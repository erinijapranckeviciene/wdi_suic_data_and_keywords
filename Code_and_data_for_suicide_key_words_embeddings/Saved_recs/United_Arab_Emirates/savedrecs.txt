AB Background: Few studies have investigated suicidal behavior and attitudes of medical students. We are not aware of any previous reports emerging from the Arab world. Aims: To investigate suicidal behavior and attitudes among medical students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Method: The prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts as well as attitudes toward suicide and reactions to a hypothetical suicidal friend were assessed using a self-report survey. Furthermore, the survey included the self-assessment of the current mood and religiosity, and socio-demographic information. Results: A group of 115 medical students (mean age 20.7 years, 59.1% female) participated in the survey. The prevalence of lifetime suicidal ideation was 17.5% and of suicide attempts 1.8%. In general, students showed very low acceptability of suicide, strong beliefs in the punishment after death, and highly endorsed communicating problems with parents. Moreover, high acceptance of and support for a suicidal friend were found. Sadness was associated with higher acceptability of suicide and fewer beliefs in punishment after death. Religiosity was associated with less acceptability of suicide, seeing suicide in context of mental illness, communicating problems with parents, and greater support for a suicidal friend. Conclusions: The prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts among medical students in the UAE was in the lower range in international comparison. Negative attitudes toward suicide were accompanied by a strong support for a suicidal friend, and both were related to religiosity.

AB The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between legal status and guardedness in patients who attempted suicide in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The consultation-liaison team assessed 355 patients admitted for suicidal/self-injurious behavior, recording their guardedness before knowing whether they were legally charged. Patients who were legally charged for the suicidal act (n=139) were 1.6 times (p=.03) more guarded in volunteering information than patients who were not legally charged. Legally charging suicide attempters might have a negative impact on risk assessment and psychiatric care.

AB Migrant workers comprise 80% of the population of the United Arab Emirates, but there is little research on their mental health. To determine the prevalence and correlates of depression among workers living in labor camps, we conducted a cross-sectional survey in labor camps in Al Ain city. The Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-42) was used to assess depression and suicidal ideation among the study participants. Off the 319 contacted workers agreed to participate, however 239 fully completed the DASS-42. The prevalence of a score >=10 ("depression") was 25.1% (60/239). Depression was correlated with physical illness (97/301), (adjusted odds ratio-AOR = 2.9; 95% CI 2.26-5.18), working in construction industry (prevalence 124/304), AOR = 2.2; 95%CI 1.56-3.83), earning less than 1,000 UAE Dirham per month (prevalence 203/314), (AOR = 1.8; 95%CI 1.33-3.16), and working more than 8 h a day (prevalence 213/315), (AOR = 2.7; 95%CI 1.19-6.27). 20/261 (6.3%) of the study participants reported thoughts of suicide and 8/265 (2.5%) had attempted suicide. People with suicidal ideation were more likely to have a physical illness (AOR = 8.1, 95%CI 2.49-26.67), earn less than 1,000 UAE Dirham per month (AOR = 5.98, 95%CI 1.26-28.45), and work for more than 8 h a day (AOR = 8.35, 95%CI 1.03-67.23). The study identified self reported indicators of a substantial burden of depression, and thoughts of self-harm among laborers surveyed. Policy level intervention and implementation, is needed to improve working conditions, including minimum wages and regulation of working hours is recommended.

DE suicide; nationals; expatriates; Dubai; UAE
AB Background: Reports on suicide from the Gulf region are scarce. Dubai is a city with a large expatriate population. However, total and gender-specific suicide rates for the national and expatriate populations are not known.
   Aims: To investigate total and gender-specific suicide rates in the national and expatriate population in Dubai and to elicit socio-demographic characteristics of suicide victims.
   Methods: Registered suicides in Dubai from 2003 to 2009, and aggregated socio-demographic data of suicide victims were analysed. Suicide rates per 100,000 population were calculated.
   Results: Suicide rate among expatriates (6.3/100,000) was seven times higher than the rate among the nationals (0.9/100,000). In both groups, male suicide rate was more than three times higher than the female rate. Approximately three out of four expatriate suicides were committed by Indians. The majority of suicide victims were male, older than 30 years, expatriate, single and employed, with an education of secondary school level and below.
   Conclusion: Further research on risk factors for and protective factors against suicide, particularly among the expatriate population, is needed. Epidemiological monitoring of suicide trends at the national level and improvement of UAE suicide statistics would provide useful information for developing suicide prevention strategies.

AB Bullying and stalking through cyberspace have become serious phenomena in the Internet era, impacting mainly young users and teenagers. Many tragic incidents have occurred, especially in the West, including self-harm and suicide due to these problems. To protect the victims many countries such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK) and Canada have codified laws dealing with cyber-crimes, including cyber-harassment. To determine the adequacy of such laws in addressing these issues, we present in this paper a legal analysis of the existing anti-bullying and stalking laws in the UAE, US, UK, and Canada. The purpose is to gain perspective on the characteristics of the laws and their ability to protect society from various forms of crimes associated with cyberbullying and cyberstalking. The paper also presents recommendations to help combat cyberbullying and cyberstalking and protect our youth from these issues.

AB BACKGROUND
   We aimed to study the distribution and causes of trauma in women of child-bearing age.
   METHODS
   Data were collected from Al-Ain Hospital (United Arab Emirates-UAE) Trauma Registry. Females aged 16 to 45 years (child-bearing age) who were admitted with trauma between March 2003 and March 2006 were included in the study.
   RESULTS
   Females represented 9% (n=171) of all trauma patients (n=1809) of the same age group, of which 29% were UAE nationals. The mean age for females was 30.5 years. Road traffic collision (RTC) was the main mechanism of injury (n=78, 46%). Burns were significantly higher in females than males (p=0.001). Cervical fractures were significantly higher in females (p=0.04), while lumbar fractures were significantly higher in males (p=0.03). In females, pelvic fractures were diagnosed in 6.4%, spinal fractures in 7%, and both injuries in 1.2%. Three females died (1.7%), and all were due to RTC.
   CONCLUSION
   The majority of females involved in trauma were aged 20-34 years. RTC is the main mechanism of injury and fatality. Female trauma is associated with a high incidence of pelvic fractures. A higher rate of cervical injuries was observed in females in contrast to lumbar injuries in males.
