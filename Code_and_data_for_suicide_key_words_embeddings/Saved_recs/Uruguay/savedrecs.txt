AB Suicide is a type of self-inflicted violence which causes great impact and damage in the family, the community and the society. Worldwide, about 800.000 people commit suicide each year and Uruguay is one of the countries with the highest suicide rate. The objective of this study is to determine the tendency of suicide deaths in Uruguay in the period between 1887 and 2017. It is a descriptive study of people who committed suicide in Uruguay during the period studied. A joinpoint regression model was used to analyze trends; mobile averages and polynomial tendencies were also calculated. It was observed that in these 130 years there remains a significant rate increase (p< 0.05). Males continue presenting the highest values, and keeping the significant rate increase (p<0.05) through the whole period. Uruguay still presents a standardized rate placed within the first third of countries with the highest rates in the world and America. It is advisable to analyze, intensify and do an ongoing follow up of the National Suicide Prevention Plan approved by the Health Authority.

AB An investigation is presented into Suicide Attempts (SA) among the Elderly in Uruguay conducted in 2014 in a Public Health institution in Montevideo linked to a Claves/Fiocruz project. Starting with an initial project, semi-structured interviews were conducted with institutionalized individuals with a history of suicide attempts, as well as a review of the literature and research into preventive norms and actions by public health authorities in the country. The results reveal difficulties of individuals in talking about SA as well as shame associated with aging. There was also a major difficulty talking about family ties, confirming gender differences in the method of SA and greater suicide ideation among women, although the possibility of SA repetition does not appear to be a concern. The study elicits reflection on the importance of attention, care, quality of life and the effects of institutionalized life upon the elderly.

DT Article
DE euthanasia; assisted suicide; criminal law; euthanasia in Europe;
   euthanasia outside Europe; rule of law
AB The passive form of euthanasia is legalized almost in every civilized country. Its active form is not a generally accepted legal institution. In Europe, active euthanasia is legalized only in The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland. In Australia, the Act on the Rights of the Terminally Ill of 1995 legalized the institution of assisted suicide, which is not identical to active euthanasia. The difference lies in the fact that legalized active euthanasia means that the author of a murder is not punishable (under certain circumstances), whilst assisted suicide is not about murder, rather about suicide. In the first case, the patient is killed on his or her request by someone else. In the second case, the patient himself or herself executes the act of self-killing (by the assistance of a healthcare worker). In Australia, the institution of assisted suicide was repealed in 1997. Assisted suicide is legal in four USA member states: in Vermont, Washington, Montana and Oregon. In Uruguay, the active form of euthanasia has been legal since 1932.

DE active euthanasia in Colombia; assisted suicide in California; passive
   euthanasia in Hungary; human rights; right to die
AB The institution of active euthanasia has been legal in Colombia since 2015. In California, the regulation on physician-assisted suicide will come into effect on January 1, 2016. The legal institution of active euthanasia is not accepted under the law of the United States of America, however, physician-assisted suicide is accepted in an increasing number of member states. The related regulation in Oregon is imitated in other member states. In South America, -Colombia is not the first country to legalize active euthanasia: active euthanasia has been legal in Uruguay since 1932. The North American legal tradition markedly differs from the South American one and both are incompatible with the Central European rule of law. In Hungary and in most European Union countries, solely the passive form of euthanasia is legal. In the Benelux countries, the active form of euthanasia is legal because the supranational law of the European Union does not prohibit it. Notwithstanding, European Union law does not prescribe legalization of either the active form of euthanasia, or the physician-assisted suicide.

DE cocaine base poste; clinical features; suicide attempts
AB Background: In Uruguay, cocaine base paste (CBP, pasta base) is a widely used form of cocaine The aim of our study is to determine the main clinical characteristics of CBP abusers
   Methods: Retrospective, single-center study of consultations at the Montevideo Poison Control Center between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005
   Results: One hundred and thirteen consultations were included, with an average age of 22 years (+ - 05 years) and a female-male sex ratio of 1 4 3 The consultations were related to drug overdose (77%), suicide attempt (168%), and wanting to give up CBP use (6 2%) In 48 1% the time elapsed since inhalation of CBP was less than 6 hours Doses varied between 05 gr and 25 gr Use of other drugs at the same time, such as alcohol, marijuana or benzodiazepines, was common (51 cases) The symptoms most frequently observed were neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular, followed by respiratory symptoms In 16 8% of patients, reason for the consultation was intentional acute ingestion of drugs, considered as a suicide attempt, occurring within a few hours of drug consumption
   Discussion: CBP users are mostly young males Although clinical findings are compatible with those for cocaine abuse, euphoria is a major clinical feature in CBP abusers The presence of respiratory symptoms reflects the complications associated with the ingestion route Suicide attempts occurring within a few hours of CBP confirm the high prevalence of suicidal ideation reported by other authors

DE suicide; children; adolescents; emergencies; hospital
AB Introduction. Suicide attempt (SA) in under 15's is one of the most frequent reasons for psychiatric consultation faced by paediatricians working in urgency services. Uruguay is the country with the highest suicide rate in South America. Suicide is currently the fifth cause of death in 10 to 14 year olds (1.8/100,000) and ninth in the 5 to 9 age group (0.4/100,000).
   Objectives. To know the incidence of SA consultations in under 15's, the characteristics of their environment and methods used.
   Material and methods. Descriptive and prospective epidemiological study in a paediatric urgency service between 01/07/08 and 30/06/09.
   Results. A total of 145 patients were included. Mean age was 12 yrs. 7 m. A 77% were female. The triggering factors were: interpersonal conflicts (57%), affective losses (17%) and battering or sexual-abuse (11%). A 78% took medication. An 18% planned the SA. A 77% occurred at home. The life of 10% was at risk. One third had at least one previous SA. A 49% had a family history of psychiatric disorders, 28% of SA and 7% of suicide. Of the total 123 SA with pills, 101 were women (n 112) and 22 males (n 33) (p < 0.05). Eight out of 15 under 10 year olds were male, and 25 out of 130 had more than 10 years of age (p < 0.05). Among under 10's, 50% used a non-pharmacological method and this figure rose to 19% (p < 0.05) in those with more than 10 years. An 88% rectified or regretted their action. Median length of hospital stay was 6 days. At the time of discharge, 99.5% did not present sequelae.
   Conclusions. SA incidence in under 15's is 2/1,000 consultations per year. The main profile is a female between 12 and 14 years of age that attempts suicide at home using medication, preferably benzodiacepines, following a discussion or affective loss, without life risk. Among those under 10 years, there is a significant predominance of males using non pharmacological methods. Verification of these behavioural patterns will enable the design of prevention strategies in the age group studied.

AB The article analyses the quality and consistency of a comprehensive interview guide, adapted to study attempted suicide and its ideation among the elderly, and imparts the method followed in applying this tool. The objective is to show how the use of a semi-structured interview and the organization and data analysis set-up were tested and perfected by a network of researchers from twelve universities or research centers in Brazil, Uruguay and Colombia. The method involved application and evaluation of the tool and joint production of an instruction manual on data collection, systematization and analysis. The methodology was followed in 67 interviews with elderly people of 60 or older and in 34 interviews with health professionals in thirteen Brazilian municipalities and in Montevideo and Bogota, allowing the consistency of the tool and the applicability of the method to be checked, during the process and at the end. The enhanced guide and the instructions for reproducing it are presented herein. The results indicate the suitability and credibility of this methodological approach, tested and certified in interdisciplinary and interinstitutional terms.

AB Objective. To compare the prevalence of bullying victimization, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts, and negative health behaviors (current tobacco use, recent heavy alcohol use, truancy, involvement in physical fighting, and unprotected sexual intercourse) in five different Latin American countries and determine the association of bullying victimization with these outcomes, exploring both bullying type and frequency.
   Methods. Study data were from Global School-based Student Health Surveys from Bolivia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Peru, and Uruguay, which covered nationally representative samples of school-going adolescents. The surveys used a two-stage clustered sample design, sampling schools and then classrooms. Logistic regression models were run to determine the statistical significance of associations with bullying.
   Results. Among the 14 560 school-going adolescents included in this study, the prevalence of any bullying victimization in the past 30 days was 37.8%. Bullying victimization was associated with greater odds of suicidal ideation with planning (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 3.12; P < 0.0001) and at least one suicide attempt (AOR: 3.07; P < 0.0001). An increasing exposure-response effect of increasing days of bullying victimization on suicide outcomes was also observed. Bullying victimization was associated with higher odds of current tobacco use (AOR: 2.14; P < 0.0001); truancy (AOR: 1.76; P < 0.0001); physical fighting (AOR: 2.40; P < 0.0001); and unprotected sexual intercourse (AOR: 1.77; P < 0.0001).
   Conclusions. Although the prevalence of bullying victimization varied by country, its association with suicidal ideation and behavior and negative health behaviors remained relatively consistent. Addressing bullying needs to be made a priority in Latin America, and an integrated approach that also includes mental and physical health promotion is needed.

DE Depression; suicidal ideation; suicide; intimate partner violence
AB Domestic violence against women is a human rights and public health problem that affects between 15 and 71% of women in the world (World Health Organization, 2005). Uruguay has a prevalence of 27.7% of domestic violence against women, predominantly intimate partner violence, but its effects on mental health have not been studied with a clinical method. Objective: to quantify the frequency of depression and suicidal ideation (SI) in women victims of intimate partner violence and to estimate the association with sociodemographic variables, moment of violence and pregnancy, excluding other causes of depressive symptoms. Method: case-control study with users from the Centro de Salud Jardines del Hipodromo in Montevideo, 30 cases and 28 controls. We applied short WAST, clinical interview, Depression Inventory and Beck Suicidal Ideation Scale. Results: 56.7% of cases present depression vs 14.3% of controls. The Odds ratio for depression in cases vs controls is 7,846. The frequency of IS is 20% of the cases and 3.6% in the controls and that of depression + suicidal ideation is 17% of the cases. The presence of depression and IS is independent of the rest of the variables except marital status (x2 = 19,408a, p < 0,001). Single, separated and / or divorced women have more cases of depression compared to married or in free union: 81% vs 19%. Conclusions: intimate partner violence is a high risk factor for depression and suicidal behaviors.

AB There is a widespread belief that India is currently in an agrarian crisis, with the spate of Suicides by farmers several states since the 1990s seen as a tragic symptom of the crisis. In the large and growing literature on the crisis some common themes emerge: the role of systemic economic reforms since 1991, the opening of the Indian economy to external competition and investment after decades of insulation; the impact on India of implementing the Agreement on Agriculture of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations; the alleged neglect of agriculture in the planning process since the mid-eighties; the decline of public investment in agriculture in response to rising fiscal deficits at the Centre and the States and above all, the slowing of the growth of agricultural output (particularly food grains) as well as a stagnation in yields per hectare of land since the nineties.
   This paper argues that the fundamental factor that is at the root Of file Current state of agriculture is India's pursuit, until the 1991 reforms, of a state-directed, state-controlled and state-dominated development strategy of import substituting industrialization with emphasis on heavy industry and insulation from the world economy. This strategy completely ignored the lessons of economic history: successful development lies in the transformation of economic structure by shifting a substantial part of the large initial share of labour force in agriculture and other low productivity activities in the informal sector to more productive off-farm activities through rural and urban industrialization with emphasis on labour-intensive manufactures to supply growing domestic and world markets and raising agricultural productivity. Leap-frogging the labour-intensive manufacturing stage of development altogether and focusing on information technology intensive services sector to bring about the transformation is not simply not feasible. This paper elaborates this main point by looking at major policy interventions in agriculture since independence It argues that there was no coherence, and little coordination among the centre, states and other policy making institutions in the decisions on the myriad interventions and their effectiveness in achieving their intended objectives was limited.
