AB Background: Phillips and Feldman reported a decline in suicides leading up to the American presidential elections, but Wasserman argued that elections had no impact on suicide. Aims: The present study explored the impact of elections on suicides in Hungary. Method: The study examined changes in the number of suicides in Hungary during the period 1990-2010 on the days of parliamentary elections, and in the weeks and months surrounding the elections. Results: There was no significant impact from the elections on the number of suicides. Conclusion: The data from Hungary replicated the results of Wasserman rather than those of Phillips and Feldman.

AB Suicide rates in Hungary have been analyzed from different aspects in recent decades. However, only descriptive rates have been reported. The aim of our epidemiological study was to characterize the pattern of annual rates of suicide in Hungary during the period 1963-2011 by applying advanced statistical methods.
   Annual suicide rates per 100,000 population (> 6 years) for gender, age group and suicide method were determined from published frequency tables and reference population data obtained from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office. Trends and relative risks of suicide were investigated using negative binomial regression models overall and in stratified analyses (by gender, age group and suicide method). Joinpoint regression analyses were additionally applied to characterize trends and to find turning points during the period 1963-2011.
   Overall, 178,323 suicides (50,265 females and 128,058 males) were committed in Hungary during the investigated period. The risk of suicide was higher among males than females overall, in all age groups and for most suicide methods. The annual suicide rate exhibited a significant peak in 1982 and remained basically constant after 2006. Different segmented patterns were observed for the suicide rates in the various age groups.
   Suicide rates revealed segmented linear pattern. This is the first detailed trend analysis with risk estimates obtained via joinpoint and negative binomial regression methods simultaneously for age-specific suicide frequencies in Hungary.

AB Annual suicide rates of Hungary were unexpectedly high in the previous century. In our narrative review, we try to depict, with presentation of the raw data, the main descriptive epidemiological features of the Hungarian suicide scene of the past decades. Accordingly, we present the annual suicide rates of the period mentioned and also data on how they varied by gender, age, urban vs. rural living, seasons, marital status, etc. Furthermore, the overview of trends of other factors that may have influenced suicidal behavior (e. g., alcohol and tobacco consumption, antidepressant prescription, unemployment rate) in the past decades is appended as well. Based on raw data and also on results of the relevant papers of Hungarian suicidology we tried to explain the observable trends of the Hungarian suicide rate. Eventually, we discuss the results, the possibilities, and the future tasks of suicide prevention in Hungary.

   POPULATION; PREVALENCE
AB Background: Hungary previously had one of the highest suicide rates in the world, but experienced major social and economic changes from 1990 onwards. We aimed to investigate the antecedents of suicide in Hungary. We hypothesised that suicide in Hungary would be associated with both risk factors for suicide as identified in Western studies, and experiences related to social and economic restructuring.
   Methods: We carried out a controlled psychological autopsy study. Informants for 194 cases (suicide deaths in Budapest and Pest County 2002-2004) and 194 controls were interviewed by clinicians using a detailed schedule.
   Results: Many of the demographic and clinical risk factors associated with suicide in other settings were also associated with suicide in Hungary; for example, being unmarried or having no current relationship, lack of other social contacts, low educational attainment, history of self-harm, current diagnosis of affective disorder (including bipolar disorder) or personality disorder, and experiencing a recent major adverse life event. A number of variables reflecting experiences since economic restructuring were also associated with suicide; for example, unemployment, concern over work propects, changes in living standards, practising religion. Just 20% of cases with evidence of depression at the time of death had received antidepressants.
   Conclusion: Suicide rates in Hungary are falling. Our study identified a number of risk factors related to individual-level demographic and clinical characteristics, and possibly recent societal change. Improved management of psychiatric disorder and self-harm may result in further reductions in suicide rates.

AB The suicide rate on religious and public holidays was examined for 133,699 suicides for Hungary for the period 1970-2002. For both men and women, more suicides were committed on Monday, while fewer were committed on the weekends. More suicides occurred on New Year's Day than expected. On Christmas Day and on Easter Sunday and Monday, suicides were less frequent only for men, a result consistent with Durkheim's theory. There was less evidence for Gabennesch's broken promise effect on the days after the holidays. National holidays had no impact on the frequency of suicide.

DT Article
AB In Hungary, which has one of the highest rates of suicide in the world, physician assisted suicide (PAS) and euthanasic are punishable criminal acts. Attitudes towards self destruction and assisted suicide are, however, very controversial, We investigated the attitudes of medical students, nurses and social science students in Hungary towards PAS, using a twelve item scale: the total number of participants was 242. Our results indicate a particular and controversial relationship between attitudes towards assisted suicide in Hungary and experience with terminally ill people. The social science students, who had the fewest personal experiences with terminally ill patients, are characterised by the most permissive attitudes towards assisted suicide. Nurses, who had everyday contact and experience with these patients, were the most conservative, being least supportive of assisted suicide. The attitudes of medical students, the would be physicians, are somewhere between those of nurses and social science students.

AB Background and method: Changes in the rate of completed suicides and in the suicide methods used in Hungary between 1990 and 2001 were evaluated using the database of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office. Results: During this period of time, the suicidal mortality rate decreased by 27.9%. A major part (62%) of this decrease was due to the less frequent use of poisonous substances and drug overdose, particularly of psychotropics. Conclusion: Beside the more widespread treatment of depression and other mental disorders, the improved safety of pharmacotherapy and the removal of the most toxic pesticides and chemicals from everyday use might have contributed to the reduction of the suicide rate in Hungary.

AB Context: Suicide is a major cause of mortality worldwide. Rates vary widely within and between countries. A suicide prevention program has never been tested in a region with a very high suicide rate in comparison with control regions without such intervention over the same period.
   Objective: To determine the effectiveness of a depression-management educational program for general practitioners (GPs) on the suicide rate in a region with a high suicide rate in Hungary.
   Design: Effects were compared with a control region, the larger surrounding county, and Hungary.
   Setting: Southwest Hungary.
   Participants: Twenty-eight GPs servicing 73 000 inhabitants participated in the educational program.
   Intervention: A 5-year depression-management educational program for GPs and their nurses was implemented together with establishment of a Depression Treatment Clinic and psychiatrist telephone consultation service in the intervention region.
   Main outcome Measures: The primary study outcome measure was annual suicide rate. The secondary outcome measure was antidepressant prescription use.
   Results: The annual suicide rate in the intervention region decreased from the 5-year preintervention average of 59.7 in 100 000 to 49.9 in 100 000. The decrease was comparable with the control region but greater than both the county and Hungary (P<.001 and P<.001, respectively). In rural areas, the female suicide rate in the intervention region decreased by 34% and increased by 90% in the control region (P<.07). The increase in antidepressant treatment was greater in the intervention region compared with the control region, the county, and Hungary and in women compared with men (P<.002).
   Conclusions: A GP-based intervention produced a greater decline in suicide rates compared with the surrounding county and national rates. Increases in patients with depression treated and of dosing were modest and may require additional measures such as depression-care managers. The importance of alcoholism in local suicides was unanticipated and not addressed. Optimal suicide prevention plans must consider major local risk factors.

   LINKAGE
AB Background: Suicide rates in Hungary are notoriously high. According to the literature, marital and educational status are associated with suicidal behaviour and these associations are somewhat influenced by gender. Since in Hungary these associations have not yet been investigated by means of large-scale multivariate epidemiological studies we aimed to investigate these in the current paper.
   Method: Census data on marital and educational status, age and gender from 1980, 1990, 2001 and 2011 were used for the general population. Corresponding data from the same years for suicide victims derived from the Hungarian Demographic Register. Suicide victims younger than 20 years were excluded. Negative binomial regression analyses were used to reveal the effects of the above variables on suicide. All statistical procedures were conducted using Stata 12 software (StataCorp. 2011).
   Results: Female gender, young age, higher educational attainment and marriage were significantly associated with decreased risks of suicide. Intriguingly, effects of educational and marital status on suicide were stronger in males.
   Limitations: Data on the length of the periods between changes in marital status and suicides were unavailable. Our four categories are not suitable to cover the whole gamut of marital statuses in a modern society (e.g. we did not have a specific category for people living in cohabitation). Ecological study design.
   Conclusion: We found that in Hungary between 1980 and 2011 the effects of some frequently investigated societal factors (e.g. educational and marital status) on suicide risk were very similar to those found in the majority of other countries. The effects of studied determinants of suicide have not changed dramatically over the past three decades in Hungary. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Seasonality of suicide in Hungary decreased from the 1980s to the 1990s, supporting the 2003 conclusion of Lester and Moksony. However, it was the strongest ever to be documented with contemporary suicide data, supporting the conjecture of Voracek, et al. (2002) that seasonality of suicide remains high in Eastern Europe. A new hypothesis regarding the co-occurrence of high incidence and strong seasonality of suicide is presented.

AB Objectives. Studies show that the seasonality of suicide (spring/early summer peak, winter low) is mainly the consequence of the seasonal incidence of depression-related suicides. The aim of the present study was to analyse the relationship between increasing antidepressant utilization and national suicide rate of Hungary between 1998 and 2006, with particular regard to seasonal patterns and gender differences. Methods. Time trend analysis (ARIMA) had been applied to investigate the correlation between the trend of antidepressant prescription and both of suicide rates and seasonality index. Results. During the 9 years of the study period there was a significant (P < 0.001) correlation between the steadily increasing antidepressant prescription (113%) and continuous decline in total national suicide rate (23%) as well as both in females and males (21 and 23%, respectively), but this relationship was 8-fold stronger in males. Increasing antidepressant utilization was associated with significantly decreased seasonality of suicides only among males. Conclusions. The results suggest that decreasing seasonality of suicides could be a good marker of lowering rate of depression-related suicides in the population particularly among males.

ID SUICIDE; RATES
AB Background Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was rarely used in Hungary in 2002, and the majority of patients receiving ECT were diagnosed with schizophrenia. This study aimed to explore the use of ECT in Hungary in 2014.
   Methods Two semi-structured questionnaires were sent to all acute adult psychiatric units in Hungary. The first questionnaire contained items concerning ECT use, and the second explored the reasons for not using ECT.
   Results Fifty-eight acute psychiatric inpatient units were identified, and 54 replied. Although 27 indicated that they used ECT, only 22 actually performed ECT in 2014. Thirty-one units did not offer ECT at all. In 2014, 174 patients received ECT in Hungary, constituting 0.59% of all inpatients treated in the departments where it was offered, equating to 0.176 patients/10,000 population. The indication for ECT shifted from schizophrenia in 2002 (55.6%) to mood disorders in 2014 (58.5%), but the absolute number of ECT-treated patients with mood disorders (110 vs 102) did not change. Reasons for not using ECT included the lack of an ECT machine, unavailability of an anesthesiologist, lack of finances, and lack of experienced staff.
   Conclusions In view of the high frequency of depression and suicide in Hungary, it is very likely that a significant minority of patients who would benefit from ECT cannot access it, which constitutes a violation of their right to the best possible treatment. The main reasons for the inadequate ECT service are the underfinanced hospital system and a lack of necessary knowledge.

ID WHO/EURO MULTICENTER; RISK-FACTORS; DENMARK; PARASUICIDE; BEHAVIOR
AB Aim To determine gender differences in suicidal behavior and investigate the factors associated with suicide attempts.
   Methods In the framework of the WHO/Euro Multicenter Study on Suicidal Behavior, 1,158 suicide attempts have been registered and analyzed retrospectively in Pecs center, Hungary. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were performed to compare the characteristics of male and female suicide attempters.
   Results A "typical" female suicide attempter could becharacterized as follows: retired or economically inactive (OR=2.38), widowed (OR= 6.55), divorced (OR= 1.64), or with depression in her personal history (OR= 1.27). Female attempters were mainly repeaters, using the method of self-poisoning, mostly with benzodiazepines. Among men, unemployment, living alone, never having been married, and problems with addiction were the main risk factors, while violent methods characterized the typical attempt In the cases of self-poisoning, men were more likely to take meprobamate or carbamazepine.
   Conclusion Significant differences were found in the risk factors for suicide attempts between men and women. Since suicide is a multi-causal phenomenon, its therapy and prevention should be complex and gender differences should be taken into consideration while building up our helping strategies.

AB Background: Previous studies have provided somewhat inconsistent results about the effects of season of birth on the risk of suicidal behavior. Therefore, we decided to investigate this question in a large sample of suicide completers.
   Methods: We determined the season of birth-associated risk of completed suicide between the years 1970 and 2008 among all individuals who were born in the area of today's Hungary between 1930 and 1939, 1941 and 1942, and 1944 and 1969.
   Results: The final sample of participants included around six and a half million people. About 80,000 completed suicides occurred among participants during the period investigated (the number of suicide completers in our study greatly exceeds the number of suicide completers in any previous studies). A significantly (p < .05) elevated risk of completed suicide was found among those individuals who were born in the high-risk period (spring and summer). Quantitatively, the biggest increase (7.6% [95% confidence interval: 5.4-9.9]) in suicide risk was detected among those who were born in July compared with the average risk of suicide in the population investigated. The associations between season of birth and the risk of completed suicide were stronger among male subjects than among female subjects and among those who committed suicide using violent methods than among those who chose nonviolent methods.
   Conclusions: Our results from a large sample of suicide completers from Hungary-a country with one of the highest suicide rates in the world over the last century-strongly support the concept that the season of birth is significantly associated with the risk of completed suicide.

The number of suicides taking place on the individuals' birthdays was compared with the number expected using chi-square tests. More suicides occurred on birthdays for men of all ages and for women over the age of 60. The birthday blues phenomenon was found for urban and rural suicides, for all marital statuses and for both violent and nonviolent methods for suicide. Possible explanations for these results were discussed.

ID SEASONALITY
AB Aim - Studying the impact of the sunshine on the numbers of suicides. The number of suicides is highest in the late spring and early summer months, while it is lowest in the cold, gloomy winter. Although the exact causes are still unknown, there are some theories about this phenomenon. A number of studies conducted in recent years have concluded that the rise in suicide rate during the warm months might be due to an increased exposure to sunlight, especially in the cases of the violent method. We studied the validity of this hypothesis on a large Hungarian database.
   Methods and subjects - We analyzed the number of monthly hours of sunshine and the number of suicides by sex and by violent vs. non-violent method over a 360 month period. Our sample consisted of 127 877 committed suicides between 1971 and 2000. The parabolic trend of seasonality had to be removed from the suicide time series, then regression analysis was conducted on the seasonally adjusted data.
   Results - Our analysis revealed that in Hungary there was no statistically significant direct relationship between the number of hours of sunshine and the number of suicides. Moreover, there was no correlation between the hours of sunshine and the number of violent suicides either.
   Conclusion - If the above claim were confirmed in subsequent research, it would mean that our current therapeutic regime should be reconsidered during the spring-summer seasons.

AB Objectives: Suicide and alcohol-related mortality are often linked to each other in recent times, especially in the unfavourable mortality trends detected in Russia. Recent study has aimed to investigate suicide and alcohol-related mortality in Hungary between 1986 and 2005. This paper is based on the concept of social anomie and expects to find more favourable trends for both causes of death among those who were less exposed to unfavourable economic and social trends in the last two decades.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional design sex, age- and education-specific mortality rates were calculated.
   Results: We found falling suicide rates in all socio-demographic groups, except well-educated middle aged men. Suicide has fallen more among women than men, more among the elderly than the young and more among the more educated than the less educated. Alcohol-related mortality has risen by 5-10%, and its occurrence in different socio-demographic groups was found to be changing entirely proportionally.
   Conclusions: Developments in suicide mortality are generally in accordance with the hypothesis based on the concept of social anomie while those of alcohol-related mortality showed no relation with this concept.

AB Hungary has a tradition both in biological psychiatry and psychotherapy, and for decades developed together with neurology. From the mid 1980s the speed of development of psychiatry started lagging behind expected standards. Psychiatric care, research and teaching were hit hard in 2007 by unprecedented closures of facilities and budget reductions. Although suicide rates have decreased since the mid 1980s, the country has still the second highest rate in the European Union. The high prevalence of alcohol use and the rapidly increasing prevalence of illicit drug use contribute to comorbidity and related behavioural issues, including the increased frequency of severe violent events committed by people with psychiatric disorders, which have not been properly addressed. The country expects the first major restructuring of its healthcare starting in 2012 since the major political changes of 1989/1990. The profession, patients and their caregivers should use this opportunity to modernize psychiatry in Hungary.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB The author studies all available data of military suicide cases in Hungary. After a short historical overview, he presents the suicide situation of Hungary, the changes in the problem of suicide within the Hungarian Defense Force in the past decades with special regard to the period after the abolition of obligatory regular army. The data examined shows, that the average suicide rate was decreased between 2005 and 2007 by 31.52% within the Hungarian Defense Forces, while the decrease was less among civilians: 9.67%. After such a great improvement, suicide rate of the military forces became lower than that of civilians. The average suicide rate between 2002 and 2004 within the Hungarian Defense Force was 21.05% higher than the rate of civilians, while it became 8.22% lower between 2004 and 2007. The decrease in the number of suicide cases can be explained by the abolition of obligatory regular army, but the Mentalhygienic Service developed at the Hungarian Defense Force also had a great influence too. This effect is proved by the fact, that suicide rate among non employed military pensioners is still high. These people are not treated by the Mentalhygienic Service of the Hungarian Defense Force. It would be worth utilizing the experiences of the Mentalhygienic Service of the Hungarian Defense Force in the preventing program of the civil population as well. Unfortunatelly today several facts obstruct this, though there are not any conceptual, ideological, political obstruction of it.

AB Purpose The aim of this study was to analyse the changes in the amount and structure of Hungarian antidepressant consumption at national and regional level, furthermore to investigate the possible relationship between antidepressant sales and trends in suicide rates using regional data.
   Method Retrospective analysis of antidepressant sales data was performed on a 12 years period (1993-2004), applying the ATC/DDD methodology developed by WHO. Linear regression model was set up to investigate the trends in antidepressant utilisation. The association between antidepressant consumption and suicide rates was measured by Pearson correlation.
   Results The nationwide utilisation of antidepressants revealed more than five-fold increase in the studied 12 year period. The usage of tricyclic antidepressants (N06AA) decreased to one third of the previous value, while the usage of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (N06AB) multiplied by 21. The consumption of 'other antidepressants' (N06AX) was found very low (3.66 DDD/1000inhabitants/day in 2004). There was not found any significant correlation between increased antidepressant consumption and decreased suicide rates at regional level by our statistical analysis (r(min) = -0.160; r(max) = -0.314).
   Conclusion Further investigation is required to identify determinants that have contributed to recent decline in suicide rate in Hungary. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In recent years, suicide rates in Hungary have been among the highest in the European Union. Attempted suicide rates in the Roma population are 2-3 times higher than in the non-Roma population. Since individuals making multiple attempts have a higher pro-bability of eventual death by suicide, and there are limited data on suicidal behaviour of the Roma population, the aim of this study was to explore the sociodemographic and psychological background factors of multiple suicide attempts in the Hungarian Roma population. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 150 individuals admitted to hospital toxicology departments, who made suicide attempts by deliberate self-poisoning, 65 of whom were multiple attempters. Detailed information regarding the current attempt and previous suicidal acts was recorded. Patients also completed the Shortened Beck Depression, the Beck Hopelessness Questionnaire, and the Social Support Questionnaire. Independent samples t-tests were used to evaluate differences in psychological variables between the Roma (N=90) and non-Roma (N=60) groups. Stepwise linear regression and odds ratios analyses were performed to identify potential background factors of multiple suicide attempts. There was a significantly higher level of previous suicidal events among the Roma in the sample population (3.53 vs. 0.84, p<.001). Roma ethnicity was found to be a strong predictor of multiple suicide attempts. Current major depression, hopelessness, and diagnosed mood disorder were identified as significant risk factors of repeated attempts. Smoking (OR=5.4), family history of suicide (OR=4.9), and long-term unemployment (OR=4.6) were additional risk factors among Roma patients. A thorough understanding of the ethnicity-specific risk factors for multiple suicide attempts could facilitate the development of effective intervention and postvention programmes.

DE active euthanasia in Colombia; assisted suicide in California; passive
   euthanasia in Hungary; human rights; right to die
AB The institution of active euthanasia has been legal in Colombia since 2015. In California, the regulation on physician-assisted suicide will come into effect on January 1, 2016. The legal institution of active euthanasia is not accepted under the law of the United States of America, however, physician-assisted suicide is accepted in an increasing number of member states. The related regulation in Oregon is imitated in other member states. In South America, -Colombia is not the first country to legalize active euthanasia: active euthanasia has been legal in Uruguay since 1932. The North American legal tradition markedly differs from the South American one and both are incompatible with the Central European rule of law. In Hungary and in most European Union countries, solely the passive form of euthanasia is legal. In the Benelux countries, the active form of euthanasia is legal because the supranational law of the European Union does not prohibit it. Notwithstanding, European Union law does not prescribe legalization of either the active form of euthanasia, or the physician-assisted suicide.

AB Background: The suicide rate in Hungary is one of the highest in the European Union, with a male-female ratio of 3.55:1. Suicide rates correlate positively with suicide attempts, for which depression is the most frequent underlying disorder. Aims: The aim of this qualitative study was to examine gender differences in suicide attempts, with a focus on the effect of precipitating factors on depression. Method: Semistructured interviews were conducted among 150 suicide attempters. Data on circumstances, reason, and method of attempt were recorded. Patients completed the Shortened Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, the Sense of Coherence Scale, and the Social Support Questionnaire. Results: Interpersonal conflict was found to be the most frequent precipitating factor. There were significant gender differences in depressive symptoms among patients with interpersonal conflicts. We found differences in depressive symptoms according to presence or absence of interpersonal conflicts among men, but not among women. Male suicide attempters who indicated interpersonal conflicts had lower levels of depression. Conclusion: Depressive symptoms are frequent among suicide attempters. However, a subgroup of male attempters reporting interpersonal conflicts are characterized by a lower level of depression. This subgroup of attempters would probably not be detected with depression screening programs and may have an unmet need for other forms of screening and prevention.

TI How to Decrease Suicide Rates in Both Genders? An Effectiveness Study of
   a Community-Based Intervention (EAAD)
SO PLOS ONE

   GOTLAND; ALLIANCE
AB Background: The suicide rate in Hungary is high in international comparison. The two-year community-based four-level intervention programme of the European Alliance Against Depression (EAAD) is designed to improve the care of depression and to prevent suicidal behaviour. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of a regional community-based four-level suicide prevention programme on suicide rates.
   Method: The EAAD programme was implemented in Szolnok (population 76,311), a town in a region of Hungary with an exceptionally high suicide rate. Effectiveness was assessed by comparing changes in suicide rates in the intervention region after the intervention started with changes in national suicide rates and those in a control region (Szeged) in the corresponding period.
   Results: For the duration of the programme and the follow-up year, suicide rates in Szolnok were significantly lower than the average of the previous three years (p=.0076). The suicide rate thus went down from 30.1 per 100,000 in 2004 to 13.2 in 2005 (-56.1%), 14.6 in 2006 (-51.4 %) and 12.0 in 2007 (-60.1 %). This decrease of annual suicide rates in Szolnok after the onset of the intervention was significantly stronger than that observed in the whole country (p=.017) and in the control region (p=.0015). Men had the same decrease in suicide rates as women. As secondary outcome, an increase of emergency calls to the hotline service (200%) and outpatient visits at the local psychiatry clinic (76%) was found.
   Conclusions: These results seem to provide further support for the effectiveness of the EAAD concept. Whilst the majority of suicide prevention programs mainly affect female suicidal behaviour, this programme seems to be beneficial for both sexes. The sustainability and the role of the mediating factors (social service and health care utilization, community attitudes about suicide) should be key points in future research.

AB The suicide rate of Hungary is the highest in the world averaged over the last century but it has shown a very pronounced decrease since 1987. To explore the background of this decrease we investigated the associations between some known suicide-related factors (i.e. tobacco use, antidepressant use and alcohol consumption at the population level) and the suicide rate between 1985 and 2008. The total number of man-hours worked per year by psychiatrists in the outpatient service system and real GDP growth were also monitored in our study. A time series analysis model was constructed to investigate the associations between the above variables and the suicide rate. In the unadjusted model annual tobacco consumption was significantly associated with the suicide rate in a positive manner, while antidepressant use and man-hours were significantly associated with the suicide rate in a negative manner. After adjustment, the associations remained significant only for tobacco consumption and antidepressant use. Neither alcohol consumption nor real GDP growth was associated with the suicide rate in any models. Our results from group-level data confirmed the role of smoking in suicidal behavior previously suggested mainly by studies using individual-level data and also corroborated the results of previous ecological studies concerning the inverse association between antidepressant use and suicide rate. These findings and the results of previous studies - investigating the relationship between smoking and the risk of suicidal behavior at the individual-level - may suggest that programs to prevent tobacco use or to address the widespread recognition and treatment of depression may also prevent suicidality.

TI Seasonal variation of mortality from external causes in Hungary between

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SUICIDE MORTALITY; REGRESSION; PATTERNS; EUROPE
AB Objective
   To analyze trends in external mortality in Hungary between 1995 and 2014 by sex.
   Methods
   Data on the numbers of deaths due to external causes were obtained from the published nationwide population register. Negative binomial regression was applied to investigate the yearly trends in external-cause mortality rates. Cyclic trends were investigated using the Walter-Elwood method.
   Results
   Suicide and accidents accounted for approximately 84% of the all-external-cause of deaths in Hungary. Annual suicide, unintentional falls and traffic accidents mortality declined significantly (p-value for annual trend: p < 0.001) from 30.5 (95% CI: 29.5-31.5) to 15.8 (15.1-16.5), from 31.2 (30.2-32.2) to 12.2 (11.7-12.8) and from 17.2 (16.4-18) to 5.4 (5-5.8) per 100 000 persons per year, respectively, during the study period. A significant declining trend in annual mortality was also found for assault, cold/heating-related accidents and accidents caused by electric current. However, the declining trend for drowning-related accidents was significant only for males. Significant winter-peak seasonality was found in the mortality rates from accidental falls, cold/heat-related accidents, other accidents caused by submersion/obstruction and other causes. Seasonal trends with a peak from June to July were observed in death rates from suicide/self-harm, accidental drowning/submersion and accidents caused by electric current. A significant seasonal variation with a peak in September was revealed in the mortality due to traffic accidents.
   Conclusions
   This Hungarian study suggests that there was a significant seasonal effect on almost all kinds of deaths from external causes between 1995 and 2014. Environmental effects are involved in the aetiology of suicide and accidents.

AB Suicide rates are higher in rural than in urban areas in the United States. One explanation that is frequently offered is scarcity of health and mental health treatment providers in rural areas. The current study tested whether number of providers per capita would explain differences in urban and rural suicide rates within the counties of California, using data from 1993-2001. Results indicate suicide rates were higher in more rural counties, entirely due to higher rural rates among European Americans. Findings also confirmed that there were fewer physicians and mental health care providers per capita in rural areas. Nonetheless, number of providers per capita was not related to suicide rates and thus could not explain the rural-urban differential in suicide rates. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Background. Previous international and Hungarian studies have shown that around 90% of persons making suicide attempts had at least one current mental disorder. The aim of this study was to investigate the current prevalence of DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric diagnoses among nonviolent suicide attempters in Budapest, Hungary. Methods. Using a structured interview (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview) determining DSM-IV Axis I diagnoses, the authors examined 100 consecutively contacted nonviolent suicide attempters (68 females and 32 males), aged between 14 and 66 (mean:36.3 years). Results. A total of 64% of the subjects were repeated attempters, and the most common method was drug overdose (96%), in 21% of cases in combination with alcohol ingestion. A total of 92% of the attempters had at least one current DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric diagnosis. In 87% it was depressive disorder (59% unipolar major depression, 14% bipolar II depression and 12% bipolar I depression, 2% dysthymic disorder), in 46% anxiety disorders, in 27% substance-use disorder and in 2% psychotic disorder. Sixty percent of the attempters received two or more current Axis I diagnoses (35% depressive + anxiety disorder only, 15% depressive + substance-related disorder only, and 10% depressive + anxiety + substance-related disorder). Limitations. Nonviolent suicide attempters are not representative of all persons with attempted suicide and subthreshold Axis I diagnoses were not investigated. Conclusion. This study supports previous international and Hungarian findings on the high prevalence and comorbidity of Axis I mental disorders among persons with recent nonviolent suicide attempt.

AB Background: In Europe, the suicide rate among children and adolescents is the highest in Hungary. In the young age group ( 10-14 and 15-19 years), the suicide mortality rate had not showed a decrease.
   Methods: This study examined suicide cases committed by children and adolescents highlighted from the extraordinary death cases in Budapest between 1994 and 1998. The 72 suicide cases, which included 59 males and 13 females, were processed by sex, age, method and time of commitment, and distribution by districts.
   Results: Leaping off high places or hanging was the highest frequency among the methods of commitment. Accurate data about the frequency, type, time and location of death cases are indispensable to decrease the number of children's and adolescents' suicides.
   Conclusions: Studies of epidemiology and risk factors may provide a basis of development of a specific suicide prevention programme including educational, health and welfare elements.

AB Chocolate and Chess (Unlocking Lakatos) tells the fascinating story of Imre Lakatos' life in Hungary before his flight to England following the failed 1956 Hungarian Revolution. The book focuses on Lakatos' role as a political functionary under Hungarian Stalinism, and compiles what is known of Lakatos' role in the induced suicide of a young woman, Eva Iszak, at the end of World War II. This historical and biographical study provides essential background for appreciating Lakatos' cross-cultural role as a philosopher in England and Hungary, through the Anglo-American philosophy and the Hegelian-Marxist traditions in which he was trained and did not leave behind.

AB To determine whether the effect of antidepressant exposure on suicide rate is modified by age and gender in Hungary, annual anti depressant prescription rates and suicide rates of about 10 million inhabitants between 1999-2005 were analyzed by age and gender groups. The suicide rate was inversely related to the increased use of antidepressants in both genders. The strongest association was found in the oldest age groups, where the increase in antidepressant use was highest, while there was no association in the under 20 or 50-69 age groups in either gender. Antidepressant prescription rate was related to suicide rate after controlling for divorce rate or unemployment rate, but not after controlling for alcohol consumption rate.

AB Voracek, Vintila, Fisher, and Yip (2002) reported that 1,120 suicides by hanging in one county in Romania from 1980-1999 did not show a decrease in seasonality from the 1980s to the 1990s using a time-series harmonic analysis. They generalized from this sample to the seasonality of suicide in the transitional societies of Eastern Europe in general.
   This Comment presents data on all 83,297 suicides (by all methods) in Hungary from 1980-1999.(2) Comparing the numbers of suicides each month in the 1980s and the 1990s (correcting for the extra leap year in the 1980s) showed a significant difference (X-11(2) =64.8, p<.001). The seasonal distribution in 1980 showed peaks in August and May. The percentage of suicides in May dropped from 9.94% in the 1980s to 9.70% in the 1990s. The percentage of suicides in July dropped from 9.86% in the 1980s to 9.44% in the 1990s.

AB Objective. The aim of the present study was to analyze the relationship between increasing utilization of antidepressants and lithium, and suicide rate of persons less than 20 years of age in Hungary, with particular regard to seasonal patterns. Methods. Time trend analysis was carried out to determine the correlation between antidepressant and lithium prescription patterns in Hungarian persons under age of 20 years as well as seasonal variations within the study period from January 1998 to December 2006. Results. There was a significant correlation (P = 0.03) between the eight-fold increase in antidepressant + lithium prescriptions and decreasing suicides in young Hungarian people under 20 years of age within the study period. Lithium, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the group of "other antidepressant drugs "rather than nonselective monoamine reuptake inhibitors and monoamine oxidase-A inhibitors were responsible for this association. No significant association could be drawn from seasonal variation with boys (P = 0.964), girls (P = 0.140), or both genders (P = 0.997). Limitation. Ecological study design. Conclusion. Our findings are in good agreement with large-scale ecological studies showing that the beneficial effect of more widely used antidepressants at a given point could appear on the level of suicide rate of the general population even among patients under the age of 20 years.

AB Across the 42 counties of Romania, the total suicide rate and the population percentage of ethnic Hungarians were strongly positively interrelated (79% attributable variance). Counties with the strongest Hungarian minority had suicide rates converging to (or exceeding) the suicide rate for Hungary, which rate is high. Of a set of about 20 vital statistics and socioeconomic indicators, only life expectancy predicted a significant increment of further variance in the suicide rates. However, this effect was small, adding merely 3% further variance explained to 79% already accounted for, Overall, the findings are supportive of the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis, i.e., the notion that geographic patterns of suicide prevalence may be partially due to genetic differences between Populations. Supplemental analyses of a questionnaire item which specifically queried this study's main finding indicated widespread disbelief of this fact of suicide prevalence across a variety of samples, including two samples from Romania.

AB Background: In the last century Hungary had astonishingly high suicide rates characterized by marked regional within-country inequalities, a spatial pattern which has been quite stable over time. Aims: To explain the above phenomenon at the level of micro-regions (n=175) in the period between 2005 and 2011.
   Methods: Our dependent variable was the age and gender standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for suicide while explanatory variables were factors which are supposed to influence suicide risk, such as measures of religious and political integration, travel time accessibility of psychiatric services, alcohol consumption, unemployment and disability pensionery. When applying the ordinary least squared regression model, the residuals were found to be spatially autocorrelated, which indicates the violation of the assumption on the independence of error terms and - accordingly - the necessity of application of a spatial autoregressive (SAR) model to handle this problem. According to our calculations the SAR(Iag) model was a better way (versus the SAR(err) model) of addressing the problem of spatial autocorrelation, furthermore its substantive meaning is more convenient.
   Results: SMR was significantly associated with the "political integration" variable in a negative and with "lack of religious integration" and "disability pensionery" variables in a positive manner. Associations were not significant for the remaining explanatory variables. Limitations: Several important psychiatric variables were not available at the level of micro-regions. We conducted our analysis on aggregate data.
   Conclusion: Our results may draw attention to the relevance and abiding validity of the classic Durkheimian suicide risk factors - such as lack of social integration - apropos of the spatial pattern of Hungarian suicides. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and comorbidity of affective disorders, especially current major depressive episode and bipolar disorder among suicide attempters in Hungary. Methods: Using a structured interview (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview) determining 16 Axis I psychiatric diagnoses defined by the DSM-IV and a semistructured interview collecting background information, the authors examined 100 consecutive suicide attempters, aged 18-65. Results: Eighty-eight percent of the attempters had one or more current diagnoses on Axis I. In 69% it was major depressive episode and 60% of them were suffering their first episode. Thirty-five percent of the patients with current major depressive episode had had hypomanic (n = 19) or manic (n = 5) episodes in the past. Seventy percent of the individuals received two or more current diagnoses on Axis I. Eighty-six percent of all current Axis I disorders (except major depressive episode) were diagnosed together with a current major depressive episode. The diagnosis of current major depressive episode and the number of current psychiatric disorders was significantly and positively related to the number of suicide attempts, but the diagnosis of past major depressive episode was not. Limitations: This study included suicide attempters who had presented selfpoisoning, but not individuals with very high risk of fatality. Conclusions: In suicide attempters there is a very high prevalence of affective disorders, especially major depression, first episode of major depression and bipolar II disorder. This study underlines the importance of early detection and treatment of psychiatric disorders for the prevention of suicidal behavior. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Introduction and Aims. The aim of this paper was to estimate how suicide rates in seven eastern European countries are affected by changes in population drinking and to put the results into a comparative perspective. Design and Methods. The analysis included data on annual suicide mortality rates and per capita consumption for the post-war period from: Russia, Belarus, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, the former Czechoslovakia and the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). Overall and gender-specific models were estimated using the Box-Jenkins technique for time-series analysis. The estimates were pooled into two groups, i.e. spirits countries (Russia, Belarus and Poland) and non-spirits countries (Hungary, Bulgaria, former Czechoslovakia and former GDR). Results. All countries obtained positive alcohol effect estimates. The effects on the overall population were largest in the spirits countries, where a 1-litre increase in per capita consumption was associated with an increase in overall suicide rates of 5.7-7.5%. The effects were somewhat smaller in the non-spirits countries, 2.7-4.7%. The estimates for males were larger, but showed the same national variations as the overall population estimates. The female estimates were generally smaller than for men and did not differ between the two country groups. Discussion and Conclusions. The results suggest that per capita consumption matters for suicide mortality in these eastern European countries, but that the strength of the relationship is contingent upon the drinking culture, so that it tends to be stronger in countries with detrimental drinking patterns.

AB The aim of this study was to compare patterns of contact made by patients with GPs and other healthcare professionals in two European cities prior to attempting suicide. The objective was to determine whether differences between a public and a private healthcare system could be a possible factor influencing the help-seeking behaviour of suicide attempters. Within the frame of the WHO/EURO Multicentre Study on Parasuicide, structured interviews were conducted with suicide attempters in Pecs, Hungary (n = 101) and Bern, Switzerland (n = 66). In Bern, slightly more patients visited their GPs throughout the year. However, within the last week before the suicide attempt, twice as many Hungarian patients went to see a GP compared with the Bern sample. Almost the same proportion of the patients had suicidal ideation, but in Pecs more than a quarter of them and in Bern half of them talked about their suicidal thoughts. in the Hungarian sample, more patients were prescribed medication and almost half of them used these drugs for self-poisoning compared to over a quarter in Bern. The differences in help-seeking behaviour between the two samples may be related to the higher number of practising GPs and a more consistent patient-doctor relationship in Bern. it is likely that a consistent and personal relationship with a medical helper or system (e.g. GP as gatekeeper) facilitates the communication Of suicidal ideation.

AB Medicolegal evaluation of postmortem findings at the death scene represents an important part of forensic medicine. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence and characteristics of suicide events. Data collection was performed from the police scene investigation reports in capital Budapest between 2009 and 2011. In this study, epidemiological parameters such as age, gender, time and place of death, postmortem changes, suicidal method, seasonal and daily distribution, natural diseases, earlier psychiatric treatment, socioeconomic risks, supposed cause of death, final notes, earlier suicide attempts, and suicide ideations were analyzed. There were 892 suicide cases (619 males, 273 females) detected in the investigated period. Hanging, overdose of prescription medications, jumping, use of firearms, drowning, and electrotrauma showed statistical differences among genders (p<0.05). The most common methods of suicide among men and women were hanging (57.4%) and overdose of prescription medications (33%), respectively. Death scene characteristics represent the important factors for forensic medicine.

AB Background - Suicide and suicide attempts have been associated to psychiatric illnesses; however, little is known about the role in suicide risk of those symptoms that do not meet the full criteria for a DSM-IV disorder. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of subthreshold psychiatric disorders among suicide attempters in Hungary. Methods - Using a modified structured interview (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview) determining 16 Axis I psychiatric diagnoses and their subthreshold forms defined by the DSM-IV and a semistructured interview collecting background information, the authors examined 140 consecutive suicide attempters, aged 18-65 years. Results - Eighty-three-point-six percent of the attempters had one or more current threshold diagnoses on Axis I and in addition more than three-quarters (78.6%) of the subjects had at least one subthreshold diagnosis. Six-point-four percent of the subjects (N = 9) had neither subthreshold nor threshold diagnoses at the time of their suicide attempts. Ten percent of the subjects (N = 14), not meeting the full criteria for any DSM-IV diagnoses, had at least one subthreshold diagnosis. In 68.6% of the subjects (N = 96), both subthreshold and threshold disorders were diagnosed at the time of their suicide attempts. The number of subthreshold and threshold diagnoses were positively and significantly related (chi(2) = 5.12, df = 1, P < 0.05). Sixty-three-point-six percent of the individuals received two or more current threshold diagnoses on Axis I and 44.3% of the individuals (N = 62) had two or more subthreshold diagnoses at the time of their suicide attempts. Limitations - The subthreshold definitions in this study included only those forms of the disorders which required the same duration as the criteria DSM-IV disorder with fewer symptoms. Conclusions - Suicide attempts showed a very high prevalence of subthreshold disorders besides psychiatric disorders meeting the full criteria required according to the DSM-IV. Subthreshold forms of mental disorders need to be taken into account in suicide prevention. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

AB Background: Suicide accounts for over 58,000 deaths in Europe per annum, where suicide attempts are estimated to be 20 times higher. Males have been found to have a disproportionately lower rate of suicide attempts and an excessively higher rate of suicides compared to females. The gender difference in suicide intent is postulated to contribute towards this gender imbalance. The aim of this study is to explore gender differences in suicide intent in a cross-national study of suicide attempts. The secondary aims are to investigate the gender differences in suicide attempt across age and country.
   Methods: Data on suicide attempts (acquired from the EU-funded OSPI-Europe project) was obtained from eight regions in Germany, Hungary, Ireland and Portugal. Suicide intent data was categorized into 'Non-habitual Deliberate Self-Harm' (DSH), 'Parasuicidal Pause' (SP), 'Parasuicidal Gesture' (SG), and 'Serious Suicide Attempt' (SSA), applying the Feuerlein scale. Gender differences in intent were explored for significance by using X-2-tests, odds ratios, and regression analyses.
   Results: Suicide intent data from 5212 participants was included in the analysis. A significant association between suicide intent and gender was found, where 'Serious Suicide Attempts' (SSA) were rated significantly more frequently in males than females (p < .001). There was a statistically significant gender difference in intent and age groups (p < .001) and between countries (p < .001). Furthermore, within the most utilised method, intentional drug overdose, 'Serious Suicide Attempt' (SSA) was rated significantly more often for males than females (p < .005).
   Conclusions: Considering the differences in suicidal intent between males and females highlighted by the current study, gender targeted prevention and intervention strategies would be recommended.

AB The aim of this study is to analyze the fatalities due to suicide in the period of 1991-2000. The autopsy reports of 719 suicide cases during that period of the Department of Forensic Medicine, University of Szeged were reviewed retrospectively. The victim's age, sex, way of commitment, place of death, the presence of alcohol and drug influence and survival time were recorded.
   Five hundred and one of the (69.6%) total 719 suicide fatalities were men and 218 (30.4%) were women. The largest age groups were 41-50 in men, in women we experienced a 'double-peak' of age groups 41-50 and 71-80.
   The most frequent way of committal was hanging (46%). The results revealed that 38.8% of the 474 victims whose blood and/or urine alcohol concentration measurement were carried out consumed alcohol prior to the act.
   The presence of licit drugs in 12% of not drug-related cases were experienced. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: We have conducted an ecological study to assess the association between antidepressant prescribing and suicide rates using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) health data, making this the largest ecological study in recent times.
   Method: Data were derived for the years 19952008 from the OECD health data set. The residuals for all variables were adjusted for country and year within each country. These were then analysed to identify predictors of suicide rate. Pearson's rank correlation coefficient and linear regression model were employed to assess associations and identify significant predictors of suicide rate.
   Results: Suicide rate has significant positive correlations with antidepressant rates (p=0.031) and unemployment (p=0.028). It also has a significant negative correlation with inpatient psychiatric beds (p=0.039). The actual coefficients are less than +/-0.16, indicating weak relationships. After adjusting for other variables, the only variable that is a statistically significant predictor of suicide rate is antidepressant prescribing (p=0.005, r(2)=0.09).
   Discussion: Our analysis using this large data set suggests a statistically significant, albeit weak positive, association between antidepressant prescribing and suicide rates.

AB Background: Previous research has suggested that patients with panic disorder but no comorbid disorder are not at greater risk for suicidal behavior. Aims: The present study followed up patients with panic disorder in order to assess the frequency of their suicidal behavior. Methods: A sample of 281 outpatients with panic disorder, but without a comorbid psychiatric disorder, was followed up for an average of 5 years. The patients were given 6-8 weeks of cognitive therapy, and 65% were prescribed SSRIs. Results: At the time of first admission, 5 patients (1.7%) reported a previous (lifetime) suicide attempt, and 53 patients (18.2%) reported previous (lifetime) suicidal ideation (both thoughts and plans), not greatly different from the Hungarian population in general. During the follow-up period, no patient committed suicide, 2 patients attempted suicide (0.7%), and 4 patients (1.4%) reported suicidal ideation. Conclusions: This study indicates that people with panic disorders without comorbid disorders have no higher suicidal risk than the general population in Hungary. After treatment with cognitive therapy and SSRIs, 38.5% were symptom-free, and only 7.8% required continued close therapeutic contact after the follow-up period.

AB In our study we assessed the frequency of reported hopelessness and suicide attempts in the national representative survey Hungarostudy 2002. The randomly selected sample consisted of 14,000 individuals over the age of 18. We created a short version of the widely used Beck Hopelessness Scale for screening purposes in suicide prevention. The short version of the BHS consists of four items and has high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.85). Moreover, we conducted an investigation into psychological, somatic, sociological and socio-economic as well as cultural variables that show a positive or negative correlation with hopelessness and important predictors of suicide. The following psychological variables showing a positive correlation with hopelessness were identified: dysfunctional attitudes, exhaustion, psychological distress, hostility, lack of life goals and inability to cope emotionally. Sense of coherence, social support, perceived self-efficiency, subjective well-being and problem-solving coping showed a negative correlation with hopelessness. Concerning the relationship between hopelessness and suicide attempts, we found that participants who attempted suicide in the last year scored higher (mean = 4.86) than participants who attempted suicide more than 3 years ago (mean = 3.57). These results indicate that applying the short version of the BHS could be very useful in general practice and in psychiatric care.

AB Some studies suggest seasonality of suicide attempts in females, but not in males. The reasons for this gender difference remain unclear. Only few studies addressed the question whether gender differences in seasonality of suicide attempts reflect gender differences in the choice of method for suicide attempts, with inconsistent results. So, this study aimed to analyze the association of gender with seasonality in suicide attempts by persons living in two Northern Bavarian regions [city of Nuremberg (480,000 inhabitants) and region of Wuerzburg (270,000 inhabitants)] between 2000 and 2004. We addressed this question by focussing on the frequency of suicide attempts in relation to the seasons. The sample consisted of 2,269 suicide attempters (882 males and 1,387 females). The overall seasonality was assessed using the chi(2) test for multinomials. Moreover, the ratio of observed to expected number of suicide attempts (OER) with 95% confidence intervals within each season was calculated. As a result, overall distribution of suicide attempts differed significantly between seasons for women (chi(2) = 9.19, df = 3, P = 0.03), but not for men. Female suicide attempts showed a trough in the spring (decline compared to the expected value by 10%; OER = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.8-1.0). This trough was restricted to female low-risk suicide attempts (decline by 13%; OER = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.77-0.98). No seasonality was found for men. Seasonality of high-risk methods was more pronounced than that of low-risk methods; however, no significant gender differences were found concerning this aspect. The overall distribution of the sub-types of suicidal acts (parasuicidal gestures, suicidal pauses, suicide attempts in the strict sense) showed seasonality neither for males nor for females. Whereas seasonality was absent in male suicide attempters, the frequency of low-risk suicide attempts in females was 13.1% lower than expected in the spring.

AB The pattern of geographic variation in European suicide rates in the high-risk group of individuals aged 65 years and over was investigated, in order to provide a further test of the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis, i.e. the assumption that genetic differences between populations may partially account for spatial differences seen in the suicide prevalence. National suicide rates (average of 1970-2002) of the elderly from 34 European countries were regressed on geographic position terms, i.e. capital cities' latitude and longitude, along with transformations (e.g. squared latitude) and interaction terms (e.g. latitude multiplied with longitude) of these, which statistically modeled various possible geographic gradients in the suicide rates. In these regression models, the strongest and statistically significant predictor of elderly suicide rates was an interaction term of squared latitude multiplied with longitude, indicating that suicide rates increased to the northeast. This accounted for 13.8% (total), 20.8% (males) and 11.6% (females) of the cross-national variance in elderly suicide rates. No further geographic position term accounted for a significant increment of further variance in suicide rates over and above this predictor. Controls for national quality of living conditions and alcohol consumption rates left these results essentially unchanged. Replicating previous evidence based on suicide rates of the general population, suicide rates of the elderly show a northeastern gradient across Europe. This J-shaped belt of high-suicide-rate countries spans from Central Europe (Austria, Hungary and Slovenia) to Northeastern Europe (Finland and the Baltic countries). There are early historical and genetic communalities among the populations inhabiting this area, but, in terms of culture, recent history, political systems and socioeconomic factors, there is great diversity between these countries. The current findings thus add to cumulated empirical evidence consistent with the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis.

AB How differences in drinking patterns may affect the impact of alcohol consumption on deliberate self-harm among adolescents is explored in this international comparative study. Schools in Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Norway (N=30,532) were surveyed. In all countries the risk of deliberate self-harm was significantly elevated among adolescents who reported some or numerous episodes of intoxication, controlling for confounding factors. The results support the assumption that intoxication is significantly related to the association between alcohol consumption and deliberate self-harm in adolescents.

AB There is now convergent evidence from classic quantitative genetics (family, twin, and adoption studies) and molecular genetic studies for specific genetic risk factors for suicidal behavior. This emerging research field has recently been supplemented by geographical studies concerned with the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis (FUSH), which states that population differences in genetic risk factors may partially account for conspicuous geographical patterns seen in suicide prevalence. In particular, the European high-suicide-rate nations constitute a contiguous, J-shaped belt, spanning from Finland to Austria. This area maps onto the second principal component identified for European gene distribution, most likely reflecting a major migration event of the past (i.e., the ancestral adaptation to cold climates and the Uralic language dispersion) still detectable in modern European populations. The present research tested the hypothesis in the United States. Consistent with the hypothesis, available historical (1913-1924 and 1928-1932) U.S. state suicide rates were uniformly positively associated with available state proportions of reported American ancestries from European high-suicide-rate countries (Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, and the Ukraine). However, contrary to the hypothesis, available contemporary (1990-1994) suicide rates were uniformly negatively associated with these ancestry proportions. The findings of this first test outside Europe are therefore conflicting. A proposal based on the geographical study approach is offered to further the progress of investigations into the genetics of suicide.

AB Background: Certain types of news coverage can increase the likelihood of suicide. This study explores, how media covered a suicide case in a country, where there was no available guideline, though it was among the leading countries in suicide statistics. The specific aim was to compare the first and second waves of reporting on suicide from the same website.
   Methods: In 2011, two young women committed double suicide in Budapest, Hungary. We analyzed the first and second waves of the reported articles about this double suicide case, in online daily newspapers, news portals and also the readers' comments.
   Results: Provocative aspects were present in 38.9-100.0% of the articles, while preventive aspects were found in 0-22.2% of the articles. Readers commented in 49.6% "Other Aspects" (comments about all other aspects not belonging to any other category, i. e. Risk Behavior, Family Relations, Suicide Place and Methods, Prevention, Media Style Reporting) and in 25.4% "Without Content" (comments without a specific content: e. g. chatting), while " Prevention" (comments about possible safety preventive measures) was mentioned only in 1.5% of the comments. In 34.1% the emotional tonality of the comments was "Neutral" (indifferent comments: e.g. chatting). Though articles published for the second time were significantly longer than the firstly published ones, the preventive aspects of reporting were not added to the second articles either, but significantly more provocative aspects were found in them.
   Conclusions: The suicide reports, both in the first and second waves of reporting, were not in line with the recommendation of the international guidelines on suicide reporting. It draws the attention of professionals to the importance of developing national guidelines on media suicide coverage.

AB Background The suicide rate is a macro indicator of the population's psychosocial wellbeing and an evaluation criterion of the effectiveness of suicide prevention strategies. A high level of injury deaths of undetermined intent (UD) is usually discussed in connection with the validity of suicide statistics. An effort is made to develop a criterion to characterise the quality of suicide statistics.
   Methods Standardised rates of suicides (X60-X84) and UD (Y10-Y34) by the International Classification of Disease version 10 as an average for the past five available years were taken from the WHO European mortality database. Rate ratios were computed by dividing rates of UD by suicide rates.
   Results There is considerable variation in suicide and UD rates among countries. The highest overall rates of UD were registered in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and the lowest in Greece, Spain and Italy. The EU-15 average UD rate of 1.97 and the rate ratio of 0.194 UD to suicides were combined into a '2-20 benchmark', in which the primary indicator is 2.0 UD cases per 100 000 and the secondary indicator is the proportion of UD to suicides 0.20 (20%), which enables countries to be clustered according to the quality of suicide statistics. The following countries satisfied the benchmark: Greece, Norway, Spain, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Austria, Italy, Romania, Hungary, Ireland and Finland.
   Conclusion This study used the developed '2-20 benchmark' in Europe to assess suicide registration quality in a particular country, to compare the relative position of countries, and to set a target for those European countries that have not yet achieved the benchmark.

AB Objective: To find out the main causes of death of people who had multiple severe injuries.
   Design: Retrospective study.
   Setting: Teaching hospital, Hungary.
   Subjects: 86 people with severe multiple injuries, of whom 59 died and had necropsies.
   Main outcome measure: Establishment of a database.
   Results: Consumption of alcohol was a common precursor. Head and chest injuries predominated. More pedestrians than people in vehicles were killed, and there were 8 suicides and 3 murders. There were no gunshot injuries.
   Conclusions: Reduction of deaths from multiple injuries is as much a socioeconomic as a medical matter.

AB The authors performed a case-controlled psychological autopsy study of 100 successive suicides in Budapest, examining the presence of major depression, alcohol, and drug and/or medicament dependency/ abuse according to DSM-IV. The presence of somatic diseases, psychosocial stress, oppressive experiences, and interpersonal relationship disorders within the period of 1 month previous to death was also examined. The control group of 100 people who died of natural causes was identical with the suicide group in respect of number, sex, and age. Results: Among those committing suicide, psychosocial stress, oppressive experiences, and interpersonal relationship disorders were much more frequent and behavioral changes occurred more often in the weeks preceding death compared to the control group. A single suicide attempt during one's life span did not prove to be predictive for a later fatal action, but multiple attempts did. Major depression was diagnosed in 36% of the cases in the suicide group and 17% in the control group. Half of major-depressed suicides (18 persons) and almost all in the control group (16 persons) suffered from reactive (secondary) major depression as a result of somatic disease. Severe alcoholism was found in 33% of the suicide cases and in 44% of the control group. Drug and/or medicament consumption (misuse and/or abuse) occurred in 14% and 8% of the cases, respectively. The data emphasize again that alcoholism seems to be one of the most serious problems in Hungary both in psychological and somatic illnesses.

ID TEMPERATURE; SUNSHINE; SEASONALITY; VIOLENT
AB Several environmental factors with periodic changes in intensity during the calendar year have been put forward to explain the increase in suicide frequency during spring and summer. In the current study we investigated the effect of averaged daily sunshine duration of periods with different lengths and 'lags' (i.e. the number of days between the last day of the period for which the averaged sunshine duration was calculated and the day of suicide) on suicide risk
   We obtained data on daily numbers of suicide cases and daily sunshine duration in Hungary from 1979 to 2013. In order to remove the seasonal components from the two time series (i.e. numbers of suicide and sunshine hours) we used the differencing method. Pearson correlations (n = 22,950) were calculated to reveal associations between sunshine duration and suicide risk
   The final sample consisted of 122,116 suicide cases. Regarding the entire investigated period, after differencing, sunshine duration and number of suicides on the same days showed a distinctly weak, but highly significant positive correlation in the total sample (r = 0.067; p = 1.17*10(-13)). Positive significant correlations (p 0.0001) between suicide risk on the index day and averaged sunshine duration in the previous days (up to 11 days) were also found in the total sample.
   Our results from a large sample strongly support the hypothesis that sunshine has a prompt, but very weak increasing effect on the risk of suicide (especially violent cases among males). The main limitation is that possible confounding factors were not controlled for. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID RATES; CHINA
AB Introduction: Over the past 20 years the WHO has considerably improved world mortality data. There are still shortcomings but more countries now report data and world-wide estimates are regularly made. Methods: Data about mortality have been retrieved from the WHO world database. Worldwide injury mortality estimates for 2008 as well as trends of the suicide rate from 1950 to 2009 were analysed. Results: Suicides in the world amount to 782 thousand in 2008 according to the WHO estimate, which is 1.4% of total mortality and 15% of injury mortality. The suicide rate for the world as a whole is estimated at 11.6 per 100,000 inhabitants. The male-female rate ratio of suicide is estimated to be highest in the European Region (4.0) and the lowest in the Eastern Mediterranean region (1.1). Among males the highest suicide rate in the 15-29 age group is in the SE Asian region, in the 45-59 age group in European males and for ages above 60 in the Western Pacific region. Females from SE Asia have a remarkably high suicide rate among 15-29-year-olds and from age 45 in the Western Pacific region. The leading country is currently Lithuania, with a suicide rate of 34.1 per 100,000 inhabitants. Also among males the suicide rate is the highest in Lithuania at 61.2. Among females South Korea with 22.1 is at the top of world suicide rates. Conclusions: During the past six decades, according to the WHO Japan, Hungary, and Lithuania have topped the list of world countries by suicide rate, but if the current trends continue South Korea will overtake all others in a few years. The heart of the problem of suicide mortality has shifted from Western Europe to Eastern Europe and now seems to be shifting to Asia. China and India are the biggest contributors to the absolute number of suicides in the world.

AB Background: Suicide is a significant public health issue worldwide, resulting in loss of lives, and burdening societies.
   Aims: To describe and analyze the time trends of suicide rates (SRs) in the Slovak Republic in 1993-2015 for targeted suicide prevention strategies.
   Methods: Data for this study were obtained from the mortality database of the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic. Crude and standardized annual SRs were calculated. Trends and relative risks of suicide according to age and sex were analyzed by joinpoint regression and negative binomial regression.
   Results: In total, there were 14,575 suicides in the Slovak Republic in the period 1993-2015 (85.3% were men). The overall average age-standardized SR for the study period was 11.45 per 100,000 person years. The rate increases with age, the highest is in men aged 75+ (42.74 per 100,000 person years). Risk of suicide is six times higher in men than in women and nine times higher in men than in women in the age group 25-34. The time trend of SRs is stable or decreasing from 1993 to 2007, but increasing after 2007, corresponding with increased unemployment rate in the country.
   Conclusion: The SR in the Slovak Republic is slightly below the average of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations. Highest SR is observed in men of working age and in retirement. Society might benefit from a strategy of education for improving the recognition of suicide risks.

   COUNTRIES; PATTERNS; BEHAVIOR; HUNGARY
AB Background: Research concerning the association between use of antidepressants and incidence of suicide has yielded inconsistent results and is the subject of considerable controversy. The first aim is to describe trends in the use of antidepressants and rates of suicide in Europe, adjusted for gross domestic product, alcohol consumption, unemployment, and divorce. The second aim is to explore if any observed reduction in the rate of suicide in different European countries preceded the trend for increased use of antidepressants.
   Methods: Data were obtained for 29 European countries between 1980 and 2009. Pearson correlations were used to explore the direction and magnitude of associations. Generalized linear mixed models and Poisson regression distribution were used to clarify the effects of antidepressants on suicide rates, while an autoregressive adjusted model was used to test the interaction between antidepressant utilization and suicide over two time periods: 1980-1994 and 1995-2009.
   Findings: An inverse correlation was observed in all countries between recorded Standardised Death Rate (SDR) for suicide and antidepressant Defined Daily Dosage (DDD), with the exception of Portugal. Variability was marked in the association between suicide and alcohol, unemployment and divorce, with countries depicting either a positive or a negative correlation with the SDR for suicide. Every unit increase in DDD of an antidepressant per 1000 people per day, adjusted for these confounding factors, reduces the SDR by 0.088. The correlation between DDD and suicide related SDR was negative in both time periods considered, albeit more pronounced between 1980 and 1994.
   Conclusions: Suicide rates have tended to decrease more in European countries where there has been a greater increase in the use of antidepressants. These findings underline the importance of the appropriate use of antidepressants as part of routine care for people diagnosed with depression, therefore reducing the risk of suicide.

AB Introduction: The analysis of the mortality data of patients is important.
   Aim: Examination of data from patients treated in the Addictological Out-patient Clinic in Jozsefvaros and deceased between 2001 and 2018.
   Method: Patients' data originated from medical records. The national and Budapest data were from the publications of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office.
   Results: The age of patients was 52.85 +/- 11.81 years for women and 51.99 +/- 12.47 years for men. Two-thirds, regardless of gender, were alcoholic. There were many violent deaths. A new phenomenon was the high number of drug- and murder-associated deaths. The former group was dominated by men. The latter group showed female dominance. The completed suicide rate was 14.6%. Suicide attempts occurred in 22.4% of patients. The majority of patients were skilled workers.
   Conclusion: Data support the view that addict patients die earlier. Leading deaths, unlike previous investigations, were violent deaths. The rate of suicide was higher than the national rate, but it was the same as previously reported, indicating a high risk of this population. Gender differences were observed with regard to violent death, requiring further elucidation.

AB The purpose of the present study was to investigate all the drowning-related cases in South-West Hungary between 2008 and 2012. It is a retrospective and descriptive study of 114 drowning-related deaths during that 5-year period. The investigation includes both unintentional and intentional drowning cases.
   We found that the most considerable risk factor of drowning in this area of Hungary is alcohol consumption, because in more than half of the cases the victims were under the influence of alcohol. We also concluded that more than two third of the cases included males. The cause of drowning in younger victims was mostly accident. In both genders subjects aged 50-70 had the highest risk of drowning in the period investigated. Seniors frequently committed suicide by drowning. Drowning deaths occurred in all types of water, mostly in lakes, rivers, canals and other types of catchment in the vicinity of victims' homes (most commonly in wells). This study might help to understand the circumstances and the causes leading to drowning and it may draw the attention to the possible preventive interventions.

ID CLINICAL-RESPONSE; RESISTANCE; RATES; ECT
AB Background. The diagnostic distribution of patients treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in Hungary is significantly different from that in Western Europe or the USA. In Hungary most of the treated patients are diagnosed with schizophrenia. Aim. To analyze the practice of referring patients for ECT in Hungary. Methods. Questionnaires containing socio-demographic data were mailed to all Hungarian psychiatric units where ECT was used (n = 34), and all of the psychiatrists working there were invited to participate. Respondents were asked to rate how often they considered ECT for various symptoms/syndromes on a five-point Likert Scale. Results. A total of 78 questionnaires were returned. Altogether, 89% of the respondents have referred patients to ECT, and 54.8% had done so in the last year. The respondents had most frequently recommended ECT for antipsychotic and antidepressant-resistant patients, catatonic symptoms, or patients with previous good treatment response to ECT. Conclusion. Considering the very high Hungarian suicide rate, the low referral rate in cases of severe suicidal intent and threat is surprising. The respondents also rarely considered ECT for NMS or severe depression. The discrepancy between current referral practices and standard recommendations could be decreased with more ECT training courses.

TI A theory for the nursing care of patients at risk of suicide
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
LA English
DT Article
DE grounded theory interviews; mental health; observer-as-participant;
   psychiatric nursing; suicide; therapeutic relationship
ID GROUNDED THEORY; NURSES
AB Aim. This paper presents a nursing care theory developed to guide the care given to people with suicidal ideas and those with a previous suicide attempt.
   Background. Suicide is a major public health problem. According to the World Health Organization, international suicide rates range from highs of more than 20 per 100 000 people in Hungary (1997 figures), to fewer than 10 per 100 000 in the United Kingdom (2002 figures). In 2002, the number of completed suicides in Taiwan increased by nearly 10% over the previous year, and the Taiwanese Government has set targets to reduce this rate. Psychiatric nurses play a vital role in helping reduce the suicide rate through prevention, education and by providing care that promotes the healing of patients who attempt suicide.
   Methods. A grounded theory approach was used. Fifteen patients who had either suicidal ideas or had attempted suicide and 15 psychiatric nurses working on acute wards were interviewed and observed using an observer-as-participant strategy. Data were collected through field notes and by tape-recorded interviews during 2003, and analysed using open, axial and selective coding and the qualitative software program QRS NUD*IST.
   Findings. The core category that emerged from the data collected was the provision of 'safe and compassionate care via the channel of the therapeutic relationship'. Other key categories linked to and embraced within this core category were: providing holistic assessments; providing protection; providing basic care; and promoting healing through advanced care.
   Conclusion. The theory generated from the findings could be used by nurses as a guide as they initiate and maintain therapeutic relationships with patients who are at risk of suicide. The theory could advance the quality of care provided by nurses. In addition, it holds potential for instilling hope in patients who have lost their ability to cope with life events and perhaps life itself.

SO ANNALS OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Suicide; Austerity; Delayed effect
ID ECONOMIC-CRISIS; FINANCIAL CRISIS; HEALTH
AB Background: During the last few years, many countries in Europe suffered from a severe economic crisis which resulted in high unemployment rates. In this frame, the possible relationship between unemployment rate and suicidal rates at the level of the general population has been debated recently.
   Material and methods: The official data concerning completed suicides and unemployment rates from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office for the years 2000-2011 were used. The percentage of changes from the previous year in the unemployment rate and the suicidal rates concerning both the general and the unemployed populations was calculated. Pearson correlation coefficient between the change in suicidal rates and change in unemployment rates was calculated both for the same year as well as after 1-6 years.
   Results: The correlations between the unemployment rate and suicide rates were strongly negative both for the general and for the unemployed populations (-0.65 and -0.55, respectively). The correlation of unemployment change with suicidality change after 1-6 years gave a peak strong positive correlation at 5 years for the general population (0.78). At 4 years after the index year, there is a peak correlation with a moderate value for the unemployed population (0.47) and a similar moderate value for the general population (0.46).
   Discussion: The current findings from Hungary suggest that unemployment might be associated with suicidality in the general population only after 3-5 years. It is possible that the distressing environment of the economic crisis increases suicidality in the general population rather than specifically in unemployed people.

TI The fate of Hungarian Jewish dermatologists during the Holocaust Part 2:
   Under Nazi rule
SO CLINICS IN DERMATOLOGY
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB At least 564,500 Hungarian Jews perished during the Holocaust, including many physicians. Exactly how many Jewish dermatologists were killed is not known. We have identified 62 Hungarian Jewish dermatologists from this period: 19 of these dermatologists died in concentration camps or were shot in Hungary, 3 committed suicide, and 1 died shortly after the Holocaust, exhausted by the War. Fortunately, many Hungarian Jewish dermatologists survived the Holocaust. Some had fled Europe before the Nazi takeover, as was described in Part 1 of this contribution. Two Holocaust survivors, Ferenc Foldvari and (Mon Rajka, became presidents of the Hungarian Dermatologic Society and helped rebuild the profession of dermatology in Hungary after the War. This contribution provides one of the first accounts of the fate of Hungarian Jewish dermatologists during the Holocaust and serves as a remembrance of their suffering and ordeal.

DE Recession and health; Socioeconomic determinants of health; Austerity
ID HEALTH; UNEMPLOYMENT; RECESSIONS; MORTALITY; SUICIDE; POLICY
AB A growing body of the literature has argued that austerity has been bad for health, though without directly measuring austerity. This paper explicitly distinguishes the association of mortality with macroeconomic fluctuations from that with fiscal policy measures, using data for 28 European Union (EU) countries covering the period 1991-2013. The main results present a nuanced, complex picture about the mortality impact of fiscal policies. We confirm the mortality decreasing (increasing) effect of recessions (booms), with the exception of suicide mortality, which shows the opposite effects. Austerity regimes are associated with an increase in all-cause mortality (0.7%). At the same time, fiscal stimuli tend to significantly increase death rates due to cirrhosis or chronic liver disease (3%) and those due to vehicle accidents (4.3%). Our results are sensitive to the set of countries included: when excluding the Baltics, Romania and Hungary, austerity policies turn out to significantly increase suicide-related mortality (2.8%), while the effect on all-cause mortality remains unaffected (0.7%). Overall, however it appears that the austerity-increasing effects are mostly compensated by the (mostly) mortality-decreasing effects of recessions. A notable exception appears to be suicides, which receive a 'double-boost' from both recessions and austerity. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hanging is a common method of committing suicide and a routine task in medico-legal autopsies. The hanging mark is the most relevant external sign and its characteristics are well known, but, for unknown reasons, there are major differences in reports on internal findings. We retrospectively studied 228 consecutive cases of hanging deaths. A complete standard autopsy was performed for every case. We investigated the association between the characteristics of the hanging mark and the frequency of bone, cartilage, soft tissue, and vascular injuries with the mode of suspension. Most cases (75.3%) presented some kind of bone or cartilage fracture, but these were unrelated to any of the variables studied. Vascular lesions are clearly more infrequent: intimal injuries were found in the carotid artery (9.1%), the jugular vein (2.2%), and ruptures of the carotid adventitial layer (21.7%). These could be partially associated with the use of a hard fixed noose and body weight.

AB The available data set regarding pregnant women who attempted suicide during pregnancy was evaluated to estimate the teratogenic effect of very large doses of drugs based on the rate and distribution of congenital abnormalities of exposed children. These pregnant women were identified from patients of central toxicological inpatients clinic, Budapest, Hungary, 1960-1993. Of 1044 women with self-poisoning during pregnancy, 411 delivered live-born babies; 367 of these children were examined in this study. Data for 12 frequently used (10 or more times) drugs were published pi previously; this paper presents 77 medicines (58 drugs and 19 medicinal products including multiple components) that were rarely used for a suicide attempt by 197 pregnant women. Although 23 (11.7%) exposed children had congenital abnormalities (CAs), in general, a causal relationship of the CA, and the drug taken by the pregnant woman cannot be assumed. This is because the suicide attempt often did not occur during a critical period for producing the CA. Of 67 pregnant women who attempted suicide between the 3rd and 12th postconceptional week, that is, the critical period of most major CAs, 7 (10.5%) children were affected with CAs. This high rate of CAs in exposed children can be explained by the intensive medical examinations, including diagnosis of mild CAs and minor anomalies, or the low socioeconomic status and hazardous lifestyle of mothers. None of the rarely used drugs was identified as a potential human teratogen. Experience of the authors shows the feasibility and benefits of using the self-poisoning model in estimating human teratogenic/fetotoxic risks of exposure to drugs.

AB The teratogenic effect of barbitals is debated, and this study was performed to identify the effects of very large doses of amobarbital used for suicide attempts during pregnancy on embryo-fetal development. Self-poisoned pregnant women were identified from patients of the Department of Toxicology Internal Medicine, Koranyi Hospital, Budapest, Hungary, who were admitted from the 3 million people of Budapest and its surrounding region. A comparison was made between outcomes 4 pregnancies of women who attempted suicide with amobarbital alone or in combination with other drugs during pregnancy with sib controls. Of 1044 women with self-poisoning during pregnancy between 1960 and 1993, 33 used amobarbital for a suicide attempt. Of these 33 women, 14 delivered live-born babies. The dose of amobarbital taken by these women ranged between 600 and 10,000 mg, with a mean of 3886 mg. Of the 14 amobarbital-exposed children, 9 had mothers who attempted suicide between the 3rd and 12th post-conceptional weeks. None of these children had a congenital abnormality, and there was no evidence of fetal growth retardation. The distribution of cognitive status and behavioral scale of the exposed children were comparable with those of, their sibs although one exposed child had a very low (about 75) IQ, whereas another one was treated because of a very severe aggressive behavioral deviation. Exposure to very large doses of amobarbital that were used for self-poisoning during pregnancy did not produce teratogenic effects in this study. Toxicology and Industrial Health 2008; 24: 79-85.

AB The present research focused on the development of a brief measure of suicidal ideation frequency, namely, the Frequency of Suicidal Ideation Inventory (FSII). Study 1 examined the latent structure of the FSII in a sample of 399 US college students. Results of exploratory factor analysis indicated a one-factor solution accounting for 86.96 % of the variance. Study 2 provided support for the internal reliability of the FSII across four different international samples (viz., US, Turkey, Hungary, and China). Within the US sample, the FSII was found to possess good 6-week test-retest reliability. Moreover, an examination of the associations between the FSII and important measures of suicide risk factors (e.g., suicidal behaviors) and suicide protective factors (e.g., flourishing) provided support for the construct validity of our new measure in an independent sample of 143 US college students. In addition, we found preliminary evidence supporting the FSII as a useful measure of the likelihood of making a future suicide attempt and evidence for the utility of the FSII over established measures of suicide risk in predicting depressive symptoms. Overall, the present findings provide promising evidence for the validity and reliability of the FSII as a brief measure of SI frequency in adults.

AB Background: There have been only a few reports illustrating the moderate effectiveness of suicide-preventive interventions in reducing suicidal behavior, and, in most of those studies, the target populations were primarily adults, whereas few focused on adolescents. Essentially, there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and cultural adaptability of suicide-prevention strategies in schools. There is also a lack of information on whether suicide-preventive interventions can, in addition to preventing suicide, reduce risk behaviors and promote healthier ones as well as improve young people's mental health.
   The aim of the SEYLE project, which is funded by the European Union under the Seventh Framework Health Program, is to address these issues by collecting baseline and follow-up data on health and well-being among European adolescents and compiling an epidemiological database; testing, in a randomized controlled trial, three different suicide-preventive interventions; evaluating the outcome of each intervention in comparison with a control group from a multidisciplinary perspective; as well as recommending culturally adjusted models for promoting mental health and preventing suicidal behaviors.
   Methods and design: The study comprises 11,000 adolescents emitted from randomized schools in 11 European countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden serving as the scientific coordinating center. Each country performs three active interventions and one minimal intervention as a control group. The active interventions include gatekeeper training (QPR), awareness training on mental health promotion for adolescents, and screening for at-risk adolescents by health professionals. Structured questionnaires are utilized at baseline, 3- and 12-month follow-ups in order to assess changes.
   Discussion: Although it has been reported that suicide-preventive interventions can be effective in decreasing suicidal behavior, well-documented and randomized studies are lacking. The effects of such interventions in terms of combating unhealthy lifestyles in young people, which often characterize suicidal individuals, have never been reported. We know that unhealthy and risk-taking behaviors are detrimental to individuals' current and future health. It is, therefore, crucial to test well-designed, longitudinal mental health-promoting and suicide-preventive interventions by evaluating the implications of such activities for reducing unhealthy and risk behaviors while concurrently promoting healthy ones.

AB the human teratogenic potential of chlordiazepoxide is debated. To study the effects on the fetal development of very large doses of chlordiazepoxide that were used for a suicide attempt during pregnancy, self-poisoned pregnant women were identified from patients in a toxicological inpatient clinic in Budapest, Hungary. Comparisons were made between congenital abnormalities, intrauterine fetal development, and cognitive-behavioral status of the exposed children born to mothers who attempted suicide with chlordiazepoxide alone or in combination with other drugs during pregnancy and their sib controls. Of 1044 women with self-poisoning during pregnancy between 1960 and 1993, 88 (8.4%) used chlordiazepoxide with or without other drugs for suicide attempt;. 35 of these women delivered five-born infants. Doses of chlordiazepoxide taken ranged between 20 and 300 mg, with a mean of 117 +/- 86 mg. Of 35 exposed children, six (17.1%) were affected with congenital abnormalities compared with three (13.6%) of their 22 sibs (OR with 95% CI: 1.3 (0.3-4.4). Of 18 pregnant women who attempted suicide between the 4th and 12th postconceptional week, the period most sensitive to congenital malformation, four delivered live-born children affected with a congenital abnormality (atrial septal defect type II, complex defect of respiratory system, mild pyelectasis because of the stenosis of ureteropelvic junction, congenital inguinal hernia). Two other children had fetal alcohol syndrome and unrecognized multiple congenital abnormality including talipes equinovarus, deformation type, and four minor anomalies. The pregnancy age-specific mean birth weight indicated intrauterine fetal growth retardation, which was confirmed by a dose-response relationship and by the higher rate of : low birth-weight newborns. Cognitive status and behavioral scale of exposed children did not indicate neurotoxic effects. Very large doses of chlordiazepoxide used for suicide attempts during pregnancy did hot induce a higher rate of congenital abnormalities but were associated with dose-dependent intrauterine growth retardation.

AB The purpose of this article is to report an evaluation of the teratogenic and fetotoxic potential of medezepam in humans based on pregnant women who used very large doses of medazepam for a suicide attempt. All self-poisoned patients were cared for at the Department of Toxicology Internal Medicine, Koranyi Hospital, a toxicological inpatients clinic in Budapest, Hungary, between 1960 and. 1993. Pregnant women were identified from self-poisoned subjects admitted from a population base of three million people of Budapest and the surrounding region. The rates of congenital abnormalities (CAs), intrauterine fetal development, cognitive and behavioral status in children born to mothers who attempted suicide with medazepam alone or in combination with other drugs during pregnancy was compared in their sib controls. Between 1980 and 1993, 835 pregnant women in our study attempted suicide during pregnancy with drugs. Of these, 314 delivered live-born infants and 283 were examined and/or evaluated. Thirty-two (3.8%) of these 835 pregnant women used medazepam with or without other drugs for self-poisoning; 10 of these women delivered live-born babies. The dose of medazepam used for the suicide attempt ranged between 60 and 500 mg, with a mean of 276 mg.; Eight of the 32 suicide attempts involving medazepam occurred between the 4th and, 12th postconceptional weeks. Of the 10 live-born exposed children, one was affected with congenital inguinal hernia; one of the 13 sib controls had a lethal hydronephrosis. No adverse effects were observed on intrauterine growth, cognitive status, or behavioral deviations in the 10 children born to mothers who attempted suicide with medazepam during pregnancy. Very large doses of medazepam were used for self-poisoning during pregnancy. These doses did not increase the rate of: CAs even though eight mothers attempted suicide during the most critical period for production of CAs. No fetotoxic, including neurotoxic, effects of exposure of live-born children to a very large dose of medazepam were observed. Our experiences show the feasibility and benefits of use of the self-poisoning model in estimating human teratogenic and fetotoxic risks of drugs. Toxicology and Industrial Health 2008; 24: 61-68.

AB Background Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for 14-20% of suicides worldwide. Regulation aimed at restricting access to pesticides or banning highly hazardous pesticides is one approach to reducing these deaths. We systematically reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness of pesticide regulation in reducing the incidence of pesticide suicides and overall suicides.
   Methods We did a systematic review of the international evidence. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase for studies published between Jan 1, 1960, and Dec 31, 2016, which investigated the effect of national or regional bans, and sales or import restrictions, on the availability of one or more pesticides and the incidence of suicide in different countries. We excluded other interventions aimed at limiting community access to pesticides. We extracted data from studies presenting pesticide suicide data and overall suicide data from before and after national sales restrictions. Two reviewers independently assessed papers for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We undertook a narrative synthesis of the data in each report, and where data were available for the years before and after a ban, we pooled data for the 3 years before and the 3 years after to obtain a crude estimate of the effect of the ban. This study is registered through PROSPERO, number CRD42017053329.
   Findings We identified 27 studies undertaken in 16 countries-five low-income or middle-income countries (Bangladesh, Colombia, India, Jordan and Sri Lanka), and 11 high-income countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, UK, and USA). Assessments largely focused on national bans of specific pesticides (12 studies of bans in six countries-Jordan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Greece [ Crete], South Korea, and Taiwan) or sales restrictions (eight studies of restrictions in five countries-India, Denmark, Ireland, the UK and the USA). Only five studies used optimum analytical methods. National bans on commonly ingested pesticides in five of the six countries studied, including four studies using optimum analytical methods, were followed by reductions in pesticide suicides and, in three of these countries, falls in overall suicide mortality. Greece was the only country studied that did not show a decrease in pesticide suicide following a ban. There were no high-quality studies of restricting sales to people for occupational uses; four of the seven studies (in three of the five countries studied-India, Denmark, and the USA) showed sales restrictions were followed by decreases in pesticide suicides; one of the two studies investigating trends in overall suicide mortality reported a fall in deaths in Denmark, but there were also decreases in suicide deaths from other methods.
   Interpretation National bans on highly hazardous pesticides, which are commonly ingested in acts of self-poisoning, seem to be effective in reducing pesticide-specific and overall suicide rates. Evidence is less consistent for sales restrictions. A worldwide ban on the use of highly hazardous pesticides is likely to prevent tens of thousands of deaths every year. Copyright (C) The Author(s).

AB Although major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with suicidal behaviors, some depressed individuals are not suicidal and others evidence various forms of suicidality. We thus investigated whether aspects of temperament and self-regulation of dysphoria represent risk factors for DSM-IV suicidality (recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation, suicidal plan, and suicide attempt) in depressed youths. Using a sample of children with MDD (N=407; ages 7-14 years), recruited from clinical sites across Hungary, we tested the hypotheses that: (a) suicidality is related to higher levels of trait negative emotionality as well as more maladaptive and fewer adaptive regulatory responses to dysphoria and (b) as the severity of suicidal behavior increases, levels of trait negative emotionality and dysfunctional emotion regulation also increase. We also explored if other aspects of temperament relate to suicidality. Children's DSM-IV diagnoses were based on semi-structured interviews and best-estimate psychiatric consensus. Parents independently provided ratings of their children's temperament, and children separately completed an inventory of emotion regulation (ER). Using multivariate models, we failed to confirm the hypothesized relations of negative trait emotionality and suicidality, but confirmed that high maladaptive and low adaptive ER response tendencies increase the odds of suicidal behaviors, above and beyond the risk posed by depressive illness severity. Unplanned interaction terms between temperament dimensions (other than negative emotionality) and ER suggested that at some high-extremes of temperament, ER has no impact on suicidality but in their absence, adaptive ER lowers the risk of suicidality. The practical implications of the findings are discussed.

AB Context: Depression is a major public health problem. Despite many years of research, the molecular mechanisms associated with depression remain unclear. Rap-1, activated in response to many extracellular stimuli, is one of the major substrates of protein kinase A, which participates in myriad physiologic functions in the brain, including cell survival and synaptic plasticity. Rap-1 is also activated directly by cyclic adenosine monophosphate through Epac, and thus participates in mediating physiologic functions independent of protein kinase A.
   Objective: To examine whether the pathogenesis of depression is associated with altered activation and expression of Rap-1, as well as expression of Epac, in depressed suicide victims.
   Design: Postmortem study.
   Setting: Tissues were obtained from the Lenhossek Human Brain Program, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary, and the Brain Collection Program of the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, Baltimore.
   Participants: Postmortem brains of 28 depressed suicide victims and 28 nonpsychiatric control subjects.
   Intervention: Examination of brain tissues.
   Main Outcome Measures: Rap-1 activation as well as messenger RNA and protein levels of Rap-1 and Epac in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum.
   Results: Rap-1 activation was significantly reduced (P < .001) in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in the suicide group. This was associated with significant reductions in Rap-1 messenger RNA and protein levels (P < .001). In contrast, protein level of only Epac-2 (P < .001) but not Epac-1 (P = .89) was significantly increased in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of these subjects. These changes were present whether the 2 cohorts were analyzed together or separately. None of the measures showed any significant change in cerebellum in the suicide group.
   Conclusion: Given the importance of Rap-1 in neuroprotection and synaptic plasticity, our findings of differential regulation of Rap-1 and Epac between brain regions suggest the relevance of these molecules in the pathophysiology of depression.

AB The results of animal investigations cannot be directly extrapolated to pregnant women. Clinical and analytical epidemiological studies for human teratogenic, risks have many inherent methodological problems and their predictions must be regarded with caution. Evaluation of the potential teratogenicity of extremely large doses of drugs in self-poisoned pregnant women who attempted Suicide offers a unique model for finding associations between congenital abnormalities and different drugs. All self-poisoned patients were cared for at a toxicological inpatient clinic in Budapest, between 1960 and 1993. Out of 1044 pregnant women identified from three different periods of the project, 19 died. Women who survived were visited at home to reveal birth outcomes, and their children were evaluated medically to identify congenital abnormalities and to estimate cognitive-behavioral status. The previous or subsequent children of these pregnant women were used as controls. In general, self-poisoned pregnant women were young (peak age was 18 to 20 years) and primiparous; 55% were unmarried and of lower socioeconomic status. Suicide attempts with drugs were most frequent in the fourth postconceptional week and second pregnancy month. Of 1044 self-poisoned pregnant women, 411 delivered live-born babies, of which 367 children (89.3%) were evaluated. The self-poisoning model appears to have several benefits (e.g., dose-response estimation) in comparison with other methods. It is suggested that an international monitoring system of self-poisoned pregnant women should be established to provide a larger database. Toxicology and Industrial Health 2008; 24: 11-28.

AB This international comparative study addresses differences between adolescents who engage in deliberate self-harm (DSH) and who receive help following the DSH episode versus those who do not. A standardised self-report questionnaire was completed by Pupils aged 14-17 in Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, The Netherlands, and Norway (n=30532). An act of DSH in the year prior to the study was reported by 1660 participants. Nearly half (48.4%) had not received any help following DSH, 32.8% had received help from their social network only and 18.8% from health services. Except for Hungary, cross-national comparisons revealed remarkably similar findings. Adolescents who had been in contact with health services following DSH reported more often a wish to die, lethal methods, alcohol/drug problems and DSH in the family compared to those who had not. However, those who received no help or help from their social network only were also heavily burdened. (C) 2008 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB In Hungary, promethazine, a phenothiazine antihistamine, is the second most frequently used, drug during pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of very large doses of promethazine that were used for a suicide attempt during pregnancy on embryo-fetal development. Self-poisoned pregnant women were identified from patients of the Department of Toxicology Internal Medicine, Koranyi Hospital, Budapest, who were admitted from the three million people of Budapest and surrounding region. The rate of congenital abnormalities, intrauterine development (based on pregnancy age at delivery and birth weight), and cognitive-behavioral status of exposed children born to mothers who attempted suicide with promethazine alone or in combination with other drugs during pregnancy was compared with their sib controls. In all, 89 of the 1044 women with self-poisoning during pregnancy between 1960 and 1993 used promethazine for a suicide attempt. Of these 89 women, 32 delivered newborn babies. The dose of promethazine taken by these women for self-poisoning ranged between 125 mg and 1750 mg (mean of 544 mg, i.e., 21.8 tablets). Of the 32 promethazine-exposed children, nine (28.1 %) were affected with congenital abnormalities. However, of 11 pregnant women who attempted suicide with promethazine between the 3rd and 12th postconceptional week, that is the critical period for production of most major congenital abnormalities, only three were affected with defects, and the critical periods for producing these defects did not overlap with the time of the suicide attempt during pregnancy. Of 34 unexposed sibs, five (14.7%) had congenital abnormalities; the difference in the total rate of congenital abnormalities between the exposed children and their sib controls was not significant. There. also was no difference in pregnancy age-specific birth weight between exposed children and their sibs. Mean intelligence quotient was not reduced, and the incidence of behavioral deviation was not increased in the exposed children, The findings of this study did not indicate teratogenic or fetotoxic (including neurotoxic) effects of large doses of promethazine in children born to mothers whoa self-poisoned during pregnancy, although the total rate of congenital abnormalities was very high.; Our experience shows the feasibility and benefits of using the self-poisoning model in estimating human teratogenic/fetotoxic risks of exposure to drugs.

AB Background: Few studies have focused on the differences between two depressed groups of patients in child psychiatry: the suicidal and the non-suicidal adolescent population. As in other countries, depression is one of the most prevalent diagnoses in adolescents in Hungary. Aims: The present study was designed to determine (a) whether there are specific symptoms to differentiate between two clinical samples of depressed children: patients expressing suicidal behaviour and their peers with no suicide attempts, and (b) if there are significant differences between parents' and adolescents' reports of the same symptoms. Methods: Using a recently developed semi-structured interview (Diagnostic Evaluation Schedule for Children and Adolescents-Hungarian version, Kovacs, 1996), 132 symptoms were assessed for two clinical groups of depressed adolescents: a suicidal group (N = 51), and a non-suicidal group (N = 8 1). The suicidal group had all made an unsuccessful suicide attempt and/or had had frequent suicidal thoughts during the 6 months prior to the study. The non-suicidal group had neither attempted suicide, nor had had suicidal thoughts during the previous 6 months. All cases were selected from a larger sample of 490 consecutively referred new outpatient children over a 1 year period in five psychiatric facilities in Hungary. Only 13-17-year-old adolescents participated in the study. Both samples were identified using operationalised computer algorithm criteria of DSM-IV major depressive disorder episode (MDD) irrespective of the current clinical diagnosis of the patients. The Pearson Chi-square test with Monte Carlo correction was used to evaluate the differences between the suicidal and the non-suicidal depressed samples. Results: Hopelessness, negative self-esteem and violent behaviour were the only significant discriminators between the two study groups according to the parent interviews, with increased problem scores in the suicidal sample compared to the non-suicidal sample. Suicidal depressed adolescents view themselves as more depressed and violent than do non-suicidal depressed individuals and were less anxious about their parents. Conclusions: The two depressed samples (suicidal vs. non-suicidal individuals) have only very few dissimilarities. There are, however, some essential differences between the parental and adolescent perceptions of the suicidal and depressive symptoms of the adolescent. The findings of the study underscore the necessity of collecting data from both the parent and the adolescent. Limitations: Cross-sectional, no lifetime psychopathology, referred samples, no blind estimation of the suicidal status of patients. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI What Are Reasons for the Large Gender Differences in the Lethality of
   Suicidal Acts? An Epidemiological Analysis in Four European Countries
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article

AB Background
   In Europe, men have lower rates of attempted suicide compared to women and at the same time a higher rate of completed suicides, indicating major gender differences in lethality of suicidal behaviour. The aim of this study was to analyse the extent to which these gender differences in lethality can be explained by factors such as choice of more lethal methods or lethality differences within the same suicide method or age. In addition, we explored gender differences in the intentionality of suicide attempts.
   Methods and Findings
   Methods. Design: Epidemiological study using a combination of self-report and official data. Setting: Mental health care services in four European countries: Germany, Hungary, Ireland, and Portugal. Data basis: Completed suicides derived from official statistics for each country (767 acts, 74.4% male) and assessed suicide attempts excluding habitual intentional self-harm (8,175 acts, 43.2% male).
   Main Outcome Measures and Data Analysis. We collected data on suicidal acts in eight regions of four European countries participating in the EU-funded "OSPI-Europe"-project (www.ospi-europe.com). We calculated method-specific lethality using the number of completed suicides per method * 100 /(number of completed suicides per method + number of attempted suicides per method). We tested gender differences in the distribution of suicidal acts for significance by using the chi(2)-test for two-by-two tables. We assessed the effect sizes with phi coefficients (phi). We identified predictors of lethality with a binary logistic regression analysis. Poisson regression analysis examined the contribution of choice of methods and method-specific lethality to gender differences in the lethality of suicidal acts.
   Findings Main Results
   Suicidal acts (fatal and non-fatal) were 3.4 times more lethal in men than in women (lethality 13.91% (regarding 4106 suicidal acts) versus 4.05% (regarding 4836 suicidal acts)), the difference being significant for the methods hanging, jumping, moving objects, sharp objects and poisoning by substances other than drugs. Median age at time of suicidal behaviour (35-44 years) did not differ between males and females. The overall gender difference in lethality of suicidal behaviour was explained by males choosing more lethal suicide methods (odds ratio (OR) = 2.03; 95% CI = 1.65 to 2.50; p < 0.000001) and additionally, but to a lesser degree, by a higher lethality of suicidal acts for males even within the same method (OR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.32 to 2.02; p = 0.000005). Results of a regression analysis revealed neither age nor country differences were significant predictors for gender differences in the lethality of suicidal acts. The proportion of serious suicide attempts among all non-fatal suicidal acts with known intentionality (NFSAi) was significantly higher in men (57.1%; 1,207 of 2,115 NFSAi) than in women (48.6%; 1,508 of 3,100 NFSAi) (chi(2) = 35.74; p < 0.000001).
   Main limitations of the study
   Due to restrictive data security regulations to ensure anonymity in Ireland, specific ages could not be provided because of the relatively low absolute numbers of suicide in the Irish intervention and control region. Therefore, analyses of the interaction between gender and age could only be conducted for three of the four countries. Attempted suicides were assessed for patients presenting to emergency departments or treated in hospitals. An unknown rate of attempted suicides remained undetected. This may have caused an overestimation of the lethality of certain methods. Moreover, the detection of attempted suicides and the registration of completed suicides might have differed across the four countries. Some suicides might be hidden and misclassified as undetermined deaths.
   Conclusions
   Men more often used highly lethal methods in suicidal behaviour, but there was also a higher method-specific lethality which together explained the large gender differences in the lethality of suicidal acts. Gender differences in the lethality of suicidal acts were fairly consistent across all four European countries examined. Males and females did not differ in age at time of suicidal behaviour. Suicide attempts by males were rated as being more serious independent of the method used, with the exceptions of attempted hanging, suggesting gender differences in intentionality associated with suicidal behaviour. These findings contribute to understanding of the spectrum of reasons for gender differences in the lethality of suicidal behaviour and should inform the development of gender specific strategies for suicide prevention.

TI Optimizing Suicide Prevention Programs and Their Implementation in
   Europe (OSPI Europe): an evidence-based multi-level approach
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

AB Background: Suicide and non-fatal suicidal behaviour are significant public health issues in Europe requiring effective preventive interventions. However, the evidence for effective preventive strategies is scarce. The protocol of a European research project to develop an optimized evidence based program for suicide prevention is presented.
   Method: The groundwork for this research has been established by a regional community based intervention for suicide prevention that focuses on improving awareness and care for depression performed within the European Alliance Against Depression (EAAD). The EAAD intervention consists of (1) training sessions and practice support for primary care physicians, (2) public relations activities and mass media campaigns, (3) training sessions for community facilitators who serve as gatekeepers for depressed and suicidal persons in the community and treatment and (4) outreach and support for high risk and self-help groups (e.g. helplines). The intervention has been shown to be effective in reducing suicidal behaviour in an earlier study, the Nuremberg Alliance Against Depression. In the context of the current research project described in this paper (OSPI-Europe) the EAAD model is enhanced by other evidence based interventions and implemented simultaneously and in standardised way in four regions in Ireland, Portugal, Hungary and Germany.
   The enhanced intervention will be evaluated using a prospective controlled design with the primary outcomes being composite suicidal acts (fatal and non-fatal), and with intermediate outcomes being the effect of training programs, changes in public attitudes, guideline-consistent media reporting. In addition an analysis of the economic costs and consequences will be undertaken, while a process evaluation will monitor implementation of the interventions within the different regions with varying organisational and healthcare contexts.
   Discussion: This multi-centre research seeks to overcome major challenges of field research in suicide prevention. It pools data from four European regions, considerably increasing the study sample, which will be close to one million. In addition, the study will gather important information concerning the potential to transfer this multilevel program to other health care systems. The results of this research will provide a basis for developing an evidence-based, efficient concept for suicide prevention for EU-member states.

AB To screen and clinically interview European adolescents reporting current suicidality (suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) and investigate attendance at the clinical interview.
   The Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) Project was carried out in 11 European countries. A baseline questionnaire was completed in school by 12,395 adolescents (mean age 14.9; SD 0.9). Those who screened positive for suicidality (attempting suicide and/or serious suicidal ideation or plans) in the past 2 weeks were invited to a clinical interview with a mental health professional.
   Of the 12,395 adolescents, 4.2 % (n = 516) screened positive for current suicidality. The prevalence ranged from 1.1 % in Hungary to 7.7 % in Israel (p < 0.001). 37.6 % (n = 194) of those who screened positive subsequently attended the clinical interview. Female students were more likely to attend for interview (42.0 % versus 30.6 %, p = 0.010). The attendance rate varied considerably across countries, from 5.7 % in Italy to 96.7 % in France (p < 0.001). Improved attendance was associated with using school as the only interview setting (Mean attendance rate, MAR = 88 vs. 31 %, p = 0.006) and arranging the interview within 1 week of contacting the student (MAR = 64 vs. 23 %, p = 0.013). The greater the travel time to interview, the lower the attendance rate (Pearson's r = -0.64, p = 0.034). Independent of the variation by country, at the individual level, adolescents with more depressive symptoms and a recent suicide attempt more often attended for interview.
   A high rate of current suicidality was found amongst European adolescents. However, the majority of these displayed limited help-seeking behaviour. Future studies should investigate ways of making screening programmes and other interventions more acceptable and accessible to young people, especially young males.

TI Clinical features of depressed children and adolescents with various
   forms of suicidality
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID CHILDHOOD; RISK; BEHAVIOR; SYMPTOMS; DISORDER; IDEATION
AB Objective: To examine various forms of suicidality specified in DSM-IV and their clinical characteristics in a large sample of children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD).
   Method: Subjects included 553 children and adolescents (aged 7.0-14.9 years) recruited between April 2000 and December 2004 from 23 mental health facilities in Hungary. Subjects received standardized clinical evaluations and best-estimate consensus DSM-IV diagnoses of MDD. All subjects were in a current episode of MDD at their assessment date.
   Results: Approximately 68% of the sample had recurrent thoughts of death, 48% had suicidal ideation, 30% had suicide plan, and 12% had attempted suicide. Compared with nonsuicidal peers, suicidal children and adolescents were more severely depressed, had more depressive symptoms, and more likely had comorbid disorders. However, depressed children and adolescents with various forms of suicidality were very similar in clinical characteristics. Feelings of worthlessness, depressed mood, psychomotor agitation, and comorbid separation anxiety and conduct disorders were independent correlates of at least I form of suicidality. Only feelings of worthlessness was related to all 4 suicidal behaviors, after adjustment for other depressive symptoms, comorbid disorders, and demographics.
   Conclusion: Clinical characteristics differ between nonsuicidal and suicidal children and adolescents but are very similar across various forms of suicidality. Feelings of worthlessness may play a central role in the development of suicidal behavior. Interventions toward the enhancement of self-esteem and amelioration of underlying psychopathology may be crucial for the prevention of suicide attempts in depressed children and adolescents.

ID METHYLONE; DRIVERS
AB The role of stimulant designer drug consumption has been investigated in three fatal cases. In Case 1 the fatal outcome can be attributed to the come down phase following their application, as the blood and urine concentration of the designer drugs was low. In the second case arrhythmogenic effect of methylone was added to the right ventricular arrhythmogenic dysplasia of the patient and these two factors could lead to death. The suicide case (Case 3) was probably the consequence of the withdrawal effect of MDPV (methylenedioxypyrovalerone). The aim of this issue was to focus on some questions of forensic importance that arose in three autopsy cases where the consumption of amphetamine-like designer drugs could play a role in the fatal outcome.

TI Mortality and the relationship of somatic comorbidities to mortality in
   schizophrenia. A nationwide matched-cohort study
SO EUROPEAN PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Schizophrenia; Mortality; Comorbidity; Physical health; Suicide
AB Aim: We conducted a matched-cohort study to assess mortality in schizophrenia and the relationship of mortality with comorbid somatic conditions and suicide attempts.
   Method: A full-population register-based prospective matched-cohort study was performed including all eligible patients with schizophrenia in Hungary between 01/01/2005 and 31/12/2013. Control subjects were individually matched to patients with schizophrenia at a 5: 1 ratio. The principal outcome measure was death due to any reason. A non-parametric approach was used for descriptive statistical purposes, the Kaplan-Meier model for survival analysis, and the Cox proportional-hazards regression model for inferential statistics.
   Results: Patients with schizophrenia (n = 65,169) had substantially higher risk of all-cause mortality than the control subjects (n = 325,435) (RR = 2.4; P < 0.0001). Comorbidities and suicide attempts were associated with significantly increased mortality in both groups. As compared to the controls, 20-year old males with schizophrenia had a shorter life expectancy by 11.5 years, and females by 13.7 years; the analogous numbers for 45-year old schizophrenics were 8.1 and 9.6 years, respectively.
   Conclusions: A significant mortality gap - mainly associated with somatic comorbidities - was detected between patients with schizophrenia and individually matched controls. Improved medical training to address the disparity in mortality, and many other factors including lack of resources, access to and model of medical care, lifestyle, medication side effects, smoking, stigma, need for early intervention and adequate health care organization could help to better address the physical health needs of patients with schizophrenia.

   STAFF
AB Background: Community facilitators (CFs), such as teachers, nurses and social workers, are well placed as gatekeepers for depression and suicidal behavior, but not properly prepared to provide preventive and supportive services. The current study aimed: (1) to improve CFs' attitudes toward depression, knowledge on suicide, and confidence to detect suicidal behavior in four European countries and (2) to identify specific training needs across regions and CF groups.
   Methods: A standardized training program was provided to 1276 CFs in Germany, Hungary, Ireland, and Portugal. Attitudes toward depression, knowledge about suicide, and confidence in identifying suicidal persons were assessed before training, after training, and at three to six months follow-up. Additionally, several participants' characteristics were registered.
   Results: At baseline, CFs showed relatively favorable attitudes toward depression, but limited knowledge on suicide, and little confidence to identify suicidal behavior. Basic skills strongly differed across CF groups and countries. For example, in Germany, carers for the elderly, nurses, teachers, and managers were most in need of training, while in Portugal pharmacists and the clergy appeared to be important target groups. Most importantly, the training program improved the competencies of CF groups across countries and these improvements were sustained after three to six months. CFs with low basic skills benefited most of the training.
   Limitations: The observed training effects could be influenced by other external factors as our results are based upon a pre-post comparison with no control group.
   Conclusions: Gatekeeper trainings in community settings are successful in improving knowledge, reshaping attitudes, and boosting the confidence of gatekeepers. The most effective strategy to achieve the preferred objectives is to target those CF groups that are most in need of training and to tailor the content of the training program to the individual needs of the target group.

AB Background: Public attitudes toward depression and help-seeking behaviour are important factors influencing depressed people to obtain professional help and adequate treatment. OSPI-Europe is a multi-level suicide prevention programme including a public awareness campaign. It was implemented in four regions of four European countries (Germany, Hungary, Ireland and Portugal). This paper reports the results of the evaluation of the campaign, including its visibility and effects of the campaign on stigma associated with depression and help seeking behaviour.
   Methods: A representative general population survey (N = 4004) including measures on personal stigma, perceived stigma, openness to help, perceived value of help, and socio-demographic variables was conducted in the four intervention and four control regions in a cross-sectional pre-post design.
   Results: The public awareness campaign was considerably more visible in Germany and Portugal compared to Ireland and Hungary. Visibility was further affected by age and years of schooling. Personal stigma, perceived stigma and openness toward professional help varied significantly across the four countries. Respondents in the intervention regions showed significantly less personal depression stigma than respondents in the control regions after the campaign. Respondents of the intervention region who were aware of the campaign reported more openness toward seeking professional help than respondents who were unaware of it.
   Conclusion: The OSPI-Europe awareness campaign was visible and produced some positive results. At the same time, it proved to be difficult to show strong, measurable and unambiguous effects, which is in line with previous studies. Public awareness campaigns as conducted within OSPI-Europe can contribute to improved attitudes and knowledge about depression in the general public and produce synergistic effects, in particular when the dissemination of awareness campaign materials is simultaneously reinforced by other intervention levels of a multi-level intervention programme.
   Limitations: The survey was cross-sectional and based on self-report, so no causal inferences could be drawn.

AB Objective: We aimed to assess the causes of death, the mortality and survival time of MS patients in Hungary.
   Patients and methods: Between 1993 and 2013, 740 patients (10,303 person-years) were treated at our Outpatients' Clinic, of which 121 died. The causes of death were established from the pathological records or the medical certificates of the cause of death. The standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated. Survival time was assessed with Gehan-Breslow test.
   Results: Sixty-four percent of our patients died of MS-related causes. The SMR was 2.52. Primary progressive (PPMS) patients' SMR was higher (4.10) than initially relapsing patients' (RR/SPMS) was. There was no difference between the genders (2.46 for men vs 2.57 for women). The median survival time of woman was 3 years longer (p < 0.001). RR/SPMS patients' median survival (35 years) was more than twice as long as PPMS patients' (14 years).
   Discussion: The frequency of the MS-related cause of death, SMR and the median survival times were mostly similar to previous results from Scandinavia and North-America, despite the very different socio-economic backgrounds of these areas which shows that the survival risk can solely be attributed to MS itself. These are the first data on the topic from Central-Eastern-Europe. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The 'European Alliance Against Depression' community-based intervention approach simultaneously targets depression and suicidal behaviour by a multifaceted community based intervention and has been implemented in more than 115 regions worldwide. The two main aims of the European Union funded project "Optimizing Suicide Prevention Programmes and Their Implementation in Europe" were to optimise this approach and to evaluate its implementation and impact. This paper reports on the primary outcome of the intervention (the number of completed and attempted suicides combined as 'suicidal acts') and on results concerning process evaluation analysis. Interventions were implemented in four European cities in Germany, Hungary, Portugal and Ireland, with matched control sites. The intervention comprised activities with predefined minimal intensity at four levels: training of primary care providers, a public awareness campaign, training of community facilitators, support for patients and their relatives. Changes in frequency of suicidal acts with respect to a one-year baseline in the four intervention regions were compared to those in the four control regions (chi-square tests). The decrease in suicidal acts compared to baseline in the intervention regions (-58 cases, -3.26%) did not differ significantly (chi(2) = 0.13; p = 0.72) from the decrease in the control regions (-18 cases, -1.40%). However, intervention effects differed between countries (chi(2) = 8.59; p = 0.04), with significant effects on suicidal acts in Portugal (chi(2) = 4.82; p = 0.03). The interviews and observations explored local circumstances in each site throughout the study. Hypothesised mechanisms of action for successful implementation were observed and drivers for 'added-value' were identified: local partnership working and 'in-kind' contributions; an approach which valued existing partnership strengths; and synergies operating across intervention levels. It can be assumed that significant events during the implementation phase had a certain impact on the observed outcomes. However, this impact was, of course, not proven.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate trait-aggression, depression and suicidal behavior of drug dependent patients with and without ADHD symptoms. The cross sectional survey was conducted in outpatient drug centers in Hungary. The Adult Self-Report Scale (ASRS), the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), the European Version of the ADolescent Assessment Dialogue (EuroADAD), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used for measures. GLM analyses, adjusting for age and gender, indicated that patients who screened positive for ADHD (ADHD+ group) had significantly higher severity of overall trait aggression, as well as physical and verbal aggression than patients who did not (ADHD negative group). The highest severity of aggression was observed when the ADHD+ status co-occurred with heroin use, while the lowest severity of aggression was detected when ADHD - status co-occurred with the use of marijuana. ADHD+ patients showed a marked increase in depression symptoms, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts as well as self-injuries associated with suicidal attempts. Considering the substantial costs of aggression and suicide from a societal perspective and from the point of view of the individual sufferer, our results highlight the importance of the diagnostic investigation of ADHD in the treatment of drug dependent patients.

AB Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (aADHD) has recently been better recognized and treated in many European countries. In spite of this development, aADHD still features as a hidden comorbidity, often not diagnosed even in patients under psychiatric treatment for other psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence rates of unrecognized aADHD in academic centers providing regular psychiatric services in the Czech Republic and Hungary. In a population of psychiatric in-and outpatients, Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale was administered. All positively and about half of the negatively screened subjects were clinically interviewed and the DSM diagnosis of ADHD was determined based on the symptom list and Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale. The estimated point prevalence rate of unrecognized comorbid aADHD among psychiatric in-and out patients was 6.99% (95% lower CI: 5.11, 95% upper CI 8.86) according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria and 9.27% (95% lower CI: 7.13, 95% upper CI 11.40) according to the DSM-5 criteria. Current suicide risk was significantly associated with the presence of undiagnosed aADHD; however, life time suicide attempts, depression, dysthymia, alcohol and substance dependence, anxiety and stress related disorders were not. Further educational efforts are needed to improve the recognition and treatment of aADHD in adults

AB Few studies have addressed the association between alcohol consumption and homicide rates at the population level in eastern European countries. The aim of the present study was to test hypotheses on how this association may vary across countries with different drinking patterns and for gender specific homicide rates. Time series analysis was used on annual alcohol consumption and homicide rates for six eastern European countries. The estimates were pooled into two groups of countries with more (Russia and Belarus) and somewhat less (Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and former Czechoslovakia) hazardous drinking patterns. The overall results showed that annual changes in alcohol consumption were positively and significantly associated with homicide rates and also indicated that the estimates were stronger in countries with a more detrimental drinking pattern. The results suggest that alcohol consumption has an effect on homicide rates in Eastern Europe and that this effect varies with drinking pattern.

AB An estimated 800 000 suicide deaths occur worldwide. The global suicide rate is 11.4 per 100 000 population; 15.0/100 000 for males and 8.0/100 000 for females. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds. In a collaborative effort to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental health problems among youth across Europe, the European Union 7(th) Framework funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. SEYLE is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to promote mental health and healthy lifestyles, while preventing psychopathology and suicidal behaviours among adolescents. The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD +/- 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged >= 16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged <= 15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called `invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised risk behaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the `invisible' risk group with those in the high-risk group, similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%), subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%), depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32%, respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-injurious behaviours (D-SIB) was 27.6%, with higher rates reported for occasional D-SIB (19.7%) compared to repetitive D-SIB (7.8%). Suicidal ideation was present in approximately one third of the sample (32.3%). More than four percent (4.2%) of the sample reported attempting suicide during their lifetime, with a significantly higher prevalence among girls (5.1% vs. 3.0%, p<0.05). In comparing the effectiveness of the three active SEYLE interventions, based on three specific preventive strategies directed towards teachers and school staff, professionals and pupils in comparison to a control group, the intervention empowering pupils, called the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) showed significant results in preventing new cases of suicide attempts, severe suicidal ideation with plans and depression. More than a 50% reduction of incident cases of suicide attempts (OR: 0.45 [0.24 - 0.85]; p=0.014), and of incident cases of severe suicidal ideation and plans (OR: 0.50 [0.27 - 0.92]; p=0.025), as well as a significant reduction by 30% of incident cases with moderate to severe depression (OR: 0.71 [0.52- 0.97]; p=0.031) was observed.

AB Introduction: There is a worldwide rising tendency of women who decide to become physician. One of the most remarkable fields of investigation is the well-being of female doctors. Aim: To study the prevalence of somatic and reproductive morbidity in a representative sample of Hungarian female physicians and compare it with a control group of graduated women. Method: Data for this epidemiological study were collected from 2515 female physicians in 2013. Graduated women from a representative survey (Hungarostudy 2013) served as controls. The results were compared to the previous (2003-2004) representative female physicians' survey. Results: We found that the prevalence of chronic somatic morbidity among female physicians was significantly higher than that in the respective control groups. A larger proportion of female medical doctors were characterized by time-to-pregnancy interval longer than one year, and undergoing infertility therapy and miscarriages, compared to the control female population, while the same prevalence of terminations of pregnancy was found. Conclusions: The longitudinal perspective confirmed the existence of the "Hungarian female physicians' paradox".

AB The aim of this study was to investigate whether a relationship exists between a decreased level of meaning in life and smoking. In 2006, 341 Hungarian respondents (48.1% males, 51.9% females) completed a questionnaire that included the Purpose in Life test, a shortened version of the Aspiration Index and the Beck Depression Inventory, as well as questions about sociodemographic characteristics, past year alcohol and illicit drug consumption, and smoking behavior. The mean age of the participants was 33.0 years (SD = 14.6), while the average years of education of the respondents was 14.5 (SD = 2.7). According to the results of the regression analysis, meaning in life proved to be significant in differentiating between nonsmokers and daily smokers. With regard to the nonsmoker vs. occasional smoker and the daily vs. occasional smoker relationship, level of life meaning was not a significant predictor. The gender-meaning in life interaction was insignificant in all three relations. Limitations of this explorative investigation are noted.

AB The ligature mark is the most relevant feature of hanging. This study was undertaken with a view to determine the characteristic features of hanging and its association with ligature material or mode of suspension. Of a total medicolegal deaths reported at an Apex Medical Centre, hanging was noted in 4.1% cases, all suicidal with mortality rate of 1.5 per 100,000 population per year. The hanging was complete in 67.7% with nylon rope as the commonest type of ligature material used for ligation. The hanging mark was usually single, situated above thyroid cartilage, incomplete, prominent, and directed toward nape of neck. The mark of dribbling of saliva was seen in 11.8% cases. Facial congestion, petechial hemorrhage, and cyanosis were significantly seen in partial hanging. Though occasionally reported, the argent line was noted in 78.7% hanging deaths with neck muscle hemorrhage in 23.6% cases. Fracture of neck structure was predominant in complete hanging.

AB Although several studies have recently assessed direct self-injurious behavior (D-SIB) among adolescents, it is still understudied in adolescents attending vocational schools: an educational setting generally associated with lower socioeconomic status. After extending the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project to a vocational school population, we examined their D-SIB and life event characteristics compared to the high school population. SEYLE's Hungarian randomly selected high school sample (N = 995) was completed with a randomly selected vocational school sample (N = 140) in Budapest, Hungary. Participants aged 14-17 years completed the SEYLE project's self-administered questionnaires. D-SIB lifetime prevalence was significantly higher (29.4%) in the vocational school group compared to the high school group (17.2%) ((2)(1) = 12.231, p< 0.001). D-SIB was associated with suicidal ideation in the vocational school group. Different life events were more frequent in the high school than in the vocational school group, and associations between D-SIB and life events differed in the vocational school group compared to the high school group. In conclusion, vocational school students are a vulnerable population with a higher prevalence of D-SIB compared to high school students. Life events and their association with D-SIB also differ in vocational school students compared to high school students. Taking all these into account might contribute to prevention/intervention designed for this population.

AB Background A regulatory signal suggested that sertindole was associated with a 10-fold increased risk of death. This observational study aimed to identify deaths and their causes in patients treated with sertindole.
   Methods Sertindole-treated patients in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Hungary, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom were identified and their vital status ascertained. Eventual cause of death and patient and treatment characteristics were ascertained. A nested case-control study compared on-treatment cardiac or unexplained deaths with randomly selected survivors matched on age and gender for potential risk factors.
   Results Eight thousand six hundred eight patients were identified as having initiated treatment with sertindole, for a total 3819 person-years exposure. Thirty-five had died since (all-cause mortality rate 0.92 per 100 person-years exposed). Of these, 15 (43%) had been previously reported to the regulatory authorities. Eight deaths were suicides, of which 2 (25%) had been previously reported; 11 were cardiac deaths, of which 8 (73%) had been reported. On average, patients who died because of cardiac disorders were older, and patients who committed suicide were younger than the other patients who died. The nested case-control study revealed that patients receiving sertindole were at a higher risk of premature cardiac or unexplained death if they had hypertension or other cardiovascular disorders associated with diabetes or metabolic disorder.
   Conclusion Overall and cardiovascular death rates were similar or lower than those observed in premarketing clinical trials. There was a very high reporting rate of all-cause and cardiovascular deaths that could have contributed to the regulatory alert. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Background: Deliberate self-harm among young people is an important focus of policy and practice internationally. Nonetheless, there is little reliable comparative international information on its extent or characteristics. We have conducted a seven-country comparative community study of deliberate self-harm among young people. Method: Over 30,000 mainly 15- and 16-year-olds completed anonymous questionnaires at school in Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway. Study criteria were developed to identify episodes of self-harm; the prevalence of self-harm acts and thoughts, methods used, repetition, reasons given, premeditation, setting for the act, associations with alcohol and drugs, hospitalisation, and whether other people knew, were examined. Results: Self-harm was more than twice as common among females as males and, in four of the seven countries, at least one in ten females had harmed herself in the previous year. Additional young people had thought of harming themselves without doing so. More males and females in all countries except Hungary cut themselves than used any other method, most acts took place at home, and alcohol and illegal drugs were not usually involved. The most common reasons given were 'to get relief from a terrible state of mind' followed by 'to die', although there were differences between those cutting themselves and those taking overdoses. About half the young people decided to harm themselves in the hour before doing so, and many did not attend hospital or tell anyone else. Just over half those who had harmed themselves during the previous year reported more than one episode over their lifetime. Conclusions: Deliberate self-harm is a widespread yet often hidden problem in adolescents, especially females, which shows both similarities and differences internationally.

AB There is evidence to suggest that both psychological characteristics and stressful life events are contributory factors in deliberate self-harm among young people. These links, and the possibility of a dose-response relationship between self-harm and both psychological health and life events, were investigated in the context of a seven-country school-based study. Over 30,000, mainly 15 and 16 year olds, completed anonymous questionnaires at secondary schools in Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and Australia. Pupils were asked to report on thoughts and episodes of self-harm, complete scales on depression and anxiety symptoms, impulsivity and self-esteem and indicate stressful events in their lives. Level and frequency of self-harm was judged according to whether they had thought about harming themselves or reported single or multiple self-harm episodes. Multinomial logistic regression assessed the extent to which psychological characteristics and stressful life events distinguished between adolescents with different self-harm histories. Increased severity of self-harm history was associated with greater depression, anxiety and impulsivity and lower self-esteem and an increased prevalence of all ten life event categories. Female gender, higher impulsivity and experiencing the suicide or self-harm of others, physical or sexual abuse and worries about sexual orientation independently differentiated single-episode self-harmers from adolescents with self-harm thoughts only. Female gender, higher depression, lower self-esteem, experiencing the suicide or self-harm of others, and trouble with the police independently distinguished multiple- from single-episode self-harmers. The findings reinforce the importance of psychological characteristics and stressful life events in adolescent self-harm but nonetheless suggest that some factors are more likely than others to be implicated.

AB ObjectivesTo investigate the prevalence and associated psychosocial factors of occasional and repetitive direct self-injurious behavior (D-SIB), such as self-cutting, -burning, -biting, -hitting, and skin damage by other methods, in representative adolescent samples from 11 European countries.
   MethodsCross-sectional assessment of adolescents was performed within the European Union funded project, Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE), which was conducted in 11 European countries. The representative sample comprised 12,068 adolescents (F/M: 6,717/5,351; mean age: 14.90.89) recruited from randomly selected schools. Frequency of D-SIB was assessed by a modified 6-item questionnaire based on previously used versions of the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI). In addition, a broad range of demographic, social, and psychological factors was assessed.
   ResultsOverall lifetime prevalence of D-SIB was 27.6%; 19.7% reported occasional D-SIB and 7.8% repetitive D-SIB. Lifetime prevalence ranged from 17.1% to 38.6% across countries. Estonia, France, Germany, and Israel had the highest lifetime rates of D-SIB, while students from Hungary, Ireland, and Italy reported low rates. Suicidality as well as anxiety and depressive symptoms had the highest odds ratios for both occasional and repetitive D-SIB. There was a strong association of D-SIB with both psychopathology and risk-behaviors, including family related neglect and peer-related rejection/victimization. Associations between psychosocial variables and D-SIB were strongly influenced by both gender and country. Only a minor proportion of the adolescents who reported D-SIB ever received medical treatment.
   ConclusionThese results suggest high lifetime prevalence of D-SIB in European adolescents. Prevalence as well as psychosocial correlates seems to be significantly influenced by both gender and country. These results support the need for a multidimensional approach to better understand the development of SIB and facilitate culturally adapted prevention/intervention.

DT Article
DE Ludwig Haberlandt; temporary hormonal contraception; pill
AB Ludwig Haberlandt (1 February 1885 - 22 July 1932), pioneer in hormonal contraception, was born in Graz, where he graduated from the university in 1909 in medicine summa cum laude and began his career as a physiologist. The idea of temporary hormonal contraception in the female body entered his mind in February 1919, when he was already Professor of Physiology in Innsbruck. He pursued his project ambitiously and by 1921 demonstrated temporary hormonal contraception in a female animal by transplanting ovaries from a second, pregnant, animal. From 1923, after further successful scientific work in this field, he began highlighting the importance of clinical trials in presentations. From then, he was criticized by his colleagues, who accused him of hindering unborn life. His idea was contradictory to the moral, ethic, religious and political agendas of that time in Europe. In 1927 official reports escalated, his family was ostracized by the local population, and Ludwig Haberlandt refused any further interviews. Against all opposition, in 1930 he began clinical trials after successful production of a hormonal preparation, Infecundin(A (R)), by the G. Richter Company in Budapest, Hungary. Although at the peak of his scientific career, he was unable to pursue other scientific agendas because of the disputed contraception project. After he committed suicide, on 22 July 1932, scientific discussion about hormonal contraception ceased until 1970 when scientists began referring to his earlier medical and scientific work.

AB The present study examines reasons for adolescent deliberate self-harm. A cross-sectional survey using an anonymous self-report questionnaire was carried out in seven countries (Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway). Data on 30,477 school pupils between the ages of 14-17 were analysed. Past year and lifetime deliberate self-harm were assessed, along with the self-reported reasons for deliberate self-harm. The results showed that 'wanted to get relief from a terrible state of mind' and 'wanted to die' were most commonly reported. Principal component analysis indicated two underlying dimensions in the reasons for deliberate self-harm, i.e. a cry of pain motive and/or a cry for help motive. The majority of self-harmers reported at least one cry of pain motive ('to die', 'to punish myself', and 'to get relief from a terrible state of mind') and an additional cry for help motive ('to show how desperate I was feeling', to frighten someone', 'to get my own back on someone', 'to find out whether someone really loved me', and 'to get some attention'). Females reported more reasons than males. Only females showed an age difference, with girls aged 16-17 more frequently reporting a cry for help motive. There was considerable consistency in choice of motives across countries and genders. Systematic assessment of the reasons for deliberate self-harm can help clinicians to better understand the meaning of self harming behaviour, select appropriate treatment, suggest alternative coping strategies, and hopefully prevent future suicidal behaviour.

AB The purpose of this study is to describe the characteristics of female children who experience sexual abuse and explore common features that may assist in developing prevention strategies.
   Between 1990 and 2010, 266 girls under the age of 18 years, suspected of being sexually abused, visited the Department of Adolescent Gynecology. We retrospectively collected data illustrating the features of all cases. Seventy-eight percent of the victims were primary school students, and 45% of them were between 11 and 14 years of age.
   The perpetrator knew the victim in 67% of the cases and was a stranger in 33%. Seventy-five (28%) perpetrators were members of the victims' families. In 14% of cases, the perpetrator was the victim's father and in 9% her stepfather. The abuse had occurred on multiple occasions in 29% of the cases. The occurrence rate of abuse was highest in the summer season (54%). As much as 63% of children experienced vaginal penetration, while 37% experienced a variety of sexual contact that did not involve penetration. Eighty-five victims were physically injured, and in 40 cases the presence of sperm was confirmed in vulvo-vaginal smears. A high proportion of female child sexual abuse takes place within the family and is revealed only after multiple episodes. The true prevalence of sexual abuse is being appreciated now that Hungarian law and society have recognized this societal problem.
   Prevention requires a systematic and lifelong approach to educating children about personal space and privacy and is the responsibility of parents and professionals.

AB Background: The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible association between attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) with special focus on the role of comorbidities and gender in a clinical sample of adolescents with both a dimensional and a categorical approach to psychopathology.
   Methods: Using a structured interview, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Kid and a self-rated questionnaire, the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory, the authors examined 202 inpatient adolescents (aged: 1318 years) in the Vadaskert Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Hospital and Outpatient Clinic, Budapest, Hungary. Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test and mediator model were used.
   Results: Fifty-two adolescents met full criteria for ADHD and a further 77 showed symptoms of ADHD at the subthreshold level. From the 52 adolescents diagnosed with ADHD, 35 (67.30%) had NSSI, of whom there were significantly more girls than boys, boys: n = 10 (28.60%), girls: n = 25 (71.40%) ((chi(2)(1) = 10.643 p < .001 phi=.452). Multiple mediation analyses resulted in a moderated mediation model in which the relationship between symptoms of ADHD and the prevalence of current NSSI was fully mediated by the symptoms of comorbid conditions in both sex. Significant mediators were the symptoms of affective and psychotic disorders and suicidality in both sexes and the symptoms of alcohol abuse/dependence disorders in girls.
   Conclusions: ADHD symptoms are associated with an increased risk of NSSI in adolescents, especially in the case of girls. Our findings suggest that clinicians should routinely screen for the symptoms of ADHD and comorbidity, with a special focus on the symptoms of affective disorders and alcohol abuse/dependence psychotic symptoms to prevent NSSI.

AB Background: Female doctors in Hungary have worse indicators of physical and mental health compared with other professional women. We aimed to cast light on possible indicators of mental health, workload, and burnout of female physicians.
   Methods: Two time-points (T) were compared, in 2003 (T1 n = 408) and 2013 (T2 n = 2414), based on two nationally representative surveys of female doctors, and comparison made with data from other professional control groups. Independent samples t test or chi-squared test was used both for the two time-point comparison and the comparison between the index and the control groups. The background factors of sleep disorders and burnout were assessed by binary logistic regression analysis.
   Results: No significant differences in the rates of depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts and attempts were detected between the 2003 and 2013 cohorts, but the prevalence of sleep disorders increased. The workload increased, and there was less job satisfaction in 2013 than in 2003, coupled to more stressful or difficult work-related situations. The personal accomplishment component of burnout significantly decreased in line with the declining work-related satisfaction. Compared to the professional control groups, the prevalence of depressive symptoms, suicide attempts, and sleep disorders was higher among female physicians at both time-points. The number of workplaces, frequency of work-related stressful situations, and intensive role conflict was associated with sleep disorders and decreased personal accomplishment.
   Conclusions: In comparison with the other professional groups, female doctors had worse mental health indicators with regard to depression, suicidal ideas, and sleep disorders both in 2003 and 2013 while within professional strata the changes seemed to be less. Increasing workload had a clear impact on sleep disorders and the personal accomplishment dimension of burnout.

AB Objective To compare the drowning mortality rates and proportion of deaths of each intent among all drowning deaths in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in 2012-2014.
   Design A population-based cross-sectional study.
   Setting 32 OECD countries.
   Participants Individuals in OECD countries who died from drowning.
   Main outcome measures Drowning mortality rates (deaths per 100000 population) and proportion (%) of deaths of each intent (ie, unintentional intent, intentional self-harm, assault, undetermined intent and all intents combined) among all drowning deaths.
   Results Countries with the highest drowning mortality rates (deaths per 100000 population) were Estonia (3.53), Japan (3.49) and Greece (2.40) for unintentional intent; Ireland (0.96), Belgium (0.96) and Korea (0.89) for intentional self-harm; Austria (0.57), Korea (0.56) and Hungary (0.44) for undetermined intent and Japan (4.35), Estonia (3.70) and Korea (2.73) for all intents combined. Korea ranked 12th and 3rd for unintentional intent and all intents combined, respectively. By contrast, Belgium ranked 2nd and 15th for intentional self-harm and all intents combined, respectively. The proportion of deaths of each intent among all drowning deaths in each country varied greatly: from 26.2% in Belgium to 96.8% in Chile for unintentional intent; 0.7% in Mexico to 57.4% in Belgium for intentional self-harm; 0.0% in nine countries to 4.9% in Mexico for assault and 0.0% in Israel and Turkey to 38.3% in Austria for undetermined intent.
   Conclusions A large variation in the practice of classifying undetermined intent in drowning deaths across countries was noted and this variation hinders valid international comparisons of intent-specific (unintentional and intentional self-harm) drowning mortality rates.

SO EPIDEMIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID NEW-ZEALAND; HEALTH INEQUALITIES; VALUE-JUDGMENTS
AB Background: Holistic depiction of time-trends in average mortality rates, and absolute and relative inequalities, is challenging.
   Methods: We outline a typology for situations with falling average mortality rates (m down arrow; e.g., cardiovascular disease), rates stable over time (m-; e.g., some cancers), and increasing average mortality rates (m up arrow; e.g., suicide in some contexts). If we consider inequality trends on both the absolute (a) and relative (r) scales, there are 13 possible combination of m, a, and r trends over time. They can be mapped to graphs with relative inequality (log relative index of inequality [RII]; r) on the y axis, log average mortality rate on the x axis (m), and absolute inequality (slope index of inequality; SII; a) as contour lines. We illustrate this by plotting adult mortality trends: (1) by household income from 1981 to 2011 for New Zealand, and (2) by education for European countries.
   Results: Types range from the "best" m down arrow a down arrow r down arrow (average, absolute, and relative inequalities all decreasing; southwest movement in graphs) to the "worst" m up arrow a up arrow r up arrow (northeast). Mortality typologies in New Zealand (all-cause, cardiovascular disease, nonlung cancer, and unintentional injury) were all m down arrow r up arrow (northwest), but variable with respect to absolute inequality. Most European typologies were m down arrow r up arrow types (northwest; e.g., Finland), but with notable exceptions of m-a up arrow r up arrow (north; e.g., Hungary) and "best" or southwest m down arrow a down arrow r down arrow for Spain (Barcelona) females.
   Conclusions: Our typology and corresponding graphs provide a convenient way to summarize and understand past trends in inequalities in mortality, and hold potential for projecting future trends and target setting.

   TESTOSTERONE; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Background: The highly prevalent parasitic infection of humans, toxoplasmosis, can have serious consequences even during an asymptomatic course of the disease. The causative agente of infection is Toxoplasma gondii, which proliferates in the intestine of cats. Risk of infection by direct contact with cats is low, but the infection can occur due to contaminated soil, water, unwashed vegetables and fruits, as well as insufficiently heat-treated meat.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to synthesize the current knowledge about infection caused by Toxoplasma gondii in a brief review focusing on latent toxoplasmosis in humans.
   Materials and Methods: More than hundred articles, studies and reports from scientific journals were considered to summarize the infection's characteristics such as prevalence and symptoms in humans.
   Results and Discussion: The symptoms of acute toxoplasmosis are either featureless, or non-existent, although, for people with immunosuppression it can be fatal, and for expectants it can result in foetal harm. The detection of the infection is conducted with serology methods, however, only in a few European countries are general screenings present. The asymptomatic carrier state is dangerous as well, because the cysts subsist in the brain of the host, which affects behaviour, the regulation of emotions, and also the level of several hormones. The latent toxoplasmosis can be connected to aggression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar personality disorder, suicidal inclination, depression, and the reduction in intelligence quotient. For the reason of the deterioration of reaction time, the disease increases the risk of traffic accidents. The latent toxoplasmosis also influences personality traits; for women and men the alteration of the personality change differs. There is no data on the current epidemiological situation in Hungary, and not even in Europe. A research regarding the extent of asymptomatic carrier state and about the psychological changes in the Hungarian population has not been conducted so far.

AB Mental disorders constitute an increasingly important public health problem in the general population. Therefore, investigation of the determinants and state of mental health of those who will be treating patients, that is, future medical doctors, is justified. The paper gives an account of a mental health survey of medical students at a university in Hungary.
   A representative sample of year I-V students (N = 100) filled an anonymous standardized self-administered questionnaire that included demographic and socioeconomic items, mental well-being characterized by a sense of coherence (SOC) and psychological distress, as well as health behaviour. SOC was measured by the 13-item Antonovsky questionnaire and psychological distress was measured by the 12-item general health questionnaire (GHQ). Models for estimating mental well-being in relation to various determinants were built by backward stepwise regression.
   Almost one-fifth of the students scored above the strict threshold on the GHQ indicating notable psychological distress. SOC showed significant positive correlation with perceived health and significant negative correlation with psychological distress. SOC and psychological distress were determined by different sets of explanatory variables in the regression models. Psychological distress and the use of sedative without medical prescription are inversely related to SOC; whereas social support and female gender show positive correlation to SOC according to our estimation. SOC, as expected, was a strong explanatory variable for psychological distress, forecasting an improvement in the GHQ score.
   Psychological distress was significantly greater in our sample of Hungarian medical students than in the same age group of the general population. Psychological distress is strongly related to SOC and can be estimated by our proposed models. Both SOC and psychological distress can be used to characterize the mental health of future medical doctors, the improvement of which needs attention even during their training.

AB Background: There are few surveys of antenatal depression and anxiety in Eastern-European countries. The aim of the present study was to gather prevalence data from a Hungarian sample and to search for associations between antenatal depression/anxiety and some psycho-social variables.
   Subjects and methods: A population-based monitoring system was created, covering every pregnant woman in the town of Szombathely, Western-Hungary for symptoms of depression and anxiety during the first trimester of pregnancy. Data were gathered in the period February 1, 2008 - February 1, 2010. Five-hundred and three pregnant women were included in the sample under survey.
   Results: Mean age of our participants was 29.8 yr. (SD=4.94/). One fifth (19.9%; 95%CI = 16.6-23.6) of pregnant women were suffering from mild to severe depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory. Frequency of severe depression was low (1.4%). 14.2% of the sample (95%CI = 11.5-17.6) showed signs of trait anxiety as measured by the Spielberger Inventory. Mean scores for depression and anxiety proved to be significantly higher among women who were unemployed, less than 20 years of age, having low educational or/and socio-economic status, and displaying higher level of social mistrust. Those living in common-law marriage had more depressive symptoms while reciprocity was associated only to anxiety.
   Conclusions: Except for prevalence of severe depression, our data did not differ from prevalence found in market economic countries. Teen age, unfavourable socio-economic conditions and high social mistrust were associated with the emergence of clinically meaningful depression and anxiety during the first trimester of pregnancy.

AB Background: Mental health problems and risk behaviours among young people are of great public health concern. Consequently, within the VII Framework Programme, the European Commission funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in eleven European countries, with Sweden as the coordinating centre, and was designed to identify an effective way to promote mental health and reduce suicidality and risk taking behaviours among adolescents.
   Objective: To describe the methodological and field procedures in the SEYLE RCT among adolescents, as well as to present the main characteristics of the recruited sample.
   Methods: Analyses were conducted to determine: 1) representativeness of study sites compared to respective national data; 2) response rate of schools and pupils, drop-out rates from baseline to 3 and 12 month follow-up, 3) comparability of samples among the four Intervention Arms; 4) properties of the standard scales employed: Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (Z-SAS), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), World Health Organization Well-Being Scale (WHO-5).
   Results: Participants at baseline comprised 12,395 adolescents (M/F: 5,529/6,799; mean age=14.9 +/- 0.9) from Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain. At the 3 and 12 months follow up, participation rates were 87.3% and 79.4%, respectively. Demographic characteristics of participating sites were found to be reasonably representative of their respective national population. Overall response rate of schools was 67.8%. All scales utilised in the study had good to very good internal reliability, as measured by Cronbach's alpha (BDI-II: 0.864; Z-SAS: 0.805; SDQ: 0.740; WHO-5: 0.799).
   Conclusions: SEYLE achieved its objective of recruiting a large representative sample of adolescents within participating European countries. Analysis of SEYLE data will shed light on the effectiveness of important interventions aimed at improving adolescent mental health and well-being, reducing risk-taking and self-destructive behaviour and preventing suicidality.
