AB The controversy regarding the direct relationship between income distribution and health remains unresolved. Empirical evidence has often failed to advance our understanding because in the countries studied there was limited ability to distinguish hypotheses. This study examines the relation between inequality and mortality in the context of Costa Rica. Costa Rica's unique social and political structure makes confounding through resource and political channels less likely, thus any effects would work predominantly through direct psychosocial channels. Using mortality data extracted from the Vital Statistics Registry, we evaluate the longitudinal relations between lagged and contemporaneous income inequality and cause-specific mortality in Costa Rica from 1995 to 2005. For those aged 15-60, results indicate that there is a significant adverse relation between increases in lagged inequality and mortality from liver disease, and marginal adverse relations with mortality from diabetes and suicide. For those aged 60 and over, there is a limited evidence of a relation between inequality and health. These results suggest increases in inequality may impact health behavior of the working aged population in Costa Rica. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Backgrounds: With the intention of establishing economic inequities, the article analyzes the variations of the Unnecessarily Premature and Sanitarily Avoidable Mortality (MIPSE) of each of the 81 cantons of Costa Rica during 2000-2005. It is important to identify those inequities, to establish policies and strategies trying to mitigate them.
   Method: It applies the MIPSE classification proposed by members of the Information and Studies Service, of the Catalunya's Sanitary Resources Headquarter, Spain. By an Indicator of Socioeconomic Development (IDSE) of a University of Costa Rica economist's team, it organised each canton in groups of quintiles (I for the richest, V. for the poorest), previous people standardization.
   Results: We found as a major causes of mortality MIPSE in the country: Heart Isquemic Disease (19,55% MIPSE causes), Traffic Accidents with Motor Vehicles (11,60%), Brain Vascular Disease (6,95%), Perinatal (6,92%) and Suicide (5,14%).
   Conclusion: The VIH infection - AIDS mortality, the Best Cancer in Women, Uterus Cancer, Skin Cancer and Hepatic Disease Secondary to Alcohol Consumption, affects more the cantons with better financial conditions and the Prostate Benign Hyperplasia mortality, Mothers mortality related with Pregnancy, Childbirth or Puerperal Stage and the Abdominal Hernia mortality, affects more to those with worst economic level. Two MIPSE groups were identified with similar inequality: Leukaemia and Congenital Cardiovascular Disease.

AB Objective. To compare the prevalence of bullying victimization, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts, and negative health behaviors (current tobacco use, recent heavy alcohol use, truancy, involvement in physical fighting, and unprotected sexual intercourse) in five different Latin American countries and determine the association of bullying victimization with these outcomes, exploring both bullying type and frequency.
   Methods. Study data were from Global School-based Student Health Surveys from Bolivia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Peru, and Uruguay, which covered nationally representative samples of school-going adolescents. The surveys used a two-stage clustered sample design, sampling schools and then classrooms. Logistic regression models were run to determine the statistical significance of associations with bullying.
   Results. Among the 14 560 school-going adolescents included in this study, the prevalence of any bullying victimization in the past 30 days was 37.8%. Bullying victimization was associated with greater odds of suicidal ideation with planning (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 3.12; P < 0.0001) and at least one suicide attempt (AOR: 3.07; P < 0.0001). An increasing exposure-response effect of increasing days of bullying victimization on suicide outcomes was also observed. Bullying victimization was associated with higher odds of current tobacco use (AOR: 2.14; P < 0.0001); truancy (AOR: 1.76; P < 0.0001); physical fighting (AOR: 2.40; P < 0.0001); and unprotected sexual intercourse (AOR: 1.77; P < 0.0001).
   Conclusions. Although the prevalence of bullying victimization varied by country, its association with suicidal ideation and behavior and negative health behaviors remained relatively consistent. Addressing bullying needs to be made a priority in Latin America, and an integrated approach that also includes mental and physical health promotion is needed.

TI Association of Serotonin Transporter Promoter Gene Polymorphism
   (5-HTTLPR) With Depression in Costa Rican Schizophrenic Patients

DT Article
DE depression; schizophrenia; serotonin transporter gene; suicidal behavior
ID SUICIDAL-BEHAVIOR; MENTAL-ILLNESS; STRESS; MODERATION; EVENTS; RISK;
   INTERVIEW; SYMPTOMS; DISORDER
AB Depression and suicidal behavior are frequently observed in patients with schizophrenia. The serotonin transporter protein regulates serotonergic signaling at synapses and is encoded by a single gene (SLC6A4; Locus Link ID: 6532), located at 17q11.1-q12 with two polymorphic variants (the short and the long allele). The short allele of serotonin transporter gene has been associated with depression and suicidality in individuals who suffered negative life events and with depression in individuals with chronic psychosis.. Subjects were recruited from a genetic study of schizophrenia conducted in Costa Rica. The authors replicated their previous research, using a more narrow phenotype (only schizophrenic subjects) and a more ethnically homogenous sample (only Costa Rican schizophrenic individuals who were not included in the previous study). The authors hypothesized that subjects with at least one copy of the serotonin transporter promoter gene polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) "s" allele would have a greater history of lifetime depression and suicidability rate than those who had an "l/l" genotype. The authors analyzed 155 subjects with a DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) diagnosis of schizophrenia (73% male, age at interview 38.3, SD = 11.23). The genotype distribution was "ss" 58 (37%), "sl" 69 (45%), and "ll" 28 (18%). In the secondary analysis, the authors explored association of the "s" allele with lifetime history of suicide behavior in 173 subjects (18 more subjects than primary analysis because schizophrenic individuals were included regardless of history of depression). The authors found that subjects carrying at least one short allele had a significant increased lifetime risk for depressive syndromes (chi(2) = 5.4, df = 1, P = 0.02; odds ratio [ OR] = 2.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-6.3). No association was found for suicidal behavior in the same sample (chi(2) = 0.928, P = 0.629). In conclusion, the genotype at the 5-HTTLPR promoter polymorphic locus increases the risk of developing major depression but not suicidal behavior during the course of the schizophrenia in these patients. Due to the small sample size, these results should be followed by definitive replication.

AB Objectives Neuropsychiatric disorders and increased suicide rates have been associated with exposure to cholinesterase inhibiting organophosphates. This study examined symptoms of psychological distress, including suicidal ideation, among banana workers in Costa Rica previously exposed to a cholinesterase inhibiting pesticide.
   Methods 78 workers who had received medical attention 1-3 years previously for occupational pesticide poisoning were recruited: 54 had been exposed to organophosphate, 24 to carbamate, and 43 and 35, respectively, had single and multiple poisoning episodes with a cholinesterase inhibitor. Referents were 130 non-poisoned workers randomly selected from company payrolls. Psychological distress symptoms during the month prior to interview were obtained using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), which has a general severity index and nine subscale scores. Differences in abnormal BSI scores (T score >= 63) were assessed through multivariate logistic regression for all poisoned and for subcategories of poisoned as compared to non-poisoned workers.
   Results Organophosphate poisoned workers reported significantly more symptoms than non-poisoned on all but one symptom dimension. Significant trends of increasing symptoms with increasing number of previous poisonings were seen for somatisation, obsessive-compulsiveness, interpersonal sensitivity, depression and anxiety. Carbamate poisoned workers only had increased scores for somatisation. The ORs for suicidal thoughts were: all poisoned 3.58 (95% CI 1.45 to 8.84); organophosphate poisoned 3.72 (1.41 to 9.81); carbamate poisoned 2.57 (0.73 to 9.81); and 2.65 and 4.98, respectively for 1 and >= 2 poisonings (trend p=0.01).
   Conclusions This cross-sectional study showed a relationship between acute occupational poisoning with organophosphates and psychological distress including suicidal ideation. Stronger designs are needed to address causality.
