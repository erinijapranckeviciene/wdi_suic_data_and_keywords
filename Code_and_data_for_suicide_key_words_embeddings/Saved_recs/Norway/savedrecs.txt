AB Background and aim: The Nordic countries provide a suitable setting for comparing trends in suicide mortality. The aim of this report is to compare suicide trends by age, gender, region and methods in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden 1980-2009. Methods: Suicide statistics 1980-2009 were analyzed for men and women aged 15 years and above and the age group 15-24 years. Regional suicide rates in 2009 were presented in maps. Results: The suicide rates across the Nordic countries declined from 25-50 per 100,000 in 1980 to 20-36 in 2009 for men and from 9-26 in 1980 to 8-11 in 2009 for women. The rates in Finland were consistently higher than those of the other countries. A significant increase of suicides in young women in Finland and Norway and a lack of a decline among young women in Sweden were noted. The male-female ratio of suicide converged to approximately 3:1 across the region during the study period. Rural areas in Finland, Norway and Sweden saw the highest suicide rates, whereas the rates in the capital regions of Denmark, Norway and Sweden were lower than the respective national rates. Conclusions: We hold that the overall decline of suicide rates in the Nordic countries reflects the socio-economic development and stability of the region, including the well-functioning healthcare. The increasing rates in Finland and Norway and the unchanged rate in Sweden of suicide in young women are an alarming trend break that calls for continued monitoring.

AB Background: There may be various reasons for differences in suicide rates between countries and over time within a country. One reason can be different registration practices. Aims: The purpose of this study was to describe and compare the present procedures for mortality and suicide registration in the three Scandinavian countries and to illustrate potential sources of error in the registration of suicide. Method: Information about registration practices and classification procedures was obtained from the cause of death registers in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. In addition, we received information from experts in the field in each country. Results: Sweden uses event of undetermined intent more frequently than Denmark does, and Denmark more frequently than Norway. There seems to be somewhat more uncertainty among deaths classified as ill-defined and unknown cause of mortality in Norway, compared with the other two countries. Sweden performs more forensic autopsies than Norway, and Norway more than Denmark. In Denmark, in cases of a suspected unnatural manner of death, a thorough external examination of the deceased is performed. Conclusion: Differences in the classification of causes of death and in postmortem examinations exist in Scandinavian countries. These differences might influence the suicide statistics in Scandinavia.

AB Using Norway 1948-2004 as a case, I test whether changes in variables related to social integration can explain changes in suicide rates. The method is the Box-Jenkins approach to time-series analysis. Different aspects of family integration contribute significantly to the explanation of Norwegian suicide rates in this period. The estimated effect of separations is stronger than the effect of divorces, both for men and women, probably because separations are closer in time to the "real" marital breakup. This difference has not been demonstrated in earlier time-series research. Marriages decrease the suicide rates for males. The unemployment estimate for men has a negative sign, contributing to fewer suicides. Both increasing alcohol (beer) consumption and fewer marriages seem to be implicated in the soaring suicide rate for young men since 1970.

AB Self-reported suicidal behavior and attitudes toward suicide in psychology students are reported and compared in Ghana, Uganda, and Norway. Small differences only were found in own suicidal behavior. However, experience of suicidal behavior in the surroundings was more common in Uganda than in Ghana and Norway. Although differences were found between the three countries in attitudes toward suicide, which emphasizes the need for culture-sensitive research and prevention, many of the differences were not as big as expected. The most pronounced difference was that the Norwegian students were more reluctant to take a stand on these questions compared to their African counterparts. Some differences were also found between the two African countries. The implications of the results for suicide prevention in Africa are discussed.

AB Suicide mortality was examined between 1970 and 1998 in a cohort of 19,801 persons categorized as indigenous Sami in Arctic Norway. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated using the suicide rates of the rural population of Arctic Norway as reference. There was a significant moderate increased risk for suicide among indigenous Sami (SMR = 1.27, 95% Confidence interval (CI): 1.02-1.56). In the study period, 89 suicides occurred in the cohort (70 men and 19 women) with increased suicide mortality both for indigenous Sami males (SMR = 1.27; 95% CI: 0.99-1.61) and females (SMR = 1.27; 95% CI: 0.77-1.99). Significant increased suicide mortality was found for young Sami aged 15-24 for both males (SMR = 1.82; 95% CI: 1.13-2.78) and females (SMR = 3.17; 95% CI: 1.17-6.91). Significant increased suicide mortality was found for indigenous Sami males residing in Sami core area (SMR = 1.54; 95% CI: 1.04-2.20) and for indigenous Sami males not belonging to semi-nomadic reindeer herding (SMR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.00-1.65). Clusters of suicides in Sami core area may explain the increased suicide mortality found in subgroups among indigenous Sami.

AB Suicide mortality among immigrant groups is an important health issue, particularly in countries with growing segments of immigrant populations such as Norway. Through linkage of Norwegian national registers we wanted to estimate suicide rates (per 100,000 population) in immigrant groups and to profile characteristics of suicide by immigration background with respect to sex, age, method and seasonality of suicide as well as time since immigrating to Norway. Among all 11,409 suicides during 1992-2012, 1,139 (10%) were individuals with an immigration background. Suicide rate was lower in first-generation immigrants (foreign-born persons to two foreign-born parents) than native Norwegians (9.53 vs 12.22, P < 0.01), with a significant difference confined to male rates only. Foreign-born persons with at least one Norwegian-born parent had significantly higher suicide rates than natives in both sexes (22.42 vs 18.03 in males, 11.67 vs 6.54 in females, P < 0.01). The most frequently used suicide method in all the population groups was hanging; this method accounted for 44.0% of all suicides of first-generation immigrants, 45.2% of all suicides of foreign-born persons with at least one Norwegian-born parent, and 35.4% of all suicides of natives. Suicide by firearms accounted for a much smaller proportion of cases of first-generation immigrants (6.7%) and foreign-born persons with at least one Norwegian-born parent (6.8%) than cases of native Norwegians (20.7%). In terms of monthly distribution, suicides of first-generation immigrants displayed two peaks, in May and in November (P= 0.01). More than 25% of all first-generation immigrant suicides occurred in the first five years after immigration; but differences in time since immigration were observed by sex and country group of origin, in particular among those aged 35 years or less when moving to Norway. In conclusion, there are notable differences in characteristics of suicides by immigration background. Knowledge of immigrant mortality according to suicide method, seasonality of suicide, and time since immigration may be useful when planning suicide preventive measures.

AB Purpose Suicide risk is reportedly higher for cancer patients than for the general population, but estimates vary and analyses of trends are few. The aim of the present study was to determine whether cancer patients had a higher suicide risk between 1960 and 1999.
   Patients and Methods A cohort comprising patients from the Cancer Registry of Norway 1960 to 1997 was linked to suicide diagnosis in the Register of Deaths at Statistics Norway and observed during 1960 to 1999. The cohort consisted of all cancer patients registered in the Cancer Registry of Norway 1960 to 1997 (N = 490,245 patients with 520,823 cancer diagnoses). Suicide was defined according to death certificates based on the International Classification of Diseases (versions 7, 8, 9, and 10).
   Results During the period, 589 cancer patients (407 males and 182 females) committed suicide. The relative risk was elevated for males and females, with standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) of 1.55 (95% Cl, 1.41 to 1.71) and 1.35 (95% Cl, 1.17 to 1.56), respectively. Risk was highest in the first months after diagnosis. For both sexes, there was a significant decrease in the relative suicide risk over decades. The risk was markedly increased among male patients with cancer of respiratory organs (SMR, 4.08; 95% Cl, 2.96 to 5.47). Otherwise, the SMRs varied from 0.76 to 3.67 across cancer types.
   Conclusion Cancer may be a risk factor for suicide, particularly shortly after diagnosis. However, the relative risk gradually decreased during the period 1960 to 1999. (C) 2004 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

TI Suicide in young people under 15 years: Problems of classification
SO NORDIC JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English

ID CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS; NORWAY
AB The aim of this paper is to examine the classification of suicide in children and young adolescents. Although under- classification of suicide in the very young is a well- known problem, our hypothesis was that accidents might wrongly be classified as suicides, leading to over-classification. This may more easily occur in the very young. Method: Information about all registered young suicides under 20 years of age in Norway in 1990 - 92 was gathered from professional informants. The suicides were reclassified as certain, uncertain or improbable suicide. People under 15 years of age ( n = 14) were compared with late adolescent suicides ( 15 - 19 years) ( n = 115). Results: Uncertain or improbable suicides were significantly more common in the very young ( 50% vs. 5%, P < 0.001). In contrast to the very young who completed suicide, the very young with uncertain suicide had few risk factors ( mental disorders, broken families, known stressors or precipitants, suicide intent and farewell notes). Clinical vignettes are given. Conclusion: Some accidents in children may wrongly have been classified as suicide. Cases of death following experimenting or imitations of models from television or fiction should rather be classified as accidents or undetermined deaths. Misclassification of suicide may be an unnecessary burden to families and peers.

AB Background. Because of the lack of mandatory registration of deliberate self-inflicted injuries in most countries, few longitudinal epidemiological studies on suicide attempts have been published. This seriously impairs the possibilities for longitudinal analyses of suicide attempt rates within and between nations.
   Material and methods. The present 12-year (1984-95) surveillance study includes all hospitalised suicide attempt patients (n=1 031) and all suicides (n=161) in Baerum, a suburban area outside Oslo, Norway. Statistical analyses were based on the index suicide attempt in the study period (person-based).
   Results. The suicide attempt rate decreased by 53.5% during the study period, to a rate considerably lower (79/100,000/year in 1995) than in most other study centres in Northern Europe. However, the suicide rate in Baerum is somewhat higher than the Norwegian average, particularly among women. Among the suicide attempt patients, the suicide rate was 2.4% after an average of 6.5 years, which is rather moderate.
   Interpretations. The study may indicate that the follow-up programme for suicide attempt patients in Baerum has contributed to a reduced suicide attempt rate in this community. The suicide figures are too small for any conclusions to be drawn.

AB BackgroundThe extent of post-mortem detection of specific psychoactive drugs may differ between countries, and may greatly influence the national death register's classification of manner and cause of death. The main objective of the present study was to analyse the magnitude and pattern of post-mortem detection of various psychoactive substances by the manner of death (suicide, accidental, undetermined and natural death with a psychiatric diagnosis) in Norway and Sweden.MethodsThe Cause of Death Registers in Norway and Sweden provided data on 600 deaths in 2008 from each country, of which 200 were registered as suicides, 200 as accidents or undetermined manner of death and 200 as natural deaths in individuals with a diagnosis of mental disorder as the underlying cause of death. We examined death certificates and forensic reports including toxicological analyses.ResultsThe detection of psychoactive substances was commonly reported in suicides (66 and 74% in Norway and Sweden respectively), accidents (85 and 66%), undetermined manner of deaths (80% in the Swedish dataset) and in natural deaths with a psychiatric diagnosis (50 and 53%). Ethanol was the most commonly reported substance in the three manners of death, except from opioids being more common in accidental deaths in the Norwegian dataset. In cases of suicide by poisoning, benzodiazepines and z-drugs were the most common substances in both countries. Heroin or morphine was the most commonly reported substance in cases of accidental death by poisoning in the Norwegian dataset, while other opioids dominated the Swedish dataset. Anti-depressants were found in 22% of the suicide cases in the Norwegian dataset and in 29% of suicide cases in the Swedish dataset.ConclusionsPsychoactive substances were detected in 66 and 74% of suicides and in 85 and 66% of accidental deaths in the Norwegian and Swedish datasets, respectively. Apart from a higher detection rate of heroin in deaths by accident in Norway than in Sweden, the pattern of detected psychoactive substances was similar in the two countries. Assessment of a suicidal motive may be hampered by the common use of psychoactive substances in suicide victims.

DT Article
DE culture; folklore; suicide
AB Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the folk stories of Norway, Iceland and Finland with a view to discovering accounts of suicide as an escape option from intolerable predicaments, and to compare any such accounts with material from Southern Europe.
   Method: The Poetic Edda (Norway/Iceland) and The Kalevala (Finland) were examined for accounts of suicide, and evidence regarding the influence of these texts and individual accounts was collected.
   Results: The Poetic Edda provided one account and The Kalevala three accounts of suicide performed as a means of escaping intolerable situations. Both the Poetic Edda and The Kalevala are in public awareness and have influenced the politics and culture of their respective regions. The individual suicides have been depicted in literature, music and the visual arts, from the distant past to the present time.
   Conclusion: Suicide as a means of escape from intolerable predicaments has been public knowledge in these regions for a millennium. This is consistent with findings from Southern Europe and substantiates that intolerable predicaments may lead to suicide.

AB ObjectiveTo investigate differences in suicide risk among immigrant population in Norway compared with native Norwegians, with respect to associated country group of origin.
   MethodsBased on the entire national population, a nested case-control design was adopted using Norwegian national longitudinal registers to obtain 23073 suicide cases having occurred in 1969-2012 and 373178 controls. Odds ratios (ORs) for suicide were estimated using conditional logistic regression analysis adjusting for socio-economic factors.
   ResultsCompared with native Norwegians, suicide risk was significantly lower in first- and second-generation immigrants but higher in Norwegian-born with one foreign-born parent and foreign-born individuals with at least one Norwegian-born parent. When stratifying data by country group of origin, first-generation immigrants had lower ORs in most of the strata. Subjects born in Asia and in Central and South America with at least one Norwegian-born parent had a significantly higher risk of suicide. The observed results remained mostly unchanged in the analyses controlled for socio-economic status.
   ConclusionsSuicide risk is lower in first- and second-generation immigrants but higher in subjects born in Norway with one foreign-born parent and those born abroad with at least one Norwegian-born parent, with notable differences by country group of origin.

AB Background: Suicide is a major public health problem and depression is among the most important risk factors for suicide. Treatment of depression might prevent suicide. To study this hypothesis further we conducted an ecological study.
   Methods: An ecological study using sales data for antidepressants and numbers of suicides in Norway and Norwegian counties 1980-2004 was performed. Data on alcohol consumption and unemployment rates were registered and taken into account. Data were analyzed using Cochrane-Orcutt time series for the country as a whole. The county specific data were analyzed with a random coefficient model with county as subject and intercept and time (slope) as random variables using an unstructured covariance matrix.
   Results: Sales of non-tricyclic antidepressants (non-TCAs) and suicide were clearly negatively related, even when controlling for alcohol and unemployment (adjusted r(2): 0.57). There was an effect modification between time and level of sales of non-TCAs. Studying the relationship between the sales of non-TCAs and the suicide rate, we found that it was significant and stronger for the low sales figures, but non-existent for the high sales figures.
   Limitations: Ecological studies cannot infer causality.
   Conclusions: The fall in suicide rates in Norway and its counties was related to the increased sales of non-TCAs. The effect was mostly a result of a sales increase in the lower sales segment, indicating that a change from the more toxic TCAs, or heightened awareness of depression and its treatment, could explain the relationship found between sales of newer antidepressants and a decrease in suicide rate.

AB Objective: This study investigates whether changes in registration and coding practices influenced official suicide rates in Norway from 1988 to 2002.
   Study Design and Setting: A Poisson regression model was used to evaluate rates of suicide and potentially competing underlying causes of death. Setting in Norway 1988-2002.
   Results: From 1988 to 1994, suicide mortality decreased significantly, by 23.7%. Simultaneously, rates of causes of death potentially masking suicide decreased or remained fairly stable. From 1994 to 2002, however, there were no significant changes in suicide rates but accidental poisoning, which may mask suicide, increased significantly by 32.4%. Also, "ill-defined causes" of death increased by 16.7%, indicating poorer data quality.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that the decreasing suicide rate in 1988-94 reflects a real change. However, the general quality of mortality statistics has deteriorated since the late 1990s, making it difficult to assess developments since 1994. Such variations in the reliability of official suicide statistics complicate international comparisons. However, shifts in the death rate because of "ill-defined" causes could serve as a warning that data quality is not consistent over time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Studies from several countries suggest that erecting fences on bridges more commonly used for suicide by jumping may be an effective way of reducing the risk of suicide by jumping from these bridges. Distribution of suicides by jumping off bridges has not yet been studied on a national level in any country. This study included all suicides by jumping from high places registered in the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry (COD) in the period 1999-2010 (n=319). Combining data from the COD registry and information from police records, 71 cases of suicide by jumping off a bridge were identified involving 36 bridges. This form of suicide constituted approximately 1% of all suicides in Norway in the period 1999-2010. Almost half of these suicides were registered at only 6 bridges. Three Norwegian bridges were secured during the observation period of this study. Two bridges had barriers installed on the full length of the bridge with 11 suicides registered before barriers were installed, and none after. On the 1 bridge that was only partially secured, no change in numbers of suicides was observed after barriers were installed. One-third of jumps from bridges occurred over land. We found that although suicide by jumping off bridges was a relatively rare event, there is a potential for saving lives by installing physical barriers on bridges that are more commonly used for suicide by jumping.

AB Background: Suicide mortality and the rates by specific methods in a population may change over time in response to concurrent changes in relevant factors in society. This study aimed to identify significant changing points in method-specific suicide mortality from 1969 to 2012 in Norway.
   Method: Data on suicide mortality by specific methods and by sex and age were retrieved from the Norwegian Cause-of-Death Register. Long-term trends in age-standardized rates of suicide mortality were analyzed by using joinpoint regression analysis.
   Results: The most frequently used suicide method in the total population was hanging, followed by poisoning and firearms. Men chose suicide by firearms more often than women, whereas poisoning and drowning were more frequently used by women. The joinpoint analysis revealed that the overall trend of suicide mortality significantly changed twice along the period of 1969 to 2012 for both sexes. The male age-standardized suicide rate increased by 3.1 % per year until 1989, and decreased by 1.2 % per year between 1994 and 2012. Among females the long-term suicide rate increased by 4.0 % per year until 1988, decreased by 5.5 % through 1995, and then stabilized. Both sexes experienced an upward trend for suicide by hanging during the 44-year observation period, with a particularly significant increase in 15-24 year old males. The most distinct change among men was seen for firearms after 1988 with a significant decrease through 2012 of around 5 % per year. For women, significant reductions since 1985-88 were observed for suicide by drowning and poisoning.
   Conclusions: The present study demonstrates different time trends for different suicide methods with significant reductions in suicide by firearms, drowning and poisoning after the peak in the suicide rate in the late 1980s. Suicide by means of hanging continuously increased, but did not fully compensate for the reduced use of other methods. This lends some support for the effectiveness of method-specific suicide preventive measures, such as restrictions to the access to firearms, which had been implemented in Norway during the relevant time period.

AB Objectives. To summarize knowledge about suicidal behaviour among indigenous Sami living in northern Norway.
   Study design. This summary is based on data from a register-based follow-Lip study (Study I) and the North Norwegian Youth Stud (Study II) - it longitudinal questionnaire Study conducted in 1994-1995 and 1997-1998.
   Methods. The cohort from Study I included 19,801 persons with Sami ethnic ancestry. 10 573 (53.4%) men and 9,228 (46.6%) women. The cross-sectional sample analysed from Study 11 (1994/1995/T1) included 2,691 adolescents (1,402 females, 52%. and 1,289 males, 48%) aged 16-18 years.
   Results. Study I indicated that there was a significant moderate increased risk for Suicide among indigenous Sami (SMR=1.27, 95% confidence interval (Cl):1.02-1.56) compared to the reference population. In Study II. there were no significant ethnic differences in the prevalence Of Suicide attempts between Sami adolescents (10.5%) and their non-Sami peers (9.2%).
   Conclusions. Although the finding of a moderate significant increased risk Of Suicide among Sami is consistent with the general findings among Indigenous peoples, the Suicide rates found among Sand is moderate compared to several others Indigenous Peoples. When it comes to suicide attempts, no ethnic differences in prevalence of suicide attempts were found between Sami adolescents and their non-Sami peers. (Int J Circumpolar Health 2009; 68(3):204-211)

AB The prevalence of suicide attempts and associated risk factors such as sociodemographic conditions, emotional/behavioural problems and parent-child relationships were examined among 591 indigenous Sami and 2100 majority adolescents in Arctic Norway. There were no significant ethnic differences in prevalence of suicide attempts. In both ethnic groups, suicidal ideation, anxious/depressed problems and eating behaviour problems were associated with suicide attempts. Cross-cultural differences in risk factors associated with suicide attempts existed. For Sami adolescents, factors diverging from the traditional cultural norms were associated with suicide attempts, such as alcohol intoxication, single-parent home and paternal overprotection (p <= .05). Vocational studies, not living together with parents, current smoking and experienced sexual intercourse were ethnic specific risk factors associated with suicide attempts among majority peers (p <= .05). Clinicians should take into account that risk factors can differ between ethnic groups and should be sensitive to culturally divergent behaviour.

The students mainly saw the causes as intra-personal and almost all of them believed that suicide can be prevented. The results indicated a huge impact of religion on the attitudes toward suicide as well as some lack of distinction between their religious and professional roles and responsibilities.

AB Background The effect of recent increases in antidepressant prescribing on population suicide rates is uncertain.
   Aims To investigate the relationship between antidepressant sales and trends in suicide rates.
   Method Graphical and quantitative assessment of trends in suicide and antidepressant sales in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland.
   Results Suicide rates declined in all four countries during the 1990s, whereas antidepressant sales increased by 3- to 4-fold. Decreasing suicide rates in Sweden and Denmark preceded the rise in anti depressant sales by over 10 years, although the reductions accelerated between 1988 and 1990. In Norway, a modest but short-lived decline in suicide rates began around the time of the increase in antidepressant sales. In Finland, decreases in male suicide rates and to a lesser extent in female suicide rates began around the time of increased antidepressant sales. In all four countries decreases in suicide rates appeared to precede the widespread use of SSRIs.
   Conclusions We found mixed evidence that increases in antidepressant sales have coincided with a reduction in the number of suicides in Nordic countries.

AB Even though the causes of suicide may be rooted in childhood, it is unknown how socioeconomic position (SEP) in childhood is related to suicide in adulthood. We describe the association between childhood SEP and suicide mortality in adulthood in Norway using registry data on 613 807 Norwegians born in 1955-1965. Data on 1 013 suicide deaths between 1990 and 2001 were linked to data on SEP indicators, using Cox regression. Suicide mortality was higher among women with high childhood SEP than among women with low childhood SEP. This association was explained in part by family situation in adulthood, but not by adult SEP. For males, after adjustment for adult SEP, we observed a similar but weaker association between suicide and childhood SEP. We discuss several mechanisms which may explain the direct positive association of childhood SEP with suicide mortality in adulthood, especially among females. These are downward mobility, not meeting high demands set by highly educated parents, psychological distress, mental disorder, gender differences and social networks and norms.

AB Suicide is a major public health issue across the Arctic, especially among Indigenous Peoples. The aim of this study was to explore and describe cultural meanings of suicide among Sami in Norway. Five open-ended focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with 22 Sami (20) and non-Sami (2) participants in South, Lule, Marka, coastal and North Sami communities in Norway. FGDs were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed employing thematic analysis. Six themes were developed from the analysis: "Sami are treated negatively by the majority society", "Some Sami face negative treatment from other Sami", "The historic losses of the Sami have turned into a void", "Sami are not provided with equal mental health care", "The strong Sami networks have both positive and negative impacts" and "'Birgetkultuvvra' might be a problem". The findings indicate that the participants understand suicide among Sami in relation to increased problem load for Sami (difficulties in life not encountered by non-Sami) and inadequate problem-solving mechanisms on different levels, including lack of equal mental health care for Sami and cultural values of managing by oneself ("ies birget"). The findings are important when designing suicide prevention initiatives specifically targeting Sami.

AB During the past decades, extensive reformatory changes in institutional psychiatric care have been implemented in Norway.
   The objective of the present study was to investigate whether these changes have resulted in shortened length of psychiatric hospital stays for suicide attempters. Further, to examine if length of hospital stay and time period in which the patients received treatment were related to the risk of a repeated suicide attempt and/or committing suicide.
   All cases of suicide attempters hospitalised between 1984 and 2006 in the municipality of B'rum, a suburb outside Oslo, were examined. The period of observation was further subdivided in two time intervals on the basis of the de-institutionalisation of psychiatric care, which started to plateau in 1996.
   Among 1,574 patients consecutively admitted to the local general hospital after a suicide attempt, 330 were admitted to inpatient psychiatric care. Patients admitted in the period 1996-2006 had significantly shorter hospital stays than patients in the preceding period 1984-1995 (Log Rank P < 0.001). Neither the time period of treatment variable nor the length of hospital stay variable was significantly associated with the risk of a repeated suicide attempt or suicide.
   Psychiatric de-institutionalisation appears as not having affected suicide attempt repetition. It is possible that reduced length of hospital stay has been compensated by improved mental health care in general and extended outpatient services in particular.

AB We investigated changes in the proportion of firearm suicides in Western countries since the 1980s and the relation of these changes to the change in the proportion of: households owning firearms. Several countries had an obvious decline in firearm suicides: Norway, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia; and New Zealand. Multilevel modeling of longitudinal data confirmed the effect of the proportion of households owning firearms. Legislation and regulatory measures reducing the availability of firearms in private households can distinctly strengthen the prevention of firearm suicides.

AB Our aim, was to build a model delineating the relationship between attitudes toward suicide and suicidal behavior and to assess equivalence by applying the model on data from different countries. Representative samples from the general population were approached in Sweden, Norway, and Russia with the Attitudes Toward Suicide (ATTS) questionnaire. Data on experience of suicidal behavior among significant others and self-reported suicidal expressions were also collected. Structural equation modeling resulted in gender and country specific models where experience of suicidal behavior among significant others and self-reported suicidal expressions earlier in life predicted attitudes, and attitudes predicted current suicidal expressions. The models included the attitude factors acceptance of suicide, condemnation, and preventability; age and level of education were also incorporated. The different models reveal possible ways to better understand gender and culture-specific paths between attitudes and suicidal behaviors, and their relevance in a suicide prevention context is considered.

SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Healthcare use; Suicide; Immigrants; Primary healthcare services;
   Register data
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; COUNTRIES
AB BackgroundThere is an increase in studies investigating the use of healthcare services prior to suicide. Although studies generally report high usage, there are no previous studies comparing immigrants' use of primary healthcare (PHC) prior to suicide with that of majority populations. There is a strong influx of immigrants in Europe, and thus a growing demand for filling this knowledge gap and exploiting unused potential for suicide prevention.MethodBy linking three national registers, we examine contact with PHC prior to suicide in all suicide cases in Norway from 2007 to 2014 among individuals aged 15years and over (N=4341). We report the percentage of individuals in personal contact within the last 6 months, 1 month and 1 week prior to suicide, and use the chi square-test for association.ResultsOverall, immigrants have less contact with PHC prior to suicide. We find significantly lower rates of contact among immigrants, both 6 months and 1 month prior to suicide, for both sexes. The trend is similar in the last week prior to suicide, but less pronounced. The largest variance in contact with PHC prior to suicide is amongst 30-44year olds. Young, male immigrant suicide victims have the lowest rates of contact with PHC prior to suicide. Contact rates increase with age for all men and women in the majority population, but not for female immigrant suicide victims.ConclusionsThere is a clear difference in rates of contact with PHC prior to suicide between the majority and immigrant populations. The rates are especially low among young males, and measures should be made to lower their threshold for consulting PHC for young males in general and young male immigrants in particular. The difference in contact due to immigrant status appears to be of equal importance as the difference due to sex, although, with few significant results, a conclusion is hard to draw.

AB Historically African societies have been assumed to have low suicide rates, though there is little conclusive evidence to support this assertion and it is informed by dubious colonial assumptions about the nature of African subjectivity. In particular, longitudinal evidence is lacking. In recent years suicide has begun to attract the attention of psychiatry professionals in Eastern and Southern Africa and of the media. It is now widely argued that suicide rates are increasing, and in some places concern around suicide has taken the appearance of a 'moral panic'. Suicide is invested with a variety of meanings across the two regions. The results of a small-scale study of attitudes to suicide in Malawi are reported.

AB Background: In Norway, there are about 550 suicides recorded each year. The number of suicide attempts is 10-15 times higher. Suicide attempt is a major risk factor for suicide, in particular when violent methods are used. Suicide attempts with violent methods have hardly been studied in Norway. This study describes demographic, psychiatric and somatic health in patients admitted to somatic hospitals in Norway after suicide attempt by violent methods compared with suicide attempters using deliberate self-poisoning (DSP).
   Methods: Patients admitted to somatic hospital after suicide attempt aged > 18 years were included in a prospective cohort study, enrolled from December 2010 to April 2015. Demographics (gender, age, marital and living condition, educational and employment status), previous somatic and psychological health were registered. Patients who had used violent methods were compared with patients admitted after suicide attempt by DSP.
   Results: The study included 80 patients with violent methods and 81 patients with DSP (mean age both groups 42 yrs.). Violent methods used were cutting (34%), jumping from heights (32%), hanging (14%), others (10%), shooting (7%) and drowning (4%). Patients with violent methods had more often psychosis than patients admitted with DSP (14% vs 4%, p < 0. 05), less anxiety disorders (4% vs 19%, p < 0.01) and less affective disorders (21% vs. 36%, p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the numbers of patients who received psychiatric treatment at the time of the suicide attempt (violent 55% versus DSP 48%) or reported previous suicide attempt, 58% in patients with violent methods and 47% in DSP. Patients with violent methods stayed longer in hospital (14.3 (mean 8.3-20.3) vs. 2.3 (mean 1.6-3.1) days, p < 0.001), stayed longer in intensive care unit (5 days vs. 0.5 days, p < 0.001) and were in need of longer mechanical ventilation (1.4 vs 0.1 days, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Patients with violent methods had more often psychosis, less anxiety disorders and affective disorders than patients with DSP. Psychiatric treatment before the attempt and previous suicide attempt was not significantly different between the groups and about half of the patients in both groups were in psychiatric treatment at the time of the suicide attempt.

AB Chain of care for patients with intentional self-harm was important in the Norwegian national action plan to prevent suicide. In this study there were two aims: (1) to calculate the potential effects of chain of care on reducing suicide rates, and (2) to assess whether suicide rates decreased more in areas where chain of care had been implemented than in other areas. We observed no differences in changes in suicide rates between areas with and without the intervention. The calculated potential effects of chain of care on national suicide rates were very small, even under unrealistically favorable conditions.

Schools in Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Norway (N=30,532) were surveyed. In all countries the risk of deliberate self-harm was significantly elevated among adolescents who reported some or numerous episodes of intoxication, controlling for confounding factors. The results support the assumption that intoxication is significantly related to the association between alcohol consumption and deliberate self-harm in adolescents.

AB Background: Mental disorders are strongly associated with excess suicide risk, and successful treatment might prevent suicide. Since 1990, and particularly after 1998, there has been a substantial increase in mental health service resources in Norway. This study aimed to investigate whether these changes have had an impact on suicide mortality.
   Methods: We used Poisson regression analyses to assess the effect of changes in five mental health services variables on suicide mortality in five Norwegian health regions during the period 1990-2006. These variables included: number of man-labour years by all personnel, number of discharges, number of outpatient consultations, number of inpatient days, and number of hospital beds. Adjustments were made for sales of alcohol, sales of antidepressants, education, and unemployment.
   Results: In the period 1990-2006, we observed a total of 9480 suicides and the total suicide rate declined by 26%. None of the mental health services variables were significantly associated with female or male suicide mortality in the adjusted analyses (p > 0.05). Sales of antidepressants (adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.97-1.00) and sales of alcohol (adjusted IRR = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.18-1.72) were significantly associated with female suicide mortality; education (adjusted IRR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.79-0.94) and unemployment (adjusted IRR = 0.91; 95% CI = 0.85-0.97) were significantly associated with male suicide mortality.
   Conclusions: The adjusted analyses in the present study indicate that increased resources in Norwegian mental health services in the period 1990-2006 were statistically unrelated to suicide mortality.

AB Studies suggest that the population level link between alcohol and suicide differs across countries and between men and women. The aim of this paper was to estimate the relationship between alcohol consumption and suicide in Canada and to put the results in a comparative perspective. The relationship was elucidated for whole Canada, different provinces and also separately for men and women. The total suicide rate in Canada increased signicantly by around 4% as alcohol consumption increased by one litre per capita, suggesting that approximately 25 - 30% of Canadian suicides were related to alcohol. The relationship was stronger for women than for men. A signicant effect was found in all provinces except from Quebec, but the overall regional variation was not statistically signicant. In an international perspective, the relationship for women was somewhat weaker than in Sweden and Norway, but larger than in Finland, the United States and Southern European countries. For men, the association was similar to what is found in the United States and Finland, weaker than in Sweden, Norway and Russia but stronger than in Southern European countries. The results only partly support the idea that intoxication frequency explains national differences in this relationship. Possible explanations for the stronger association among women are also discussed.

AB This cross-sectional survey was aimed to compare attitudes towards suicide and suicidal behaviour among randomly selected sample (N = 172) belonged to Hindu and Muslim religions. Data were collected through face-to-face interview. Hindus differed from Muslims regarding suicidal attempts among family (chi (2) = 12.356, p < .002) and community members (chi (2) = 20.425, p < .000). Our study also showed that suicidal behaviours were comparatively low among Muslim participants than Hindus. Further, Muslims hold more negative attitudes towards suicide than Hindus. An enhanced understanding of attitudes towards suicide among general population may be crucial to plan educational, intervention and prevention programs.

AB Background. Suicide rates are higher in certain educational groups. The highest rates are generally found in the medical and allied professions, but the empirical evidence for high suicide rates may be questionable. This study compares the rate of suicide among trained physicians, dentists, nurses, police officers and theologians with the rate among other university graduates and the general population according to sex, age and time period.
   Method. Census data from 1960, 1970, 1980 and 1990 relating to education were linked to suicide as cause of death data from Statistics Norway, and followed up for the period 1960-2000, comprising 46 and 49 million person-years among men and women respectively.
   Results. Physicians still have a higher rate compared with other graduates and the general population, both among males [43(.)0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 35(.)3-52(.)5] and females (26(.)1, 95 % CI 15(.)1-44(.)9). Suicide rates increased steeply by age among physicians and other graduates, whereas for non-graduates the rate was highest in the 40-60 years age group. The suicide rate among female nurses was also elevated, whereas police officers seemed to have an intermediate suicide risk. The rate among theologians was low (7(.)0, 95% CI 2(.)9-16(.)9). The suicide rates in the 1990s were significantly lower than in the 1980s.
   Conclusions. The high suicide rates among physicians and elderly graduates are of concern. The reasons why graduates are more vulnerable than others when getting older and the low rate among theologians warrant further study.

AB Background: The aim of this paper was to study the collaboration between emergency departments (EDs) in general hospitals and community health services (CHS) in Norway when providing psychosocial care and aftercare to patients treated in EDs following a suicide attempt. We wanted to explore the extent to which quality indicators at the hospital level measured in 1999 and 2006 could predict the presence or absence of a chain of care structure in the CHS in 2006.
   Methods: Data were collected through structured interviews with informants from 95% of all general hospitals in Norway in 1999 and 2006, and informants from CHS, in a stratified sample of Norwegian municipalities in 2006 (n = 47).
   Results: In 15 of the 47 municipalities (32%), the CHS reported having a chain of care structure in 2006. A discriminant function analysis revealed that the hospitals that in 1999 had: (a) a collaboration agreement with aftercare providers, and (b) written guidelines, including a quality assurance system, were significantly more likely to have municipalities with a chain of care structure in their catchment area in 2006.
   Conclusions: Hospitals' and municipalities' self-reported provision of aftercare services for patients treated after a suicide attempt was markedly below the recommendations given in national standards. Systems at the hospital level for the management and care of patients admitted after a suicide attempt and systematic collaboration between hospitals and aftercare providers seem to be important elements in the long-term maintenance of continuity of care for suicide attempters.

Data were obtained from the mortality dataset of Department of Health and National Health Insurance Database. Included in the sample were 862 persons aged 12-24 years who committed suicide in Taiwan between 2001 and 2004. We compared the records of medical service utilization of adolescents (ages 12-18 years) with young adults (ages 19-24 years). Persons in both age groups contacted general practitioners more often than other types of medical providers in the year preceding suicide, with the exception of the month before suicide. Females made greater use of medical services than males in both age groups. Suicide prevention strategies should increase the emphasis in training non-psychiatric medical practitioners to identify and treat young persons at suicide risk.

AB ObjectiveTo investigate the association of resting heart rate with suicide in two large cohorts.
   MethodThe MJ cohort (Taiwan) included 532 932 adults from a health check-up programme (1994-2008). The HUNT cohort (Norway) included 74 977 adults in the Nord-TrOndelag County study (1984-1986), followed up to 2004. In both cohorts heart rate was measured at baseline, and suicide was ascertained through linkage to cause-of-death registers. Risk of suicide was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models.
   ResultsThere were 569 and 188 suicides (average follow-up period of 8.1 and 16.9 years) in the MJ and HUNT cohorts respectively. Sex- and age-adjusted hazard ratio for every 10 beat increase in heart rate per minute was 1.08 (95% Confidence Interval 1.00-1.16) and 1.24 (1.12-1.38) in the MJ and HUNT cohorts, respectively. In the MJ cohort this association was confined to individuals with a history of heart diseases vs. those without such a history (P for interaction = 0.008). In the HUNT cohort the association did not differ by history of heart diseases and was robust to adjustment for health-related life style, medication use, and symptoms of anxiety and depression.
   ConclusionElevated resting heart rate may be a marker of increased suicide risk.

AB Background: The use of psychotropic medications in relation to mental disorders is considered central to preventing suicide. However, few studies have addressed prescription patterns at different time points within the last year prior to suicide and compared these with those of the general population.
   Methods: We use data covering the period from 2010 to 2011 from the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry and the Norwegian Prescription Database to examine dispensing patterns of prescription medication within 12 months and within 30days of suicide. Our data includes all registered suicides in Norway among individuals aged 15 years and older in 2011 (n=594), 434 men and 160 women. Dispensing of prescription medication in the general population (n approximate to 4 million) are used for comparison.
   Results: Dispensing of any prescription medication were high and varied from 95.6% for females and 83.2% for males within 12 months of suicide, to 64.4% for females and 47.2% for males within 30days of suicide, respectively. The percentages with dispensed prescription medication increased with age. A similar sex and age pattern was observed for the dispensing of psychotropic medications. Within the last 30days, close to one in two were dispensed psychotropic medications. The dispensing of antidepressants, hypnotics and sedatives was more common than the dispensing of other categories of psychotropics. The percentages with dispensed prescription medication among the population controls were considerably lower, in particular the dispensing of psychotropics.
   Conclusion: Dispensing of prescription medications, including psychotropic medications, is common prior to suicide. The percentage with dispensed prescription medication increases with age and are higher for females than for males.

AB Seasonal variation in the number of suicides has long been acknowledged. It has been suggested that this seasonality has declined in recent years, but studies have generally used statistical methods incapable of confirming this. We examined all suicides occurring in Norway during 1969-2007 (more than 20,000 suicides in total) to establish whether seasonality decreased over time. Fitting of additive Fourier Poisson time-series regression models allowed for formal testing of a possible linear decrease in seasonality, or a reduction at a specific point in time, while adjusting for a possible smooth nonlinear long-term change without having to categorize time into discrete yearly units. The models were compared using Akaike's Information Criterion and analysis of variance. A model with a seasonal pattern was significantly superior to a model without one. There was a reduction in seasonality during the period. Both the model assuming a linear decrease in seasonality and the model assuming a change at a specific point in time were both superior to a model assuming constant seasonality, thus confirming by formal statistical testing that the magnitude of the seasonality in suicides has diminished. The additive Fourier Poisson time-series regression model would also be useful for studying other temporal phenomena with seasonal components.

ID 28-YEAR FOLLOW-UP; FETAL-GROWTH; RISK; CIRCUMSTANCES; QUALITY
AB In this issue of the Journal, Bjorngaard et al. give us new insights into the etiology of mental health by studying birth order and suicide risk (Am J Epidemiol. 2013;177(7):638-644). Although the authors provided empirical evidence that each increase in birth order (i.e., from first-born to second-born, second-born to third-born, etc.) is associated with a 46% higher suicide risk, they gave us very little information on the likely explanations. In our commentary, we draw attention to the possible mechanisms underlying a causal relationship between birth order and suicide. Given that Norway is one of the richest countries in the world, the findings of Bjorngaard et al. in a Norwegian cohort also call for a discussion of whether their results are representative of other societies that are similar or dissimilar with respect to economic institutions, social conditions, and political environment. We suggest that there are several plausible mechanisms to explain higher suicide rates among later-born children, but other mechanisms might also operate in the opposite direction, that is, have beneficial outcomes among later-born children. Specifically, there are reasons to expect a different relationship between birth order and psychiatric outcomes in poorer societal contexts.

AB Objective: The author hypothesized, based on research until 1991, that a five-fold increase in the use of antidepressants might reduce Swedish suicide rates by 25%. A subsequent 3.5-fold increase in the use of antidepressants provided a 'natural experimental situation' for prospectively testing this hypothesis.
   Method: Swedish statistics on suicide, use of antidepressants, unemployment and alcohol consumption were obtained for 1978-96. Time-series of the latter variables were compared with suicide rates. Demographic subgroups regarding age, gender and county were analysed. Suicide rates were also compared with the use of antidepressants in Denmark, Norway and Finland.
   Results: Suicide rates decreased in accordance with the a priori hypothesis. Alcohol consumption and unemployment rates did not correlate well with suicide rates.
   Conclusion: This naturalistic study is not conclusive. The increased use of antidepressants appears, however, to be one of the contributing factors to the decrease in the suicide rate. It is of great scientific and clinical importance that this be evaluated by further studies.

AB The objective of this study was to identify predictors of a high level of quality of care for suicide attempters at general hospital emergency departments in Norway. Structured interviews with key informants covering the quality of care of patients admitted following attempted suicide were conducted in 1999 and 2006 at 87% of all general hospitals. Hospitals having implemented a chain of care program for suicide attempters in 1999 maintained significantly higher levels on quality of care indicators 7 years later. Predictors of a high quality of care level were training of staff in management and care of suicide attempters and to have written guidelines for the care.

AB A prospective cohort of 74,332 men and women was used to investigate the association of body mass index and height with suicide, anxiety, and depression. Participants in the Nord-Trondelag Health Study (Norway, 1984-1986) (HUNT 1) were aged 20 years or more and followed up until December 31, 2002. Anxiety and depression were measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Rating Scale (HADS) in 1995-1997. There were 183 suicides. Suicide risk decreased with increasing body mass index at baseline (1984-1986) in men and women. In models controlling for a range of psychological, social, and lifestyle factors, the hazard ratio per standard deviation increase in body mass index was 0.82 (95% confidence interval: 0.68, 0.98). In contrast, in the subset of participants (n = 44,396) with HADS measures, body mass index at baseline (1984-1986) was positively associated with depression. In fully adjusted models, the odds ratio for depression per standard deviation increase in body mass index (HADS-D: >= 8) was 1.11 (95% confidence interval: 1.07, 1.15). In fully adjusted models, there was no association of height with the incidence of suicide or depression. Raised body mass index is associated with an increased risk of depression but reduced risk of suicide in men and women. The mechanisms underlying these different associations require clarification.

AB Objectives: To Investigate the association of sleeping problems with suicide risk.
   Design: Prospective cohort study linking health survey information on sleep problems of Norway's national mortality registry. Participants were followed up from 1984-6 until December 31, 2004.
   Setting: Residents of Nord-Trondelag County, Norway, aged 20 years or older in 1984-6.
   Participants: Altogether 87.285 people were eligible for the surveye and 74,977 (86%) took part in one or more aspects of the study.
   Interventions: N/A
   Measurements and Results: Three percent of participants experienced sleeping problems every night, 5% experienced problems "often" and 31% reported problems "sometimes." There were 188 suicides during follow-up. Sleeping problems at baseline were strongly associated with subsequent suicide risk. Compared to participants who reported no sleeping problems the age- and sex- adjusted hazard ratios for suicide were 1.9 (CI 1.3-2.6). 2.7 (CI 1.4-5.0), and 4.3 (CI 2.3-8.3) for reporting sleeping problems sometimes, often, or almost every night, respectively. Associations were stronger in younger (< 50 years) participants, but we found no statistical evidence for gender differences. Adjusting for measures of common mental disorder and alcohol use at baseline weakened the associations, but the 3% of subjects with the worst sleep patterns remained at two fold increased risk of suicide.
   Conclusions: Sleeping problems are a marker of suicide risk, mainly due to presence of both sleeping and mixed anxiety and depression. Physicians should be aware of the possible vulnerability for people affected by sleeping problems.

AB We assess (i) whether being married is a protective factor against socio-economic inequalities in suicide, and (ii) whether any such buffering effect varies between countries. We used the data from a European cross-national comparison project, a prospective follow-up of several European population censuses matched with vital statistics. The data encompass 99.5 million person-years aged 30 and above and, 25,476 suicides in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Turin, Madrid, Norway and Switzerland. Standardised rates were computed and logistic regressions were used to assess educational inequalities. Among the non-married, the lower educational group had an increased risk of dying of suicide compared to the higher group (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.45). Inequalities among the married were lower (OR = 1.29). In all countries or regions except Austria, the lower educational group had a higher risk of suicide mortality among the non-married than among the married. The buffering effect of being married was not observed for elderly individuals (65 and over). Among younger individuals, the buffering effect of being married on relative inequalities in suicide was stronger in Madrid, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland (but significant only for Denmark and Norway). There was no indication that countries with stronger welfare policies or lower divorce rate had a lower buffering effect. We conclude that being married protects against inequalities in suicide and that this protective effect is not affected by the level of social capital at the country level. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Volunteer crisis tine responders are a valuable resource for suicide prevention crisis lines worldwide. Aim: The aim of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of how volunteers operating a diaconal crisis line in Norway experienced challenges and how these challenges were met. Method: A qualitative, explorative study was conducted. A total of 27 volunteers were interviewed through four focus groups. The material was analyzed using systematic text condensation. Results: The greatest challenge to the volunteers was the perception of a gap between their expectations and the practice field. The experience of many volunteers was that the crisis line primarily served a broad ongoing support function for loneliness or mental illness concerns, rather than a suicide prevention crisis intervention function. Limitations:The focus group design may have made the participants more reluctant to share experiences representing alternative perspectives or personally sensitive information. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that a uniform response to callers using crisis lines as a source of ongoing support is warranted and should be implemented in volunteer training programs.

AB Background: The international classification of diseases (ICD) provides guidelines for the collection, classification and dissemination of official cause-of-death statistics. New revisions of the ICD can potentially disrupt time trends of cause-of-death statistics and affect between-country comparisons. The aim of this study was to measure how switching from ICD-9 to ICD-10 affected mortality statistics for external causes of death, i.e. intentional and unintentional injuries, in Italy and Norway.
   Methods: A sample of death certificates (N = 454,897) were selected in Italy from the first year the ICD-10 was implemented (2003) and reclassified from ICD-10 to ICD-9 by the Italian National Institute of Statistics. A sample of death certificates was also selected in Norway (N = 10,706) from the last year the ICD-9 was used (1995) and reclassified according to ICD-10 by Statistics Norway. The reclassification (double-coding) was performed by special trained personal in governmental offices responsible for official mortality statistics. Although the reclassification covered all causes of death (diseases and injuries) in the sample, our analysis focused on just one ICD chapter XX. This was external causes of mortality (injury deaths), and covered 15 selected categories of injuries.
   Results: The switch from ICD-9 to ICD-10 had a significant net impact on 8 of the 15 selected categories. In Italy, accidental falls decreased by 76%; traffic accidents decreased by 9%; suicide by hanging decreased by 3%; events of undetermined intent decreased by 69%; and overall injury deaths decreased by 4%. These net decreases reflect the moving of death records from injury categories in ICD-9 to other injury or disease categories in ICD-10. In Norway, the number of records in three categories decreased significantly: transport accidents, 9%; traffic accidents, 13%; and suicide by self-poisoning, 18%. No statistically significant differences (net changes) were observed in the total number of accidents, suicides and homicides in either country.
   Conclusions: Switching to ICD-10 did not change the overall trends for accidents, homicides and suicides in either country. However, the number of records in some injury subcategories e. g. accidental falls and traffic accidents, decreased. Changing classification can thus affect the ranking of causes of injury mortality, with consequences for public health policy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: There are presently few international studies that examine adolescents' own experience of both triggering and the underlying reasons behind their suicide attempts. Aims: To present the rates, triggering factors, and underlying reasons for such behavior. Methods: The 23-year (1984-2006) surveillance study reported includes all general hospital-treated suicide attempters aged between 13 and 19 years (n = 254) living in the municipality of Baerum, a suburb on the outskirts of Oslo, Norway. Results: Suicide attempt rates for both sexes decreased during the period of study. The female suicide attempt rate was on average 3.5 times higher than the male rate. An average of 8.2% of the suicide attempters made a repeat attempt within the following year. Overall, the most commonly reported trigger was a relational conflict (50.2%), and the most commonly reported underlying reason was a dysfunctional family situation (43.6%), followed by mental health problems (22.8%). The main gender difference for both triggers and underlying reasons was that relational conflicts were reported significantly more often by girls than by boys as triggers (55.0% versus 32.7%), and dysfunctional family issues were reported significantly more often by girls than by boys (47.1% versus 30.8%) as underlying reasons for the attempt. Mental health problems were reported less frequently as an underlying reason by girls than boys (21.2% versus 28.8%). Conclusions: A family-oriented intervention embracing the extended family system seems warranted in a majority of the cases in our study.

DT Article
ID ANTIDEPRESSANTS; ASSOCIATION; PREVENTION
AB Background: In the period 1990-2006, strong and almost equivalent increases in sales figures of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were observed in all Nordic countries. The sales figures of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) dropped in Norway and Sweden in the nineties. After 2000, sales figures of TCAs have been almost constant in all Nordic countries. The potentially toxic effect of TCAs in overdose was an important reason for replacing TCAs with SSRIs when treating depression. We studied whether the rapid increase in sales of SSRIs and the corresponding decline in TCAs in the period 1990-98 were associated with a decline in suicide rates.
   Methods: Aggregated suicide rates for the period 1975-2006 in four Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) were obtained from the national causes-of-death registries. The sales figures of antidepressants were provided from the wholesale registers in each of the Nordic countries. Data were analysed using Fisher's exact test and Pearson's correlation coefficient.
   Results: There was no statistical association (P = 1.0) between the increase of sales figures of SSRIs and the decline in suicide rates. There was no statistical association (P = 1.0) between the decrease in the sale figures of TCAs and change in suicide rates either.
   Conclusions: We found no evidence for the rapid increase in use of SSRIs and the corresponding decline in sales of TCAs being associated with a decline in the suicide rates in the Nordic countries in the period 1990-98. We did not find any inverse relationship between the increase in sales of SSRIs and declining suicide rates in four Nordic

AB Trends in adolescent suicide rates (15-19 years) from 1979 to 1996 were compared with suicide trends in individuals of 20 years and over in 30 countries and with trends in rates of deaths due to undetermined causes in adolescents in 17 countries of the WHO European Region. In 21 of the 30 studied countries, male adolescent suicide rates increased during the study period (highest increases in Belarus, Kazakstan and Ireland) accompanied by far less increases or decreases in suicide rates of males of 20 years and over. Part of the observed increases in Sweden, Ireland and Greece can be attributed to improved suicide statistics, while increases in Finland, Belgium, Bulgaria and the United Kingdom can be even higher due to the rising classification of deaths as "undetermined". In Portugal, decreasing suicide trends seem to be misinterpreted by ignoring the vast increases in rates of undetermined deaths. Female adolescent suicide rates rose less markedly than in males in 18 countries, with the exception of strong increases in Norway, Ireland. Increases in female adolescent suicide rates were marginally affected by changes in classification practices and were accompanied primarily by declining suicide rates in females of 20 years and over.

AB The aim of this naturalistic and retrospective follow-up study was to identify putative predictors of suicide attempts among young adults at high risk with a particular view on adverse life events. One hundred young adults who had been given emergency treatment for mental health problems in child and adolescent outpatient clinics in Norway were assessed 5/9 years after referral. Suicide and suicide attempts in the follow-up period were registered as well as suicide attempts at referral and previous suicide attempts unrelated to the treatment referral. In addition, adverse life events during childhood and adolescence and social background factors were registered. Only one subject committed suicide during the follow-up period. However, suicide attempts were frequent (29/100) and equally distributed among those referred for suicidal or other reasons. Those who had attempted suicide experienced more adverse life events during adolescence, were more likely to be male, to have incomplete schooling and a record of psychiatric hospitalizations. Clinicians need to address the risk of future suicide attempts also among young emergency patients not referred for suicidal reasons.

AB ObjectivePrevious studies from North Norway showed significantly increased mortality in patients with schizophrenia and personality disorder. The aim of the present study was to investigate total and cause-specific mortality in inpatients with affective disorder in a 33-year follow-up cohort, with a specific focus on sex differences.
   MethodsBased on a hospital case register covering all admissions to psychiatric hospital in the two northernmost counties in Norway from 1980 to 2012, 790 men and 866 women with major depressive disorder and 331 men and 514 women with bipolar disorder were included. The cohort was linked to the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry. The relative mortality in men compared to women was tested using Cox regression with attained age as the time variable. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of the patients when compared to the general population in Norway was calculated.
   ResultsPatients with affective disorders had twice the mortality of the general Norwegian population [SMR=2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.9-2.3]. For major depressive disorder, the SMR for total mortality was higher among men (2.6, 95% CI: 2.2-3.0) than women (1.8, 95% CI: 1.5-2.1). For bipolar disorder, no difference was seen between men and women. The SMR for suicide among women showed an increasing trend throughout the period 1980-1990: 20.0 (95% CI: 10.4-38.4); 1991-2001: 27.0 (95% CI: 15.7-46.2); 2002-2012: 40.4 (95% CI: 23.0-71.2).
   ConclusionsThe substantially increased mortality in patients with affective disorders in Norway has been persistent over a period of 33 years, despite extensive reforms in psychiatric health care. Indications of increasing SMR for suicide in women call for further research.

The results revealed satisfactory internal consistency and good temporal stability. Moderately high correlations with other measures of suicide ideation suggested satisfactory concurrent validity. Similarly, the construct validity was evidenced by moderate correlations among the BSI, the Hopkins Symptom Check List (HSCL-25) depressive scale, and the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS). In general, the findings suggest that the BSI is a reliable and valid instrument to assess severity of suicide ideation in college students.

AB Background: Theory is the foundation of science; this is true in suicidology. Over decades of studies of suicide notes, Leenaars developed a multidimensional model of suicide, with international (crosscultural) studies and independent verification. Aim: To corroborate Leenaars's theory with a psychological autopsy (PA) study, examining age and sex of the decedent, and survivor's relationship to deceased. Method: A PA study in Norway, with 120 survivors/informants was undertaken. Leenaars theoretical-conceptual (protocol) analysis was undertaken of the survivors' narratives and in-depth interviews combined. Results: Substantial interjudge reliability was noted (K = .632). Overall, there was considerable confirmatory evidence of Leenaars's intrapsychic and interpersonal factors in suicide survivors' narratives. Differences were found in the age of the decedent, but not in sex, nor in the survivor's closeness of the relationship. Older deceased people were perceived to exhibit more heightened unbearable intrapsychic pain, associated with the suicide. Conclusion: Leenaars's theory has corroborative verification, through the decedents' suicide notes and the survivors' narratives. However, the multidimensional model needs further testing to develop a better evidence-based way of understanding suicide.

ID 28-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN; VIOLENT DEATHS; INFANT DEATH; BEREAVEMENT; STRESS
AB Aspart of a larger study, this article describes the local authorities in Norway as providers of help and survivors as recipients of help after the suicide of a young person (< 30 years) in 83 families. A questionnaire developed for this study maps the extent of professional community support as reported by parent survivors (N = 128). Additionally, 41 survivors described the quality of the assistance through in-depth interviews. Another questionnaire assesses the provisions and the organization of intervention strategies in local communities. Personnel in 321 of Norway's 481 municipalities responded. Although survivors' wishes for ideal support coincide with recommendations by experts in the field, local authorities lack the organization tofu fill such expectations. The discussion highlights issues relating to content, organization, and ideology of the assistance.

DT Article
ID STATISTICS
AB This paper explores the usage of suicide statistics and the emergence of suicidology in nineteenth-century Scandinavia and Finland. Drawing upon texts from Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark-with a focus on Swedish language sources-it illustrates the significance that suicide statistics gained during this period, and pays attention to the question of how the Scandinavian discussion on suicide was linked to ideas from outside the geographic area. Taking the cross-references between the selected texts as a starting point, this short foray into early suicidology commences in Finland and works its way westwards.
   The discussed works provide a multi-faceted perspective on the issue of suicide statistics in nineteenth century Scandinavia. The paper confirms the influence of central European personalities and ideas on the discussion in the Nordic countries, but at the same time shows that Scandinavian scholars presented unique and novel works, and thus were actively participating and contributing to the emerging pan-European debate on suicide.

   PARASUICIDE; PREVALENCE; LIFETIME; RISK
AB Background: Individuals who have attempted suicide are at increased risk of subsequent suicidal behavior. Since 1983, a community-based suicide prevention team has been operating in the municipality of Baerum, Norway. This study aimed to test the effectiveness of the team's interventions in preventing repeated suicide attempts and suicide deaths, as part of a chain of care model for all general hospital treated suicide attempters.
   Methods: Data has been collected consecutively since 1984 and a follow-up was conducted on all individuals admitted to the general hospital after a suicide attempt. The risk of repeated suicide attempt and suicide were comparatively examined in subjects who received assistance from the suicide prevention team in addition to treatment as usual versus those who received treatment as usual only. Logistic regression and Cox regression were used to analyze the data.
   Results: Between January 1984 and December 2007, 1,616 subjects were registered as having attempted suicide; 197 of them (12%) made another attempt within 12 months. Compared to subjects who did not receive assistance from the suicide prevention team, individuals involved in the prevention program did not have a significantly different risk of repeated attempt within 6 months (adjusted OR = 1.08; 95% CI = 0.66-1.74), 12 months (adjusted OR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.57-1.30), or 5 years (adjusted RR = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.67-1.22) after their first recorded attempt. There was also no difference in risk of suicide (adjusted RR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.46-1.57). Previous suicide attempts, marital status, and employment status were significantly associated with a repeated suicide attempt within 6 and 12 months (p < 0.05). Alcohol misuse, employment status, and previous suicide attempts were significantly associated with a repeated attempt within 5 years (p < 0.05) while marital status became non-significant (p > 0.05). With each year of age, the risk of suicide increased by 3% (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: The present study did not find any differences in the risk of fatal and non-fatal suicidal behavior between subjects who received treatment as usual combined with community assistance versus subjects who received only treatment as usual. However, assistance from the community team was mainly offered to attempters who were not receiving sufficient support from treatment as usual and was accepted by 50-60% of those deemed eligible. Thus, obtaining similar outcomes for individuals, all of whom were clinically judged to have different needs, could in itself be considered a desirable result.

ID DURKHEIM THEORY; HOMICIDE RATES; AGE STRUCTURE; SIZE; DIVORCE; FAMILY;
   INTEGRATION; CONTEXT; FINLAND; NORWAY
AB Recently, the long observed pattern of a monotonic increase in suicide with age has shifted, often dramatically, because more recent birth cohorts have exhibited much higher suicide rates at younger ages than earlier cohorts have. These changes, however did not occur in all countries. We examine cohort variations in suicide rates in 14 modern, western societies using an extension of the age-period-cohort characteristic model that incorporates hierarchical linear modeling. Results support a general Durkheimian perspective. Birth cohorts experiencing relatively less social integration and regulation, as measured by higher rates of nonmarital births and larger relative cohort size, have higher suicide rates than other cohorts. Societies that provide alternative sources of social integration and regulation, as through collectivist institutions or through greater support for families and children, moderate this tendency. On the other hand, when societies experience rapid social change, the relationship between decreased social integration and regulation and increased suicide rates is stronger especially for males. These results have implications for stemming the increased suicide rates for youth observed in many contemporary societies.

AB Together with the other Nordic countries, Norway stands in a unique position internationally with its large population representative registries. By means of unique personal identification numbers assigned to all Norwegian citizens, as well as to immigrants who stay for more than 6 months, it is possible to construct individual record linkages covering an increasing number of years across different national registries. The Norwegian registries include, among others, information from the primary and specialist health care services, the prescription of drugs, and causes of death. In addition, they include sociodemographic information like year of birth, gender, immigration status, educational attainment, marital status, and the use of various social benefits. Norway is one of very few countries that have a nationwide registry on primary health care use. This registry gives the opportunity to explore the role of the primary health care services prior to suicide and in the follow-up of the suicide bereaved, which has been pointed out as one of the most promising areas for future suicide prevention. Linkages of Norwegian registries opens up new approaches in analyses and the possibility to explore a range of novel research themes, such as treatment trajectories and patterns of health care use prior to suicide and among the suicide bereaved.
   In this paper, we give a description of the Norwegian population representative registries applicable for suicide research. We discuss the analytic opportunities as well as the challenges and obstacles of a registry based research approach to - suicide.
   The main strength of registry-based research on suicide is the ability to maintain data on the total population, the possibility to study small sub-populations or low-prevalent events, virtually continuous timelines in longitudinal data, few or no non-response or other missing data, no sample attrition, and the possibility of gaining access to large amounts of various health and sociodemographic information. In addition registry-based research allows investigation of hard-to-reach populations, such as groups of individuals with severe mental disorders or immigrants that traditionally have been difficult to recruit for participation in research projects.
   The opportunities presented in the article could motivate to do similar research in Canada and even inspire for cooperation between Norwegian and Canadian researchers on registry based research on suicide. In our opinion, registry-based research on suicide will play an increasingly important role in suicide research in the years to come.

AB Background and Aim: Published research on suicidality among Norwegian youth and publications describing interventions were summarized in order to access the current status of knowledge building via empirical research. Method: A systematic Medline search identified 29 studies on risk factors on the entire spectrum of suicidal phenomena from self-harm without suicidal ideation to completed suicide with the mean age at/under 25 years. A specialist Norwegian journal, Suicidologi, was searched for additional matter, especially interventions. Result: Most studies focussed on psychological and psychiatric risk factors of attempted suicide. Other suicidal phenomena, psychosocial and societal risk factors, and impact of interventions were hardly studied. Depression, previous suicidal behaviour, alcohol use and non-intact parental unit were consistent significant risk factors found in suicide and attempted suicide studies. Conclusion: Supporting non-intact parental units and the maintenance of intact parental units along with early detection and management of suicide attempts, depression and alcohol use should be targeted as suicide prevention interventions among adolescents.

AB Objective: To calculate the incidence rates of hospital-treated psychosis and suicide in historical cohorts of a small rural community in southeast Norway, and to compare the local findings with the national ones.
   Method: We have carried out a longitudinal epidemiological study, reviewing the patient records at the mental hospitals of people born in the rural community after 1845. Based on these records, we have constructed a local register of psychosis and suicide in this population. The local incidence rates of psychosis and suicide have been compared with the national ones.
   Results: The overall local incidence rates of psychosis and suicide were similar to the national ones. The local rates of schizophrenia dropped considerably after World War II.
   Conclusion: The overall local incidence rates of psychosis and suicide seem to be representative for the country at large despite frequent endogamy. The recent drop in the incidence rate of schizophrenia seems to be in agreement with several international studies.

AB . Suicide has become one of the leading causes of death of Swiss males aged between 15 and 44 years, whose age-standardized rates are about three times higher than those for females. We compared age-stratified suicide rates of Swiss men and women aged 1579 years and analysed gender-specific differences from 1950 to 2007. Furthermore, we explored whether changes in measures of family integration can explain changes in suicide trends. The use of multivariate ageperiodcohort models avoids age aggregation and allows the exploration of heterogeneous time trends across age, period and birth cohort. In addition, explanatory variables can be included. We found strong gender-specific differences in suicide mortality. Although the same risk factors may act on age and overdispersion, there was no significant correlation between gender-specific cohort effects. Family integration had an effect on Swiss suicide risk but only partially explained the underlying trends over time.

AB Although suicide rates among prisoners are high and vary between countries, it is uncertain whether this reflects the importation of risk from the general population or is associated with incarceration rates.
   We collected data on suicides and undetermined deaths in 12 countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England and Wales, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, and Sweden) directly from their prison administrations for 2003-2007. These were compared with rates of suicides in the general population separately by gender using Pearson's correlations. In addition, they were compared with rates of incarceration. Linear regression was used to examine any association after adjustment for rates of incarceration.
   Data were collected on 861 suicides in prison, of which 810 were in men. In the men, crude relative rates of suicide were at least three times higher than the general population. Western European countries had similar rates of prisoner suicide which were mostly higher than those in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. There was no association between rates of suicide in prisoners and general population rates or rates of incarceration. In the women, inmate suicide rates varied widely and were mostly raised compared with rates in the general population. In addition, these rates did not appear to be associated with general population rates of suicide.
   Rates of prison suicide do not reflect general population suicide rates, suggesting that variations in prison suicide rates reflect differences in criminal justice systems including, possibly, the provision of psychiatric care in prison.

ID 5-YEAR SURVIVORS; LATE MORTALITY; IDEATION; RISK
AB Suicide risk in adult cancer patients is found to be elevated, but limited information exists regarding risks of suicide and non-suicidal violent deaths when diagnosed with cancer in young age. We investigate suicide and violent deaths in a national cohort including individuals diagnosed with cancer before age 25. Through the linkage of different national registries (Cancer Registry of Norway, Norwegian Causes of Death Registry and the National Registry) a cohort of all live births in Norway during 1965-1985 was defined and followed up through 2008. Individuals diagnosed with cancer before age 25 and the cancer-free references were compared using an extended Cox proportional hazard regression model. The cohort comprised 1,218,013 individuals, including 5,440 diagnosed with cancer before age 25. We identified 24 suicides and 14 non-suicidal violent deaths in the cancer group. The hazard ratio (HR) of suicide in the cancer group was 2.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-3.8), and was increased both when diagnosed with cancer in childhood (0-14 years of age); HR=2.3 (95% CI: 1.2-4.6), and during adolescence/young adulthood (15-24 years); HR=2.6 (95% CI: 1.5-4.2). Survivors of bone/soft tissue sarcomas, CNS tumors and testicular cancer were at particular risk. The risk of non-suicidal violent death was not increased in the cancer survivors (HR=1.0; 95% CI: 0.6-1.7). Although based on small numbers and the absolute risk of suicide being low, these are novel findings with important implications for establishing adequate follow-up including suicide prevention strategies for young cancer survivors.
   What's new? The onset of cancer at a young age profoundly affects psychological health and potentially increases the risk of death by suicide. Little is known, however, about the extent of suicidal behavior exhibited by childhood, adolescent and young adult cancer survivors. Using national registry data, the authors of the present study examined suicides and violent deaths in cancer patients diagnosed before age 25, finding that suicide risk is increased more than two-fold for cancer survivors diagnosed before age 15 and for those diagnosed during adolescence/young adulthood (15-24 years). Suicide screening and prevention efforts may be necessary components of follow-up care in these patient populations.

TI Predictors of suicide in the patient population admitted to a
   locked-door psychiatric acute ward
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID RISK-FACTORS; COLLABORATIVE ASSESSMENT; MANAGEMENT; DISCHARGE; CAMS
AB Objective
   No prior study appears to have focused on predictors of suicide in the general patient population admitted to psychiatric acute wards. We used a case-control design to investigate the association between suicide risk factors assessed systematically at admission to a locked-door psychiatric acute ward in Norway and subsequent death by suicide.
   Method
   From 2008 to 2013, patients were routinely assessed for suicide risk upon admission to the acute ward with a 17-item check list based on recommendations from the Norwegian Directorate of Health and Social Affairs. Among 1976 patients admitted to the ward, 40 patients, 22 men and 18 women, completed suicide within December 2014.
   Results
   Compared to a matched control group (n = 120), after correction for multiple tests, suicide completers scored significantly higher on two items on the check list: presence of suicidal thoughts and wishing to be dead. An additional four items were significant in non-corrected tests: previous suicide attempts, continuity of suicidal thoughts, having a suicide plan, and feelings of hopelessness, indifference, and/or aggression. A brief scale based on these six items was the only variable associated with suicide in multivariate regression analysis, but its predictive value was poor.
   Conclusion
   Suicide specific ideations may be the most central risk markers for suicide in the general patient population admitted to psychiatric acute wards. However, a low predictive value may question the utility of assessing suicide risk.

AB Background: To investigate whether schizophrenia patients with both suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-harm have earlier age of onset of psychotic and depressive symptoms and higher levels of clinical symptoms compared to patients with only suicide attempts or without suicide attempt.
   Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, 251 patients (18-61 years old, 58% men) with schizophrenia treated at hospitals in Oslo and Innlandet Hospital Trust, Norway, were assessed with a comprehensive clinical research protocol and divided into three groups based on their history of suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-harm.
   Results: Suicide attempts were present in 88 patients (35%); 52 had suicide attempts only (29%) and 36 had both suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-harm (14%). When compared with nonattempters and those with suicide attempts without non-suicidal self-harm, patients with both suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-harm were more frequently women, younger at the onset of psychotic symptoms, had longer duration of untreated psychosis, and had higher levels of current impulsivity/aggression and depression. Patients with both suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-harm were more likely to repeat suicide attempts than patients with suicide attempts only.
   Conclusions: Patients with both suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-harm had different illness history and clinical characteristics compared to patients with only suicide attempts or patients without suicidal behavior. Our study suggests that patients with both suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-harm represent a distinct subgroup among patients with schizophrenia and suicidal behavior with their early onset of psychotic symptoms, high rate of repeated suicidal behavior and significant treatment delay.

AB This descriptive study examined gender differences related to attitudes toward suicide among randomly selected urban residents. Data was collected using a standardized questionnaire through face-to-face interview. Our findings revealed that men hold more pro preventive attitudes to help persons with suicidal thoughts (80.3 %, p = 0.05) and agreed that suicidal attempts are impulsive (78.6 %, p = 0.01). However, they hold permissive attitude to help persons with incurable diseases and expressing death wishes to die (66 %, p = 0.05). A majority of men (78.6 %) than women agreed that "suicidal attempt is essentially a cry for help" (chi (2) = 11.798, p = 0.05). These gender differences need to be taken into consideration when developing appropriate programs to prevent suicide. Further, decriminalizing the law, high-quality research and raising awareness about suicide prevention among the general population is crucial in developing countries like India.

AB Background: Attitudes toward suicidal behaviour can be essential regarding whether patients seek or are offered help. Patients with suicidal behaviour are increasingly treated by mental health outpatient clinics. Our aim was to study attitudes among professionals at outpatient clinics in Stavropol, Russia and Oslo, Norway.
   Methods: Three hundred and forty-eight (82 %) professionals anonymously completed a questionnaire about attitudes. Professionals at outpatient clinics in Stavropol (n = 119; 94 %) and Oslo (n = 229; 77 %) were enrolled in the study. The Understanding Suicidal Patients (USP) scale (11 = positive to 55 = negative) and the Attitudes Towards Suicide Scale (ATTS) (1 = totally disagree, 5 = totally agree) were used. Questions about religious background, perceived competence and experiences of and views on suicidal behaviour and treatment (0 = totally disagree, 4 = totally agree) were examined.
   Results: All groups reported positive attitudes, with significant differences between Stavropol and Oslo (USP score, 21.8 vs 18.7; p < 0.001). Professionals from Stavropol vs. Oslo reported significantly less experience with suicidal patients, courses in suicide prevention (15 % vs 79 %) guidelines in suicidal prevention (23 % vs 90 %), interest for suicide prevention (2.0 vs 2.7; p < 0.001), and agreed more with the ATTS factors: avoidance of communication on suicide (3.1 vs 2.3; p < 0.001), suicide is acceptable (2.9 vs 2.6; p = 002), suicide is understandable (2.9 vs 2.7; p = 0.012) and (to a lesser extent) suicide can be prevented (4.2 vs 4.5; p < 0.001). In both cities, psychiatric disorders (3.4) were considered as the most important cause of suicide. Use of alcohol (2.2 vs 2.8; p < 0.001) was considered less important in Stavropol. Psychotherapy was considered significant more important in Stavropol than Oslo (3.6 vs 3.4; p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: Professionals reported positive attitudes towards helping suicidal patients, with significant differences between cities. A need for further education was reported in both cities, but education was less integrated in mental health care in Stavropol than it was in Oslo. In both cities, psychiatric disorders were considered the major reasons for suicide, and psychotherapy was the most important treatment measure.

AB Objective: This study investigates the relationship between cannabis use and later depression, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in a cohort of young Norwegians.
   Method: Data were gathered through the Young in Norway longitudinal study, in which a population-based sample of 2033 Norwegians were followed up over a 13-year period, from their early teens to their late twenties. Data were gathered on: (a) exposure to cannabis use; and (b) depression, suicide ideation and suicide attempts. In addition, information about possible confounding factors was included.
   Results: In early adolescence, no associations with later depression or suicidal behaviours were observed. In the sample's twenties, we observed highly significant associations with suicide ideation and suicide attempts. When adjusting for confounders, the OR was 2.9 (95% CI 1.3-6.1) for later suicide attempts in the group who had used cannabis 11+ times during the past 12 months.
   Conclusion: The findings suggest that exposure to cannabis by itself does not lead to depression but that it may be associated with later suicidal thoughts and attempts.

TI Prevalence and characteristics of suicide attempters and ideators among

AB Background: More knowledge about suicidality and suicide risk profiles in acute psychiatric hospital patients (both first-time and chronic patients) is needed. While numerous factors are associated with suicidality in such populations, these may differ across cultures. Better understanding of factors underlying suicide risk can be informed by cross-cultural studies, and can aid development of therapeutic and preventive measures.
   Methods: An explorative, cross-sectional cohort study was carried out. Acutely admitted patients at one psychiatric hospital in northwest Russia and two in northern Norway were included. At admission, demographic, clinical, and service use data were collected, in addition to an assessment of suicidal ideation and attempts, comprising five dichotomic questions. Data from 358 Norwegian and 465 Russian patients were analyzed with univariate and multivariate statistics. Within each cohort, attempters and ideators were compared with patients not reporting any suicidality.
   Results: The observed prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts was significantly higher in the Norwegian cohort than in the Russian cohort (chi(2) = 168.1, p < 0,001). Norwegian suicidal ideators and attempters had more depressed moods, more personality disorders, and greater problems with alcohol/drugs, but fewer psychotic disorders, cognitive problems or overactivity than non-suicidal patients. Russian suicidal ideators and attempters were younger, more often unemployed, had more depressed mood and adjustment disorders, but had fewer psychotic disorders and less alcohol/drug use than the non-suicidal patients.
   Conclusions: Rates of suicidal ideation and non-fatal attempts in Norwegian patients were intermediate between those previously reported for patients admitted for the first time and those typical of chronic patients. However, the significantly lower rates of suicidal ideation and non-fatal attempts in our Russian cohort as compared with the Norwegian, contrasted with what might be expected in a region with much higher suicide rates than in northern Norway. We suggest that suicide-related stigma in Russia may reduce both patient reporting and clinicians' recognition of suicidality. In both cohorts, overlapping risk profiles of ideators and attempters may indicate that ideators should be carefully evaluated and monitored, particularly those with depressed moods, alcohol/substance abuse disorders, and inadequate treatment continuity.

ID SURVIVORS
AB Little knowledge has been documented on the experiences of young suicide survivors, how they are coping with schooling and what kind of support they think they need. Thirty-two adolescents who had lost a close family member or friend by suicide participated in a research project by filling in questionnaires and participating in focus group interviews. The article explores the young people's experiences with and wishes for help from the school, including teachers and school nurses. The results show that the young people struggle with concentration and learning new material. Although many are satisfied with care and support while at school, the young bereaved do not receive all the assistance they wish for and need. In order to adequately support young suicide survivors to continue schooling, it is worth listening to their opinions about how they may be approached.

AB Despite the worldwide proliferation of suicide-prevention crisis-line networks, there is limited in-depth knowledge of how the volunteer call responders experience and manage emotional stressors. The study's purpose was to explore emotional stressors related to operating a diaconal suicide-prevention crisis line, and how these are managed in daily operations. In this qualitative study, 27 volunteers were interviewed in four focus groups. The material was analysed using systematic text condensation. The participants experienced emotional stressors related to being unable to actively intervene, encountering traumatised callers and feeling uncertain about representing the Church. They used a combination of personal coping strategies and organisational support factors. Implications for training and practice are further discussed.

   MIGRANTS; ILLNESS; PEOPLE
AB The relative importance of socio-economic factors on risk for suicide in the immigrant population may differ from that for the native population; however, few studies have addressed this issue on a national basis. With a nested case-control design and data from Norwegian population registers we identified 11,409 suicide cases in the years 1992-2012 and 191,785 sex-birthdate-matched controls. The influence of socio-economic factors on the risk for completed suicide was assessed through conditional logistic regression. Among 11,409 suicides, 1139 (10%) were individuals with an immigration background of either themselves or their parent(s). Suicide cases, as well as the controls, with an immigration background differed in several aspects of their socio-economic status from those without such a background. Being single or separated, divorced or widowed, was, however, associated with an increased risk of suicide regardless to the subjects' immigration background. Low level of education and low annual income significantly increased the risk for suicide in almost all the study subgroups. Living in the capital area was associated with a reduced risk of suicide in first-generation immigrants but an increased risk in native Norwegians. In conclusion, persons with an immigration background, as well as native Norwegians, shared most common risk factors for suicide, but the strength of associations between socio-economic factors and risk for suicide can differ by immigration background.

AB Despite the large amount of research on adolescent suicidality, there are few detailed studies illustrating the characteristics of child and adolescent completed suicide. Our study presents the characteristics of child and adolescent suicides occurring over a period of 25 years within a large geographical area in Northern Finland, with a special focus on gender differences. The study sample included all 58 suicides among children and adolescents (<18 years) occurring in the province of Oulu in Finland between 1988 and 2012. The data is based on documents pertaining to establish the cause of death from forensic autopsy investigations. A register linkage to the data from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register (FHDR) was also made. 79% of the suicide victims were male. Violent suicide methods predominated in both genders (males 98%, females 83%). While symptoms of mental illness were common, only a minority (15% of males and 17% of females) had a previous history of psychiatric hospitalization. 17% of females but none of the males had been hospitalized previously due to self-poisoning. A greater proportion of females than males had a history of self-cutting (33% vs. 7%) and previous suicide attempts (25% vs. 4%). 48% of males and 58% of females were under the influence of alcohol at the time of their suicide, and alcohol intoxication was related to suicides during the night. One fifth of the adolescents screened positive for substances other than alcohol. The results of this study indicate that there are similarities but also some differences in the characteristics of male and female suicides in adolescents. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Previous research has revealed an association between parental bereavement from external causes and risk of suicide in offspring. Few studies have however provided insights into specific influences of cause of death, gender of the deceased and bereaved, age at bereavement and suicide, and time since bereavement. The present nested case-control study was based on data from three longitudinal registers. Subjects comprised 19 015 persons who died from suicide at an age of 11-64 years during 1969-2012 (cases), and 332 046 live comparison individuals matched for gender and date of birth. Information about deceased parents' cause and date of death, and sociodemographic data was retrieved and merged. Data were analysed with conditional logistic regression. Losing a parent to suicide, transport accidents and other external causes of death was associated with an increased suicide risk in offspring. Parental suicide was associated with a substantially higher suicide risk than transport accidents and other external causes. These effects were equally strong for daughters and sons, and for the loss of a mother, father or both parents. Suicide risk was highest in younger bereaved offspring, and bereavement had both short and long-term impacts on suicide risk. In conclusion, all offspring exposed to parental death by external causes have an increased suicide risk, independent of factors related to the exposure. The consequences are long lasting, and offspring should be offered follow-up in primary healthcare. Younger offspring bereaved by parental suicide have the highest risk and may be targeted for prevention and intervention programs in specialist healthcare. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Prevalence of Death Ideation and Attempted Suicide and the Associated Risk Factors in Isparta, Turkey
   Objective: Suicide is a complex process from the initiation of ideation to planning, and finally to an attempt. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of death ideation, attempted suicide, and the associated risk factors in Isparta, Turkey.
   Materials and Methods: The study included 600 participants aged 18-65 years representative of the population of central Isparta that were selected via the stratified simple randomized sampling method. The participants were administered a questionnaire for collecting demographic data, and the participant's experiences of death ideations and suicide attempts, and the clinical version of SCID were used.
   Results: The lifetime prevalence of attempted suicide and death ideations was 4.3% and 27.5%, respectively. Death ideas and attempted suicide were both more prevalent among women and younger adults. All those that attempted suicide were exposed to a stress factor prior to the attempt. The rates of death ideation and attempted suicide were lower among the participants that had children. A family history of attempted suicide was associated with an increase in the frequency of death ideations and attempted suicide. Attempted suicide and death ideas were more common among those with major depressive disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder was observed significantly more frequently among those that had attempted suicide. Panic disorder and a specific phobia were also significantly associated with death ideation.
   Conclusion: The present study's findings indicate that there were common risk factors for attempted suicide and death ideations in the study group. Determination of the prevalence of attempted suicide and death ideation in a population, identification of the associated risk factors and assessment of their relationship to mental disorders can facilitate a better understanding of suicidal behaviour.

AB Background: To investigate monthly variation in depression, anxiety and their comorbidity (COM) in an epidemiologic study and their association to monthly variation in suicide rates. Methods: 60,995 participants of the Health Study of Nord-Trondelag County in 1995-97 rated themselves on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in all months except July. All 10,670 male and 3833 female suicides in Norway from 1969 through 1996 were included. Results: The prevalence of comorbid anxiety and depression was highest in spring (April, May) and in October (P < 0.01). There was a correlation between the monthly variation in the national suicide rate and monthly variation in comorbid anxiety and depression (r=0.72, df=11, p=0.01) and for male alone (r=0.67, df=11, p=0.03). There was also a significant monthly variation in the prevalence of depression (p < 0.001) and no monthly variation in the prevalence of anxiety. Limitations: Limited information about the third of the population who did not take part in the HUNT-2 Study. HADS based depression and anxiety cover psychological symptoms, not somatic and social ones. In relation to DSM-IV and ICD-10 defined anxiety disorders and depressions, the sensitivity and specificity of HADS caseness, give a considerable number of false-positive cases. Conclusions: Increased prevalence of comorbid depression and anxiety in males during spring, and its association with suicidality should have clinical importance, as identification and treatment could influence suicide rates.

AB Background The suicide rate is a macro indicator of the population's psychosocial wellbeing and an evaluation criterion of the effectiveness of suicide prevention strategies. A high level of injury deaths of undetermined intent (UD) is usually discussed in connection with the validity of suicide statistics. An effort is made to develop a criterion to characterise the quality of suicide statistics.
   Methods Standardised rates of suicides (X60-X84) and UD (Y10-Y34) by the International Classification of Disease version 10 as an average for the past five available years were taken from the WHO European mortality database. Rate ratios were computed by dividing rates of UD by suicide rates.
   Results There is considerable variation in suicide and UD rates among countries. The highest overall rates of UD were registered in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and the lowest in Greece, Spain and Italy. The EU-15 average UD rate of 1.97 and the rate ratio of 0.194 UD to suicides were combined into a '2-20 benchmark', in which the primary indicator is 2.0 UD cases per 100 000 and the secondary indicator is the proportion of UD to suicides 0.20 (20%), which enables countries to be clustered according to the quality of suicide statistics. The following countries satisfied the benchmark: Greece, Norway, Spain, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Austria, Italy, Romania, Hungary, Ireland and Finland.
   Conclusion This study used the developed '2-20 benchmark' in Europe to assess suicide registration quality in a particular country, to compare the relative position of countries, and to set a target for those European countries that have not yet achieved the benchmark.

ID SELF-HARM; BRIEF INTERVENTION; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; CONTACT
AB Background: Safety plans have been suggested as an intervention for people at risk of suicide. Given the impulsive character of suicidal ideation, a safety plan in the format of a mobile phone application is likely to be more available and useful than traditional paper versions. Aims: The study describes MYPLAN, a mobile phone application designed to support people at risk of suicide by letting them create a safety plan. Method: MYPLAN was developed in collaboration with clinical psychiatric staff at Danish suicide preventive clinics. The mobile application lets the user create an individualized safety plan by filling in templates with strategies, actions, and direct links to contact persons. Results: MYPLAN was developed in 2013 and is freely available in Denmark and Norway. It is designed for iPhone and android platforms. As of December 2015, the application has been downloaded almost 8,000 times. Users at risk of suicide as well as clinical staff have provided positive feedback on the mobile application. Conclusion: Support via mobile phone applications might be particularly useful for younger age groups at risk of suicide as well as in areas or countries where support options are lacking. Yet, it is important to examine the effectiveness of this type of intervention.

TI Murder followed by suicide: Norwegian data and international literature
SO NORDIC JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID EXTENDED SUICIDE; HOMICIDE
AB Background: In Scandinavia, the knowledge base for murder-suicides is uneven, and there has been no statistics in criminal records. Method: We collected data from criminal registers in Norway from 1990 to 2007, and seek to compare this with international literature from the last 50 years. Results: Over 90% of murder-suicide perpetrators are males and 80% of their victims are females. A vast majority of perpetrators are, or have been, intimate partners with their victim. The woman has often indicated an intention to break up from the relationship before the homicide. Compared with isolated homicides, the ages of both the perpetrator and victim are higher; most perpetrators use firearms, and tend to be less socially marginalized. Psychiatric instability is often a background factor, but should be seen in view of longstanding personal conflicts and threat of or loss of family, employment or social reputation. Norwegian statistics show that one in four murderers who have killed a near acquaintance also will commit suicide. Conclusions: Increased knowledge is essential to prevent further tragedies of murder-suicide. Scrutinizing the taboo surrounding the topic will probably lead to improved awareness. We suggest that a connection should be made between the homicide(s) and the suicide in criminal registers.</.

LA English
DT Article
DE suicide; police; stress; Norway
ID PREVALENCE
AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine potential predictors of suicidal ideation among a large sample of Norwegian police officers. Some have suggested that suicide is a leading cause of death among police officers.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected using anonymously completed questionnaires from 766 officers, a 60 percent response rate most measures included were commonly used by other researchers. Predictors included personal demographics, work situation characteristics, job demands, burnout components, work outcomes and coping responses. Logistic regression analysis was used as the prevalence of suicidal ideation was strongly skewed; most police officers indicated no suicidal ideation. Two criterion groups were created; police officers indicating no suicidal ideation (n = 495) and police officers indicating some suicidal ideation (n = 124).
   Findings - Single police officers, officers reporting higher levels of both exhaustion and cynicism (burnout components), and officers engaging in less active coping and reporting lower levels of social support indicated more suicidal ideation.
   Research limitations/implications - Use of self-report data raises the possibility of response set tendencies.
   Practical implications - Organizations can undertake efforts to prevent potential suicide of their members. It appears that reducing levels of burnout, increasing social support, and highlighting the benefits of active coping represent useful starting points.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to our understanding of suicidal ideation among police officers.

AB This retrospective study from Western Norway is based on the cases of 196 homicide victims from 1985 to 2009. The median age of the victims was 35 years, in both genders. Within the cases, 113 of the victims were male and 83 female, 28 victims were under the age of 18, and 19 victims were not native Norwegians.
   Ethanol was detected in the blood of a higher proportion of male compared to female victims, whereas a higher proportion of female compared to male victims had both illegal/legal drugs detected in their blood. Most perpetrators were male. Men were most often killed by an acquaintance, women by their present or former intimate partner. In 14 cases of intimate partner homicide the perpetrator committed suicide after killing their female partner. The dominant scene of crime was private homes. Most victims were killed by blunt force, sharp force or gunshot. The head was the body region most often injured in the homicide victims. Female victims were more often killed by manual strangulation than male victims. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID STATISTICS; RATES; AUTOPSIES; IRELAND; MANNER; US
AB Objective: Valid mortality statistics are important for healthcare planning and research. Suicides and accidents often present a challenge in the classification of the manner of death. The aim of this study was to analyse the reliability of the national suicide statistics by comparing the classification of suicide in the Scandinavian cause of death registers with a reclassification by 8 persons with different medical expertise (psychiatry, forensic pathology and public health) from each of the 3 Scandinavian countries.
   Methods: The cause of death registers in Norway, Sweden and Denmark retrieved available information on a sample of 600 deaths in 2008 from each country. 200 were classified in the registers as suicides, 200 as accidents or undetermined and 200 as natural deaths. The reclassification comprised an assessment of the manner and cause of death as well as the level of certainty.
   Results: In total, 81%, 88% and 90% of deaths registered as suicide in the official mortality statistics were confirmed by experts using the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish data sets, respectively. About 3% of deaths classified as accidents or natural deaths in the cause of death registers were reclassified as suicides. However, after a second reclassification based on additional information, 9% of the natural deaths and accidents were reclassified as suicides in the Norwegian data set, and 21% of the undetermined deaths were reclassified as suicides in the Swedish data set. In total, the levels of certainty of the experts were 87% of suicides in the Norwegian data set, 77% in the Swedish data set and 92% in Danish data set; the uncertainty was highest in poisoning suicides.
   Conclusions: A high percentage of reported suicides were confirmed as being suicides. Few accidents and natural deaths were reclassified as suicides. Hence, reclassification did not increase the overall official suicide statistics of the 3 Scandinavian countries.

AB This qualitative study focuses on the ways in which existential themes were understood and addressed in therapeutic relationships with patients who had attempted suicide. Health care professionals (HCP) from Norway specialist healthcare participated in focus groups. The interviews were transcribed and analysed by systematic text-condensation through a four-step procedure. We found that the HCPs emphasised the context-specific functions of their departments. They considered these conversations essential but demanding. They indicated existential themes of hope/hopelessness, loneliness, meaning, life/death, shame, religion and suicide. The HCPs' understandings of themes deemed to be existential and how they should be addressed were primarily based on clinical experience. This appeared to exacerbate the pressure on their personal involvement, leading to the question of whether patients' existential needs are tackled or instead disappear into a conversational vacuum. The study suggests that HCPs' professional competence of existential themes pertaining to patients at suicide risk needs to be strengthened.

ID SUICIDE RATES; STATISTICS; AUTOPSY; CLASSIFICATION; IRELAND
AB Background: National mortality statistics should be comparable between countries that use the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases. Distinguishing between manners of death, especially suicides and accidents, is a challenge. Knowledge about accidents is important in prevention of both accidents and suicides. The aim of the present study was to assess the reliability of classifying deaths as accidents and undetermined manner of deaths in the three Scandinavian countries and to compare cross-national differences.
   Methods: The cause of death registers in Norway, Sweden and Denmark provided data from 2008 for samples of 600 deaths from each country, of which 200 were registered as suicides, 200 as accidents or undetermined manner of deaths and 200 as natural deaths. The information given to the eight experts was identical to the information used by the Cause of Death Register. This included death certificates, and if available external post-mortem examinations, forensic autopsy reports and police reports.
   Results: In total, 69 % (Sweden and Norway) and 78 % (Denmark) of deaths registered in the official mortality statistics as accidents were confirmed by the experts. In the majority of the cases where disagreement was seen, the experts reclassified accidents to undetermined manner of death, in 26, 25 and 19 % of cases, respectively. Few cases were reclassified as suicides or natural deaths. Among the extracted accidents, the experts agreed least with the official mortality statistics concerning drowning and poisoning accidents. They also reported most uncertainty in these categories of accidents. In a second re-evaluation, where more information was made available, the Norwegian psychiatrist and forensic pathologist increased their agreement with the official mortality statistics from 76 to 87 %, and from 85 to 88 %, respectively, regarding the Norwegian and Swedish datasets. Among the extracted undetermined deaths in the Swedish dataset, the two experts reclassified 22 and 51 %, respectively, to accidents.
   Conclusion: There was moderate agreement in reclassification of accidents between the official mortality statistics and the experts. In the majority of cases where there was disagreement, accidents were reclassified as undetermined manner of death, and only a small proportion as suicides.

AB Background: Suicide is an important world health issue, especially in territories inhabited by indigenous people. This investigated differences in suicide rates, suicide methods, and suicide occurrence by month and day of the week among the indigenous and non-indigenous populations of the Nenets Autonomous Okrug (NAO) and to compare the findings from the NAO with national Russian statistics.
   Methods: In this retrospective population-based mortality study we investigated all suicides that occurred in the NAO in 2002-2012 (N = 252). Suicide method and the month and day of the week suicide occurred was taken from autopsy reports and disaggregated by ethnic group (indigenous and non-indigenous) and sex. Data from the NAO were then compared with national data from the Russian Federal Statistics Service (Rosstat).
   Results: Hanging was the most common suicide method in the NAO in both indigenous and non-indigenous populations. The proportion of suicides by hanging among males was lower in the NAO than in national data (69.3 vs 86.2 %), but the inverse was true for females (86.5 vs 74.9 %). Suicide by firearm and by cutting was significantly higher among the indigenous population in the NAO when compared with national data. Peaks in suicide occurrence were observed in May and September in the NAO, whereas national data showed only one peak in May. Suicide occurrence in the indigenous population of the NAO was highest in April, while the non-indigenous population showed peaks in May and September. Suicide occurrence in the NAO was highest on Fridays; in national data this occurrence was highest on Mondays.
   Conclusions: We showed different relative frequencies of suicide by hanging, cutting, and firearm, as well as different suicide occurrence by month and day of the week in the NAO compared with Russia as a whole. These results can be used to plan suicide prevention activities in the Russian Arctic.

AB Background: The study has a dual objective: (1) to investigate the extent to which, and how and to whom, elderly people gave warning (according to the definition of the term given by the American Association of Suicidology) prior to suicide; (2) to investigate how these warnings were perceived by the recipients of them, and what reactions the recipients had to the warnings.
   Methods: This is a psychological autopsy study based on qualitative interviews. Sixty-three informants were interviewed about 23 suicides by individuals aged over 65 in Norway. The informants comprised relatives, general practitioners (GPs) and home-based care nurses. In general, the analysis of the interviews follows the systematic text condensation method.
   Results: The interviews contained four main themes regarding reactions to the warnings: "not taken seriously," "helplessness," "exhaustion," and "acceptance." A total of 14 of the 23 elderly people gave warning before the suicides occurred. The warnings were given to relatives (11), home-based care nurses (5), and GPs (2).
   Conclusions: Even though more than half of the elderly people had given warning (most frequently to relatives) before the suicide, the warnings did not initiate preventive measures. Together with passive attitudes, the lack of recognition of both the risk of suicide and the opportunities for treatment prevented possible measures being implemented. The paper discusses the grounds for the reactions as well as how suicide warnings given by elderly people can be taken seriously.

AB Objective: The frequency of suicide attempts and clinical characteristics of attempters among poly-substance abusers and alcoholics were examined. Methods: A consecutive sample (n = 260) of in-and outpatients from two Norwegian counties were assessed by Composite International Diagnostic Interview (Axis I disorders), Millon's Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (Axis II disorders) and the Norwegian National Client Assessment Form. When analysing the association between suicide attempters and the range of predictor variables, logistic regression analysis was conducted. Results: Almost half (47%) of the sample reported lifetime suicide attempts; significantly more frequently in poly-substance abusers (58%) than alcoholics (38%). A substance use disorder with duration of >= 15 years and an early onset (< 18 years of age) were independently associated with being a suicide attempter after controlling for Axis I disorders. In addition, eating disorders, agoraphobia and major depression were strongly and independently associated with being a suicide attempter. Conclusion: Attempts at preventing suicidal behaviour should not ignore the suicide risk among poly-substance abusers. In addition, prevention of suicidal behaviour demands a treatment programme focusing concomitantly on both addictive behaviour and comorbid psychiatric disorders.

AB Physicians have a higher suicide rate than the general population or other academics. Little is known about the reasons for this. Analysing risk factors may be a valuable way of identifying reasons for the high suicide rate among physicians, thereby leading to preventive efforts. The present study is one of the first papers on suicidal thoughts and attempts among physicians. A questionnaire about suicidal thoughts (developed by E.S. Paykel) was completed by 1,063 of 1,476 active Norwegian physicians (72%). Lifetime prevalence ranged from 51.1% for feelings that life was not worth living to 1.6% for a suicide attempt. Risk factors were being female, living alone, and depression. Suicidal thoughts, however, were hardly attributed to working conditions. A high rate of suicide and a low rate of suicidal attempts support the hypothesis that physicians do not 'cry for help,' but are inclined to act out their suicidal impulses.

AB Objective: To investigate the risk and protective factors for previous and future suicide attempts among adolescents. Method: A representative sample of high school students (N = 9,679) in grades 7 through 12 (aged 12-20 years) were followed from 1992 to 1994. Response rate was 97% at initial testing and 80% at follow-up. Measures of psychiatric symptoms (depressed mood, eating problems, conduct problems), substance use, self-worth, pubertal timing, social network, and social integration were included. Results: A total of 8.2% had ever attempted suicide and 2.7% reported an attempt during the P-year study period. Logistic regression analysis showed that future attempts were predicted by previous attempt, female gender, young age, perceived early pubertal development (stronger among girls), suicidal ideation, alcohol intoxication, not living with both parents, and poor self-worth. Conclusions: The importance that the clinician ask about previous suicidal behaviors is underscored. Early pubertal timing (particularly among girls), loss of self-worth, and alcohol intoxication may serve as risk factors for future suicide attempts.

AB Objectives: Suicide rates have widely been reported to peak in spring and summer. A frequent hypothesis is that increased sunlight exposure alters biological mechanisms. However, few attempts have been made to systematically untangle the putative suicidogenic risk of sunlight exposure from that of seasonality. We examined whether average hours of daily sunlight in a month confer additional risk over month of year when predicting monthly suicide rates.
   Design: Historical population-based ecological longitudinal study.
   Setting and participants: We used 3 longitudinal studies (n=31 060 suicides) with monthly suicide and meteorological data from Greece (1992-2001), Victoria, Australia (1990-1998) and Norway (1969-2009).
   Intervention: We used a negative binomial regression to observe (1) the association of month of year with suicides, adjusting for different sunlight exposures, and (2) the association of sunlight exposure with suicides, adjusting for month of year. We then investigated claims that suicides were associated with daily sunlight exposures, defined by us as 2550 sunlight exposure combinations corresponding to a 1-50 days exposure window with lags of 0-50 days.
   Results: Using monthly data, the association between month of year and suicides remained after adjusting for mean daily hours of sunlight and change in the mean daily hours of sunlight. Adjusted for month of year, the associations between sunlight exposure and suicides became non-significant and attenuated towards the null (the coefficient estimate for mean daily hours of sunlight decreased in absolute magnitude by 72%). The findings were consistent across all 3 cohorts, both when analysed separately and combined. When investigating daily sunlight exposures, we found no significant results after correcting for multiple testing.
   Conclusions: Using monthly data, the robustness of our month of year effects, combined with the transient and modest nature of our sunlight effects, suggested that the association between sunlight exposure and suicide was a proxy for the association between seasonality and suicide.

AB Driver fatalities in motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) encompass accidents, suicides, and natural deaths when driving. The objective of this study was to determine the significance of pathology and other autopsy findings for drivers in fatal MVCs. Forensic autopsy records of driver fatalities in southeast Norway between 2000 and 2014 were studied retrospectively. Data from individual police and collision investigation reports were also collected and analyzed. In 406 driver fatalities, the male/female ratio was 340/66; 9% died from natural causes, 9% were suicides, 65% were culpable accidental deaths, 14% were nonculpable deaths, and 3% were undetermined deaths. Head injuries and thoracic injuries were the most common causes of death. A seatbelt had been worn in 50% of the fatalities, and its prevalence did not differ between accidental deaths and suicides. Blood levels of alcohol and/or drugs that indicated impairment at the time of the collision were found in 40% (105/262) of all culpable accidental deaths but in 50% (64/127) of drivers aged up to 35 years. Pathology (most often cardiovascular disease) suggestive of sudden incapacitation before the collision was present in 24% (62/264) of drivers who were culpable in the accident and in 70% (46/66) of culpable drivers older than 55 years. A substantial proportion of drivers are killed in accidental collisions that may have occurred as a result of either alcohol/drug impairment or preexisting disease. Suicides and natural deaths both constitute significant proportions of MVC fatalities and may be misclassified unless a full inquest including an autopsy is performed.

AB Repetition after attempted suicide is high with only limited research been put into effect studies. The Baerum-model from Norway offers a practical and affordable intervention. Our aim was to study the acceptability and effectiveness of a Baerum-model like intervention after attempted suicide using a quasi-experimental design. During a period in 2004, attempted suicide patients were offered follow-up care by a rapid-response outreach programme, an intervention lasting 6 months; a control group was established prospectively from a similar period in 2002. The design was an intent-to-treat analysis. The outcome was measured by: 1) participation by acceptance and adherence, 2) repetition of suicide attempt and suicide, and 3) including the number of repetitive acts in 1 year after the attempted suicide episode. Follow-up period was 1 year. Participation was 70%. There was a significant lower repetition rate in the intervention group, where the proportion of repetitive patients fell from 34% to 14%. There were also fewer suicidal acts, in total 37 acts in 58 patients in the control group and 22 acts in 93 patients for the intervention group. We have concluded that the outreach programme has a good feasibility because of high acceptability and adherence, and has an acceptable effectiveness in the follow up period of 1 year. We have therefore initiated a similar study using a randomization design in order to study efficacy.

AB Repetition after attempted suicide is high but only few effect studies have been carried out. The Baerum Model from Norway offers practical and affordable intervention for those not being offered psychiatric treatment. During a period from 2005-2007, all attempted suicide patients except those with major psychiatric diagnoses (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe/psychotic depression), were offered participation. The intervention group received the OPAC programme (outreach, problem solving, adherence, continuity) and the control group received treatment as usual (TAU). The intervention period was 6 months. After this intervention period, all patients were followed passively for an extra 6 months. The design was an intent-to-treat one. The outcomes were: 1) repetition of attempted suicide or suicide, and 2) total number of suicidal acts. A total of 200 patients were offered participation, 67 refused. Of the 133 participants, 69 were randomized to the OPAC programme and 64 to the (non-intervention) control group. Four in each group dropped out after initial participation. There was a significant lower proportion who repeated a suicide attempt the intervention group (proportion 8.7%) than in the control group (proportion 21.9%) and the number of repetitive acts was also significant lower (eight repetitions in the intervention group vs. 22 in the control group). In conclusion, our findings suggest a protective effect of the OPAC programme on the proportion who repeated a suicide attempt and on the total number of repetitions during the follow-up.

LA English
DT Article
DE Suicide; Bereavement; Norway; Social support; Socioeconomic status
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; CHILDREN
AB Background Parentally bereaved offspring have an increased suicide risk as a group, but the ability to identify specific individuals at risk on the basis of risk and protective factors is limited. The present study aimed to investigate to what degree different risk factors influence suicide risk in offspring bereaved by parental death from external causes.
   Methods: Based on Norwegian registers, individual-level data were retrieved for 375 parentally bereaved suicide cases and 7500 parentally bereaved gender-and age-matched living controls. Data were analysed with conditional logistic regression.
   Results: Bereaved offspring with low social support, indicated by offspring's single status and repeated changes in marital status and residence, had a significantly increased suicide risk compared to bereaved offspring with high social support. Moreover, low socioeconomic status, having an immigration background, having lost both parents and loss due to suicide significantly increased suicide risk.
   Limitations: Several variables relevant to bereavement outcome, such as coping mechanisms and the quality of the parent-offspring relationship are impossible to examine by utilizing population registers. Moreover, the availability of data did not enable the measurement of marital stability and residence stability across the entire lifespan for older individuals.
   Conclusions: Healthcare professionals should be aware of the additional risk posed by the identified risk factors and incorporate this knowledge into existing practice and risk assessment in order to identify individuals at risk and effectively target bereaved family and friends for prevention and intervention programs. Ideal follow-up for bereaved families should include a specific focus on mobilizing social support

AB Objectives. To investigate the experience of suicidal expressions (death wishes, life weariness, ideation, plans and attempts) in young Swedish Sami, their attitudes toward suicide (ATTS), and experience of suicidal expressions and completed suicide in significant others and to compare with Swedes in general.
   Methods. A cross-sectional study comprising 516 Swedish Sami, 18-28 years of age together with an age and geographically matched reference group (n = 218). Parts of the ATTS questionnaire have been used to cover different aspects of the suicidal complex. Data were analysed with regard to gender, occupation, counties and experience of negative societal treatment due to Sami background.
   Results. Both young Sami and young Swedes reported suicidal ideation, life weariness, and death wishes in a high degree (30-50%), but it was more common among the Sami. Having had plans to commit suicide showed a significant gender difference only in the Sami. The prevalence of suicide attempts did not differ significantly between Sami and Swedes. Subgroups of the Sami reported a higher degree of suicidal behaviour, Sami women and reindeer herders reported a 3, 5-fold higher odds of suicide attempts and a 2-fold higher odds having had plans committing suicide. Sami living in Vasterbotten/Jamtland/Vasternorrland and Sami with experience of ethnicity related bad treatment 2-fold higher odds of suicidal plans compared to those living in other counties.
   Conclusion. An increased occurrence of suicidal ideation/death wishes/life weariness in young Sami compared to young majority Swedes was found, but not an increased prevalence of suicide attempts and positive attitudes together with an increased awareness to handle suicide problems could be a contributing factor. Severe circumstances and experience of ethnicity-related bad treatment seems to contribute to increased levels of suicidal plans and attempts in subgroups of Sami.

AB Background. Suicide is the most common cause of death among youth in China. Method. A case-control psychological autopsy study in 23 geographically representative disease surveillance points around China collected information from family members and close associates of 114 persons aged 15-24 years who died by suicide (cases) and 91 who died of other injuries (controls).
   Results. Among the 114 suicides 61% were female, 88% lived in rural villages, 70% died by ingesting pesticides (most commonly stored in the home), 24% previously attempted suicide, and 45% met criteria of a mental illness at the time of death. Multivariate logistic regression identified several independent risk factors: severe life events within 2 days before death (OR 31.8, 95% CI 2.6-390.6), presence of any depressive symptoms within 2 weeks of death (OR 21.1, 95 % CI 4.6-97.2), low quality of life in the month before death (OR 9.7, 95% CI 2.8-34.1), and acute stress at time of death (moderate: OR 3.1, 95 % CI 0.8-11.9; high: OR 9.1, 95 % CI 1.2-66.8). A significant interaction between mental illness at time of death and gender indicated that diagnosis was an important predictor of suicide in males (OR 14.0, 95% CI 2.6-76.5) but not in females (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.0-3.6). Prior suicide attempt was related to suicide in the univariate analysis (OR 57.5) but could not be included in the multivariate model because no controls had made prior attempts.
   Conclusions. Suicide prevention efforts for youth in China must focus on restricting access to pesticides, early recognition and management of depressive symptoms and mental illnesses, improving resiliency, and enhancing quality of life.

AB Background: The aim of this study is to examine the validity and reliability of the Korean version of attitudes towards suicide (ATTS) on a group of university students, which would contribute to the evaluation of the ATTS as a useful tool of measuring attitudes toward suicide in South Korea with very high suicide rates.
   Methods: The subjects of the study were 195 undergraduates at Chung-Ang University, South Korea in 2013. The measure for assessing public attitudes towards suicide was ATTS made up of 34 items in English and the Korean version of it was produced by forward and backward translation procedure. To identify any factors unique to South Koreans' attitudes towards suicide, we applied exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to the data from 195 university students and was followed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to assess construct validity of the Korean version. The internal consistency of the scale was assessed using Cronbach's a and the assessment of the test-retest reliability was performed by intraclass correlation coefficients.
   Results: On the EFA analysis, were excluded, the tool had 11 factors (32 items), accounting for 62.99 % of the total variance in participants' responses. CFA failed to support 11-factor model of the scale. Six out of 11 factors were acceptable in terms of both internal consistency and test-retest reliability.
   Conclusions: Six factors of the Korean version of the ATTS had acceptable content validity and reliability. However, on the whole, it did not have good construct validity and thus further investigations are needed to develop a scale measuring true public attitudes toward suicide in South Korea.

AB The first Norwegian tools designed to assess the violence risk of the mentally ill were developed in the late 1980s, though the first national guidelines for both violence and suicide risk assessment were not published until two decades later in 2007. This article reviews the history of the field of forensic risk assessment in Norway from its humble beginnings to the present day. First an overview is provided of the history of forensic psychiatry and the criminal justice system. The main scope, however, is to discuss current research on and practice of risk assessment of violence in Norway, with an emphasis on the development and use of Norwegian risk assessment tools and methods. Particular attention is paid to instruments that follow the structured professional judgment model of risk assessment, as actuarial tools are rarely researched and not routinely implemented in clinical practice in Norway. Finally, a brief analysis is provided of some controversies concerning risk assessment in the expert witness reports on Anders Behring Breivik, who murdered 77 persons in 2011.

AB Predictors of self-reported suicide attempts were studied cross-sectionally and prospectively in order to discern which variables may account for the gender difference in such reports. A representative sample of Norwegian students (N = 9,679) in grades 7-12 were followed from 1992 to 1994. More girls (10.4%) than boys (6.0%) reported a previous attempt and more girls (3.3%) than boys (1.9%) reported an attempt during the study period. The gender difference in previous suicide attempts was significantly reduced when depressed mood was controlled, and was no longer significant when disordered eating was included. There was no gender difference in future attempts when previous attempts, depressed mood, physical appearance, pubertal timing, and romantic involvement were controlled. Girls' higher level of risk factors may account for their higher level of self-reported nonfatal suicidal behavior.

AB The present 12-year (1984-1995) surveillance study includes all hospitalized parasuicide patients (n = 1,031) as well as all suicides (n = 161) in the municipality of Baerum, a suburb of Oslo. The parasuicide rate decreased from 170 per 100,000 in 1984 to 79 per 100,000 in 1995 (53.5%). The parasuicide rates were lower than those in several comparable studies. Rates were higher for divorced females and separated males compared to married and other marital states, and the pattern of relative risk of parasuicide with respect to marital status was stable. Unemployment and substance abuse were positively correlated with parasuicidal behavior for both males and females. Approximately 33% reported one or more previous parasuicidal acts, and 21% repeated the parasuicide during the observation period. Ninety-four percent used self-poisoning as parasuicide method. A total of 2.4% of the parasuiciders committed suicide during the observation period. The mean annual suicide rate in Baerum was 19.0 per 100,000 compared to the national average of 14.7. The results support the notion of parasuicide and suicide being two different but overlapping populations. The implementation of a follow-up system for parasuiciders may have contributed to the reduced parasuicide rate during the study period.

AB Objective To examine the association between minor and major mental health impairment in late adolescence and death from suicide and unintentional injuries/accidents in men.
   Methods In Norway, all men attend a compulsory military medical and psychological examination. We included 558 949 men aged 17-19 years at the time of military examination in 1980-1999 and followed them up for death from suicide and unintentional injuries/accidents until the end of 2013. We used Cox proportional hazard models to examine the association between the presence of minor and major mental health impairments at examination and death from suicide and unintentional injuries/accidents.
   Results Compared to men with no mental health impairment, those with minor mental health impairment was associated with an increased risk of death from suicide (adjusted HR (HRadj)= 1.63, 95% CI 1.39 to 1.92), transport accidents (HRadj= 1.33, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.63), accidental poisoning (HRadj= 2.27, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.88) and other unintentional injuries/accidents (HRadj= 1.54, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.02). In men with major mental health impairment, the risk of death from suicide and accidental poisoning was elevated two times (HRadj= 2.29, 95% CI 1.85 to 2.85) and three times (HRadj= 3.53, 95% CI 2.61 to 4.79), respectively.
   Conclusions We found an increased risk of death from suicide and unintentional injuries/accidents in men who had minor and major mental health impairment at age 17-19 years.

AB Objective: To compare risk factors for self-harm in 2 groups: hospitalized adolescents who had attempted suicide and adolescents reporting suicide attempts in a community survey. Method: Ail suicide attempters aged 13 to 19 years admitted to medical wards (n = 91) in a region of Norway were assessed and interviewed. Risk factors were identified by comparisons with a general population sample participating in a questionnaire study in the same community (n = 1,736). In this population sample, a separate analysis of risk factors for reporting deliberate self-harm (n = 141) was performed, applying bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Results: Adjusted risk factors for suicide attempts in hospitalized adolescents were depression (odds ratio [OR] = 4.7), disruptive disorders (OR = 9.4), low self-worth (OR = 1.3), infrequent support from parents (OR = 3.3) or peers (OR = 3.3), parents' excessive drinking (OR = 4.3), and low socioeconomic status (OR = 2.4). For adolescents who self-reported self-harm, depression (OR = 3.1) and loneliness (OR = 1.13) were significant adjusted risk factors (p < .001). Low self-worth, low socioeconomic status, and little support from parents or peers characterized hospitalized suicidal adolescents compared with those who were not hospitalized. Conclusions: The risk factors were more powerful for hospitalized than for nonhospitalized adolescents. Prevention efforts should target the same factors for both groups, at a population level for nonhospitalized adolescents and at an individual level for hospitalized adolescents, with a focus on depression, low self-esteem, and family communication.

AB Background: Women prisoners are known to suffer from an accumulation of factors known to increase the risk for several major health problems. This study examines the prevalence of adverse childhood experiences (ACE) and the relationship between such experiences and suicide attempts and drug use among incarcerated women in Norway.
   Methods: A total of 141 women inmates (75% of all eligible) were interviewed using a structured interview guide covering information on demographics and a range of ACE related to abuse and neglect, and household dysfunction. The main outcome variables were attempted suicide and adult drug abuse.
   Results: Emotional, physical and sexual abuse during childhood was experienced by 39%, 36% and 19%, respectively, and emotional and physical neglect by 31% and 33%, respectively. Looking at the full range of ACE, 17% reported having experienced none, while 34% reported having experienced more than five ACEs. After controlling for age, immigrant background and marital status, the number of ACEs significantly increased the risk of attempted suicide and current drug abuse.
   Conclusion: The associations observed between early life trauma and later health risk behaviour indicate the need for early prevention. The findings also emphasize the important role of prison health services in secondary prevention among women inmates.

AB Background: Competence and attitudes to suicidal behaviour among physicians are important to provide high-quality care for a large patient group. The aim was to study different physicians' attitudes towards suicidal behaviour and their perceived competence to care for suicidal patients.
   Methods: A random selection (n = 750) of all registered General Practitioners, Psychiatrists and Internists in Norway received a questionnaire. The response rate was 40%. The Understanding of Suicidal Patients Scale (USP; scores < 23 = positive attitude) and items about suicide in case of incurable illness from the Attitudes Towards Suicide Questionnaire were used. Five-point Likert scales were used to measure self-perceived competence, level of commitment, empathy and irritation felt towards patients with somatic and psychiatric diagnoses. Questions about training were included.
   Results: The physicians held positive attitudes towards suicide attempters (USP = 20.3, 95% CI: 19.6-20.9). Internists and males were significantly less positive. There were no significant differences in the physicians in their attitudes toward suicide in case of incurable illness according to specialty. The physicians were most irritated and less committed to substance misuse patients. Self perceived competence was relatively high. Forty-three percent had participated in courses about suicide assessment and treatment.
   Conclusions: The physicians reported positive attitudes and relatively high competence. They were least committed to treat patients with substance misuse. None of the professional groups thought that patients with incurable illness should be given help to commit suicide. Further customized education with focus on substance misuse might be useful.

   PEOPLE; DEATH
AB Background: It is well established that patients with serious mental disorders have higher mortality than the general population, yet there are few studies on mortality of both natural and unnatural causes in patients with personality disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the mortality of in-patients with personality disorder diagnosis in a 27-year follow-up cohort in North Norway, with a special focus on gender differences.
   Method: Based on a hospital case register covering 1980 to 2006, 284 female and 289 male patients were included. The cohort was linked to the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry for information concerning mortality. The mortality rates were adjusted for age by applying a Poisson regression model. The relative mortality in men compared to women was tested with Cox regression with attained age as the time variable. The number of deaths to be expected among the patients if the mortality rates of the general population in Norway had prevailed was estimated and excess mortality, expressed by the standardized mortality ratio (SMR), calculated.
   Results: When compared to the mortality in the general population, men and women with personality disorder diagnoses had 4.3 (95% CI: 3.2 - 5.9) and 2.9 (95% CI: 1.9 - 4.5) times, respectively, increased total mortality. Patients with personality disorder diagnoses have particularly high mortality for unnatural deaths; 9.7 (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.3 - 15.1) times higher for men and 17.8 (95% CI: 10.1 - 30.3) for women, respectively, and even higher for suicides - 15 (95% CI: 9-27) for men and 38 (95% CI: 20-70) for women. The mortality due to natural causes was not statistically significantly increased in women, whereas men had 2.8 (95% CI: 1.8 - 4.4) times higher mortality of natural deaths than the general population.
   Conclusion: Compared to the general population, patients with a personality disorder have high mortality, particularly mortality from unnatural causes. The number of deaths caused by suicides is especially high for women. Men also have higher mortality of natural causes than the general population.

AB Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore how former suicidal inpatients experienced treatment and care in psychiatric wards in Norway following the implementation of the National guidelines for prevention of suicide in mental health care. The focus of the analysis was on aspects of treatment and care with potential for improvement. Method: We interviewed five former inpatients and analysed the data by means of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results: Experiencing a sense of companionship with the staff and receiving individualized treatment and care was important for the participants. This involved establishing trusting connections with mental health workers who treated them with respect, made them feel valued, and who recognized their suffering and needs. The formerly suicidal patients experienced being in a recovery process, which was promoted by the support of mental health workers. Although the participants reported mostly positive experiences, there were examples of insufficient care. Sometimes, they felt that their suffering and suicidality were not sufficiently recognized. Conclusion: Our study indicates that although there has been increased focus on suicidality in the mental health services, among other through clinical guidelines, some mental health workers still lack competence and should focus more fully on how to provide individualized care for suicidal inpatients.

AB Background. To describe suicide rates in the indigenous and non-indigenous populations of the Nenets Autonomous Okrug (NAO) in 2002-2012, as well as associated socio-demographic characteristics.
   Study design. Retrospective population-based mortality study.
   Methods. Data from autopsy reports were used to identify 252 cases of suicide in the NAO in 2002-2012. Data on socio-demographic characteristics of these cases were obtained from passports and medical records at local primary health care units, and were then linked to total population data from the Censuses in 2002 and 2010. Suicide rates for the indigenous Nenets population and the non-indigenous population were standardized to the European standard population. The rates were also estimated according to different socio-demographic characteristics and compared by calculating relative risks.
   Results. The crude suicide rates were 79.8 per 100,000 person-years (PYs) in the Nenets population and 49.2 per 100,000 PYs in the non-indigenous population. The corresponding standardized estimates were 72.7 per 100,000 PYs and 50.7 per 100,000 PYs. The highest suicide rates in the Nenets population were observed in the age group 20-29 years (391 per 100,000 PYs), and in females aged 30-39 years (191 per 100,000 PYs). Socio-demographic characteristics associated with high suicide rates in the Nenets population were age 20-39 years, male, urban residence, having secondary school or higher education, being an employee or employer, and being single or divorced. Males aged 20-29 years, and females aged 30-39 and aged 70 years and above had the highest suicide rates in the non-indigenous population (137.5, 21.6 and 29.9 per 100,000 PYs, respectively). The elevated suicide rates observed in the non-indigenous population were associated with male sex, rural residence, secondary school education, being an employee or employer, and being single or divorced.
   Conclusions. Suicide rates in the NAO were substantially higher among the indigenous Nenets population than the non-indigenous population, and were associated with different socio-demographic characteristics.

AB Background Since the late 1970s, the psychiatric service system in Norway has been changed gradually according to the principles of deinstitutionalisation.
   Aims To document the mortality of psychiatric patients in a deinstitutionalised service system.
   Methods The case register of a psychiatric hospital covering the period 1980-1992 was linked to the Central Register of Deaths. Age-adjusted death rates and standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed.
   Results Patients with organic psychiatric disorders had significantly higher mortality regardless of cause of death. SMRs ranged from 0.9 for death by cancer in women to 36.3 for suicide in men. For unnatural death, SMRs were highest in the first year after discharge. Compared to the periods 1950-1962 and 1963-1974, there has been an increase in SMRs for cardiovascular death and suicide in both genders.
   Conclusions Deinstitutionalisation seems to have had as its cost a relative rise both in cardiovascular death and unnatural deaths for both genders, but most pronounced in men.

ID POPULATION; ONSET; MORTALITY; SURVIVAL
AB Background: The literature offers discrepant findings regarding age at death in individuals with Huntington disease (HD).
   Objective: To study the age at death and causes of death in males and females with a diagnosis of HD in Norway.
   Methods: Registry study of deaths in 1986-2015 using data from two national registries: the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry (NCDR) and the registry of the Centre for Rare Disorders (CRD), Oslo University Hospital.
   Results: Mean age at death for individuals with HD was found to be 63.9 years (NCDR) and 61.7 years (CRD), compared to a mean of 76.9 years in the general population (NCDR). There were no significant gender differences for age at death in individuals with HD. The significant increase in age at death within the general population from 1986 to 2015was not observed in individuals with HD. In 73.5% of individuals with HD, the underlying cause of death was HD, followed by cardiovascular diseases, cancer and respiratory diseases. The most common immediate cause of death was respiratory diseases (44.2%). Suicide was a more common cause of death in the population with HD (2.3%) compared to the general population (1.3%).
   Conclusion: The age at death of individuals with HD was stable over a period of 30 years and 13.3 years lower than in the general population. Longer life expectancy for females from the general population was not found in females with HD. Suicide was more common among individuals with HD compared to the general population.

TI Suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-harm among university students:

SO BJPSYCH OPEN
LA English

DE Deliberate self-harm; epidemiology; suicide
ID INJURY
AB Background
   Suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-harm (NSSH) are major public health concerns that affect millions of young people worldwide. Consequently, there is a strong need for up-to-date epidemiological data in this population.
   Aims
   To provide prevalence and trend estimates of suicidal thoughts and behaviours and NSSH thoughts and behaviour in university students.
   Method
   Data are from a 2018 national health survey for higher education in Norway. A total of 50 054 full-time students (69.1% women) aged 18-35 years participated (response rate 31%). Suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and NSSH were assessed with three items drawn from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, and thoughts of NSSH were assessed with one item from the Child and Adolescent Self-Harm in Europe study.
   Results
   Lifetime suicidal thoughts were reported by 21.0%, and 7.2% reported having such thoughts within the past year. In total, 4.2% reported a suicide attempt, of whom 0.4% reported attempting suicide within the past year. The prevalence of lifetime NSSH behaviour and thoughts was 19.6% and 22.6%, respectively. All four suicidal behaviour and NSSH variables were more common among students who were single, living alone and with a low annual income, as well as among immigrants. There was an increase in suicidal thoughts from 2010 (7.7%) to 2018 (11.4%), which was evident in both men and women.
   Conclusions
   The observed high and increasing prevalence of suicidal thoughts and NSSH among college and university students is alarming, underscoring the need for further research, preferably registry-linked studies, to confirm whether the reported prevalence is representative of the student population as a whole.

TI Why suicide? Elderly people who committed suicide and their experience
   of life in the period before their death
SO INTERNATIONAL PSYCHOGERIATRICS
LA English
DT Article
DE suicide; aged; qualitative research; psychological autopsy
ID OLDER; DISORDER
AB Background: The objective of this study is to acquire an understanding of the suicides among a group of elderly people by studying how they experienced their existence towards the end of life.
   Methods: This is a psychological autopsy study based on qualitative interviews with 63 informants in relation to 23 suicides committed by persons aged over 65 in Norway. Informants who knew the deceased persons well describe what the elderly person communicated to them about their experience of life in the period before the suicide and how they as informants saw and understood this. The informants comprise relatives, family doctors and home-based care nurses. The analysis of the interviews follows the systematic text condensation method.
   Results: The descriptions are divided into three main elements: the elderly persons' experiences of life, their perception of themselves, and their conceptions of death. "Experience of life" has two sub-topics: this life has been lived and life as a burden. Everything that had given value to their life had been lost and life was increasingly experienced as a burden. Their "perception of themselves" concerned losing oneself Functional decline meant that they no longer had freedom of action and self-determination. "Conceptions of death" involve the following sub-topics: acknowledgement/acceptance and death is better than life. Life had entered into its final phase, and they seemed to accept death. For some time, many of them had expressed the wish to die.
   Conclusions: The results lead us to argue that their suicides should be considered as existential choices. The sum total of the different forms of strain had made life a burden they could no longer bear. Age meant that they were in a phase of life that entailed closeness to death, which they could also see as a relief.

AB Objectives. To study the prevalence and psychosocial and ethnocultural correlates Of self-mutilation and/or suicidal behaviour ill Indigenous Sami and majority Norwegian adolescents ill north Norway.
   Study design. A cross-sectional questionnaire Study.
   Methods. A total of 487 students, aged 13-16 years in 21 junior high schools and 247 parents participated in this school based questionnaire Study conducted in 1990 in Finnmark. the County in Norway with the highest suicide rates. Sociodemographics, substance use, thriving at school, ethnocultural factors Such its ethnic context, ethnic identity, ethnic language competence and ethnic parentage, self-reported its well as parent-reported behavioural/emotional problems were assessed.
   Results. Self-mutilation and/or suicidal attempts within the last 6 months were reported by 12.5% of the adolescents and 14.8% reported having suicidal thoughts. Ill univariate analyses, significant gender differences Occurred for both ethnic groups, With more girls reporting self-mutilation and suicidal behaviour. However, in logistic regression analyses adjusting for all other significant variables, the gender difference disappeared. No significant ethnic differences occurred in prevalence. Although factors associated with self-mutilation and suicidal behaviour varied between Sami and Norwegian adolescents, self-reported anxiety/depression was it strong and significant correlate to both self-mutilation/suicide attempts and Suicidal thoughts ill both ethnic groups. Parents reported less emotional/behavioural problems associated with self-mutilation and/or suicidal behaviour than the adolescents did. Ethnic identification in Sami and ethnic context in Norwegian adolescents Occurred in independent analyses as significantly related to self-mutilation and/or suicidal behaviour, but turned insignificant when adjusting for all other significant variables. Conclusions. In contrast to several other Indigenous groups the prevalence of self-mutilation and/or suicidal behaviour did not differ between Sami and Norwegian gian adolescents. In both ethnic groups, the effect of ethnocultural factors disappeared when controlled for other variables such as anxiety/depression. Across both ethnic groups, anxiety and depression problems occurred as a common and significant correlate for self-mutilation and suicidal behaviour. (Int J Circumpolar Health 2009; 68(3):235-248)

AB This article analyses and compares recent research on Scandinavian physicians' attitudes towards, as well as their practice of, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. The studies discussed are quite dissimilar in their design, resulting in considerable difficulties as far as comparability is concerned. Such difficulties are common in these fields of research. As an intended contribution to the amendment of future research, we suggest what we take to be detailed and precise definitions of the terms euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide for use internationally. Our definitions, or interpretations, basically draw on the Dutch experience and understanding of these terms. The Dutch approach implies that acts of abstention from life-prolonging treatment, i.e., withholding and withdrawing treatment, and pain and symptom treatment that theoretically could shorten life (including terminal sedation) are to be considered,normal medical practice'. Furthermore, death is seen as having natural causes in all of these acts. That, however, is not the case with euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. When a physician performs either of these acts, he or she is required to state 'unnatural death' in the patient's death certificate. Our conceptual suggestions do not address the ethical status of the various medical decisions that are made with regard to the death of patients; our aim is conceptual clarity only, As far as euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in Scandinavia is concerned, even though comparisons prove difficult, we do think some observations may be made: physicians from Norway, Denmark and Sweden display differences in both attitude and practice concerning these phenomena. Norwegian physicians are most restrictive with regard to attitude. Danish and Swedish physicians display a more liberal attitude, the latter being the most liberal. These findings did not fit the physicians' practice. Danish physicians have performed euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide more often than Norwegian physicians. Swedish physicians, even though they are the most liberal when it comes to attitude, appear never to have performed euthanasia and very seldom physician-assisted suicide.

AB Background: The influence of seasons on mood disorders is controversial. Objective: To examine monthly variations in admissions for mania and depressions including variations with sex and age and correlations with frequencies of suicides. Methods: All admissions for mania or depression (N = 4341) in a population of 1,800,000 with 35,285 admissions in the years 1992-1996 were analysed. All 14,503 suicides in Norway the years 1969-1996 were also analysed. Results: Admissions for depression had a significant monthly variation for women (chi(2) = 29.78, df = 11, P < 0.005) with the highest peak in November and for men (chi(2) = 19.69, df = 11, P < 0.05) with the highest peak in April. Among women increasing age correlated negatively with the range of monthly observed/expected ratios (r(s) = -0.943, N = 6, P < 0.01) and with a of maximal monthly observed/expected ratio (r(s) = -0.943, N = 6, P < 0.01). Among men suicides correlated with admissions for depression (r = 0.647, N = 12, P < 0.05) and mania (r = 0.678, N = 12, P < 0.05). Limitations: The time of admission to hospital are not identical to onset of affective episode. The study was done retrospectively. No sociocultural or physical environmental data were investigated. Conclusion: A hypothesis of an influence of seasons on mood disorders is supported. Younger women seem to be especially vulnerable. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Public health organizations have recommended restricted access and safe storage practices as means to reduce firearm injuries and deaths. We aimed to assess the effect of four firearm restrictions on firearm deaths in Norway 1969-2009. Methods: All deaths due to firearm discharge were included (5,660 deaths, both sexes). The statistical analysis to assess impact of firearm legislations was restricted to males because of the sex disproportionality (94% were males). Results: A total of 89% of firearm deaths (both sexes) were classified as suicide, 8% as homicide, and 3% as unintentional (accident). During the past four decades, male accidental firearm death rates were reduced significantly by 90%. Male firearms suicide rates increased from 1969 to 1991 by 166%, and decreased by 62% from 1991 to 2009. Despite the great reduction in male accidental firearm deaths, we were unable to demonstrate effects of the laws. In contrast, we found that a 1990 regulation, requiring a police permit before acquiring a shotgun, had a beneficial impact on suicide in the total sample and in those aged 15-34 years. Male firearm homicides decreased post-2003 regulation regarding storing home guard weapons in private homes. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that two laws could have contributed to reduce male firearm mortality. It is, however, a challenge to measure the role of four firearm restrictions. The null findings are inconclusive, as they may reflect no true impact or study limitations.

AB Background: Thinking about suicide is an indicator of suicide risk. Suicide rates are higher among doctors than in the population. The main aims of this study are to describe the changes in the lifetime prevalence of suicidal feelings from 2000 to 2010 and the possible predictors of serious suicidal thoughts in 2010 among Norwegian doctors. Differences in lifetime prevalence of suicidal feelings between Norwegian doctors in 2010 and German doctors in 2006 will be also described.
   Methods: Longitudinal and cross-sectional study based on questionnaire data from 2000 and 2010, including approximately 1,600 Norwegian doctors. In Germany, cross-sectional study based on questionnaire data from 2006 among a sample of 3,295 doctors. The main outcome measures were the lifetime prevalence of suicidal feelings (felt life was not worth living, wished own death, had thoughts of taking own life).
   Results: The prevalences in 2000 and 2010 of ever had feelings of life not worth living were 48 (44 to 52) % and 45 (41 to 49) %, of ever wished own death 27 (23 to 30) % and 23 (20 to 26) %, and of ever had thoughts of taking own life 29 (16 to 33) % and 24 (21 to 27) %. Paired t-tests among those who responded both in 2000 and 2010 show significant reductions for felt life not worth living (t = -3.4; p = 0.001), wished own death (t = -3.1; p = 0.002) and had thoughts of taking own life (t = -3.5; p < 0.0001). In 2010, significant predictors of serious suicidal thoughts in a multivariate model were low subjective well-being (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.52-0.90), poor or average self-rated health (2.36; 1.25-4.45) and high psychosocial work stress (1.92; 1.06-3.46), controlled for age, gender, speciality and job satisfaction. Norwegian doctors in 2010 compared with their German counterparts in 2006 reported quite similar prevalences of suicidal feelings.
   Conclusions: Suicidal feelings among Norwegian doctors decreased from 2000 to 2010. Individual and work-related factors may to certain explain these findings. Compared with other professionals in Norway and doctors in Germany, Norwegian doctors showed no higher risk of suicidal thoughts.

DT Article
DE Injury deaths; intentional poisoning; poisoning mortality; unintentional
   poisoning
AB Context: Poisoning is an important category of avoidable deaths in Norway and an important public health issue. Close monitoring of any development in this field is essential for effective preventive measures. Objective: To assess the pattern and trends of poisoning mortality in Norway from 2003 to 2012 based on official mortality data. Materials and methods: This is a population-based registry study. We analyzed the underlying external cause of death data, in order to assess poisoning deaths (ICD-10) by accidents (X40-X49); intentional self-harm (suicide) (X60-X69); assault (homicide) (X85-X90); and poisoning of undetermined intent (Y10-Y19). We compared poisoning deaths to other injury mechanisms and used multiple injury cause data to identify substances involved in poisoning deaths. Poisson regression was applied to estimate the trend. Results: Poisoning was the second leading mechanism of injury deaths in Norway from 2003 to 2012, causing between 424 and 496 deaths each year. The rates of poisoning deaths varied between 8 and 11 per 100,000 inhabitants, with a peak in 2004. About 3366 of the 4620 poisoning deaths in the decade were accidental. Opioids were the most common causative agents. Heroin caused 150 deaths in 2004. The numbers fell to 63 in 2012 but showed great yearly variations. Deaths by methadone increased from 24 in 2003 to 61 in 2012. Discussion: Poisoning mortality rates declined from 2003 to 2012. Interpretation of the data, however, should be done with caution, and comparison with other countries may be biased due to differences in data production procedures. Evaluation of the effect of preventive measures to reduce mortality should be emphasized. Conclusion: Poisonings remain a significant cause of mortality by injury in Norway. Emphasis should be placed on following the trends closely, especially regarding methadone deaths.

AB The aim of the study was to explore differences and similarities between the various non-natural manners of death (accident, suicide, homicide) regarding toxicological findings in illicit drug users. Medicolegal autopsy reports from the Institute of Forensic Medicine University of Oslo concerning deaths from 2000 to 2009 were investigated. Those aged 20-59 whose manner of death was non-natural and who tested positive for any narcotic drug (morphine/heroin, amphetamines, ecstasy, cannabis, LSD, PCP, and high levels of GHB in addition to methadone and buprenorphine) were selected. All substance findings were registered and categorized (narcotics, ethanol, and medicinal products). Of the 1603 autopsies that met the selection criteria, 1204 were accidental intoxications, 122 accidents other than intoxication, 114 suicides by intoxication, 119 non-intoxication suicides, and 44 victims of homicide. Poly drug use was found in all manners of death. The drug profile as well as the mean number of substances (illicit drugs and medicinal products) varied from 2.9 to 4.6 substances per case, depending on the manner of death. Intoxication suicides had the highest number of substances and a total drug profile similar to accidental intoxications. Non-intoxication suicides had a total drug profile similar to homicide and accidents other than intoxication. The number of substances found per case increased during the decade, mainly due to increased findings of methadone, cannabis, amphetamines, and benzodiazepines. Methadone findings increased much more than buprenorphine. Methadone was found 20 times more often than buprenorphine in accidental intoxication cases. In summary, poly drug findings are common in adults who suffer a non-natural death while using illicit drugs. The different manners of death have some specific characteristics and significant differences regarding drug profile. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) is a therapeutic framework that appears promising to reduce suicidal ideation and suicidal cognition. CAMS has not previously been evaluated in a standard specialized mental health care setting for patients with suicidal problems in general. In this pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) we will investigate if CAMS is more effective than treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Effects will also be investigated on mental health and symptom relief in general and upon readmissions to inpatient units.
   Methods/design: The study is a multicenter, observer-blinded, superiority, two-armed RCT which will include patients from four clinical departments at Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, Norway. We aim to include 100 patients with moderate to strong suicidal problems, as defined by a score of 13 or more on Beck's Scale for Suicide Ideation - Current. Patients are included regardless of diagnosis. Randomization will be performed using a stratified four-block procedure with treatment unit as the stratification variable. The duration of treatment will vary depending on patients' needs and clinical assessments. Patients are interviewed by research staff at four checkpoints: baseline, 2 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. Central outcome measures are the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation -Current, Outcome Questionnaire - 45, and Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Count.
   Discussion: This pragmatic trial is effectuated within the Public Health Care System in Norway, where patients have multiple problems and diagnoses and therapists have a high work load. Results from this trial are highly generalizable to a typical everyday clinical setting, and one should expect similar results if CAMS is implemented in the future as a standard component in specialized mental health care systems.

AB Background: Despite an increased risk of suicide among physicians Lye lack studies on prevalence and predictors of suicidal ideation among medical students and young doctors. Method: A prospective study of Norwegian medical students (n = 522) re-examined after the first postgraduate year. comprising suicidal thoughts and attempts, perceived study str ess, job stress, and personality. Results: The previous year prevalence of suicidal thoughts was 14% at both points of time. The lifetime prevalence was 43%, while 8% had planned suicide, and 1.4% had attempted suicide. Suicidal ideation in medical school was predicted by lack of control, personality trait, single marital status, negative life events and mental distress (anxiety and depression). In the first postgraduate year, mental distress was the most important predictor, but before controlling for this variable, job stress, vulnerability (neuroticism), single status, and less working hours were independent predictors. Prospectively, suicidal thoughts and vulnerability as student predicted postgraduate suicidal ideation. Conclusions: The level of suicidal thoughts was high, but 1the level of attempts was low. Clinical implications: Preventive efforts should be directed both at the students' abilities to cope with stress and at mental health services for young doctors. Limitations of study: The lower response rate at follow-up (57%) may reduce external validity. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Seasonal variations of violence have been the subject of some controversy. Norway, situated between latitudes 58 degrees and 72 degrees N, has considerable seasonal variations of light and provides a good opportunity for studies of seasonality.
   Method: The monthly numbers of police reports of violent incidents in 1991-1997 were obtained for the entire Norwegian population of 4,450,000 inhabitants and separately for each of seven Norwegian cities at different latitudes.
   Results: A total of 82,537 episodes of violence were recorded. There was a significant Variation in violent incidents between months, with a minimum daily frequency of 28.7 in March and a maximum daily frequency of 35.1 in lune. The frequency curve had one significant peak in May through June and another significant peak in October through November. The monthly frequency of violence correlated with the absolute value of monthly change in length of day from the previous month. In the seven cities the highest monthly ratio of observed to expected frequencies increased with latitude. With increasing latitude, the months with the largest increase in Violence came rater both in the spring and in the fall.
   Conclusions: There is a distinct pattern of seasonal variation in the frequency of violence that varies systematically with latitude. This pattern resembles the seasonal pattern of some forms of suicide, hospitalization for affective disorders, and mood and activity in the general population.

AB Objectives. Unnatural deaths among Indigenous populations, including the Swedish Sami, occur more often than among the general population. To find prevention strategies, we explored the circumstances of the unnatural deaths of members of reindeer-herding Sami families.
   Study design. The number of deaths from among a cohort of 7,482 members of reindeer-herding Sami families were retrieved from the National Board of Health and Welfare for the years 1961 2001.
   Methods. An evaluation of the information from autopsy records at the National Board of Forensic Medicine, police reports, and available medical records identified 158 unnatural deaths. These were then analysed in detail.
   Results. Transport-related deaths and suicides were the most common unnatural deaths among Swedish reindeer-herding Sami family members. Suicides contributed to 23% of all deaths, road traffic accidents to 16%, and snowmobile fatalities to 11%. The accidents generally reflected an "outdoor lifestyle" and the working conditions were characterized by the use of off-road vehicles such as snowmobiles. Half of the number of victims tested positive for alcohol and alcohol abuse was documented in 15% of all victims.
   Conclusions. The results indicate that alcohol is an important factor in preventing unnatural deaths among reindeer-herding Sami, together with increased safety of both on-road and off-road transportation. (Int J Circumpolar Health 2010; 69(2):129-137)

AB Aims. To assess the relative importance of various adverse childhood experiences for the occurrence of later suicidal behavior in terms of experienced suicide attempts and suicidal ideation among drug addicts, and to assess possible gender differences in these associations. Design. Cross-sectional survey. Setting. Residential and outpatient treatment units for drug addicts in Norway. Participants. National sample of 800 drug addicts admitted to treatment in 1992-93. Measurements. Self-reports of attempted suicide (life-time prevalence) and suicidal ideation (1 month prior to admission). Data collected from structured interviews with therapists. Findings. A total of 38.0% of the drug addicts reported having attempted suicide once or several times; the proportion was higher among those who reported various adverse experiences during childhood (sexual or violent assaults, bullying, parents' alcohol abuse, parents' psychiatric problems, school adjustment problems and own psychiatric problems), and increased with number of areas of such adverse childhood experiences. Forty-two per cent of the clients reported suicidal ideation in the month prior to admission, displaying the same kind of associations with adverse childhood experiences, and also a significant association when controlling for previous suicide attempts. There were relatively small gender differences in self-reported suicidal behavior, the proportion being somewhat higher among women, but only among those with no or few adverse childhood experiences. Conclusions. Self-reported suicidal behavior and ideation among drug addicts is highly prevalent and more so with increasing number of areas of childhood adversities.

DT Article
ID 6 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES; DECISION-MAKING; CARE; CHOICES
AB BackgroundEnd-of-life decisions, including limitation of life prolonging treatment, may be emotionally, ethically and legally challenging. Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) are illegal in Norway. A study from 2000 indicated that these practices occur infrequently in Norway.
   MethodsIn 2012, a postal questionnaire addressing experience with limitation of life-prolonging treatment for non-medical reasons was sent to a representative sample of 1792 members of the Norwegian Medical Association (7.7% of the total active doctor population of 22,500). The recipients were also asked whether they, during the last 12 months, had participated in euthanasia, PAS or the hastening of death of non-competent patients.
   ResultsSeventy-one percent of the doctors responded. Forty-four percent of the respondents reported that they had terminated treatment at the family's request not knowing the patient's own wish, doctors below 50 and anaesthesiologists more often. Anaesthesiologists more often reported to have terminated life-prolonging treatment because of resource considerations. Six doctors reported having hastened the death of a patient the last 12 months, one by euthanasia, one by PAS and four had hastened death without patient request. Male doctors and doctors below 50 more frequently reported having hastened the death of a patient.
   ConclusionForgoing life-prolonging treatment at the request of the family may be more frequent in Norway that the law permits. A very small minority of doctors has hastened the death of a patient, and most cases involved non-competent patients. Male doctors below 50 seem to have a more liberal end-of-life practice.

AB Objectives: To study mortality cause of death and risk indicators for death in Norwegian patients with spinal cord injury.
   Design: A cross-sectional study with retrospective data.
   Subjects: All patients (n=387) with traumatic spinal cord injury admitted to Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital, Norway, during the period 1961-82.
   Methods: Medical records were reviewed retrospectively. Causes of death were collected from Statistics Norway and death certificates. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated for the entire sample and for causes of death. To explore risk indicators for death, a Cox regression model was used.
   Results: During the observation period, 1961-2002, 142 patients died. The main causes of death were pneumonia/influenza (16%), ischaemic heart diseases (13%) and urogenital diseases (13%). SMR was 1.8 for men and 4.9 for women. Cause-specific SMRs were markedly elevated for urogenital diseases, suicide, pneumonia/influenza, urogenital cancer, and diseases of the digestive system. Risk indicators for death were: higher age at injury, tetraplegia, functionally complete spinal cord injury, pre-injury cardiovascular disease, alcohol or substance abuse and psychiatric diagnosis.
   Conclusion: The SMRs show that life expectancy is reduced in chronic spinal cord injury in Norway, more for women than for men. Cause-specific SMRs and risk indicators suggest that the high mortality rates after spinal cord injury to a certain degree are related to preventable aetiologies To maximize longevity in chronic spinal cord injury, more attention must be paid to co-morbidity.

AB Background The epidemiology of suicidality shows considerable variation across sites. However, one of the strongest predictors of suicide is a suicidal attempt. Knowledge of the epidemiology of suicidal ideas and attempts in the general population as well as in the health care system is of importance for designing preventive strategies. In this study, we will explore the role of the psychiatric hospital in suicide prevention by investigating treated incidence of suicidal ideation and attempt, and further, discern whether sociodemographic, clinical and service utilization factors differ between these two groups at admission.
   Methods The study was a prospective cohort study on treated incidence in a 1-year period and 12-month follow-up. The two psychiatric hospitals in northern Norway, serving a population of about 500,000 people, participated in the study. A total of 676 first-time admissions were retrospectively checked for suicidality at the time of admission. A study sample of 168 patients was found eligible for logistic regression analysis to elucidate the risk profiles of suicidal ideators versus suicidal attempters. GAF, HoNOS and SCL-90-R were used to assess symptomatology at baseline.
   Results 52.2% of all patients admitted had suicidal ideas at admission and 19.7% had attempted suicide. In the study sample, there were no differences in risk profile between the two groups with regard to sociodemographic and clinical factors. Males who had made a suicide attempt were less likely to have been in contact with an out-patient clinic before the attempt. The rating scales not measuring suicidality directly showed no differences in symptomatology.
   Conclusion The findings provide evidence for the importance of the psychiatric hospital in suicide prevention. About half of the admissions were related to suicidality and the similar risk profiles found in suicidal ideators and suicidal attempters indicate that it is the ideators who mostly need treatment that get admitted to the hospital, and should be evaluated and treated with equal concern as those who have attempted suicide.

AB In this study, we attempt to even out some of the imbalance in suicide research caused by the fact that most such research has been conducted in the Western part of the world with the corresponding common disregard of the potential problems in generalizing findings to different cultural settings. Our point of departure was to look at suicidal behavior as communication and our main purpose was to investigate whether Qvortrup's semiotic four-factor model, which has been empirically supported in the West, would be applicable in an African context, exemplified by Uganda. Interviews of patients admitted to hospital following an act of nonfatal suicidal behavior were conducted in Uganda and Norway and the data were compared. The results showed that the four-factor structure found in the West was not applicable in the Ugandan context, but that two by two of these factors were collapsed into a two-factor model in Uganda: One factor regarding the external dialog and one factor regarding the internal dialog. Some differences and some similarities were found between Norway and Uganda when suicidal behavior was considered as a communicative act. The results are discussed in terms of the differences in the psychological characteristics of the suicidal persons in the two countries, as well as the different cultural settings of the study.

   OUTCOMES; NUCLEUS; TRIAL
AB Background: Ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus (VIM) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for tremor, but there is limited data on long-term efficacy and mortality after VIM-DBS. Here we report the analysis of patient satisfaction and mortality in all patients treated in our center 1996-2010 with VIM-DBS for essential tremor (ET).
   Methods: Forty-six consecutive patients were included in this study. Medical records were reviewed, and a follow-up questionnaire was sent to all surviving patients.
   Results: Seventy percent of all possible participants (26 patients) answered the questionnaire. Follow-up time for the responding patients was median 6.0 years (2-16). Median self-reported score on visual analogue scale of the initial postoperative effect on tremor was 8.5 (0.1-10), with a significant reduction to 7.4 (0-10) at follow-up (p = 0.001). Patients reported a median score of 10 (0-10) for overall patient satisfaction with VIM-DBS treatment. Eight patients (17%) died after median 8.9 years (0.6-15) after surgery, at median age 77.4 years (70-89). One patient (2%) committed suicide seven months after the operation. Calculated standard mortality ratio among ET patients was 1.3 (CI 0.6-2.6), similar to the general population.
   Conclusion: We found no significant increase in mortality in this cohort of VIM-DBS operated ET patients compared to the general population in Norway. The patients reported high long-term satisfaction and continuing effect of VIM-DBS on tremor even after many years. VIM-DBS therefore seems to be an effective symptomatic long-term treatment of ET. However, one patient committed suicide. Only one other suicide has previously been reported after VIM-DBS. It is therefore still unclear whether VIM-DBS increases suicide risk.

AB Objectives: The Survey of Living Condition in the Arctic (SLiCA) is an international research project on health and living conditions among Arctic indigenous peoples. The main objective of this article is to examine the prevalence of self-reported suicide thoughts among the study population in Alaska, Greenland, Sweden and Norway.
   Study design: Population-based survey.
   Methods: Indigenous participants aged 16 years (15 years in Greenland) and older living in traditional settlement regions in Alaska, Sweden and Norway and across the entire Greenland were invited to participate. Data were collected in three periods: in Alaska from January 2002 to February 2003, in Greenland from December 2003 to August 2006, in Sweden from spring 2004 to 2006 and in Norway in 2003 and from June 2006 to June 2008. The principal method in SLiCA was standardised face-to-face interviews using a questionnaire. A questionnaire had among other things, questions about health, education, traditional activities, ethnicity and suicidal thoughts.
   Results: Information about suicidal thoughts, gender and age were available in 2,099 participants between the ages of 16 and 84 from Alaska, Greenland, Sweden and Norway. Greenland had the highest rates of suicidal thoughts when adjusting for age and gender (p = 0.003). When stratifying on age and gender, significant differences across countries were only found for females in the two youngest age groups. Differences in suicidal thoughts across countries could partly be explained by educational level.
   Conclusion: Swedish respondents had less suicidal thoughts than those in any other countries. In the future, analyses of suicidal thoughts should take socioeconomic status into account as well as self-reported health, depression and anxiety.

AB The purpose of the present study was to measure the prevalence of self-harm (SH) behaviours and examine potential differences in characteristics among adolescents reporting on self-harm (SH), depending on whether they had attempted suicide (SA), performed nonsuicidal self-harm (NSSH), or both.
   Cross-sectional survey of 11,440 adolescents aged 14-17 years in the city of Oslo, Norway. Responses regarding measures of lifetime SH and risk factors were collected. The response rate was 92.7 %. Data were analysed by segregating SH responses into the categories of NSSH, SA, and NSSH + SA.
   Among all respondents, 4.3 % reported NSSH, 4.5 % reported SA, 5.0 % reported both NSSH and SA, and 86.2 % reported no SH. The group reporting to have engaged in both behaviours comprised more girls and reported more suicidal ideation, problematic lifestyles, poorer subjective health, and more psychological problems compared with the other groups. The four groups could be distinguished by one discriminant function that accounted for most of the explained variance.
   Our findings suggest that NSSH and SA are parts of the same dimensional construct in which suicidal ideation carries much of the weight in adolescents from a school-based sample. They also indicate the group of adolescents who seems to alternate between NSSH and SA is more burdened with mental ill-health and behavioural problems compared with others. These adolescents should therefore be targeted by clinicians and school health personnel for identification and provision of adequate help and services.

AB Background: Suicide attempts (SA) are more frequent in bipolar disorder (BD) than in most other mental disorders. Prevention strategies would benefit from identifying the risk factors of SA recurrence in BD. Substance use disorders (SUD) (including tobacco-related) are strongly associated with both BD and SA, however, their specific role for the recurrence of SA in BD remains inadequately investigated. Thus, we tested if tobacco smoking - with or without other SUDs - was independently associated with recurrent SA in BD.
   Methods: 916 patients from France and Norway with ascertained diagnoses of BD and reliable data about SA and SUD were classified as having no, single, or recurrent (>= 2) SA. Five SUD groups were built according to the presence/absence/combination of tobacco, alcohol (AUD) and cannabis use disorders. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify the correlates of SA recurrence.
   Results: 338 (37%) individuals reported at least one SA, half of whom (173, 51%) reported recurrence. SUD comorbidity was: tobacco smoking only, 397 (43%), tobacco smoking with at least another SUD, 179 (20%). Regression analysis showed that tobacco smoking, both alone and comorbid with AUD, depressive polarity of BD onset and female gender were independently associated with recurrent SA.
   Limitations: Lack of data regarding the relative courses of SA and SUD and cross-national differences in main variables.
   Conclusion: Tobacco smoking with- or without additional SUD can be important risk factors of SA recurrence in BD, which is likely to inform both research and prevention strategies.

AB Background: Social inequalities in health can to a substantial degree be explained by social causation. However, indirect selection by early life factors has been suggested. The main aim of this study was to estimate how much adult social gradients in selected psychiatric outcomes depended on parental and individual characteristics in early life. Methods: The population comprised all males born in Norway 1967-71 (n = 170 678). We compiled data on several social and biological variables from birth onwards from different national registers. Health outcomes were collected from the Cause of Death Register (suicide) and the Labour and Welfare Administration (psychiatric disability, psychiatric sickness absence). Indicator of socio-economic position was education level at the age of 28 years. Men were followed up between 4 and 9 years from the age of 29 years. Results: Crude rates per 100 000 person-years were 21.8 (suicide), 145.7 (disability) and 1164.7 (sickness absence). Social inequalities were strong and consistent for all outcomes. Parental and individual characteristics accounted for a substantial part of the social inequalities in neurosis or personality disorder disability (44.1%) and a moderate role for inequalities in psychiatric sickness absence (25.6%), schizophrenia disability (20.7%) and suicide (17.4%). General ability at the age of 18 years had strongest influence on the social health gradients. Suicide and schizophrenia disability were associated with a combination of high parental and low own education level. Conclusion: This study indicates that indirect selection explains a substantial part of social inequalities in certain psychiatric outcomes and that early life prevention is important to reduce health gradients.

AB Knowledge is needed of mental health in relation to life events of former acute child and adolescent outpatients at risk of suicide.
   The present study describes the long-term mental health outcome of young adults who as children or adolescents were referred to outpatient psychiatry for mental health problems, and identifies putative mental health statistical outcome predictors at follow-up, with focus on life events.
   One hundred patients referred to treatment at child and adolescent outpatient clinics in Nordland County, Norway, during 1990-1994 were interviewed face to face, 5-9 years after referral.
   At follow-up, life events at young age were associated with the mental health status in spite of referral and acute psychotherapeutic intervention. There was a general effect of life events at young age, affecting a large number of mental health variables. Childhood and adolescence difficulties were highly correlated, indicating a possible continuation of effects from childhood to adolescence. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The objective of this study was to explore whether parental heavy drinking is associated with suicidal behavior in adolescents, and if so, whether this association is stronger among younger adolescents and whether a possible impact of one parent's intoxication adds to that of the other parent. Two cross-sectional school surveys were conducted in 2002 and 2004 in Norway and comprised 11,637 and 20,703 students, respectively (ages 13 to 19). Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts increased with increasing exposure to parental intoxication, after controlling for adolescents' intoxication frequency. The association between exposure to parental intoxication and suicidal ideation was significantly stronger among younger than among older adolescents. There was a significant positive correlation between frequency of mother's and father's intoxication. Hence, exposure to one parent's intoxication did not add to the impact of the other on suicidal ideation. The results suggest that parental heavy drinking is a risk factor for adolescents' suicidal behavior, and more so for younger than older adolescents.

AB Despite the ethical codes guiding bereavement research, few studies have been conducted to evaluate the perceived stress experienced by the bereaved, and to explore which methodologies cause least distress. This article investigates how bereaved and traumatised populations experience research participation, and they voice their recommendations for future research. The data are from a nationwide three-phase study in Norway among parents who had lost their child by suicide, SIDS, and accidents between July 1, 1997 and December 31, 1998. Whereas the first phase reported quantitative results of perceived psychosocial health and focused on offered and ideal support (N = 262), the second phase investigated the same issues through in-depth interviews of a sub sample (N = 69). Phase three, reported here, included the responses of 64 parents to a short questionnaire evaluating research participation in the two previous phases. The results show that 100% of the parents experienced participation as "positive"/"very positive", and none regretted participating. They linked the positive experiences to being allowed to tell their complete story, the format of the interview, and a hope that they might help others. Apparently, processes of meaning reconstruction and increased awareness of the bereavement process were facilitated by the interviews. However, three-quarters of the interviewees reported that it was to a greater or lesser degree painful to talk about the traumatic loss. Regression analysis showed that being a woman and high levels of psychic distress were the most important predictors of a painful interview experience. In order to protect bereaved and vulnerable populations from harm, already existing ethical codes must be strictly applied, and the researchers must listen respectfully to recommendations from bereaved parents.

AB Diving operations are technically complex, and the underwater environment poses a high risk of fatal or near miss accidents. Furthermore, long-term effects of diving on bone, the central nervous system and the lung have been observed in divers who have not experienced any diving-related accidents.
   To compare total and cause-specific mortality among Norwegian professional divers by class of diving certificate, relative to the general population.
   Data on mortality were obtained for divers in the Norwegian Inshore Diving Registry, which comprises data on all divers with a certificate valid for professional diving after 1980. By August 2010, 5526 male divers born between 1950 and 1990 were identified, 3130 of whom were fully certified professional divers. The rest of the Norwegian male population born in the same period (1 604 147) served as referents. Data on mortality were obtained by linkage to the Cause of Death Registry.
   Mortality was 23 per 1000 in professional divers and 24 per 1000 in referents. The hazard ratio was 0.79 (confidence interval [CI] 0.630.997). Diving-related accidents and suicide were the most common causes of death among divers. Both were significantly more common among divers with the higher level diving certificates.
   Overall, mortality in professional divers was lower than that of the general population. However, professional divers had a higher risk of dying from work-related accident or suicide.

AB Objective To investigate external-cause mortality among 21 609 Norwegian male military peacekeepers deployed to Lebanon during 1978-1998.
   Methods The cohort was followed from the 1st day of deployment through 2013, and mortality during deployment and post discharge was assessed using SMRs calculated from national rates in Norway. Poisson regression was used to see the effect of high-conflict versus low-conflict exposure.
   Results For the total cohort, external-cause mortality was within expected values during deployment (SMR = 0.80) and post discharge (SMR = 1.05). In the low-conflict exposure group, a lower mortality from all external causes (SMR = 0.77), transport accidents (SMR = 0.55) and accidental poisoning (SMR = 0.53) was seen. The high-conflict exposure group showed an elevated mortality from all external causes (SMR = 1.20), transport accidents (SMR = 1.51) and suicide (SMR = 1.30), but these risks were elevated only during the first 5 years after discharge. This group also showed elevated mortality from all external causes (rate ratio, RR = 1.49), and for transport accidents (RR = 3.30) when compared with the low-conflict exposure group.
   Conclusions Overall external-cause mortality among our peacekeepers was equal to national rates during deployment and post discharge. High-conflict exposure was associated with elevated mortality from all external causes, transport accidents and suicide during the first 5 years after discharge from service.

AB Objectives To determine the extent to which educational inequalities in relation to mortality widened in Norway during 1960-2000 and which causes of death were the main drivers of this disparity.
   Design Nationally representative prospective study.
   Setting Four cohorts of the Norwegian population aged 45-64 years in 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990 and followed up for mortality over 10 years.
   Participants 359 547 deaths and 32 904 589 person years.
   Main outcome measures All cause mortality and deaths due to cancer of lung, trachea, or bronchus; other cancer; cardiovascular diseases; suicide; external causes; chronic lower respiratory tract diseases; or other causes. Absolute and relative indices of inequality were used to present differences in mortality by educational level ( basic, secondary, and tertiary).
   Results Mortality fell from the 1960s to the 1990s in all educational groups. At the same time the proportion of adults in the basic education group, with the highest mortality, decreased substantially. As mortality dropped more among those with the highest level of education, inequalities widened. Absolute inequalities in mortality denoting deaths among the basic education groups minus deaths among the high education groups doubled in men and increased by a third in women. This is equivalent to an increase in the slope index of inequality of 105% in men and 32% in women. Inequalities on a relative scale widened more, from 1.33 to 2.24 among men (P=0.01) and from 1.52 to 2.19 among women (P=0.05). Among men, absolute inequalities mainly increased as a result of cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer, and chronic lower respiratory tract diseases. Among women this was mainly due to lung cancer and chronic lower respiratory tract diseases. Unlike the situation in men, absolute inequalities in deaths due to cardiovascular causes narrowed among women. Chronic lower respiratory tract diseases contributed more to the disparities in inequalities among women than among men.
   Conclusion All educational groups showed a decline in mortality. Nevertheless, and despite the fact that the Norwegian welfare model is based on an egalitarian ideology, educational inequalities in mortality among middle aged people in Norway are substantial and increased during 1960-2000.

AB Aim: Previous studies indicate that Norwegian physicians hold conservative attitudes towards ethically controversial end-of-life decisions. The present study was undertaken to explore whether in Norway euthanasia may be hidden under labels such as death after analgesic injections and withholding or withdrawing treatment. Methods: A postal questionnaire containing 76 questions on ethical, collegial and professional autonomy issues was sent to a representative sample of 1616 active physicians in Norway in 2000, Results: 83% responded. A total of had terminated life-prolonging treatment based on the resource situation, while 53.5 and 40.1% respectively had stopped life prolonging treatment due to the wish of the patient and the wish of the patient's relatives. Although not significantly. anaesthesiologists more often reported to have stopped treatment due to resource considerations. One percent of the physicians reported to have shortened a patient s life intentionally (other than stopping futile treatment). All of these were men. Logistic regression showed no effect when gender, age and specialty were analysed simultaneously. 10.6%, and male more often than female physicians, had had experience of unintentional patient death in relation to pain treatment. Anaesthesiologists had had experiences of death following an analgesic injection no more than other specialists. Conclusions: Only a small minority of Norwegian physicians has committed euthanasia. Ho ever, patient death has occurred following ethically questionable decisions such as withdrawal of treatment based on resource considerations and requests from the family.

AB Background: There are five different kinds of death; natural death due to any disease, accidental death, suicidal death, homicidal death, and undetermined death.
   Objectives: This study aimed to determine the major causes of death based on the autopsied reports to aid the development of preventive strategies.
   Methods: This study was a retrospective cross-sectional study consisting of autopsy reports of all suicidal, homicidal and occupational deaths recorded in all forensic medicine dissection halls in thirty-two provinces of Iran from March 2011 to March 2015. A questionnaire was designed containing all the information required for our studies such as gender, age, cause of death, and the autopsy reports.
   Results: There were 19288 suicides, 11655 homicides, and 8558 occupational deaths during five years. Among suicidal deaths, there were seventy percent male and thirty percent female. Most victims (about 22%) were between 18 to 24 years old (Mean age +/- SD: 33.1 +/- 13.1 years). The highest cases of suicide were 52% hanging, and 25% poisoning, respectively. Among homicidal victims, there were 18% males and 20% females. Most victims were between 25 to 29 years old (24%) (Mean age +/- SD: 32.4 +/- 15.6 years). The most common methods were 46% firearms, and 29% stab wounds, respectively. Among occupational deaths happened in 99% of males and 1% of females. The most common victims' age-group was 30 - 39 years old (25%) (Mean age +/- SD: 35.8 +/- 10.3 years). Seventy-four percent of cases were caused by blunt trauma as a result of falling from a height. The second common cause of death was Electrocution (21% of the cases).
   Conclusions: The analysis of the causes of suicidal, homicidal, occupational deaths, can aid the development of preventive strategies to decrease the occurrence of these kinds of preventable deaths in Iran.

AB Background Previous studies of bipolar disorders indicate that childhood abuse and substance abuse are associated with the disorder. Whether both influence the clinical picture, or if one is mediating the association of the other, has not previously been investigated.
   Method A total of 587 patients with bipolar disorders were recruited from Norway and France. A history of childhood abuse was obtained using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Diagnosis and clinical variables, including substance abuse, were based on structured clinical interviews (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders or French version of the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies).
   Results Cannabis abuse was significantly associated with childhood abuse, specifically emotional and sexual abuse ((2)=8.63, p=0.003 and (2)=7.55, p=0.006, respectively). Cannabis abuse was significantly associated with earlier onset of the illness (z=-4.17, p<0.001), lifetime history of at least one suicide attempt ((2)=11.16, p=0.001) and a trend for rapid cycling ((2)=3.45, p=0.06). Alcohol dependence was associated with suicide attempt ((2)=10.28, p=0.001), but not with age at onset or rapid cycling. After correcting for possible confounders and multiple testing, a trend was observed for an interaction between cannabis abuse and childhood abuse and suicide attempt (logistic regression: r(2)=0.06, p=0.039). Significant additive effects were also observed between cannabis abuse and childhood abuse on earlier age at onset (p<0.001), increased rapid cycling and suicide attempt (logistic regression: r(2)=0.03-0.04, p<0.001). No mediation effects were observed; childhood abuse and cannabis abuse were independently associated with the disorder.
   Conclusions Our study is the first to demonstrate significant additive effects, but no mediation effects, between childhood abuse and cannabis abuse on increased clinical expressions of bipolar disorders.

AB The aim of this study was to describe regional differences in the incidence of disability pensions ( DPs) with psychiatric diagnoses, and to determine whether these differences were related to age and/or gender. We compared the incidence rates of new DPs including all diagnoses, with DP with psychiatric diagnoses in Norwegian regions from 1988 to 2000. The population at risk was all individuals aged 16 - 67 in each year. Individuals already on DP were excluded. Cases were collected from the Norwegian National Insurance Administration. The results showed that the incidence rate ratio ( IRR; Norway reference) for DP with psychiatric diagnoses was most elevated for men 1.41 ( 95% CI 1.27 - 1.58) and women 1.48 ( 95% CI 1.34 - 1.64) living in the most rural region. Men in the urban area had a higher IRR, 1.33 ( 95% CI 1.26 - 1.40), than urban women, 1.02 ( 95% CI 0.96 - 1.07). The incidence more than doubled in the youngest age group ( 16 - 29 years) and decreased in the oldest age group ( 60 - 67 years) between 1988 and 2000. The findings conclude that individuals living in semi-rural regions of Norway are more likely to receive a DP with a psychiatric diagnosis than those living in urban areas. Large gender differences were found in the urban area. Further research is needed to investigate the impact of the psychiatric healthcare system and access to rehabilitation on psychiatric disability.

AB Background: Suicidal behavior among the elderly is a research field in which qualitative and quantitative methods can and should supplement each other. The objective of this qualitative study is to investigate whether the descriptions of elderly people who committed suicide, given by those who knew them, can provide common features that create recognizable patterns, and if so whether these patterns can help to shed light on the suicidal process.
   Method: This is a psychological autopsy study based on qualitative interviews with 63 informants concerning 23 suicides committed by persons aged over 65 in Norway. The informants were relatives, their family doctors, and home-based care nurses. In general, the analysis of the interviews follows the systematic text condensation method.
   Results: The descriptions have three main topics: life histories, personality traits and relationships. "Life histories" includes the sub-topics ability to survive and action-oriented achievers. They describe people who came through difficult circumstances when growing up and who were action-oriented in life in general and in crises. "Personality traits" includes the sub-topics obstinacy and controlling others. The informants saw the elderly people as strong-willed, obstinate and possessing a considerable ability to control themselves and those around them. "Relationships" includes the sub-topics I didn't know him and He showed no ability to meet us halfway, and describes the informants' experience of emotionally closed persons who kept a distance in their relationships.
   Conclusions: On the basis of the descriptions of the elderly people given in this study, we argue that these individuals will find difficulty in accepting and adapting to age-related loss of function since their self-esteem is so strongly associated with being productive and in control. Loss of control reveals their vulnerability - and this they cannot tolerate.

AB IMPORTANCE Examining causes of death and making comparisons across countries may increase understanding of the income-related differences in life expectancy.
   OBJECTIVES To describe income-related differences in life expectancy and causes of death in Norway and to compare those differences with US estimates.
   DESIGN AND SETTING A registry-based study including all Norwegian residents aged at least 40 years from 2005 to 2015.
   EXPOSURES Household income adjusted for household size.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Life expectancy at 40 years of age and cause-specific mortality.
   RESULTS In total, 3 041 828 persons contributed 25 805 277 person-years and 441 768 deaths during the study period (mean [SD] age, 59.3 years [13.6]; mean [SD] number of household members per person, 2.5 [1.3]). Life expectancy was highest for women with income in the top 1% (86.4 years [95% CI, 85.7-87.1]) which was 8.4 years (95% CI, 7.2-9.6) longer than women with income in the lowest 1%. Men with the lowest 1% income had the lowest life expectancy (70.6 years [95% CI, 69.6-71.6]), which was 13.8 years (95% CI, 12.3-15.2) less than men with the top 1% income. From 2005 to 2015, the differences in life expectancy by income increased, largely attributable to deaths from cardiovascular disease, cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and dementia in older age groups and substance use deaths and suicides in younger age groups. Over the same period, life expectancy for women in the highest income quartile increased 3.2 years (95% CI, 2.7-3.7), while life expectancy for women in the lowest income quartile decreased 0.4 years (95% CI, -1.0 to 0.2). For men, life expectancy increased 3.1 years (95% CI, 2.5-3.7) in the highest income quartile and 0.9 years (95% CI, 0.2-1.6) in the lowest income quartile. Differences in life expectancy by income levels in Norway were similar to differences observed in the United States, except that life expectancy was higher in Norway in the lower to middle part of the income distribution in both men and women.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In Norway, there were substantial and increasing gaps in life expectancy by income level from 2005 to 2015. The largest differences in life expectancy between Norway and United States were for individuals in the lower to middle part of the income distribution.

AB Background. Many studies have shown associations between a history of childhood trauma and more severe or complex clinical features of bipolar disorders (BD), including suicide attempts and earlier illness onset. However, the psychopathological mechanisms underlying these associations are still unknown. Here, we investigated whether affective lability mediates the relationship between childhood trauma and the severe clinical features of BD.
   Method. A total of 342 participants with BD were recruited from France and Norway. Diagnosis and clinical characteristics were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS) or the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders (SCID-I). Affective lability was measured using the short form of the Affective Lability Scale (ALS-SF). A history of childhood trauma was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Mediation analyses were performed using the SPSS PROCESS macro.
   Results. Using the mediation model and covariation for the lifetime number of major mood episodes, affective lability was found to statistically mediate the relationship between childhood trauma experiences and several clinical variables, including suicide attempts, mixed episodes and anxiety disorders. No significant mediation effects were found for rapid cycling or age at onset.
   Conclusions. Our data suggest that affective lability may represent a psychological dimension that mediates the association between childhood traumatic experiences and the risk of a more severe or complex clinical expression of BD.

AB Background: Studies have shown that adolescents with a history of both suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-harm report more mental health problems and other psychosocial problems than adolescents who report only one or none of these types of self-harm. The current study aimed to examine the use of child and adolescent psychiatric services by adolescents with both suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-harm, compared to other adolescents, and to assess the psychosocial variables that characterize adolescents with both suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-harm who report contact.
   Methods: Data on lifetime self-harm, contact with child and adolescent psychiatric services, and various psychosocial risk factors were collected in a cross-sectional sample (response rate = 92.7%) of 11,440 adolescents aged 14-17 years who participated in a school survey in Oslo, Norway.
   Results: Adolescents who reported any self-harm were more likely than other adolescents to have used child and adolescent psychiatric services, with a particularly elevated likelihood among those with both suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-harm ( OR = 9.3). This finding remained significant even when controlling for psychosocial variables. In adolescents with both suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-harm, symptoms of depression, eating problems, and the use of illicit drugs were associated with a higher likelihood of contact with child and adolescent psychiatric services, whereas a non-Western immigrant background was associated with a lower likelihood.
   Conclusions: In this study, adolescents who reported self-harm were significantly more likely than other adolescents to have used child and adolescent psychiatric services, and adolescents who reported a history of both suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-harm were more likely to have used such services, even after controlling for other psychosocial risk factors. In this high-risk subsample, various psychosocial problems increased the probability of contact with child and adolescent psychiatric services, naturally reflecting the core tasks of the services, confirming that they represents an important area for interventions that aim to reduce self-harming behaviour. Such interventions should include systematic screening for early recognition of self-harming behaviours, and treatment programmes tailored to the needs of teenagers with a positive screen. Possible barriers to receive mental health services for adolescents with immigrant backgrounds should be further explored.

AB Objectives To examine increases in several health outcomes after the July 22, 2011 terrorist attacks in Norway.
   Methods Retrospective analysis of nationwide registers (n = 4,953,000) where incidences of schizophrenia/psychosis hospitalizations, suicides, acute myocardial infarctions, and preterm births after the terrorist attacks were compared with corresponding periods the previous 3 years.
   Results Compared with the same period the preceding 3 years, the observed number of hospitalizations from schizophrenia/psychosis was 14% higher during the first 4 weeks after the terrorist attack (incidence ratio [IR] = 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07-1.21). The corresponding IRs for the first 3 days and the first week were 1.26 (95% CI = 0.99-1.58) and 1.10 (95% CI = 0.96-1.24). The observed number of suicides was increased by 45% the first 4 weeks (IR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.12-1.86), 163% the first 3 days (IR = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.15-5.20), and 105% the first week (IR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.14-3.42). For acute myocardial infarction, there was an increase of 5% the first 4 weeks. There were also more births the 4 weeks (IR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.01-1.07, but this increase was not seen in preterm births of less than 37 weeks of gestation (IR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.83-1.04).
   Conclusions We observed a general nationwide increase of health outcomes investigated in this study the first 4 weeks after the terrorist attacks. These results may contribute to the growing body of evidence on the adverse health outcomes that may accompany national stressors.

AB Background: Euthanasia requests have increased as the number of debilitated patients rises in both developed and developing countries such as India due to medical, psychosocial-emotional, socioenvironmental, and existential issues amid fears of potential misuse. World's position: Albania, Colombia, the Netherlands, and Switzerland permit euthanasia conditionally. Australia's legalization of euthanasia has been withdrawn. The United States permits withdrawal of life support. Mexico and Norway permit active euthanasia. India's position: Following the Aruna Shanbaug case the Supreme Court granted legal sanction to passive, but not active, euthanasia that is valid till the Parliament legislates on euthanasia. Handling euthanasia requests: Acknowledging the complexity of the problem; individualizing the palliative approach; and accepting the There is no alternative' or There is no answer' (TINA) factor.

AB Background: Inpatient bed numbers are continually being reduced but are not being replaced with adequate alternatives in primary health care. There is a considerable risk that eventually all inpatient treatment will be unplanned, because planned or elective treatments are superseded by urgent needs when capacity is reduced.
   Aims of the study: To estimate the rate of unplanned admissions to inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities in Norway and analyse the difference between patients with unplanned and planned admissions regarding services received during the three months prior to admission as well as clinical, demographical and socioeconomic characteristics of patients.
   Method: Unplanned admissions were defined as all urgent and involuntary admissions including unplanned readmissions. National mapping of inpatients was conducted in all inpatient treatment psychiatric wards in Norway on a specific date in 2012. Binary logit regressions were performed to compare patients who had unplanned admissions with patients who had planned admissions (i.e., the analyses were conditioned on admission to inpatient psychiatric treatment).
   Results: Patients with high risk of unplanned admission are suffering from severe mental illness, have low functional level indicated by the need for housing services, high risk for suicide attempt and of being violent, low education and born outside Norway.
   Conclusion: Specialist mental health services should support the local services in their efforts to prevent unplanned admissions by providing counselling, short inpatient stays, outpatient treatment and ambulatory outpatient psychiatry services. Implications for health policies: This paper suggests the rate of unplanned admissions as a quality indicator and considers the introduction of economic incentives in the income models at both service levels.

TI Psychosocial follow-up after parasuicide in Norwegian general hospitals.

LA Norwegian
DT Article
ID DELIBERATE SELF-HARM; SECONDARY PREVENTION; ATTEMPTED-SUICIDE; NORWAY
AB Background. Routines and standards of care for parasuicide patients in general hospitals in Norway were reviewed in relation to international and national recommendations.
   Material and methods. Telephone interviews were conducted with personnel at all Norwegian general hospitals with emergency units. 55 of a total of 58 hospitals participated (95 %).
   Results. Two thirds of the hospitals reported that most parasuicide patients were routinely psychiatrically evaluated and then referred to psychiatric or community aftercare. At almost half of the hospitals (46%) the staff had not received any specific training in clinical management of parasuicide patients during the last three years. Structured collaboration with external aftercare providers was non-existent in 43 % of the hospitals. Hospitals with projects aimed at psychosocial follow up of parasuicide patients or hospitals with a team or a person responsible for the follow-up, had, however, routines more in accordance with the recommendations than hospitals without projects or teams.
   Interpretation. The study shows great variations between Norwegian general hospitals in their routines and standards of care for psychosocial follow-up of parasuicide patients. Increasing the staffs competence, developing written routines and establishing mutually binding co-operation between the hospital and external caregivers are important areas for further development.

AB Objective. This paper examines the short-term risk of cause-specific death following widowhood.
   Method. We followed all individuals registered as married in Norway in 1975 for marital status and mortality until 2006. Widowed individuals were followed for mortality for 7 years following widowhood. Causes of death were categorized into five cause-groups. Life tables were used in survival analyses.
   Results. Deaths among the widowed were most frequent in the week following widowhood. In this week and compared to married individuals, there were more deaths including those from malignant cancer in men (hazard ratio (HR) of 1.51; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.89), from external causes in men (HR = 3.64; 95% CI: 2.01, 5.28), and from respiratory diseases (HR = 2.18; 95% CI: 1.52, 2.84 inmen and HR= 3.18; 95% CI: 2.26, 4.09 in women). A majority of respiratory deathswere frompneumonia. Thereafter excessmortality among thewidowed dropped gradually. Although these numbers stabilized, they were still elevated in year 7. Excess mortality was particularly high in the youngest age group considered (55-64 years) and decreased with age, though more so in men than in women. Only a few more widowed individuals than expected died of a condition in the same cause-group as their spouses.
   Conclusion. A novel finding was that excess deaths in the week following widowhood also were from cancer and respiratory diseases. Men in the youngest age group seemed most vulnerable. Prevention should be considered directly after the death of a spouse, and measures should be aimed at virtually all causes of death. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge of the natural course and especially the total and cause-specific mortality of community-acquired chronic HCV infection is limited. The aims of our study were to determine the total and cause-specific mortality in patients infected with chronic hepatitis C in a community-based setting in northern Norway. This prospective cohort study included 1010 HCV-positive patients diagnosed with recombinant immunoblot assay between 1 January 1990 and 1 January 2000, with a median observation time from diagnosis to follow-up of 7 years. Data were collected from medical records in the period between 1 January 2004 and 30 June 2006. Time and cause of death were ascertained from the Norwegian Causes of Death Register. Age-adjusted death rates and standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were compared with those of the general Norwegian population. In total, 122 deaths were recorded. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival was 88% at 14 years. The SMR in the cohort relative to the general population was 6.66. Most of the excess deaths in both genders were because of liver-related causes, those associated with a drug-using lifestyle and suicide. The statistically significant increase in SMRs ranged from 4.2 for death by cancer in women to 64.6 for liver disease in women. There was no statistically significant increase in SMRs from cardiovascular disease in either gender or from cancer in men. In conclusion, our study shows that the death rate in patients infected with hepatitis C is 6.66 times higher than in the general Norwegian population.

AB The Arctic has been a subject to various socio-cultural changes; indigenous people living in the region have experienced injustice and oppression in different forms. Furthermore, there are currently various new social, political and environmental challenges. It has been assumed that the continuous sociocultural transition has an influence on indigenous people's wellbeing. We conducted a systematic literature review with regard to epidemiological mental health research on Arctic indigenous children and adolescents. The aim was to describe the nature and scope of research conducted and to explore for possible regional and ethnic differences in mental health. It was found that current epidemiological knowledge is based mainly on cross-sectional studies from selected regions and limited to substance use and suicidal behaviour. Youth suicide rates are alarmingly high in many parts of the Arctic, particularly in Greenland and Alaska. Differences between indigenous and non-indigenous groups are also most evident and uniform across suicide studies, with rates being systematically higher among indigenous youth. Substance use is common throughout the Arctic, however, regional and ethnic differences in usage vary considerably. Other psychosocial problems remain largely unexplored. In addition, very little is known about the causes of mental health problems in general and the impact of rapid socio-cultural changes in particular. There are several methodological limitations in the studies included here, many related to the validity of research instruments in different cultural contexts. There is a need for longitudinal comparative studies from the entire Arctic with culturally relevant instruments addressing mental health in early childhood as well. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: To study the mortality pattern of Norwegian doctors, people in human service occupations, other graduates and the general population during the period 1960-2000 by decade, gender and age. The total number of deaths in the study population was 1 583 559.
   Methods: Census data from 1960, 1970, 1980 and 1990 relating to education were linked to data on 14 main causes of death from Statistics Norway, followed up for two five-year periods after census, and analyzed as stratified incidence rate data. Mortality rate ratios were computed as combined Mantel Haenzel estimates for each sex, adjusting for both age and period when appropriate.
   Results: The doctors had a lower mortality rate than the general population for all causes of death except suicide. The mortality rate ratios for other graduates and human service occupations were 0.7-0.8 compared with the general population. However, doctors have a higher mortality than other graduates. The lowest estimates of mortality for doctors were for endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases, diseases in the urogenital tract or genitalia, digestive diseases and sudden death, for which the numbers were nearly half of those for the general population. The differences in mortality between doctors and the general population increased during the periods.
   Conclusions: Between 1960 and 2000 mortality for doctors converged towards the mortality for other university graduates and for people in human service occupations. However, there was a parallel increase in the gap between these groups and the rest of the population. The slightly higher mortality for doctors compared with mortality for other university graduates may be explained by the higher suicide rate for doctors.

AB Introduction of the HSV-Tk suicide gene into allogeneic T cells offers the possibility to control developing host-reactive cells within the context of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Sensitive quantitative detection methods are a prerequisite to monitor genetically modified T cells in peripheral blood and tissues to study their involvement in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-induced lesions as well as their disappearance or persistence after ganciclovir (GCV)-induced suicide. We monitored the alloreactivity of HSV-Tk-transduced T cells after BMT by studying their in vivo distribution and quantity in peripheral blood and in tissues in a WAG/Rij into Brown Norway fully mismatched rat allogeneic BMT model. Genetically modified T cells were quantified in blood and tissues by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, immunohistochemical analysis, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. A significant increase in the number of allogeneic HSV-Tk1(+) T cells was found in particular in spleen and lymph nodes and large numbers were found in tongue, skin, and intestines. In blood, an increase in HSV-Tk(+) T cells closely preceded clinical symptoms of GVHD. Real-time quantitative PCR proved to be a fast and accurate tool by which to quantify transduced T cells both in blood and tissues. This enables the study of the in vivo alloreactivity of retrovirus-transduced cells and the response of HSV-Tk-expressing T cells to GCV-induced suicide therapy. Furthermore, we showed the potential use to study specific cause-effect relationships in a broad range of animal and clinical studies involving genetically engineered cells.

   Methods The 1991 and 2001 Belgian censuses were linked with cause-of-death data, each yielding a study population of over 5 million individuals aged 25-64, followed up for 5 years. Age-standardised mortality rates (ASMR) were computed by educational level (EL) and cause. Inequalities were measured through rate differences (RDs), rate ratios (RRs) and population attributable fractions (PAFs). We analysed changes in educational inequalities between the 1990s and the 2000s, and decomposed the PAF into the main causes of death.
   Results All-cause and avoidable ASMR decreased in all ELs and both sexes. Lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease (IHD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and suicide in men, and IHD, stroke, lung cancer and COPD in women had the highest impact on population mortality. RDs decreased in men but increased in women. RRs and PAFs increased in both sexes, albeit more in women. In men, the impact of lung cancer and COPD inequalities on population mortality decreased while that of suicide and IHD increased. In women, the impact of all causes except IHD increased.
   Conclusion Absolute inequalities decreased in men while increasing in women; relative inequalities increased in both sexes. The PAFs decomposition revealed that targeting mortality inequalities from lung cancer, IHD, COPD in both sexes, suicide in men and stroke in women would have the largest impact at population level.

AB Objective: To explore possible risk factors for intimate partner homicide by combining structured risk assessment based on information available in court documents and individual risk assessment provided through interviews with the bereaved. Method: The aim of this study was to scrutinize intimate partner homicide (IPH) situations and interactions within a retrospective, mixed methods design. All IPHs in Norway that had received a final legal judgment from 1990 to 2012 (N = 177) were included. Quantitative data was extracted through structured investigation of the court documents. Risk factors were identified from three validated risk assessment instruments. Qualitative data were retrieved from interviews with a sample of bereaved (n = 12). Results: The IPH distribution was biased toward low socioeconomic status. Previous intimate partner violence (IPV) was identified in 7 out of 10 IPH incidents. Observed risk by the bereaved was infrequently communicated to health care, police, or support services. Individuals who did communicate risk found that professionals underestimated the reported risk and did not act on their warnings. Conclusions: The majority of IPHs did not occur without warning signs. To prevent IPH, structured risk assessments and knowledge of family and friends' perceptions of risk is essential.

AB This study presents the findings from in-depth interviews with 24 people from 15 families in Norway who lost their young son or daughter in a traffic accident. Their grief has several dimensions: the loss of a young life, the loss of life quality, the effect on family events and their meaning, and the new responsibilities brought onto family members. For each young fatality, many relatives and friends are affected with a wide range of emotional and socioeconomic consequences. Parents report that grief is more overwhelming during the first few years and never disappears, while over the years they slowly learn to cope with it. Here we especially highlight the role of traffic authorities and what professional actors can do to meet the bereaved with empathy and minimize negative effects.

AB This paper provides an overview of recent Norwegian and international research into physicians' health problems and their use of health services, with a particular focus on more recent studies relating to The Norwegian Physicians' Survey. The review suggests that physicians' physical health is similar to the general population, although female physicians tend to be in better health than other women. Some mental disorders such as depression and suicide appear to be more prevalent. Mental health problems are known to be associated with low work control (autonomy), time pressure and demanding patients. There is little difference between the genders early in their career, but more female than male physicians seem to experience problems later on. Physicians seldom take sick leave, and tend to make less use of primary health care and some screening facilities. Self-treatment is common - even for mental problems. American impaired physician programmes have demonstrated high recovery rates (70-80%), and increasing emphasis is now being placed on psychiatric diagnoses. As certain mental disorders appear to be common among physicians, specialist psychiatric services should be made more accessible for this group. A low-threshold facility for seeking help with such problems has recently been developed in Norway (the Villa Sana Resource Centre).

AB There are few studies of long-term, cause-specific mortality in multiple sclerosis (MS) relating to population mortality. Our objective was to study survival, excess mortality and causes of death in a cohort of patients with a long history of MS. Patients living in Oslo with definite MS and onset during 1940-80 were included in 2006. Causes of death and mortality in the general population were obtained from the Cause of Death Registry of Statistics Norway. Of the 386 patients included in the study, 263 (68%) had died at inclusion. Median survival from onset was 35 years (Kaplan-Meier: 95% confidence interval 33-37). Primary progressive MS was associated with shorter survival, but mean age at death was similar for relapsing-remitting and primary progressive MS patients. The most frequent underlying cause of death was MS (50%), and infection was often registered as a contributory cause (56%). The all-cause standardized mortality ratio was 2.47. Excess mortality was most marked during the second decade after onset of MS. We conclude that infections are probably the main cause of death in patients with MS, but the frequency is underestimated due to misleading information on death certificates. Excess mortality in patients with MS first appeared during the second decade of the disease. Survival seems to be age-dependent rather than related to disease course.

AB This study aimed to explore how health care workers think, feel and act when working with patients who self-injure. Eight health care workers who had extensive experience with patients who self-injure were recruited from a secure ward at a psychiatric hospital in Western Norway. Semi-structured interviews were conducted at the participants' workplace. The interviews were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Four themes emerged from the analysis: (1) "Before": the frustration inherent in using coercive strategies; (2) "The Change": from coercion to alliance; (3) "Now": the experience of useful ways of working with self-injury; (4) "Thin line between Life and Death": suicide attempt or self-injury? The first theme describes how the ward used to function before the changes described in the second theme occurred. The third theme and its sub-themes detail how undergoing the change process previously described led to a subjectively better way of working with self-injury. The fourth theme describes a new challenge that arose with the new way of thinking about and working with self-injury. The four themes form a chronological narrative of how the participants' understanding and treatment of self-injury changed with experience, and details the new ways of working with and understanding self-injury. The discussion section explores how the themes relate to each other and explores the findings in the light of psychological literature.

ID RISK
AB Introduction Suicide prevention in psychiatric care is arguably complex and incompletely understood as a patient safety issue. A resilient healthcare approach provides perspectives through which to understand this complexity by understanding everyday clinical practice. By including suicidal patients and healthcare professionals as sources of knowledge, a deeper understanding of what constitutes safe clinical practice can be achieved.
   Methods This planned study aims to adopt the perspective of resilient healthcare to provide a deeper understanding of safe clinical practice for suicidal patients in psychiatric inpatient care. It will describe the experienced components and conditions of safe clinical practice and the experienced practice of patient safety. The study will apply a descriptive case study approach consisting of qualitative semistructured interviews and focus groups. The data sources are hospitalised patients in a suicidal crisis and healthcare professionals in clinical practice.
   Ethics and dissemination This study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee (2016/34). The results will be disseminated through scientific articles, a PhD dissertation, and national and international conferences. These findings can generate knowledge to be integrated into the practice of safety for suicidal inpatients in Norway and to improve the feasibility of patient safety measures. Theoretical generalisations can be drawn regarding safe clinical practice by taking into account the experiences of patients and healthcare professionals. Thus, this study can inform the conceptual development of safe clinical practice for suicidal patients.

AB Based on the results from the qualitative part of the study "Grief Groups in Norway" conducted in 2009-2011, this article focuses on grief group participants' recommendations for good or ideal grief groups. Participants have insightful observations about grief groups and how they can be improved, and taking their point of view seriously is one important way of ensuring that users of such group get an optimal experience from joining such groups. Using their experiences to adjust the structure and function of the groups, one can allow for practical solutions for organizations that have difficulties starting up grief support groups, for example, in areas where the population density is low. A major finding in this study was that grief group participants stressed the importance of thorough information before and at the start of grief groups. This concerned information about the aim, structure, organization, and possible effects and limitations of group participation.

AB Background
   Although self-harm and sleep problems are major public health problems in adolescence, detailed epidemiological assessment is essential to understand the nature of this relationship.
   Aims
   To conduct a detailed assessment of the relationship between sleep and self-harm in adolescence.
   Method
   A large population-based study in Norway surveyed 10 220 adolescents aged 16-19years on mental health, including a comprehensive assessment of sleep and self-harm.
   Results
   Adolescents with sleep problems were significantly more likely to report self-harm than those without sleep problems. Insomnia, short sleep duration, long sleep onset latency, wake after sleep on set as well as large differences between weekdays versus weekends, yielded higher odds of self-harm consistent with a dose-response relationship. Depressive symptoms accounted for some, but not all, of this association.
   Conclusions
   The findings highlight a strong relationship between sleep problems and self-harm. Interventions to reduce adolescent self-harm ought to incorporate sleep problems as a treatment target.

AB Data analyzed in this article is part of a study conducted to explore grief support groups in Norway. Participants that fulfilled the criteria of Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) were compared with participants that did not in order to explore whether they differed on satisfaction and experiences with participation. To allow for comparison, a subsample of 22 participants that fulfilled the criteria of POD were drawn from the total of 262 participants. Demographic and loss-related variables were analyzed to explore factors associated with PGD. Fulfillment of POD was then analyzed to explore the group's effect on life quality and overall satisfaction. The main finding is that participants who fulfill the criteria of prolonged grief are in general less satisfied with the groups and report less positive effect on life quality. We also found age- and gender-differences regarding fulfillment of PGD, with older bereaved women especially at risk of developing symptoms of PGD.

AB The main objectives of this study were to investigate the association between childhood violence and psychological distress and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTS) among Sami and non-Sami adults, and to explore a possible mediating effect of childhood violence on any ethnic differences in mental health. This study is part of a larger questionnaire survey on health and living conditions in Mid- and Northern Norway (SAMINOR 2) which included 2116 Sami and 8674 non-Sami participants. A positive association between childhood violence and psychological distress and PTS in adulthood was found regardless of ethnicity. For women, childhood violence may have mediated some of the ethnic differences in psychological distress (53.2%) and PTS (31.4%). A similar pattern was found for men as to psychological distress (45.5%) and PTS (55.5%). The prevalence of psychological distress was significantly higher in the Sami than in the non-Sami group: 15.8% vs. 13.0% for women, and 11.4% vs. 8.0% for men. Likewise, PTS showed a higher prevalence in the Sami group, both for women (16.2% vs. 12.4%) and for men (12.2% vs. 9.1). Conclusion: A positive association between childhood violence and adult mental distress was found for both Sami and Norwegian adults. More mental problems were found among the Sami. Childhood violence may have mediated some of the ethnic differences.

AB This study explored the potential contribution of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)-based Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item (PHQ-9) instrument to the developmental epidemiology research in Norway, by examining depressive symptoms in a school sample of adolescents (N = 846). The average PHQ-9 scores were 6.89 (SD = 5.13) for girls, and 4.57 (SD = 3.98) for boys; 8.5% of girls and 2.6% of boys were classified into the originally proposed categories indicative of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD; PHQ-9 scores >= 15). Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed a single-factor structure for the PHQ-9 with solid psychometric properties and high internal consistency for both genders. However, even though configural equality was observed, there was no evidence for metric or scalar equality across genders, warranting further investigation of measurement equivalence for the current Norwegian version of the PHQ-9. We observed no major associations between the PHQ-9 scores and adolescent religion or immigrant background. Further, school grade, not living together with both biological parents, and diagnosed chronic illness were differently associated with elevated depressive symptoms for boys and girls. Finally, high residential instability, perceived low SES, school dissatisfaction, lack of close friendships, history of suicide attempts and self-harm, and elevated emotional problems were all significantly and consistently associated with greater depression for both genders. Overall, the PHQ-9 appears to be a promising research tool, potentially offering clinically-relevant classification of adolescent self-reported depressive symptomatology in addition to the symptom severity captured by continuous scores. Nevertheless, further investigation concerning the observed measurement non-equivalence, as well as the comprehensive validation and comparison against the gold standard is required before the PHQ-9 is to be used for diagnostic screening in Norway.

AB Background: Extreme self-harming behavior is a major challenge for patients and health services. Nevertheless, this patient population is poorly described in research literature. Aims: The aim of this study was to assess the volume of patients with extensive psychiatric hospitalization due to extreme self-harming behaviors, the extent of severe medical sequelae, and collaboration problems within health services. Methods: In a national screening investigation, department managers in 83 adult psychiatric inpatient institutions across all health regions in Norway were invited to participate in a brief, prepared, telephone interview. Results: Sixty-one interviews were completed. Extensive hospitalization (prolonged or multiple) due to extreme self-harm was reported for the last year in all health regions and in 427 individual cases. Mean number of cases did not differ by region. Psychiatric hospitalizations were more frequent in hospital units than mental health centers. In 109 of the cases, self-harming behavior had severe medical consequences, including five deaths. In 122 of the cases, substantial collaboration problems within the health services were reported (disagreements on diagnosis, treatment needs and resources). Extensive (long-term) hospitalization was particularly associated with the combination of severe medical sequelae and collaboration problems. Conclusion: This investigation confirms a noteworthy, nationwide, population of severely self-harming inpatients with extensive health service use, prevalent severe medical complications, and unsatisfactory collaboration within health services. These preliminary results are alarming, and indicate a need for more profound understanding of highly complex and severe cases.

AB Purpose: The role of compulsory treatment of serious mental disorders has been the topic of ongoing public debate involving among others mental health professionals, service providers, service user advocates, relatives of service users, media commentators and politicians. However, relatively little is known about general public attitudes towards involuntary admission and compulsory treatment of people with various mental disorders. This article examines the attitudes in a representative sample of Norway's population towards the use of involuntary admission and treatment, and under which circumstances does the general public consider compulsory treatment to be justified in the Norwegian mental health care services.
   Method: Data were collected from a representative sample of the population in Norway aged 18 and older. The sample was stratified for gender, geographical region and age distribution (n = 2001). The survey was performed in the months of May 2009 (n = 1000) and May 2011 (n = 1001), using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) by an independent polling company. All respondents were provided a general definition of coercive intervention before the interview was conducted.
   Analysis: Univariate descriptions and bivariate analyses were performed by means of cross-tabulation, analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) and comparing of group of means. Cohen's d was used as the measure for effect size.
   Results: Between 87% and 97% of those surveyed expressed strong or partial agreement with the use of involuntary admissions or compulsory treatment related to specified cases and situations. The majority of interviewees (56%) expressed the opinion that overall, current levels are acceptable. A further, 34% were of the opinion that current levels are too low, while only 9.9% of respondents supported a reduction in the level of involuntary treatment. Lower levels of education were associated with a more positive attitude towards involuntary admission and treatment.
   There was stronger support for admission to prevent suicide than the possibility of violence by the mentally ill.
   Conclusion: The Norwegian adult population largely supports current legislation and practices regarding involuntary admission and compulsory treatment in the mental health services. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   PREVALENCE; MIGRANTS; SUICIDE; CANCERS
AB Background: Immigration to the Nordic countries has increased in the last decades and foreign-born inhabitants now constitute a considerable part of the region's population. Several studies suggest poorer self-reported health among foreign-born compared to natives, while results on mortality and life expectancy are inconclusive. To date, few studies have summarized knowledge on mortality differentials by country of birth. This article aims to systematically review previous results on all-cause and cause-specific mortality by country of birth in the Nordic countries.
   Methods: The methodology was conducted and documented systematically and transparently using a narrative approach. We identified 43 relevant studies out of 6059 potentially relevant studies in August 2016, 35 of which used Swedish data, 8 Danish and 1 Norwegian.
   Results: Our findings from fully-adjusted models on Swedish data support claims of excess mortality risks in specific categories of foreign-born. Most notably, immigrants from other Nordic countries, especially Finland, experience increased risk of mortality from all causes, and specifically by suicide, breast and gynaecological cancers, and circulatory diseases. Increased risks in people from Central and Eastern Europe can also be found. On the contrary, decreased risks for people with Southern European and Middle Eastern origins are found for all-cause, suicide, and breast and gynaecological cancer mortality. The few Danish studies are more difficult to compare, with conflicting results arising in the analysis. Finally, results from the one Norwegian study suggest significantly decreased mortality risks among foreign-born, to be explored in further research.
   Conclusions: With new studies being published on mortality differentials between native and foreign-born populations in the Nordic countries, specific risk patterns have begun to arise. Regardless, data from most Nordic countries remains limited, as does the information on specific causes of death. The literature should be expanded in upcoming years to capture associations between country of birth and mortality more clearly.

AB Background: To investigate seasonal variations in telephone calls to a help-line for children, and their correlation to changes in length of day, latitude and age. Method: 691,787 calls to the Red Cross Help-Line in Norway for children in the three-year period 1996-1998 were included. Results: Monthly frequencies of calls deviated significantly from an expected even distribution (chi(2)=9446.34, df=11, P<0.0001). The frequency curve for calls peaked in April and October and had its lowest level in July and December. Variation was pronounced: the mean number of daily calls varied between 436 in July and 886 in April. There was a strong and positive correlation between the number of calls and the change in length of day across the year (r(s)=0.76, N=12, P<0.01). Increasing latitude correlated positively with the range of the monthly observed/expected ratios of calls (r(s)=0.79, N=7, P<0.05). The frequency of calls was largest among children 12 to 14 years of age. Age correlated negatively with the range of monthly observed/expected ratios of calls (r=-0.94, N=12, P<0.001). Limitations: Social and cultural factors could not be explored in the design used in the present study. Conclusions: The frequency of calls from children correlates positively with change in length of day (i.e., maximal in spring and fall), and the magnitude of the seasonal variation correlates positively with latitude and negatively with age. Knowledge of seasonal variation in requests for help may have value in planning services for children. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PALLIATIVE CARE; SUICIDE; EUTHANASIA; NETHERLANDS; ATTITUDES
AB Objectives: To analyse legislation and medical professional positions concerning the doctor's role in assisted dying in western Europe, and to discuss their implications for doctors.
   Method: This paper is based on country-specific reports by experts from European countries where assisted dying is legalised (Belgium, The Netherlands), or openly practiced (Switzerland), or where it is illegal (Germany, Norway, UK).
   Results: Laws on assisted dying in The Netherlands and Belgium are restricted to doctors. In principle, assisted suicide (but not euthanasia) is not illegal in either Germany or Switzerland, but a doctor's participation in Germany would violate the code of professional medical conduct and might contravene of a doctor's legal duty to save life. The Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill proposed in the UK in 2005 focused on doctors, whereas the Proposal on Assisted Dying of the Norwegian Penal Code Commission minority in 2002 did not.
   Professional medical organisations in all these countries except The Netherlands maintain the position that medical assistance in dying conflicts with the basic role of doctors. However, in Belgium and Switzerland, and for a time in the UK, these organisations dropped their opposition to new legislation. Today, they regard the issue as primarily a matter for society and politics. This "neutral'' stance differs from the official position of the Royal Dutch Medical Association which has played a key role in developing the Dutch practice of euthanasia as a "medical end-of-life decision'' since the 1970s.
   Conclusion: A society moving towards an open approach to assisted dying should carefully identify tasks to assign exclusively to medical doctors, and distinguish those possibly better performed by other professions.

AB Childhood maltreatment is known to increase the risk of future psychiatric disorders. In the present study, we explored the impact of experienced maltreatment on the prevalence and comorbidity of psychiatric disorders in a high-risk population of adolescents in residential care units. We also studied the impact of poly-victimization. The participants of the study were adolescents in residential care units in Norway (n=335, mean age 16.8 years, girls 58.5%). A diagnostic interview (Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment Interview) was used, yielding information about previous maltreatment (witnessing violence, victim of family violence, community violence, sexual abuse) and DSM-IV diagnoses present in the last three months. Exposure to maltreatment was reported by 71%, and in this group, we found significantly more Asperger's syndrome (AS) (p =.041), conduct disorder (CD) (p =.049), major depressive disorder (MDD) (p =.001), dysthymia (p =.030), general anxiety disorder (GAD) (p <.001), and having attempted suicide (p =.006). We found significantly more comorbid disorders in the maltreated group. Poly-victimization was studied by constructing a scale comprised of witnessing violence, victim of family violence, victim of sexual abuse and household dysfunction. We found that poly-victimization was associated with significantly increased risk of MDD, GAD, AS, CD, and having attempted suicide (p <.01). The complexity of the clinical outcomes revealed in this study suggest that longer-term treatment plans and follow-up by psychiatric services might be needed to a greater extend than for the rest of the child and adolescent population, and that trauma informed care is essential for adolescents in residential youth care.

AB Objective: We wanted to study the prevalence and characteristics of dangerousness among female psychiatric patients.
   Method: A national survey was performed in Norway, covering all psychiatric in- and out-patient units.
   Results: There were 329 persons reported to have a psychiatric disorder and to satisfy our criteria for dangerousness, giving a total prevalence of 9.9/100 000 adults. There were 54 women, giving a female prevalence of 3.1/100 000. When compared to a matched sample of the men, fewer women were out-patients or had had jail sentences. We found no sex differences with regard to frequencies of psychosis, mental retardation, personality disorders, or drug or alcohol abuse. The women had an increased frequency of suicide-related and self-injurious behaviours and previous commitment for arson.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of women with psychiatric disorders who are considered to be dangerous was 3.1/100 000. The dangerous men did not show higher frequencies than the women for psychopathology, drug abuse, behaviour or criminality.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between minority stress, social belongingness to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGB[T+]) community, and mental health among lesbian and bisexual women. The data were collected using a web-based questionnaire. The self-selected sample consisted of 499 respondents, of which 33% were bisexual women and 67% were lesbian women. All women reported low levels of minority stress, moderate levels of belongingness to the LGB(T+) community, and most reported good mental health. Bisexual women reported higher levels of minority stress, lower levels of belongingness to the LGB(T+) community, and worse mental health than lesbian women. The strongest minority stress factor among bisexual women was concealment, whereas among lesbian women it was internalized homonegativity. Although there were several associations between belongingness to the LGB(T+) community and mental health among lesbian women, no similar relationship was found among bisexual women.

AB Measuring personality disorders among substance abusers may entail special problems related to the reliability and validity of the instruments. The Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory II (MCMI-II), a well-known self-reporting instrument, was used in a prospective study of drug abusers from 21 treatment programs in Norway (n = 481) to investigate the influence of substance abuse on the reliability and stability of the MCMI personality traits at intake to treatment and after 7 years (n = 342). As regards the drug-abusing and drug-free subgroups, the MCMI-II dimensional scores were equally reliable and stable in both groups, and were not influenced by the abusing state. Using the MCMI-II in a categorical diagnostic way did not show sufficient predictive validity. The MCMI-II dimensional scores should therefore be used to measure personality disorder traits among help-seeking and former drug abusers. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Background: "Several elderly patients express a wish to die >>. The existential impact of age related loss plays an important role in the development of the wish to die. Other contributory factors are: personal characteristics, biological components, social context, perceptions and values. Aim: To explore the experiences, perceptions and initiatives of home healthcare professionals when dealing with elderly patients who no longer wish to live. Methods: Qualitative focus group interviews were conducted with eight home healthcare workers in three communities in Norway. Results: One theme emerged: When life no longer has any meaning, based on the following five sub-themes: Loss of hope, A cry for help, Lack of the will to live, The feeling of being a burden to someone, Loneliness and lack of a social network. Conclusion: Health personnel working in home care have an important responsibility for the development of guidance and support strategies for elderly patients living at home in order to meet their specific health needs.

AB Background: Most depressed older people in a suicidal state have mixed feelings, where the wish to live and the wish to die wage a battle. Aims: To explore and describe depressed older people's experiences of being suicidal and their search for meaning. Method: Data were collected from 29 participants resident in the Rogaland and Vestfold districts of Norway, by means of individual interviews, after which a thematic analysis was performed. Results: For the participants in this study, the lived experiences of the situated meaning of survival after being suicidal comprised a main theme - "shadows from the past" - and two themes - "feeling that something inside is broken" and "a struggle to catch the light." Conclusion: Mental health-care professionals might be able to reduce the risk of suicide and perturbation by helping depressed older people to explore, resolve, and ultimately come to terms with their unresolved historical issues. Additional valuable strategies in primary care settings include encountering patients frequently, monitoring adherence to care plans, and providing support to address the source of emotional pain and distress.

AB This international comparative study addresses differences between adolescents who engage in deliberate self-harm (DSH) and who receive help following the DSH episode versus those who do not. A standardised self-report questionnaire was completed by Pupils aged 14-17 in Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, The Netherlands, and Norway (n=30532). An act of DSH in the year prior to the study was reported by 1660 participants. Nearly half (48.4%) had not received any help following DSH, 32.8% had received help from their social network only and 18.8% from health services. Except for Hungary, cross-national comparisons revealed remarkably similar findings. Adolescents who had been in contact with health services following DSH reported more often a wish to die, lethal methods, alcohol/drug problems and DSH in the family compared to those who had not. However, those who received no help or help from their social network only were also heavily burdened. (C) 2008 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

   DECLINE
AB Autopsies can give valuable information about the cause of death, and represent an important tool for obtaining valid cause of death statistics. In particular, they may shed light on the circumstances of death in ambiguous and criminal cases. To address the need for information on current autopsy practices, forensic autopsy rates in two counties in Central Norway over the period 2007-2009 were assessed. To investigate toxicological findings that could possibly remain undisclosed without the performance of an autopsy, the impact of alcohol and drugs in forensic autopsy cases from this material was evaluated.
   The total forensic autopsy rate in this material was 3%. The forensic autopsy rates were low for natural deaths (1%), accidental falls (12%) and the heterogeneous category "other accidents'' (21%), relatively high for accidental poisonings (84%), and less than adequate for road traffic accidents (57%). For suicides the forensic autopsy rate was 63%, and for recognized homicides 100%. The total forensic autopsy rate was higher for men than for women (5% vs. 2%), and decreased with age, being 38% in the age group <30 years, 23% in the age group 30-59 years, and 1% in the age group >59 years. Despite that Norwegian legislation and regulations regarding forensic autopsy requests are national, the forensic autopsy rates were generally lower in the county of Nord-Trondelag than in Sor-Trondelag, with most striking differences in suicide deaths (11% vs. 91%) and road traffic accidents (46% vs. 67%). This illustrates how autopsy rates, and possibly cause of death registries, might be susceptible to the influence of regional variations in law enforcement, with possible consequences for the quality and validity of cause of death statistics.
   Of the forensic autopsy cases where toxicological analysis was performed (361 of 364 cases) a total of 71% had positive toxicology results; 12% were positive for alcohol only, 44% were positive for drugs only, and 15% were positive for both alcohol and drugs. The toxicology results suggest that alcohol and drugs are important factors in sudden unexpected deaths, and that a thorough and comprehensive toxicological analysis is called for when investigating these deaths. Mean BAC in alcohol positive forensic autopsy cases was 1.7% (median 1.6%, range 0.29-4.1%). The average number of substances detected in toxicology positive cases was 2.6 (median 2, range 1-10).

AB Introduction. Poisoning is a common cause of emergency visits and hospital admission in Western countries. The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence and type of toxic exposures presenting to emergency medical facilities in Iceland. Materials and methods. The study was prospective and included all patients with confirmed or suspected poisoning presenting to hospitals and rural medical centers providing emergency services in Iceland during the twelve-month period from April 2001 until March 2002. Results. A total of 1,121 toxic exposures were documented representing an incidence of 3.91 cases per 1,000 inhabitants per year. The female to male ratio was 1.23. The majority of exposures (56.7%) occurred in the patient's home, 60% were deliberate, 72% had drugs and/or alcohol as their main cause, and 11% involved illicit drugs. Exposures to chemicals other than drugs were usually unintentional. Conclusion. Toxic exposures requiring emergency medical care are common in Iceland. Self-poisonings by ingestion of prescription drugs and/or alcohol accounted for the majority of cases.

TI Poverty in Global Perspective: Is Shame a Common Denominator?
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Focussing on the psychosocial dimensions of poverty, the contention that shame lies at the 'irreducible absolutist core' of the idea of poverty is examined through qualitative research with adults and children experiencing poverty in diverse settings in seven countries: rural Uganda and India; urban China; Pakistan; South Korea and United Kingdom; and small town and urban Norway. Accounts of the lived experience of poverty were found to be very similar, despite massive disparities in material circumstances associated with locally defined poverty lines, suggesting that relative notions of poverty are an appropriate basis for international comparisons. Though socially and culturally nuanced, shame was found to be associated with poverty in each location, variably leading to pretence, withdrawal, self-loathing, 'othering', despair, depression, thoughts of suicide and generally to reductions in personal efficacy. While internally felt, poverty-related shame was equally imposed by the attitudes and behaviour of those not in poverty, framed by public discourse and influenced by the objectives and implementation of anti-poverty policy. The evidence appears to confirm the negative consequences of shame, implicates it as a factor in increasing the persistence of poverty and suggests important implications for the framing, design and delivery of anti-poverty policies.

AB Health-related quality of life was estimated using the physical and mental summary scores of the SF-12 Health Survey in a cross-sectional study of a general population of 23,312 individuals aged 40-47 years in Hordaland County, Norway. The mean scores in the main occupational groups were adjusted for lifestyle factors using a six-way analysis Of covariance. The category of legislators, senior officials, and managers scored highest on both the physical and the mental components, whereas the drivers scored lowest on the physical health and agricultural and fishery workers scored lowest on mental health. Smoking showed marked dose-response relationships with reduced physical and mental health, and inverse U-shaped relationships were found for alcohol consumption and the body mass index, with the mental scale for body mass index peaking above the recommended range of 18.5 to 25.0 kg/m(2). Although selection bias related to the choice of occupation cannot be ruled out, the low scores of the quality of life measure for the agricultural and fishery workers and the drivers most likely reflect the effect of known health stressors for these occupations.

AB Objectives To explore all-cause mortality and the association between symptoms of depression and all-cause mortality in farmers compared with other occupational groups, using a prospective cohort design.
   Methods We included adult participants with a known occupation from the second wave of the Nord-TrOndelag Health Study (HelseundersOkelsen i Nord-TrOndelag 2 (HUNT2) 1995-1997), Norway. Complete information on emigration and death from all causes was obtained from the National Registries. We used the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to measure symptoms of depression. We compared farmers to 4 other occupational groups. Our baseline study population comprised 32618 participants. Statistical analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazards models.
   Results The estimated mortality risk in farmers was lower than in all other occupations combined, with a sex and age-adjusted HR (0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.00). However, farmers had an 11% increased age-adjusted and sex-adjusted mortality risk compared with the highest ranked socioeconomic group (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.25). In farmers, symptoms of depression were associated with a 13% increase in sex-adjusted and age-adjusted mortality risk (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.45). Compared with other occupations this was the lowest HR, also after adjusting for education, marital status, long-lasting limiting somatic illness and lifestyle factors (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.39).
   Conclusions Farmers had lower all-cause mortality compared with the other occupational groups combined. Symptoms of depression were associated with an increased mortality risk in farmers, but the risk increase was smaller compared with the other occupational groups.

TI Ambiguous indifference - fatal overdoses among marginalized drug users
   after discharge from inpatient treatment

DT Article
DE Fatal overdoses; drug treatment system; marginalization; indifference
ID RISK; SUICIDE; ADDICTS; MORTALITY; DEATH
AB BACKGROUND - In the European context, Norway is one of the countries with the highest over-dose-related mortality rate. Research proves that the risk of overdose mortality among marginalized drug users is particularly high during the first weeks after discharge from inpatient treatment. AIM - It is therefore interesting to investigate whether there might be a connection between marginalization and treatment culture to understand fatale overdoses after discharge from inpatient treatment. DESIGN & METHODS - The case study is based on a previous field study connected to the death register. The study focuses on a single individual, Sam, and his treatment process. Data is analyzed in the light of a cultural analytical perspective. RESULTS - The results shows how the treatment system can be a social arena for institutional exclusion and marginalization that aggravate the person's self-esteem and life situation. One central aspect of the process of treatment was that it generated indifference. Sam's treatment motivation developed into treatment indifference. In the last part of the article, the author discusses indifference as a risk aspect of overdose mortality after discharged from treatment. It is not possible to conclude if Sam's overdose death was an accident or suicide. However, in the light of action theory the case shows that indifference can be a central aspect of both an unintentional and intentional overdose. Sam's death can be understood in the light of the concept ambiguous indifference. CONCLUSION - The case shows that there may be a relationship between marginality, treatment culture and overdose mortality. Cultural and structural aspects of the treatment system put Sam in an empty and risky situation that probably contributed to his death. In a comparison of risk situations in this case-history with recent research on treatment system, we can see several worrisome resemblances considering overdose mortality after discharge from inpatient treatment.

AB Objective: Beyond genetic risk variants, the pathophysiology of bipolar disorders is likely to be partly determined by environmental susceptibility factors. Our study is one of the first to investigate, in a large sample of well-characterized bipolar patients, associations between clinical presentations and childhood trauma subtypes, including neglect and abuse items.
   Method: 587 patients with D.SM-W defined bipolar disorder were recruited from France and Norway between 1996-2008 and 2007-2012, respectively. History of childhood trauma was obtained using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Clinical variables were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (Norwegian sample) or the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (French sample).
   Results: Earlier age at onset of bipolar illness, suicide attempts, rapid cycling, and an increased number of depressive episodes each had significant associations.001) with at least 1 subtype of childhood trauma (emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and emotional neglect). Multivariate analyses investigating trauma variables together showed that both emotional and sexual abuse were independent predictors of lower age at onset (P=.002 for each) and history of suicide attempts (OR= 1.60 [95% Cl, 1.07 to 2.39], P=.023; OR= 1.80 [95% Cl, 1.14 to 2.86], P=.012, respectively), while sexual abuse was the strongest predictor of rapid cycling (OR= 2.04 [95% Cl, 1.21 to 3.42], P=.007). Females reported overall higher childhood trauma frequency and greater associations to clinical expressions than males (P values <.05).
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate consistent associations between childhood trauma and more severe clinical characteristics in bipolar disorder. Further, they show the importance of including emotional abuse as well as the more frequently investigated sexual abuse when targeting clinical characteristics of bipolar disorder.

AB Objectives. To study. prospectively, in young adult patients, the mortality during the first years after the diagnosis of diabetes.
   Design. The Diabetes Incidence Study in Sweden (DISS) aims to register all incident cases aged 15-34 years. During a 10-year period all deaths were identified by record linkage to the national Cause of Death Registry.
   Subjects. During the period, 4097 new cases were registered and classified as type 1 diabetes (73%). type 2 (16%), secondary (2%) and unclassified (9%). The median follow-up was 5 years (21 001 person-years).
   Main outcome measures. Calculation of the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Evaluation of all deceased by scrutiny of clinical records, death certificates and autopsy protocols.
   Results. Fifty-eight patients died, corresponding to an SMR of 3.5 (CI = 2.7-4.5), which increased from 1.5 at 15-19 years to 4.1 at 30-34 years, SMR was 2.7 in primary diabetes: 2.3 (1.6-3.3) in type 1 and 4.1 (2.6-6.7) in type 2. In secondary diabetes, alcohol-associated pancreatitis a common cause, SMR was 32 (CI = 24-45). Evidence of alcohol or drug misuse, mental dysfunction or suicide was found in 40 of all 58 deceased cases. Less often, hypoglycaemia (n = 7) or hyperglycaemia-ketoacidosis (n = 11) was present at death. Unexplained 'dead in bed' was found once.
   Conclusions. In the investigated population-based cohort the early mortality was about threefold increased. Hypoglycaemia and ketoacidosis per se played a relatively small role compared with a heavy impact from social and mental dysfunction, and from careless use of alcohol or drugs.

AB There is evidence to suggest that both psychological characteristics and stressful life events are contributory factors in deliberate self-harm among young people. These links, and the possibility of a dose-response relationship between self-harm and both psychological health and life events, were investigated in the context of a seven-country school-based study. Over 30,000, mainly 15 and 16 year olds, completed anonymous questionnaires at secondary schools in Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and Australia. Pupils were asked to report on thoughts and episodes of self-harm, complete scales on depression and anxiety symptoms, impulsivity and self-esteem and indicate stressful events in their lives. Level and frequency of self-harm was judged according to whether they had thought about harming themselves or reported single or multiple self-harm episodes. Multinomial logistic regression assessed the extent to which psychological characteristics and stressful life events distinguished between adolescents with different self-harm histories. Increased severity of self-harm history was associated with greater depression, anxiety and impulsivity and lower self-esteem and an increased prevalence of all ten life event categories. Female gender, higher impulsivity and experiencing the suicide or self-harm of others, physical or sexual abuse and worries about sexual orientation independently differentiated single-episode self-harmers from adolescents with self-harm thoughts only. Female gender, higher depression, lower self-esteem, experiencing the suicide or self-harm of others, and trouble with the police independently distinguished multiple- from single-episode self-harmers. The findings reinforce the importance of psychological characteristics and stressful life events in adolescent self-harm but nonetheless suggest that some factors are more likely than others to be implicated.

AB Background: To study mortality rate and causes of death among all hospitalized opioid addicts treated for self-poisoning or admitted for voluntary detoxification in Oslo between 1980 and 1981, and to compare their mortality to that of the general population.
   Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted on 185 opioid addicts from all medical departments in Oslo who were treated for either self-poisoning (n = 93, 1980), voluntary detoxification ( n = 75, 1980/1981) or both ( n = 17). Their median age was 24 years; with a range from 16 to 41, and 53% were males. All deaths that had occurred by the end of 2000 were identified from the Central Population Register. Causes of death were obtained from Statistics Norway. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed for mortality, in general, and in particular, for different causes of death.
   Results: During a period of 20 years, 70 opioid addicts died (37.8%), with a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) equal to 23.6 (95% CI, 18.7-29.9). The SMR remained high during the whole period, ranging from 32.4 in the first five-year period, to 13.4 in the last five-year period. There were no significant differences in SMR between self-poisonings and those admitted for voluntarily detoxification. The registered causes of death were accidents (11.4%), suicide (7.1%), cancer (4.3%), cardiovascular disease (2.9%), other violent deaths ( 2.9%), other diseases (71.4%). Among the 50 deaths classified as other diseases, the category "drug dependence" was listed in the vast majority of cases ( 37 deaths, 52.9% of the total). SMRs increased significantly for all causes of death, with the other diseases group having the highest SMR; 65.8 ( 95% CI, 49.9 - 86.9). The SMR was 5.4 ( 95% CI, 1.3 - 21.5) for cardiovascular diseases, and 4.3 ( 95% CI, 1.4 - 13.5) for cancer. The SMR was 13.2 ( 95% CI, 6.6 - 26.4) for accidents, 10.7 ( 95% CI, 4.5 - 25.8) for suicides, and 28.6 ( 95% CI, 7.1 - 114.4) for other violent deaths.
   Conclusion: The risk of death among opioid addicts was significantly higher for all causes of death compared with the general population, implying a poor prognosis over a 20- year period for this young patient group.

AB Purpose of Review(1) To develop a framework for understanding the holistic effects of climate change on the Saami people; (2) to summarize the scientific evidence about the primary, secondary, and tertiary effects of climate change on Saami culture and Sapmi region; and (3) to identify gaps in the knowledge of the effects of climate change on health and well-being of the Saami.
   Recent Findings The Saami health is on average similar, or slightly better compared to the health of other populations in the same area. Warming climate has already influenced Saami reindeer culture. Mental health and suicide risk partly linked to changing physical and social environments are major concerns.
   Summary The lifestyle, diet, and morbidity of the Saami are changing to resemble the majority populations posing threats for the health of the Saami and making them more vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Climate change is a threat for the cultural way of life of Saami. Possibilities for Saami to adapt to climate change are limited.

AB Major findings of the Survey of Living Conditions in the Arctic (SLiCA) are: (1) A combination of traditional activities and cash employment is the prevailing lifestyle of Arctic indigenous peoples; (2) family ties, social support of each other, and traditional activities have a lot to do with why indigenous people choose to remain in Arctic communities; (3) well-being is closely related to job opportunities, locally available fish and game, and a sense of local control. Well-being and depression (and related problems like suicide) are flip sides of the same coin. Improving well-being may reduce social problems; and, (4) health conditions vary widely in the Arctic: three-in-four Greenlandic Inuit self-rate their health as at least very good compared with one-in-two Canadian and Alaska Inuit and one-in-five Chukotka indigenous people. Findings are based on 7,200 interviews in a probability sample of Inupiat settlement regions of Alaska, the four Inuit settlement regions of Canada, all of Greenland, and the Anadyrskij, Anadyr, Shmidtovs, Beringovskij, Chukotskij, Iujl'tinskij, Bilibinskij, Chaunskij, Providenskij, Uel'Kal' districts of Chukotka. Indigenous people and researchers from Greenland, Russia, Canada, the United States, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland collaborated on all phases of the study.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients treated in psychiatric care are exposed to the risk of adverse events, similar to patients treated in somatic health care.
   OBJECTIVES: In this article we report the findings of triggers associated with adverse events (AEs) identified by a version of the Global Trigger Tool - Psychiatry (GTT-P) adapted for Norwegian hospital-based psychiatric treatment.
   METHODS: The design was a retrospective analysis of a random sample of 240 patient records from a psychiatric clinic in one Norwegian hospital. Patient records were sampled from both inpatient and outpatient psychiatric clinics in hospitals serving the northern part of the county of Trondelag, Norway.
   RESULTS: Our analysis was based on the identification of 32 potential triggers of adverse events. Eighteen of the triggers were significantly related to adverse events. No adverse events were identified in patient records that did not also contain triggers included in the Global Trigger Tool.
   CONCLUSIONS: There is a clear relationship between the presence of triggers in a patient record and the likelihood of adverse events. Particularly relevant for psychiatric patients is 'suffering' as a trigger and this may also be relevant to somatic care and has implications for inclusion in the GTT-P.

ID GUN; LAWS
AB As recent cases of mass murder at Utoya Island in Norway, and in the United States (US) at Virginia Tech, Virginia; Tucson, Arizona; Aurora, Colorado; and Newtown, Connecticut all illustrate, acts of extreme violence involving high powered weapons and committed by persons with a presumed or confirmed mental illness tend to arouse intense public and political debates about the efficacy of firearm regulation and control. Following these tragedies, in the US at least, various law reform measures have been proposed and in some cases implemented designed principally to make it more difficult for mentally ill persons to gain access to firearms. In this article it is contended that measures like these are at best tinkering with the margins of gun control and also have the tendency to reinforce the stigma and discrimination experienced by persons with a mental illness, while perpetuating stereotypes of them as dangerous to themselves and others. Despite these limitations, and while firearm regulation policies and practices vary widely across the globe, most nations still seek in some way to limit access to guns by persons with a mental illness. This article explores in more detail how such policies and practices have been applied in the Australian State of New South Wales and the lessons to be learned elsewhere from this experience.

AB Aim: To assess the aggregate association between alcohol consumption and violence, while controlling for potential confounders. Design and measurements: The data comprise aggregate time-series for Norway in the period 1880-2003 and 1911-2003 on criminal violence rates and per capita alcohol consumption. Possible confounders comprise annual rates of unemployment, divorce, marriage, total fertility rate, gross national product, public assistance/social care and the proportion of the population aged between 15 and 25. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) analyses were performed on differenced data. Both semilogarithmic and linear models were estimated. Findings: Alcohol consumption was associated significantly with violence, and an increase in alcohol consumption of 1 litre per year per inhabitant predicted a change of approximately 8% in the violence rate. The parameter estimate for the alcohol variable remained unaltered after including the covariates both in the semilogarithmic and the linear models. Of the seven covariates included in the models, only divorce was associated significantly with violence rate. Conclusions: The results suggest that alcohol consumption has an independent effect on violence rates when other factors are controlled for. The results support the assumption of a causal effect of alcohol consumption on violence, and it appears that alcohol consumption is an important factor when we wish to explain changes in violence rates over time.

AB The agricultural sector in Norway has undergone structural changes over the past 50 years. The objective of this study was to analyze the distribution of concerns about farm economy, work time, and mental complaints among Norwegian farmers. In a sample of single principal owner-operators (n = 2,676), we calculated the unadjusted and adjusted odd ratios (ORs) for concerns about the farm economy, concerns for insufficient time to complete work, and high symptom load of mental complaints. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to explore the associations between farm characteristics, concerns, and mental health. Farmers had a high probability for an increased symptom load of mental complaints. The level of farm income was more strongly associated with economic concerns and mental health concerns when a major part of total household income resulted from farming. The high workload required in farming combined with off-farm supplemental employment was additionally associated with higher levels of time concerns and mental complaints. Norwegian farmers have a relatively high workload both in farming and in off-farm work but are able to make sustainable plans for their individual workload needs. The high individual workload in both these arenas poses a challenge, but was not associated with a greater probability for a high symptom load of mental complaints.

AB To investigate prospectively the associations between daily smoking and nicotine dependence and anxiety, depression and suicide attempts.
   Data were from the Young in Norway Longitudinal Study. A population-based sample (n = 1501) was followed for 13 years from ages 13-27 years. Data were gathered on smoking patterns and nicotine dependence; and depression, anxiety and parasuicide. Extensive information on socio-demographic factors, parental and family conditions, parental rearing practices, educational career, conduct problems, alcohol problems and use of illegal substances was also collected.
   Young adults who were nicotine-dependent had clearly elevated rates of anxiety, depression and parasuicide. These rates declined after controlling for a previous history of mental health problems and potential confounding factors. After adjustment, nicotine dependence was still associated with anxiety, depression and parasuicide. There was also a significant association with later depression in the group of non-dependent daily smokers. Measures of reduced mental health did not predict later smoking initiation or the development of nicotine dependence.
   Mental health was reduced more seriously in nicotine-dependent smokers than in non-dependent smokers. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that smoking, in particular nicotine dependence, influences mental health.

AB Objective: We aimed to assess the causes of death, the mortality and survival time of MS patients in Hungary.
   Patients and methods: Between 1993 and 2013, 740 patients (10,303 person-years) were treated at our Outpatients' Clinic, of which 121 died. The causes of death were established from the pathological records or the medical certificates of the cause of death. The standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated. Survival time was assessed with Gehan-Breslow test.
   Results: Sixty-four percent of our patients died of MS-related causes. The SMR was 2.52. Primary progressive (PPMS) patients' SMR was higher (4.10) than initially relapsing patients' (RR/SPMS) was. There was no difference between the genders (2.46 for men vs 2.57 for women). The median survival time of woman was 3 years longer (p < 0.001). RR/SPMS patients' median survival (35 years) was more than twice as long as PPMS patients' (14 years).
   Discussion: The frequency of the MS-related cause of death, SMR and the median survival times were mostly similar to previous results from Scandinavia and North-America, despite the very different socio-economic backgrounds of these areas which shows that the survival risk can solely be attributed to MS itself. These are the first data on the topic from Central-Eastern-Europe. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID CHILDREN; PLAYERS
AB Computer games are the most advanced form of gaming. For most people, the playing is an uncomplicated leisure activity; however, for a minority the gaming becomes excessive and is associated with negative consequences. The aim of the present study was to investigate computer game-playing behaviour in the general adult Norwegian population, and to explore mental health problems and self-reported consequences of playing. The survey includes 3,405 adults 16 to 74 years old (Norway 2007, response rate 35.3%). Overall, 65.5% of the respondents reported having ever played computer games (16-29 years, 93.9%; 30-39 years, 85.0%; 40-59 years, 56.2%; 60-74 years, 25.7%). Among 2,170 players, 89.8% reported playing less than 1 hr. as a daily average over the last month, 5.0%, played 1-2 hr. daily, 3.1% played 2-4 hr. daily, and 2.2% reported playing > 4 hr. daily. The strongest risk factor for playing > 4 hr. daily was being an online player, followed by male gender, and single marital Status. Reported negative consequences of computer game playing increased strongly with average daily playing time. Furthermore, prevalence of self-reported sleeping problems, depression, suicide ideations, anxiety, obsessions/compulsions, and alcohol/substance abuse increased with increasing playing time. This study showed that adult populations should also be included in research on computer game-playing behaviour and its consequences.

AB Social and economic policies are inextricably linked with population health outcomes in Europe, yet few datasets are able to fully explore and compare this relationship across European countries. The European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey aims to address this gap using microdata on income, living conditions and health. EU-SILC contains both cross-sectional and longitudinal elements, with nationally representative samples of individuals 16 years and older in 28 European Union member states as well as Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. Data collection began in 2003 in Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Greece, Luxembourg and Austria, with subsequent expansion across Europe. By 2011, all 28 EU member states, plus three others, were included in the dataset. Although EU-SILC is administered by Eurostat, the data are output-harmonized so that countries are required to collect specified data items but are free to determine sampling strategies for data collection purposes. EU-SILC covers approximately 500 000 European residents for its cross-sectional survey annually. Whereas aggregated data from EU-SILC are publicly available [http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/income-and-living-conditions/data/main-tables], microdata are only available to research organizations subject to approval by Eurostat. Please refer to [http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/microdata/eu_silc] for further information regarding microdata access.

   NETHERLANDS; MORTALITY; CARE
AB Background Finnmark County is the northernmost county in Norway. For several decades, the rate of mortality after injury in this sparsely inhabited region has remained above the national average. Following documentation of this discrepancy for the period 1991-1995, improvements to the trauma system were implemented. The present study aims to assess whether trauma-related mortality rates have subsequently improved.
   Methods All injury-associated fatalities in Finnmark from 1995-2004 were identified retrospectively from the National Registry of Death and reviewed. Low-energy trauma in elderly individuals and poisonings were excluded.
   Results A total of 453 cases of trauma-related death occurred during the study period, and 327 of those met the inclusion criteria. Information was retrievable for 266 cases. The majority of deaths (86%) occurred in the pre-hospital phase. The main causes of death were suicide (33%) and road traffic accidents (21%). Drowning and snowmobile injuries accounted for an unexpectedly high proportion (12 and 8%, respectively). The time of death did not show trimodal distribution. Compared to the previous study period, there was a significant overall decline in injury-related mortality, yet there was no change in place of death, mechanism of injury, or time from injury until death.
   Conclusions Changes in injury-related mortality cannot be linked to improvements in the trauma system. There was no change in the epidemiological patterns of injury. The high rate of on-scene mortality indicates that any major improvement in the number of injury-related deaths lies in targeted prevention.

DE Death; Police custody; Alcohol intoxication; Suicides
AB Purpose: To describe the changes in death rates and causes of deaths in Norwegian police cells during the last 2 decades. To review reports on death rates in police cells that have been published in medical journals and elsewhere, and discuss the difficulties of comparing death rates between countries.
   Methods: Data on deaths in Norwegian police cells were collected retrospectively in 2002 and 2012 for two time periods: 1993-2001 (period 1) and 2003-2012 (period 2). Several databases were searched to find reports on deaths in police cells from as many countries as possible.
   Results: The death rates in Norwegian police cells reduced significantly from 0.83 deaths per year per million inhabitants (DYM) in period 1 to 0.22 DYM in period 2 (p < 0.05). The most common cause of death in period 1 was alcohol intoxication including intracranial bleeding in persons with high blood alcohol levels, and the number declined from 16 persons in period 1 to 1 person in period 2 (p = 0.032). The median death rate in the surveyed Western countries was 0.44 DYM (range: 0.14-1.46 DYM).
   Conclusion: The number of deaths in Norwegian police cells reduced by about 75% over a period of approximately 10 years. This is probably mainly due to individuals with severe alcohol intoxication no longer being placed in police cells. However, there remain large methodology difficulties in comparing deaths rates between countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Early onset of bipolar disorder (BD) is an important clinical predictor of a more severe course and poorer outcome. A higher proportion of childhood onset BD has been reported in studies from USA compared to Europe. We investigated age at onset of first affective episode in a Norwegian sample and compared it to previous European and US findings. In addition, we examined whether age at onset influenced on time to first treatment, and if patient characteristics related to illness severity influenced age at onset.
   Methods: Two hundred and twenty five BD patients were recruited consecutively mainly from psychiatric out-patient units at three major hospitals in Oslo, Norway, diagnosed using SCID-I and divided into four groups based on age at onset.
   Results: Six percent of the patients had onset in childhood, 32% in adolescence, 43% in young adulthood, and 19% as adults. Average age at onset was 22.8 years (SD 9.4). There was a significantly higher age at onset and a significantly shorter time from onset to first treatment in patients with lifetime hospitalization.
   Limitation: Retrospective information which could be confounded by collection bias.
   Conclusion: Age at onset in our sample resembled previous European studies, but not US- or Norwegian studies. The difference in age at onset seems more related to different definitions of onset, than to hospitalization history. This highlights the importance of improving the research criteria and of using similar criteria to ascertain age at onset. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aims. This paper is a report of a study of health-related quality of life and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in patients attending an Accident and Emergency department because of psychosocial crises. Background. Psychosocial crises are commonplace globally, but there is little knowledge about patients attending Accident and Emergency departments because of psychosocial crises. Methods. Data were collected at an Accident and Emergency department in Norway from September 2008 to June 2009. A total of 99 adults participated in the baseline study and 41 of these participated at 2 months follow-up. The Short Form-36 Health Survey and the Post Traumatic Symptom Scale were used to obtain data. Findings. Participants reported significantly lower scores in all health-related quality of life domains at baseline compared with the general Norwegian population. The mental health score was two standard deviations below the norm. Health-related quality of life scores were improved and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms were reduced after 2 months. High levels of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms were reported by 78% of the participants at baseline and 59% at follow-up. Participants with high levels of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms at follow-up also reported low health-related quality of life scores. Conclusion. This study suggests a need for an acute psychosocial intervention and an opportunity to receive follow-up support at Accident and Emergency departments.

AB Aims: Despite the excess mortality and morbidity associated with acute poisoning by substances of abuse, follow-up is frequently not organised. We assessed morbidity, including repeated poisoning, and follow-up after acute poisoning by substances of abuse through charting contacts with health services. We also charted short-term mortality. Methods: Patients 12 years and older treated for acute poisoning by substances of abuse at a primary care emergency outpatient clinic in Oslo, Norway, were included consecutively from October 2011 through September 2012. We retrieved information from national registers on fatalities, hospital admissions, and contacts at outpatient specialist health services and with general practitioners (GPs), during the 90 days following a poisoning episode. Results: We included 1731 patients treated for 2343 poisoning episodes. During the 90 days following the poisoning, 31% of the patients were treated at somatic hospitals, 9% admitted to psychiatric hospitals, 37% in treatment at outpatient psychiatric/addiction specialist health services, 55% saw their GP, while 34% had no follow-up. The short-term mortality rate was 2.0%, eight times higher than expected. Increasing age, suicidal intention, opioid poisoning, and severe mental illness were associated with increased risk of death. Increasing age, male gender, opioid poisoning, and severe mental illness were associated with repeated poisoning. Patients with increased risk of repeated poisoning were more likely to be in follow-up at outpatient specialist psychiatric/addiction services and in contact with their GP. Conclusions: Follow-up measures seem targeted to those most in need, though one out of three had none. The mortality rate calls for concern.

   RATES; MENTAL-HEALTH; TRENDS; CARE; UNEMPLOYMENT; CONSUMPTION;
   PREVALENCE
AB Background: We aimed at describing the trends in antidepressants use (AD) by age and sex, during 2007-2011, in 5 European settings (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Catalonia and Veneto), and to assess whether the differences found across settings could be related to economic, social and cultural determinants.
   Methods: We collected data of AD use expressed in defined daily doses (DDD). Data were retrieved from population-based databases. We calculated DDD/1000 inhabitants/day. We analysed which economic, social, and cultural covariates determined between-settings differences in AD consumption.
   Results: The use of AD showed an increasing trend during the study period, being Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors the most consumed, followed "others AD". Women and the elderly showed the highest AD consumption. Between-settings variability in AD consumption showed a positive correlation with pharmaceutical expenditure and a negative one with general practitioner's rate. After adjusting by pharmaceutical expenditure and general practitioners rate Masculinity, Long-Term Orientation and Individualism cultural dimensions were associated with AD use by using the Hofstede's cultural dimensions model.
   Limitations: This study has been conducted in administrative databases, with no information on AD use by indication; differences among AD use could be related to their prescription for other disorders. Analyses were based on a small dataset and none of the results reached statistical significance.
   Conclusions: AD use increased through 2007-2011. Pharmaceutical expenditure and General Practitioners rate, Masculinity, Long-Term Orientation and Individualism explained the differences in AD use between countries. People's attitude should be considered when designing national campaigns to improve antidepressant use.

AB Background: Assessing factors associated with non-fatal overdose is important as these could be useful to identify individuals with substance use disorders at high risk of adverse outcomes and consequences. Depression may play an important role in terms of overdose risk. We aimed to test if drug users suffering from a depressive disorder might have significantly higher risk of non-fatal overdose as compared with drug users without depression.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, Embase and Web of Knowledge were searched. The pooled analyses were based on prevalence rates, risk difference (RD) and odds ratio (OR), reporting 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The combined estimates were obtained weighting each study according to random effects model for meta-analysis.
   Results: Seven articles, involving 12,019 individuals, and run in the US, Canada, Sweden, Norway, and Australia, were included. Pooled analyses comparing depressed with not depressed individuals highlighted a RD (95% CIs) for non-fatal overdose of 7.3% (4.8-9.7%) and an OR (95% CIs) of 1.45 (1.17-1.79). The subgroups analyses based on specific characteristics of included studies confirmed the association between depression and overdose.
   Conclusions: Depressive disorders seem to be important factors associated to the risk of-non-fatal overdose. Longitudinal studies might appropriately clarify causal inference issues. Future research should address the role of depressive disorders as predictors of subsequent non-fatal overdoses. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The aims of this study were to compare clinical characteristics and educational and occupational functioning in two Bipolar Disorder (BD) samples recruited respectively from acutely admitted inpatients and public outpatient clinics and to investigate if the two BD samples differed in the same way in education and work ability from the general population.
   Methods: DSM-IV BD patients were consecutively recruited from acute wards throughout Norway (N = 252; 69.8% BD I; 25.0% BD II; 5.2% BD NOS) and from outpatient clinics in the Oslo region (N = 230; 60.4% BD I; 33.5% BD II; 6.1% BD NOS) and demographic and clinical characteristics were compared. A reference sample from the general population (N = 100 869) was used to compare levels of education, marital status and disability benefits.
   Results: the acute ward sample was older, and had more men, more BD I disorder, more hospitalisations and suicide attempts, longer illness duration, an earlier age of onset and first treatment and used a higher number of antipsychotics, anticonvulsants and lithium than the outpatient sample. Both samples were educated to the same level as their respective reference populations, but received disability benefit and were single to a higher but similar degree.
   Conclusions: Clinical differences between the BD samples had no consequence for educational achievement and receipt of disability benefit compared to the general population indicating that other factors than severity of illness play a role for education and work abilities in BD patients.

AB Most studies in the field of impaired driving have focused on the hazards imposed on society by the impaired drivers, whereas little attention has been paid to the future outcome of the drivers. The aim of the study was to identify mortality rates and causes of death among drunken and drugged drivers during the years after apprehension. Prospective cohort study on apprehended drunken and drugged drivers, follow-up period: 7.5 years, outcome variable: death. Apprehended drivers 20-39 years old who provided samples positive for alcohol (n = 2531) or drugs other than alcohol (n = 918) constituting the total national samples of these two driver categories in 1992. The mortality rate among male drunken drivers was higher than in an age-matched Norwegian population (standardised mortality ratio, SMR = 3.7 (95% CI 2.9-4.7). The SMR for drugged drivers was 18.1 (14.9-21.8) for men and 27.9 (14.4-48.8) for women. In a subgroup of male drugged drivers using heroin, SMR was 39.8 (28.8-53.6). The dominant causes of death among drunken and drugged drivers were drug poisoning/overdose, accidents and suicide. Apprehension for drunken or drugged driving and subsequent analytical verification, is an indicator of increased risk of future premature death in the age group 20-39 years, particularly for drugged drivers. To our knowledge this is a new finding, and studies to confirm it should be carried out in other countries. If verified, the results should lead to the consideration of new public health approaches towards apprehended impaired drivers. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study examines reasons for adolescent deliberate self-harm. A cross-sectional survey using an anonymous self-report questionnaire was carried out in seven countries (Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway). Data on 30,477 school pupils between the ages of 14-17 were analysed. Past year and lifetime deliberate self-harm were assessed, along with the self-reported reasons for deliberate self-harm. The results showed that 'wanted to get relief from a terrible state of mind' and 'wanted to die' were most commonly reported. Principal component analysis indicated two underlying dimensions in the reasons for deliberate self-harm, i.e. a cry of pain motive and/or a cry for help motive. The majority of self-harmers reported at least one cry of pain motive ('to die', 'to punish myself', and 'to get relief from a terrible state of mind') and an additional cry for help motive ('to show how desperate I was feeling', to frighten someone', 'to get my own back on someone', 'to find out whether someone really loved me', and 'to get some attention'). Females reported more reasons than males. Only females showed an age difference, with girls aged 16-17 more frequently reporting a cry for help motive. There was considerable consistency in choice of motives across countries and genders. Systematic assessment of the reasons for deliberate self-harm can help clinicians to better understand the meaning of self harming behaviour, select appropriate treatment, suggest alternative coping strategies, and hopefully prevent future suicidal behaviour.

DE Overdose; Drug-induced death; Cause of Death Registry; Police registry;
   Opioids
AB Background: Registries for drug deaths may include different persons and provide different characteristics of the deceased. The aim of this study was to establish whether a database of drug-induced deaths (Cause of Death Registry (CDR) using the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) definition and the Police registry of drug deaths) included the same persons and provided the same characteristics of the deceased and thus yielded the same information for establishing targeted prevention measures.
   Methods: Notifications from 2007 to 2009 were drawn from the CDR and the police registry of drug deaths and the unique Norwegian personal identification number was used to match the registrations.
   Results: The two sources of drug deaths yielded 1384 registrations, encompassing 929 individuals of whom only 49% were included in both registries. A large proportion of the deceased (40%) were not listed in the police registry. This group was older (mean age 43 years vs. 35 years); dependence and suicide were listed more often as cause of death (33% vs. 8%); and heroin was listed less often as the type of drug causing death (24% vs. 67%) than those included in both registries. In particular, among women not included in the police registry, the cause of death was identified with much greater frequency as pharmaceuticals with morphine or codeine (47% vs. 16%).
   Conclusion: The large discrepancies in size, overlap, and characteristics of the deceased included in two sources of drug death imply that prevention measures based on the two sources will differ. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives The aim of this study was to examine mortality and cancer incidence in a cohort of 28 300 military servicemen known, from personnel files, to have served in the Royal Norwegian Navy during 1950-2004.
   Methods The cohort was followed from 1951-2007 for mortality and from 1953-2008 for cancer. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and incidence ratios (SIR) for cancer were calculated from national rates. Internal comparisons [rate ratios (RR)] were made using Poisson regression.
   Results Mortality for all Navy personnel was lower than expected for all causes combined (SMR 0.84) and for most disease groups and violent causes, but not for cancer mortality (SMR 1.02). Vessel crews had consistently higher SMR than land-based personnel, still with rates lower than or close to national ones. The relative risk between the two subgroups was in the same direction for mortality from alcohol abuse and non-malignant alcohol-related diseases (RR 1.56) and for the incidence of alcohol-related cancers (RR 1.58) and lung cancer (RR 1.65). An overall small excess in the incidence of all cancers combined for the entire cohort (SIR 1.06) was caused by prostate cancer, malignant melanoma, and non-melanoma skin cancer. An excess of bladder cancer was observed among submariners (SIR 1.53).
   Conclusion The low all-cause mortality was in line with a "healthy soldier effect". Navy personnel had a lower-than-expected mortality from accidents and suicide. Alcohol-related diseases were more frequent among vessel crews than among land-based personnel, but largely comparable to the rates among all Norwegian men.

AB Background
   Testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) patients and survivors have excess mortality compared to the general male population, but relative survival (RS) has been scarcely studied. We investigated causes of excess mortality and their impact on RS among men diagnosed with TGCT in Norway, 1953-2015.
   Methods and findings
   Using registry data (n = 9541), standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and RS were calculated. By December 31st, 2015, 816 testicular cancer (TC) and 1508 non-TC deaths had occurred (non-TC SMR: 1.36). Within five years of TGCT diagnosis, 80% were TC deaths. Non-TC second cancer (SC) caused 65% of excess non-TC deaths, of which 34% from gastric, pancreatic or bladder cancer. SC SMRs remained elevated >= 26 years of follow-up. In localized TGCT diagnosed > 1979, SC SMRs were only elevated after seminoma. Cardiovascular disease caused 9% and other causes 26% of excess non-TC deaths, of which 58% from gastrointestinal and genitourinary disorders. RS continuously declined with follow-up. TGCT patients diagnosed > 1989 had superior five-year TC-specific RS (98.3%), lower non-TC SMR (1.21), but elevated SMRs for several SCs, infections, Alzheimer's disease, genitourinary disease and suicide. A limitation was lack of individual treatment data.
   Conclusions
   RS declines mainly from TC deaths < 5 years after TGCT diagnosis. Later, excess SC mortality becomes particularly important, reducing RS even.26 years. Radiotherapy; standard adjuvant seminoma treatment 1980-2007, is likely an important contributor, as are chemotherapy and possibly innate susceptibilities. Vigilant long-term follow-up, including psychosocial aspects, is important. Further research should focus on identifying survivor risk groups and optimizing treatment.

ID MENTAL-HEALTH; SUICIDE; STRESS
AB Agriculture has undergone profound changes, and farmers face a wide variety of stressors. Our aim was to study the levels of anxiety and depression symptoms among Norwegian farmers compared with other occupational groups. Working participants in the HUNT3 Survey (The Nord-Trondelag Health Study, 2006-2008), aged 19-66.9 years, were included in this cross-sectional study. We compared farmers (women, n = 317; men, n = 1,100) with HUNT3 participants working in other occupational groups (women, n = 13,429; men, n = 10,026), classified according to socioeconomic status. We used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to measure anxiety and depression symptoms. Both male and female farmers had higher levels of depression symptoms than the general working population, but the levels of anxiety symptoms did not differ. The differences in depression symptom levels between farmers and the general working population increased with age. In an age-adjusted logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio (OR) for depression caseness (HADS-D = 8) when compared with the general working population was 1.49 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22-1.83) in men and 1.29 (95% CI: 0.85-1.95) in women. Male farmers had a higher OR of depression caseness than any other occupational group (OR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.52-2.49, using higher-grade professionals as reference). Female farmers had an OR similar to men (2.00, 95% CI: 1.26-3.17), but lower than other manual occupations. We found that farmers had high levels of depression symptoms and average levels of anxiety symptoms compared with other occupational groups.

   GLOBAL ASSESSMENT; COMORBID ANXIETY
AB Background: There is a strong association between bipolar disorder (BD) and substance use disorder (SUD). The clinical and functional correlates of SUD in BD are still unclear and little is known about the role of excessive substance use that does not meet SUD criteria. Thus, the aims of the current study were to investigate lifetime rates of illicit substance use in BD relative to the normal population and if there are differences in clinical and functional features between BD patients with and without excessive substance use.
   Methods: 125 consecutively recruited BD in-and outpatients from the Oslo University Hospitals and 327 persons randomly drawn from the population in Oslo, Norway participated. Clinical and functional variables were assessed. Excessive substance use was defined as DSM-IV SUD and/or excessive use according to predefined criteria.
   Results: The rate of lifetime illicit substance use was significantly higher among patients compared to the reference population (OR = 3.03, CI = 1.9-4.8, p < .001). Patients with excessive substance use (45% of total) had poorer educational level, occupational status, GAF-scores and medication compliance, with a trend towards higher suicidality rates, compared to patients without. There were no significant group differences in current symptom levels or disease course between groups.
   Conclusion: The percentage of patients with BD that had tried illicit substances was significantly higher than in the normal population. BD patients with excessive substance use clearly had impaired functioning, but not a worse course of illness compared to patients without excessive substance use. An assessment of substance use beyond SUD criteria in BD is clinically relevant.

AB To examine prevalence of mental health problems among adolescents with chronic headache and compare internal and external coping strategies in young people with chronic headaches with and without mental health problems. This study is based on a cross-sectional survey undertaken in Akershus County in Norway. A total of 19,985 adolescents were included in the study, covering lower secondary and upper secondary students, aged 13-19 years. Chronic headache was measured with a single item question based on headache frequency. Mental health was assessed by using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ). Internal and external coping strategies were assessed through seven options for answering the question: What do you do/what happens when you are burdened by painful thoughts and feelings? Adolescents with chronic headaches showed more frequent mental health problems overall (23 %) compared to those without chronic headache (6 %). Logistic regression analyses showed that those adolescents having both chronic headaches and comorbid mental health problems more frequently used internal coping strategies, such as keeping feelings inside (OR 2.05), using abusive substances (OR 1.79) and talking oneself out of problems (OR 1.55), compared to those without mental health problems. Groups with mental health problems, especially with chronic headache, less frequently used the external strategy of talking to others about their problem than controls (OR 0.7-0.8). Factor analyses revealed significant differences in profiles of coping strategies between groups. We suggest that attention should be paid towards the high risk group that has both chronic headaches and mental health problems and their tendency to use destructive internal coping strategies.

AB Background: Adverse media coverage of isolated incidents affects the public perception of the risk of violent behavior among people with mental illness. However, the risk of violence is studied most frequently among inpatients, which falsely exaggerates the prevalence of people with mental illness because the majority of individuals receive treatment as outpatients.Aim: To estimate the prevalence of the risk of violence among inpatients and outpatients in psychiatric treatment, as well as the associations with gender, age, socio-economic status and co-morbid substance use disorders in all major diagnostic categories.Methods: We conducted a national census of patients in specialist mental health services in Norway, which included 65% of all inpatients (N=2,358) and 60% of all outpatients (N=23,124).Results: The prevalence of the risk of violence was 32% among inpatients and 8% among outpatients, where 80% of the patients in specialist mental health services were outpatients. If we weight the prevalence rates accordingly, less than 2% of the patients in specialist mental health services had a high risk of violent behavior.Conclusions: The stigma attached to those with mental illness is not consistent with the absence or low to modest risk of violent behavior in 98% of the patient group. Substance use disorders must be given priority in the treatment of all patient groups. Mental health care in general and interventions that target violent behavior in particular should address the problems and needs of these patients better, especially those who are unemployed, have a low level of education and have a background of being a refugee or an immigrant.

SO ADDICTION
LA English
DT Article
ID CIRRHOSIS MORTALITY; LIVER-CIRRHOSIS; CONSUMPTION; EPIDEMIOLOGY;
   COUNTRIES
AB This supplement includes a collection of papers that aim at estimating rite relationship between per capita alcohol consumption and various forms of mortality, including mortality front liver cirrhosis, accidents, suicide, homicide, ischaemic heart disease, and total mortality. The papers apply a uniform methodological protocol, and they are all based on rime series data covering the post-war period in the present EU countries and Norway. bz this paper we discuss various methodological and analytical issues that are common to these papers. We argue that analysis of time series data is the most feasible approach for assessing the aggregate health consequences of changes in population drinking. We further discuss how aggregate data may also be useful for judging the plausibility of individual-level relationships, particularly those prone to be confounded by, selection effects. The aggregation of linear and curvilinear risk curves is treated as well as various methods for dealing with the time-lag problem. with regard to estimation techniques we find country specific analyses preferable to pooled cross-sectional/time series models since the latter incorporate rite dubious element of geographical co-variation, and conceal potentially interesting variations in alcohol effects. The approach taken in the papers at hand if instead to pool the country specific results into three groups of countries that represent different drinking cultures; traditional wine countries of southern Europe, beer countries of central Europe and the British Isles and spirits countries of northern Europe. The findings of the papers reinforce the central tenet of the public health perspective that overall consumption is an important determinant of alcohol-related harm rates. However, there is a variation across country groups in alcohol effects, particularly those on violent deaths, that indicates the potential importance of drinking patterns. There is no support for the notion that increases in per capita consumption have any cardioprotective effects at the population level.

AB Background: Deliberate self-harm among young people is an important focus of policy and practice internationally. Nonetheless, there is little reliable comparative international information on its extent or characteristics. We have conducted a seven-country comparative community study of deliberate self-harm among young people. Method: Over 30,000 mainly 15- and 16-year-olds completed anonymous questionnaires at school in Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway. Study criteria were developed to identify episodes of self-harm; the prevalence of self-harm acts and thoughts, methods used, repetition, reasons given, premeditation, setting for the act, associations with alcohol and drugs, hospitalisation, and whether other people knew, were examined. Results: Self-harm was more than twice as common among females as males and, in four of the seven countries, at least one in ten females had harmed herself in the previous year. Additional young people had thought of harming themselves without doing so. More males and females in all countries except Hungary cut themselves than used any other method, most acts took place at home, and alcohol and illegal drugs were not usually involved. The most common reasons given were 'to get relief from a terrible state of mind' followed by 'to die', although there were differences between those cutting themselves and those taking overdoses. About half the young people decided to harm themselves in the hour before doing so, and many did not attend hospital or tell anyone else. Just over half those who had harmed themselves during the previous year reported more than one episode over their lifetime. Conclusions: Deliberate self-harm is a widespread yet often hidden problem in adolescents, especially females, which shows both similarities and differences internationally.

AB Context Previous studies have shown that physicians have an increased risk of mental health problems such as depression, suicide and substance abuse.
   Objectives To study the prevalence of mental health problems during the first postgraduate year, and to investigate whether work-related factors in hospital are linked to these, when we control for gender, previous mental health problems, personality traits, stress in medical school and other possible predictors.
   Design Nationwide and prospective postal questionnaire survey.
   Setting University of Oslo.
   Subjects Medical students who answered questionnaires in their graduating semester, and 1 year later when they were junior house officers (n=371).
   Results Mental health problems (needing treatment) during internship were reported by 11%, with no gender difference. Adjusted predictors of mental health problems were: previous mental health problems, (odds ratio (OR)=5.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 15.8); being married/cohabitant (OR=0.2, CI 0.1 to 0.7); the personality trait 'vulnerability' (OR=1.5, CI 1.1 to 2.0); negative life events during internship (OR=2.1, CI 1.2 to 3.5), and job stress as house officer (OR=1.05, CI 1.01 to 1.10). The job stress factor of emotional pressure/demands from patients was most important. Perceived study stress and lack of skills at the end of medical school were univariately related to mental health problems in internship, but not when other variables were adjusted. Gender, weekly working hours and lack of sleep were not linked to having problems.
   Conclusion Job stress is related to mental health problems among young doctors, even when the variables of previous mental health problems and personality traits are controlled for. More support during internship is needed.

AB Background: Many studies have investigated how unemployment influences health, less attention has been paid to the reverse causal direction; how health may influence the risk of becoming unemployed. We prospectively investigated a wide range of health measures and subsequent risk of unemployment during 14 years of follow-up. Methods: Self-reported health data from 36 249 participants in the Norwegian HUNT2 Study (1995-1997) was linked by a personal identification number to the National Insurance Database (1992-2008). Exact dates of unemployment were available. Cox's proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for the association of unemployment with several health measures. Adjustment variables were age, gender, education, marital status, occupation, lifestyle and previous unemployment. Results: Compared to reporting no conditions/symptoms, having a parts per thousand yen3 chronic somatic conditions (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.46-2.17) or high symptom levels of anxiety and depression (HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.35-1.83) increased the risk of subsequent unemployment substantially. Poor self-rated health (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.24-1.51), insomnia (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.09-1.32), gastrointestinal symptoms (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.08-1.26), high alcohol consumption (HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95-1.44) and problematic use of alcohol measured by the CAGE questionnaire (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.17-1.48) were also associated with increased risk of unemployment. Conclusion: People with poor mental and physical health are at increased risk of job loss. This contributes to poor health amongst the unemployed and highlights the need for policy focus on the health and welfare of out of work individuals, including support preparing them for re-employment.

AB Background: Previous research has shown that men who adhere to traditional beliefs about masculinity have increased health risks compared to those who do not. Single marital status, unemployment, retirement, and physical illness are commonly known risk factors for male suicidal behavior. Most men struggling with these risk factors are, however, not suicidal. To find out more about what makes some men vulnerable to suicidal behavior, risk factors must be analyzed in light of men's life history as well as the social context where they live their masculinity.
   Method: We conducted semi-structured qualitative in-depth interviews with 15 men (20-76 years old) who were admitted to hospital after a suicidal act. We analyzed the data by means of qualitative content analysis with a directed approach. The analysis was directed by the participants' reports on whether they had wanted to die or not at the time of the suicidal act. On this basis, they were divided into two groups: a "to die" and a "not to die" group. We then analyzed each group separately before comparing them.
   Results: In both groups, the main reason or trigger for the suicidal act were problems in intimate relationships. These problems were complex and connected to the men's lived masculinity, ranging from shame, or tainted masculine honor, to taking responsibility as a man for the wife. Some men pointed to pain and ennui as reasons or triggers for their suicidal act. Only one in the "not to die" group took full responsibility for the suicidal act, whereas all but one did the same in the "to die" group. The men not taking responsibility described the suicidal act as involuntary because of either alcohol or a kind of "black-out". Not taking responsibility for the act may be a way of preserving masculine identity.
   Conclusion: Relationship problems are the main reason or trigger of the suicidal act for most participants, but in very different ways, mirroring lived masculinity. The most striking finding is the uniqueness of each story, questioning the utility of standardized suicide prevention efforts.

Impact of sunlight on the age of onset of bipolar disorder. Bipolar Disord 2012: 14: 654663. (c) 2012 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Objective: Although bipolar disorder has high heritability, the onset occurs during several decades of life, suggesting that social and environmental factors may have considerable influence on disease onset. This study examined the association between the age of onset and sunlight at the location of onset. Method: Data were obtained from 2414 patients with a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, according to DSM-IV criteria. Data were collected at 24 sites in 13 countries spanning latitudes 6.3 to 63.4 degrees from the equator, including data from both hemispheres. The age of onset and location of onset were obtained retrospectively, from patient records and/or direct interviews. Solar insolation data, or the amount of electromagnetic energy striking the surface of the earth, were obtained from the NASA Surface Meteorology and Solar Energy (SSE) database for each location of onset. Results: The larger the maximum monthly increase in solar insolation at the location of onset, the younger the age of onset (coefficient= -4.724, 95% CI: -8.124 to -1.323, p = 0.006), controlling for each countrys median age. The maximum monthly increase in solar insolation occurred in springtime. No relationships were found between the age of onset and latitude, yearly total solar insolation, and the maximum monthly decrease in solar insolation. The largest maximum monthly increases in solar insolation occurred in diverse environments, including Norway, arid areas in California, and Chile. Conclusion: The large maximum monthly increase in sunlight in springtime may have an important influence on the onset of bipolar disorder.

AB Background: Though substance use is a known risk factor for self-discharge, patients self-discharging during treatment for acute poisoning have not previously been described. We charted characteristics of patients self-discharging during treatment for acute poisoning by substances of abuse looking for associations between self-discharge, repeated poisoning, and death.
   Methods: All patients 12 years and older treated for acute poisoning by substances of abuse at an emergency outpatient clinic in Oslo, Norway, were included consecutively from October 2011 through September 2012. We collected data on gender, age, main toxic agent, suicidal intention, homelessness, history of severe mental illness, and self-discharge. Information on deaths was retrieved from the National Cause of Death Register. We did a multiple logistic regression analysis to look for associations between self-discharge and repeated poisoning and a Cox regression analysis for associations between self-discharge and death.
   Results: During one year, 1731 patients were treated for 2343 episodes of acute poisoning by substances of abuse. Two-hundred-and-sixty-six (15%) patients self-discharged during at least one poisoning episode. Self-discharging patients were older, median age 39 years vs 32 years (p < 0.001), more frequently homeless, 20/266 (8%) vs 63/1465 (4%) (p = 0.035), and the main toxic agent more frequently was an opioid, 82/266 (31%) vs 282/1465 (19%) (p < 0.001). Self-discharge was an independent risk factor for repeated poisoning. The adjusted odds ratio for two or more poisoning episodes during one year among self-dischargers was 3.0 (95% CI 2.2-4.1). The association was even stronger for three or more poisoning episodes, adjusted odds ratio 5.0 (3.3-7.5). In total, there were 34 deaths, 9/266 (3.4%) among self-discharging patients and 25/1465 (1.7%) among patients not self-discharging (p = 0.12). The adjusted hazard ratio for death among self-discharging patients was 1.6 (0.75-3.6).
   Conclusions: Self-discharge was associated with frequent poisonings by substances of abuse. Short-term mortality was doubled among self-discharging patients, though this increase was not statistically significant. Still, the increased risk of repeated poisoning marks self-discharging patients as a vulnerable group who might benefit from targeted post-discharge follow-up measures.

AB AimsTo assess the causes of death and cause-specific standardized mortality ratios in two nationwide, population-based cohorts diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes during the periods 1973-1982 and 1989-2012, and to evaluate changes in causes of death during the follow-up period.
   MethodsPeople with Type 1 diabetes who were aged < 15 years at diagnosis were identified in the Norwegian Childhood Diabetes Registry and followed from diagnosis until death, emigration or September 2013 (n = 7871). We assessed causes of death by linking data to the nationwide Cause of Death Registry and through a review committee that evaluated medical records, autopsy reports and death certificates.
   ResultsDuring a mean (range) follow-up of 16.8 (0-40.7) years, 241 individuals (3.1%) died, representing 132 143 person-years. The leading cause of death before the age of 30 years was acute complications (41/119, 34.5%). After the age of 30 years cardiovascular disease was predominant (41/122, 33.6%), although death attributable to acute complications was still important in this age group (22/122, 18.0%). A total of 5% of deaths were caused by dead-in-bed' syndrome. The standardized mortality ratio was elevated for cardiovascular disease [11.9 (95% CI 8.6-16.4)] and violent death [1.7 (95% CI 1.3-2.1)] in both sexes combined, but was elevated for suicide only in women [2.5 (95% CI 1.2-5.3)]. The risk of death from acute complications was approximately half in women compared with men [hazard ratio 0.43 (95% CI 0.25-0.76)], and did not change with more recent year of diagnosis [hazard ratio 1.02 (0.98-1.05)].
   ConclusionsThere was no change in mortality attributable to acute complications during the study period. To reduce premature mortality in people with childhood-onset diabetes focus should be on prevention of acute complications. Male gender implied increased risk.
   What's new?
   This nationwide, population-based study is a long-term follow-up of two cohorts, diagnosed with childhood-onset Type 1 diabetes in 1973-1982 and 1989-2012 [mean (range) follow-up 16.8 (0-40.7) years]. The study addresses cause-specific mortality based on clinical information in addition to high-quality register data. The leading cause of death before the age of 30 years was acute complications; after the age of 30 years cardiovascular death was predominant. In spite of improved diabetes care during the study period we report no change in mortality attributable to acute complications. Our results indicate a need to improve diabetes management and psychosocial care to prevent premature mortality.

AB Background: The comorbidity of headache and psychiatric symptoms is a well-recognized clinical phenomenon, but there are only limited data regarding the temporal relationship between headache and symptoms of anxiety and depression as well as behavioral problems in adolescents. This study investigates the relationship of anxiety and depressive symptoms and behavioral problems at baseline with recurrent headache at follow-up four years later.
   Methods: Within the Nord-Trondelag Health Study (HUNT), including repeated population-based studies conducted in Norway, 2399 adolescents in junior high schools aged 12-16 years (77% of the invited) participated in Young-HUNT1 (1995-1997) and again at follow-up four years later, in Young-HUNT2 (2000-2001). The same comprehensive questionnaire that included assessment of symptoms of anxiety and depression and behavioral problems, i.e. conduct and attention difficulties was completed in both studies. In addition 1665 of the participants were interviewed about their headache complaints in Young-HUNT2.
   Results: In adjusted multivariate analyses we found that higher scores of anxiety and depressive symptoms at baseline were associated with recurrent headache at follow-up four years later (OR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.2-2.1, p = 0.001), evident for migraine (OR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2-2.7, p = 0.008) and non-classifiable headache (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0-2.8, p = 0.034), but not statistically significant for tension-type headache (OR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0-1.9, p = 0.053). Higher scores of anxiety and depressive symptoms at baseline were significantly associated with more frequent headache at follow-up (monthly vs. no recurrent headache OR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.3-2.5, p = 0.001, weekly or daily vs. no recurrent headache OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2-2.9, p = 0.005). Among adolescents without recurrent headache at baseline, higher scores for symptoms of anxiety and depression were associated with new onset migraine four years later (OR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.1-4.8, p = 0.036). Higher scores of attention problems at baseline were associated with non-classifiable headache at follow-up (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.3-3.4, p = 0.017).
   Conclusions: Results from the present study showed that symptoms of anxiety and depression in early adolescence were associated with recurrent headache four years later. Recognizing anxiety and depressive symptoms should be considered part of the clinical assessment in young headache patients, as early identification of these associated factors may lead to improved headache management.

TI Effect of the market withdrawal of dextropropoxyphene on use of other
   prescribed analgesics

   IMPACT
AB Background and aims: Dextropropoxyphene (DXP) is a synthetic opioid that was prescribed worldwide for mild to moderate pain. It was withdrawn from the European market in 2009. In this study we aim to investigate the effect of the market withdrawal of dextropropoxyphene in Norway on overall use of opioids and other analgesics at an individual level.
   Methods: Data were collected from the nationwide Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD). It covers all prescription of drugs from 01 January 2004 from Norwegian pharmacies dispensed to individuals outside institutions. The study period was divided in two 2-year periods from 01 September 2008 to 31 August 2010, and from the market withdrawal of DXP on 01 September 2010 to 31 August 2012. We included every individual that filled at least one prescription of dextropropoxyphene in the first 2-year period in our study population. In this study dextropropoxyphene, codeine and tramadol are defined as "weak opioids", and all other opioids are termed "strong opioids".
   Results: Nine thousand one hundred and seventy-one individuals were included in our study population. Four thousand two hundred and ninety filled a prescription of DXP only once and were classified as "single users", 2,990 were users with prescriptions of up to 200 defined daily doses (DDD) over the first 2-year period, or "sporadic users", and 1,886 were classified high users with over 200 DDDs over a 2-year period. After the market withdrawal 8,392 continued to be prescribed analgesics or benzodiazepines. In the single user group, the proportion of users of weak opioids decreased from 69.5% to 57.6%, whereas the proportion of users of strong opioids was unchanged. Among the sporadic user group, the proportion of users of weak opioids went from 69.7% to 71.0%, the proportion using tramadol from 39.1% to 43.9%, and the users of strong opioids from 25.8% to 31.3%. In the high user group, there was an increase in the number of users of strong opioids from 37.8% to 51.4%. The amount of strong opioids prescribed in the high user group increased from a mean of 262.5 DDD to a mean of 398.3 DDD in the following 2 years. The amount of tramadol increased in all groups and was 3 times as high in the high user group after market withdrawal of DXP.
   Conclusions: Our study showed that the withdrawal of DXP lead to an increase in prescription of other analgesics. The proportion of users increased in all three groups and so did the prescribed amount of other analgesics. Both the proportion of users of other opioids and the amount prescribed increased considerably. However, 1 in 10 earlier users of DXP stopped using prescribed analgesics altogether in the following 2 years. The increase in use among earlier high users of DXP was most striking.
