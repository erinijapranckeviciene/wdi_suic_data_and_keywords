AB Objectives. We examined how US cultural involvement related to suicide attempts among youths in the Dominican Republic.
   Methods. We analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of youths attending high school in the Dominican Republic (n=8446). The outcome of interest was a suicide attempt during the past year. The US cultural involvement indicators included time spent living in the United States, number of friends who had lived in the United States, English proficiency, and use of US electronic media and language.
   Results. Time lived in the United States, US electronic media and language, and number of friends who had lived in the United States had robust positive relationships with suicide attempts among youths residing in the Dominican Republic.
   Conclusions. Our results are consistent with previous research that found increased risk for suicide or suicide attempts among Latino youths with greater US cultural involvement. Our study adds to this research by finding similar results in a nonimmigrant Latin American sample. Our results also indicate that suicide attempts are a major public health problem among youths in the Dominican Republic. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102:664-671. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2011.300344)

TI A Cross-National Comparison of Suicide Attempts, Drug Use, and Depressed

AB We compared suicide attempts, depressed mood, and drug use of 1,710 Dominican public high school students in New York City (NYC) and 9,573 in the Dominican Republic (DR) in 2009. Compared to DR Dominicans, NYC Dominicans were more likely to have reported lifetime marijuana use (27.6% vs. 1.5%), lifetime inhalant use (11.0% vs. 7.6%), lifetime other drug use (9.9% vs. 3.0%), depressed mood (31.3% vs. 27.2%), and suicide attempt (13.8% vs. 8.8%). The results of this study supported the hypothesis that substantial increases in illicit drug use, especially cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, and methamphetamines, among NYC Dominican youth account for their increased risk for suicide attempts compared to their DR Dominican counterparts. It also identified suicide attempts as a public health problem among NYC Dominicans, the largest NYC Latino immigrant population.

TI Transgender Women's Experiences with Stigma, Trauma, and Attempted
   Suicide in the Dominican Republic
SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR

ID RISK-FACTORS; HEALTH; POPULATIONS; PEOPLE; NEEDS
AB Studies on attempted suicide in transgender populations, particularly those in resource-limited settings, are scarce. We examined the relationships between stigma, trauma, and suicide attempts in a national sample of transgender women from the Dominican Republic. Bivariate analysis examined differences between suicide attempters and nonattempters (n = 298). Multivariate analysis reported odds ratios with attempted suicide as the outcome (n = 260). About a quarter of respondents (23.9%) experienced sexual abuse, 12.3% were tortured, and 20.3% experienced a murder attempt. More than a quarter reported using illegal drugs. Independent sample t tests found significant differences between suicide attempters and nonattempters. Attempters were more likely to have experienced sexual abuse, psychological abuse, torture, and a murder attempt (p < .001 for all). Respondents who experienced psychological abuse had over three times higher odds of attempting suicide, compared to respondents who had not (OR = 3.203, p < .01). Experience with torture and attempted murder were associated with higher odds of attempting suicide (OR = 2.967, p OR = 2.894, p < .05, respectively). Although some nations have implemented antidiscrimination policies protecting transgender citizens, these policies are often not consistently enforced. Eliminating stigmatizing policies may reduce rates of negative health outcomes and subsequently improving population health.

AB With PLAGSALUD support, pesticide illness surveillance has extended to all seven Central American countries, producing 7,000 poisoning reports in 2000, but governments' use of the surveillance data has been limited by inadequacies of data management, interpretation, an reporting and an influential pesticide industry in weak economies. Overrepresented reports of suicides minimize occupational hazards. In six countries, 32,245 questionnaire responses indicated 98% underreporting of pesticide poisonings and a regional estimate of 400,000 poisonings per year (1.9% of the population), 76% work-related. A potentially far-reaching measure to come out of this surveillance is an agreement of the ministers of health of Central America and the Dominican Republic (RESSCAD 2000) for a harmonized list of banned and restricted pesticides, including the 12 most frequently reported. The RESSCAD agreement has met considerable resistance from industry. Its achievement versus failure will disclose the ability of Central American governments to prioritize protection of human health against commercial corporate interests. Surveillance data have potential for policy reform, but a more aggressive health sector is needed, linked with the environmental sector, grass-roots organizations, and universities.
