AB For the effects of social integration on suicides, there have been different and even contradictive conclusions. In this study, the selected economic and social risks of suicide for different age groups and genders in the United Kingdom were identified and the effects were estimated by the multilevel time series analyses. To our knowledge, there exist no previous studies that estimated a dynamic model of suicides on the time series data together with multilevel analysis and autoregressive distributed lags. The investigation indicated that unemployment rate, inflation rate, and divorce rate are all significantly and positively related to the national suicide rates in the United Kingdom from 1981 to 2011. Furthermore, the suicide rates of almost all groups above 40 years are significantly associated with the risk factors of unemployment and inflation rate, in comparison with the younger groups.

AB This paper reviews the sentences dictated between 1993 and 2002 by the Supreme Courts of Canada and the Unites States, the House of Lords and Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the European Human Rights Court, about the validity of the legal prohibition of assistance for suicide. These sentences constituted a judicial consensus about the right to die. This consensus recognized the legal right of patients to reject medical treatments but did not recognize the right to be assisted by a physician to commit suicide. This exclusion is changing in the recent case law of Canada and the United Kingdom, which accepts the fundamental right of terminal patients to medically assisted suicide.

AB The genetics of suicide is increasingly recognized and relevant for mental health literacy, but actual beliefs may lag behind current knowledge. We examined such beliefs in student samples (total N = 686) from Estonia, Malaysia, Romania, the United Kingdom, and the United States with die Beliefs in the Inheritance of Risk Factors for Suicide Scale. Cultural effects were small, those of key demographics nil. Several facets of construct validity were demonstrated. Marked differences in perceived plausibility of evidence about the genetics of suicide according to research design, observed in all samples, may be of general interest for investigating lily theories of abnormal behavior and communicating behavioral and psychiatric genetic research findings.

AB Objectives: First, to determine if a cyclical trend is observed for search activity of suicide and three common suicide risk factors in the United Kingdom: depression, unemployment, and marital strain. Second, to test the validity of suicide search data as a potential marker of suicide risk by evaluating whether web searches for suicide associate with suicide rates among those of different ages and genders in the United Kingdom.
   Study design: Cross-sectional.
   Methods: Search engine data was obtained from Google Trends, a publicly available repository of information of trends and patterns of user searches on Google. The following phrases were entered into Google Trends to analyse relative search volume for suicide, depression, job loss, and divorce, respectively: 'suicide '; 'depression + depressed + hopeless'; 'unemployed + lost job '; 'divorce'. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was employed to test bivariate associations between suicide search activity and official suicide rates from the Office of National Statistics (ONS).
   Results: Cyclical trends were observed in search activity for suicide and depression-related search activity, with peaks in autumn and winter months, and a trough in summer months. A positive, non-significant association was found between suicide-related search activity and suicide rates in the general working-age population (15-64 years) (r = 0.164; P = 0.652). This association is stronger in younger age groups, particularly for those 25-34 years of age (r = 0.848; P = 0.002).
   Conclusions: We give credence to a link between search activity for suicide and suicide rates in the United Kingdom from 2004 to 2013 for high risk sub-populations (i.e. male youth and young professionals). There remains a need for further research on how Google Trends can be used in other areas of disease surveillance and for work to provide greater geographical precision, as well as research on ways of mitigating the risk of internet use leading to suicide ideation in youth.

DT Article
ID MEDICAL DECISIONS; END; REQUESTS; LIFE
AB A comparison of the views of geriatric medicine physicians and intensive care physicians in the United Kingdom on the topics of active voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide revealed rather different attitudes. Eighty percent of geriatricians, but only 52% of intensive care physicians, considered active voluntary euthanasia as never justified ethically. Gender and age did not play a major part in attitudinal differences of the respondents. If the variability of attitudes of these two medical specialties are anywhere near illustrative of other physicians in the United Kingdom, it would be difficult to formulate and implement laws and policies concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide. In addition, ample safeguards would be required to receive support from physicians regarding legalization.

AB Aircraft assisted suicides were studied in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Finland during 1956-2012 by means of literature search and accident case analysis. According to our study the frequency varied slightly between the studies. Overall, the new estimate of aircraft assisted suicides in the United States in a 20-yr period (1993-2012) is 0.33% (95% Cl 0.21-0.49) (24/7244). In the detailed accident case analysis, it was found that in five out of the eight cases from the United States, someone knew of prior suicidal ideation before the aircraft assisted fatality. The caveats of standard medico-legal autopsy and accident investigation methods in investigation of suspected aircraft assisted suicides are discussed. It is suggested that a psychological autopsy should be performed in all such cases. Also the social context and possibilities of the prevention of aviation-related suicides were analyzed. In addition, some recent aircraft assisted suicides carried out using commercial aircraft during scheduled services and causing many casualties are discussed.

ID CELEBRITY SUICIDE; MEDIA
AB Background: Media reporting of suicide has been associated with imitative acts. Internationally, this has led to the development of guidelines to promote responsible reporting of suicide. Aims: To examine the nature and quality of news coverage of suicidal behavior in the United Kingdom (UK) and Republic of Ireland (ROI). Method: UK and ROI press clippings relating to suicide over 12 months (N = 8,101) were coded for content and assessed for quality against existing guidelines. We examined variability in relation to key characteristics (e.g., type of publication) and compared newspaper portrayal of suicide against official statistics. Results: Reports were biased toward young, female, and relatively unusual suicides (including those involving a celebrity, more than one individual, and violent methods). Almost a third of reports had inappropriate headlines, but only a minority were of poor overall quality, and editors appear to be responsive to feed back.There was considerable variability in the quality of reports for different suicide methods. Limitations: This work cannot account for the impact of reporting on suicidal behavior. The speed of change in media trends also limits its conclusions. Conclusion: Our findings underscore the need for sustained efforts to promote responsible reporting of suicide.

AB Annual suicide figures are critical in identifying trends and guiding research, yet challenges arising from significant lags in reporting can delay and complicate real-time interventions. In this paper, we utilized Google Trends search volumes for behavioral forecasting of national suicide rates in Ireland between 2004 and 2015. Official suicide rates are recorded by the Central Statistics Office in Ireland. While similar investigations using Google trends data have been carried out in other jurisdictions (e.g., United Kingdom, United Stated of America), such research had not yet been completed in Ireland. We compiled a collection of suicide- and depression-related search terms suggested by Google Trends and manually sourced from the literature. Monthly search rate terms at different lags were compared with suicide occurrences to determine the degree of correlation. Following two approaches based on vector autoregression and neural network autoregression, we achieved mean absolute error values between 4.14 and 9.61 when incorporating search query data, with the highest performance for the neural network approach. The application of this process to United Kingdom suicide and search query data showed similar results, supporting the benefit of Google Trends, neural network approach, and the applied search terms to forecast suicide risk increase. Overall, the combination of societal data and online behavior provide a good indication of societal risks; building on past research, our improvements led to robust models integrating search query and unemployment data for suicide risk forecasting in Ireland.

AB There is evidence for widespread disbelief in the genetics of suicide, despite recent research progress in this area and convergent evidence supporting a role for genetic factors. This study analyzed the beliefs held in 8 samples (total N=1224) of various types (psychology, medical, and various undergraduates, psychology graduates, and the general population) from 6 countries located on 3 continents (Austria, Canada, Malaysia, Romania, United Kingdom, and the USA). Endorsement rates for the existence of genetic risk factors for suicide ranged from 26% and 30% (Austrian psychology undergraduates and general population) to around 50% (psychology undergraduates in the USA and United Kingdom). In the 8 samples, respondents' sex, age, religiosity, political orientation, and other demographic variables were, for the most part, unrelated, but overall knowledge about suicide throughout was related positively to endorsement rates. Consistent with previous research, across a considerable variety of sample types and cultural settings there was no evidence for a clear majority believing in genetic bases for suicide.

AB Self-poisoning by ingestion or inhalation is common, and it is important to study its various epidemiological manifestations with clear definitions. Data on fatal self-poisonings are recorded nationally within the UK and are codified according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) revision relevant at the time. Most fatal self-poisonings are codified as suicides, accidental deaths or undetermined deaths ('open verdicts'). Non-fatal self-poisoning data, whether accidental or as a manifestation of deliberate self-harm, are recorded through hospital discharge information nationally but are not routinely published in the same way as mortality data. The bulk of the UK's published epidemiological information on nonfatal self-poisoning episodes is largely based on individual hospitals' admission or discharge records ('special studies'). After establishing definitions for different self-poisoning categories we discuss the published data on self-poisoning as they relate to suicide, accidental self-poisoning and deliberate self-harm in the UK.

AB This paper reviews the research literature on gunshot suicide in the United Kingdom and the international literature with reference to strategies aimed at preventing gunshot suicides. Trends in gun ownership and changes in firearm legislation in the UK over the past 20 years are described.
   Most UK gunshot suicides are male, middle-aged and living with a partner and involve, the use of shotguns. They are less likely to have current or past mental health problems, or a previous act of self-harm, than people who commit suicide by other methods, and their suicide is more likely to have been precipitated by a relationship dispute. Where alcohol is consumed the amount tends to be large.
   The international literature provides evidence of a strong association between rates of gun ownership and gunshot suicide, and some evidence of a reduction in firearm suicide rates following the introduction of restrictive firearm legislation. Over the past 20 years the number of gunshot suicides in the UK has declined by over 50% to a little over a hundred deaths per annum. At the same time, firearm legislation has become progressively more restrictive and rates of gun ownership have declined. Measures, which might further reduce the prevalence of gunshot suicides in the UK, are discussed.

AB Background: Suicide prevention literature currently suffers from inconsistent measurement and incomplete theoretical development. Aims: Using a recommended suicide measurement approach for epidemiological studies (i.e. the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R)), the present investigation assessed United Kingdom young adult suicide prevalence rates. This study also investigated the utility of a Preferences in Information Processing (PIP) model of suicide in identifying those at increased odds for elevated suicide risk, as well as lifetime ideation and attempt. Method: A cross-sectional mental health and well-being survey study (n = 414) was conducted. Results: The prevalence rates of elevated risk (49.8%), lifetime ideation only (55.3%) and lifetime attempt (13.5%) were high. Bivariate associations demonstrated that elevated depression, anxiety and Need for Affect (NFA) Avoidance were associated with worsened suicide outcomes, whereas elevated Need for Cognition (NFC) was associated with decreased suicide risk. Logistic regression results identified depression and NFA Avoidance as the strongest predictors of elevated suicide risk. Multinomial logistic regression results established several PIP-based moderation effects for depression and anxiety in which NFA Approach and NFC differentially influenced odds of suicide attempt group membership. Conclusion: The SBQ-R is an appropriate tool for UK young adult suicide research. NFA and NFC demonstrated potential for inclusion in young adult suicide prevention programming. Further research is needed to fully evaluate the PIP model of suicide and effectiveness of proposed theory-based approaches to suicide prevention.

AB Restriction of means for suicide is an important part of suicide preventive strategies in different countries. All suicides in Denmark between 1970 and 2000 were examined with regard to method used for suicide. Overall suicide mortality and method-specific suicide mortality was compared with official information about availability of medical compounds (barbiturates, benzodiaze-pines, analgesics, antidepressants) and carbon monoxide in vehicle exhaust and household gas. Restrictions on the availability of carbon monoxide, barbiturates and dextropropoxyphen was associated with a decline in the number of suicides by self-poisoning with these compounds. Restricted access occurred concomittantly with a 55% decrease in suicide rate.

AB We investigated changes in the proportion of firearm suicides in Western countries since the 1980s and the relation of these changes to the change in the proportion of: households owning firearms. Several countries had an obvious decline in firearm suicides: Norway, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia; and New Zealand. Multilevel modeling of longitudinal data confirmed the effect of the proportion of households owning firearms. Legislation and regulatory measures reducing the availability of firearms in private households can distinctly strengthen the prevention of firearm suicides.

TI Maternal deaths from suicide in Singapore
SO SINGAPORE MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE female suicide; maternal deaths; maternal mortality; severe maternal
   mental illness; suicide
ID DEPRESSION; REGISTER
AB Introduction: Maternal mortality in Singapore, as in other developed countries, has remained low in the past decade. In the United Kingdom and Australia, maternal deaths from suicide and psychiatric causes have been the leading cause of maternal mortality, and there have therefore been comprehensive healthcare programmes to address the mental health needs of mothers.
   Methods: In this study, we looked at maternal deaths from 2000 to 2004, by linking coronial cases of female suicide in the reproductive age group 15-45 years, with the birth registration database, to identify both early and late maternal deaths.
   Results: There was only one identified maternal death among 589 female suicides aged 15-45 years, occurring in a teenager within the first month postpartum. There was likely also another case that was unconfirmed and unreported.
   Conclusion: From this preliminary study, suicide and psychiatric causes are not significant causes of maternal mortality in Singapore. However, given that the epidemiology of postnatal depression statistics mirror that of the other countries, it is possible that maternal suicides have been under-reported, and the load may well be higher. There is a need for a similar confidential enquiry into maternal deaths to be set up here, as is already in place in various countries, notably the United Kingdom and Australia, for the past decade.

AB Research from the United Kingdom has suggested differential risk factors for suicide among South Asians when compared with the general population. Studies in the United Kingdom have found higher risk related to gender, marital status, and religion. It has been unknown how such demographic variables, acculturative stress, and lower rates of help-seeking influence rates of suicide among South Asians in the United States. In this study, a community sample of South Asians in the United States (n = 524) were asked to complete a demographic questionnaire and validated measures for levels of acculturation, help-seeking, and beliefs about reasons for living via web-based survey. South Asians' scores on the Reasons for Living Inventory (RFL) were significantly higher than the normative population across all subscales except the Survival and Coping Beliefs subscales. Demographic variables significantly related to RFL scores included gender (men with higher RFL scores), age (younger individuals with lower RFL scores), country of origin (those from India with lower RFL scores), education level (lower RFL scores in those with higher education levels), and income (those with lower incomes having lower RFL scores). Help-seeking attitudes were also significantly related to RFL scores. As a whole, the findings are consistent with U.K.-based studies and provide valuable comparative data on a U.S.-based sample.

SO ALTERNATIVE LAW JOURNAL

DT Article
DE Criminal law; manslaughter; suicide; criminal liability; causation; free
   will
AB For more than half a century, Australian states and territories have criminalised the distinct offence of inciting another person to commit suicide. The maximum penalties for these offences vary and require the accused to have intended that the victim would commit suicide. In contrast, the offence of involuntary manslaughter does not require such an intention. Instead, a charge of manslaughter requires that the accused acted in a conscious and voluntary way that caused the victim's death, and that their conduct was either criminally negligent or unlawful and dangerous. Drawing on cases from the United States and United Kingdom, this article suggests that in appropriate circumstances in Australia, especially in the context of family violence, offenders should be held criminally liable for manslaughter if they cause another person to commit suicide.

AB Suicide is a major public health issue in Canada. The quality of health care services, in addition to other individual and population factors, has been shown to affect suicide rates. In publicly managed care systems, such as systems in Canada and the United Kingdom, the quality of health care is manifested at the individual, program and system levels. Suicide audits are used to assess health care services in relation to the deaths by suicide at individual level and when aggregated at the program and system levels.
   Large health administrative databases comprise another data source used to inform population-based decisions at the system, program and individual levels regarding mental health services that may affect the risk of suicide. This status report paper describes a project we are conducting at the Institut national de sante publique du Quebec (INSPQ) with the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System (QICDSS) in collaboration with colleagues from Wales (United Kingdom) and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.
   This study describes the development of quality of care indicators at three levels and the corresponding statistical analysis strategies designed. We propose 13 quality of care indicators, including system-level and several population-level determinants, primary care treatment, specialist care, the balance between care sectors, emergency room utilization, and mental health and addiction budgets, that may be drawn from a chronic disease surveillance system.

The effect on method-specific suicide rate and overall suicide rate of restrictions on availability of carbon monoxide, barbiturates, and dextropropoxyphene was examined. From 1970 to 2000, overall suicide mortality and method-specific suicide mortality in Denmark were compared with official information about availability of barbiturates and analgesics and carbon monoxide in vehicle exhaust and household gas. Restrictions on availability of household gas with carbon monoxide content and barbiturates was associated with a decline in the number of suicides and suicides by self-poisoning with these compounds after controlling for the effect of calender year. Restricted access occurred concomittantly with a 55 percent decrease in suicide rate.

AB Birth cohort effects in suicide rates are well established, but to date there is no methodological approach or framework to test the temporal stability of these effects. We use the APC-Detrended (APCD) model to robustly estimate intensity of cohort effects identifying non-linear trends (or 'detrended' fluctuations) in suicide rates. The new APC-Hysteresis (APCH) model tests temporal stability of cohort effects. Analysing suicide rates in 25 WHO countries (periods 1970-74 to 2005-09; ages 20-24 to 70-79) with the APCD method, we find that country-specific birth cohort membership plays an important role in suicide rates. Among 25 countries, we detect 12 nations that show deep contrasts among cohort-specific suicide rates including Italy, Australia and the United States. The APCH method shows that cohort fluctuations are not stable across the life course but decline in Spain, France and Australia, whereas they remain stable in Italy, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. We discuss the Spanish case with elevated suicide mortality of cohorts born 1965-1975 which declines with age, and the opposite case of the United States, where the identified cohort effects of those born around 1960 increase smoothly, but statistically significant across the life course.

AB Background: It has been suggested that there is a causal association between isotretinoin therapy and the risk of depression, psychotic symptoms, suicide, and attempted suicide.
   Objective: To further investigate the proposed association between isotretinoin therapy and the risk of depression, psychotic symptoms, suicide, and attempted suicide using a formal study design.
   Design: Large population-based cohort studies.
   Setting: The Canadian Saskatchewan Health Database and the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database.
   Patients: Data were analyzed for 7195 isotretinoin users and 13 700 oral antibiotic users with acne from the Canadian Saskatchewan Health Database and for 340 isotretinoin users and 676 oral antibiotic users with acne from the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database. All subjects had computer-recorded histories of between 6 months and 5 years before, and at least 12 months after, their first isotretinoin or antibiotic prescription.
   Outcome Measure: Prevalence rates of neurotic and psychotic disorders, suicide, and attempted suicide were compared between isotretinoin and antibiotic users and within isotretinoin users as their own comparison (pretreatment vs posttreatment). The results were expressed as relative risks, calculated using multiple logistic regression analyses.
   Results: Relative risk estimates, comparing isotretinoin use and oral antibiotic use with nonexposure to either drug for newly diagnosed depression or psychosis, were approximately 1.0 regardless of the data source. Similarly, relative risk estimates were all around 1.0 when comparing before with after isotretinoin use. The relative risk estimate for suicide and attempted suicide was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.3-2.4) when comparing current isotretinoin exposure with nonexposure.
   Conclusion: This study provides no evidence that use of isotretinoin is associated with an increased risk for depression, suicide, or other psychiatric disorders.

AB Introduction. Paracetamol poisoning is a major health problem worldwide. Limitation of pack size is an approach increasingly advocated to reduce rates of suicide and serious self-harm from this agent. The United Kingdom adopted such a policy in 1998, restricting non-pharmacy sales to 8 g and pharmacy to pack sizes of 16 g. Methods. A literature review was conducted and commentary written on the impact of the change in the United Kingdom on a variety of indices of paracetamol overdose. Results. Potential markers of effect identified included paracetamol sales, poisons information data, laboratory results, liver unit referrals, and hospital activity and mortality data. Initial reports suggested effects associated with the legislation, but longer term suicide trend analysis has not confirmed these early findings, which were confounded by population trends in self-harm. Conclusion. Paracetamol pack size limitation as applied in the United Kingdom has not reduced paracetamol-related death. Reasons postulated for this failure include patient avoidance of the legislation's intentions, patient confusion, and ineffectiveness of the regulations as conceived and implemented.

AB Availability of drugs with high lethality has been hypothesized to increase the risk of self-poisoning suicides. A literature search concerning deliberate self-poisoning and the effect of restricting access to drugs was conducted, and the effect of restrictions in availability of barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants, dextropropoxyphene, and weak analgesics was reviewed. The correlations between method-specific and overall suicide rates and sales figures for barbiturates, dextropropoxyphene, weak analgesics, and tricyclic antidepressants were reviewed. It is concluded that restriction in availability of drugs with high case fatality should be a part of suicide prevention strategies.

AB The objective of this study was to estimate the potential of method restriction as a public health strategy in suicide prevention. Data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office and the Swiss Institutes of Forensic Medicine from 2004 were gathered and categorized into suicide submethods according to accessibility to restriction of means. Of suicides in Switzerland, 39.2% are accessible to method restriction. The highest proportions were found in private weapons (13.2%), army weapons (10.4%), and jumps from hot-spots (4.6%). The presented method permits the estimation of the suicide prevention potential of a country by method restriction and the comparison of restriction potentials between suicide methods. In Switzerland, reduction of firearm suicides has the highest potential to reduce the total number of suicides.

AB Study Objective. To estimate the rate of suicide in patients taking montelukast.
   Design. Population-based cohort study
   Data Source. United Kingdom General Practice Research Database.
   Patients. A total of 23,500 patients who had received at least one prescription for montelukast in the cumulative data from February 1998-March 2007.
   Measurements and Main Results. Rate of suicide was to be calculated as number of suicides divided by person-time at risk. Person-time of montelukast exposure was accrued for each patient as a cumulative duration of all prescriptions. The 23,500 patients had received 252,593 prescriptions for montelukast, representing 21,050 person-years at risk for suicide. We then sought to identify all cases that had a computer-recorded diagnosis of suicide; however, no cases of suicide were found in patients exposed to montelukast during our time frame.
   Conclusion. The risk of suicide attributable to montelukast, if present at all, is extremely low in users.

AB Sexual orientation minority (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, and other; LGBQ+) persons represent a vulnerable population with respect to suicide-related behavior. An emerging theory of suicide, the Integrated Motivational-Volitional Model of Suicide (IMV), is utilized in the present study to examine sexual orientation, as well as a number of other IMV-defined pre-motivational factors (i.e., demographics, psychological distress and personality), as they impact the IMV motivational factors of defeat, entrapment, and suicidal ideation/intent. The present investigation featured a cross-sectional online survey of young adults (ages 18-34 years; n = 418; 27% identified as LGBTQ+) across the United Kingdom. The key findings included: (1) high rates of 12-month suicidal ideation prevalence (54.5%) and willingness to enact a future suicide attempt (60.8%); (2) bisexual and other (e.g., pansexual)-identifying sexual minority persons reported higher levels of IMV-related outcomes (e.g., internal entrapment, defeat); (3) sexual orientation accounted for significant variance in predicting motivational constructs controlling for a number of other pre-motivational factors; (4) other sexual minority status, compared to heterosexual identity, predic all motivational outcomes, and; (5) extraversion, agreeableness, and emotional stability emerged as pre-motivational protective factors for varying motivational outcomes. Findings are discussed with respect to the suicide and sexual minority theories, as well as tailored suicide prevention efforts and future research.

AB This article presents findings and recommendations for journalists and educators based on a study of more than 20 years' reporting of infanticide, filicide and family murder-suicide in the United Kingdom's national and regional press. On average, 50 children die each year at the hands of parents in the United Kingdom, and the deaths receive significant media attention. This study finds journalists exhibit a gender-biased trend in their writing depending on the sex of the perpetrator. Furthermore, most media coverage fails to acknowledge that killings by men are often the culmination of long-term domestic violence. Findings suggest news values and sourcing strategies are distorting the true picture and foregrounding tragedy narratives for the predominantly male perpetrators, often blaming women for leading a loving father to "snap". In sharp contrast, mothers who kill are more negatively portrayed. The research finds that crime reporters need training in domestic violence to look beyond simplistic stereotypes.

AB The proportion of elderly in the population is increasing due to a falling birth rate and increased life expectancy, and suicide rates increase with age. Trends in elderly suicide rates over a 24-year period, 1979 to 2002, were examined. Differences in suicide rates between elderly men and women and between the age-bands 65 to 74 years and 75+ years were examined. Data was ascertained from the WHO website. Suicide rates for men and women for the age-bands 65 to 74 years and 75+ years declined over the 24-year study period.
   Suicide rates were higher in men than women for both the age bands. In men, suicide rates were higher in the 75+ age-band than in the 65 to 74 years age-band. Various national initiatives may have contributed to the decline in suicide rates. The challenge will be to sustain the decline, given that the population is ageing and suicide rates generally increase with age.

AB Objective The goal was to analyze the association of religiosity with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in a UK nationally representative sample. Methods This study used cross-sectional data from 7403 people who participated in the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS). Religion was assessed with the question 'Do you have a specific religion?' with 'yes' and 'no' answer options. Lifetime and past 12-month suicidal ideation and suicide attempts were assessed. The association between religiosity and suicidality was studied in multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic, behavioural, and psychopathological factors. Results Compared to those without a religion, the prevalence of past 12-month suicidal ideation (3.2% vs. 5.4%), past 12-month suicide attempts (0.4% vs. 0.9%), lifetime suicidal ideation (11.2% vs. 16.4%), and lifetime suicide attempts (3.6% vs. 6.0%) was lower among those with a religion. In the fully adjusted model, having a religion was significantly associated with lower odds for all types of suicidality except past 12-month suicide attempts: suicidal ideation (past 12-month: OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.51-0.99; lifetime: OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.69-0.99) and suicide attempts (past 12-month: OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.35-1.45; lifetime: OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.53-0.90). Conclusion There is a negative association between religiosity and suicidality in the UK. Future studies should focus on the underlying mechanisms.

TI Paroxetine, other antidepressants, and youth suicide in New York City:

SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID FLUOXETINE TREATMENT; MAJOR DEPRESSION; BEHAVIOR; TRENDS; RISK
AB Background: Regulatory agencies in the United Kingdom and the United States have recently issued warnings about a possible link between suicidal ideation and attempts and the use of paroxetine in a pediatric patient population. The objective of this study was to determine the proportion of youth suicides that tested positive for paroxetine or other antidepressants in medical examiner toxicologic testing in New York City from 1993 through 1998, the first 6 years that paroxetine was available in the United States.
   Method. Subjects in this medical examiner surveillance study were suicides less than 18 years of age. Serum toxicology was examined for paroxetine and other antidepressants.
   Results: There were 66 suicides among persons under 18 years of age in the years 1993 through 1998. Toxicology was tested in 58 (87.9%) of the 66 suicides, and 54 (81.8%) had injury-death intervals of 3 days or less. None of the victims had paroxetine detected in their blood obtained at the time of autopsy. Imipramine was detected in 2 victims and fluoxetine in another 2.
   Conclusion: Despite regulatory concerns, none of the autopsies of youth suicides in New York City detected paroxetine in the victims, although other antidepressants were detected in 4 victims. However, in the vast majority of the youth suicides, there was no evidence of antidepressant use immediately prior to death.

AB Mass murders in Dunblane, United Kingdom, and Port Arthur, Australia, provoked rapid responses from the governments of both countries. Major changes to Australian laws resulted in a controversial buy-back of longarms and tighter legislation. The Australian situation enables evaluation of the effect of a national buy-back, accompanied by tightened legislation in a country with relatively secure borders. AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) was used to predict future values of the time series for homicide, suicide and accidental death before and after the 1996 National Firearms Agreement (ATA). Men compared with observed values, firearm suicide was the only parameter the ATA may have influenced, although societal factors could also have influenced observed changes. The findings have profound implications for future firearm legislation policy direction.

AB Purpose
   This study examined trends in the suicide rates of persons with foreign background in Japan.
   Methods
   Using the nationwide death records in the Vital Statistics of Japan, we first reported the age-adjusted suicide rates of 8 foreign nationals (Brazil, China, Korea, Peru, the Philippines, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States) in Japan by sex from 1980 to the mid-2010s. We also computed rate ratios to compare the suicide rate of each group with those of the Japanese population. Second, we focused on Koreans, who had the highest suicide rate in Japan. We compared the suicide rates of Koreans in Japan with Koreans in South Korea to examine whether their suicide rates were more closely related to those of their country of origin or those of their host country.
   Results
   We found that the suicide rates of Koreans and Chinese in Japan were similar to or higher than those of Japanese, while other groups tended to show lower suicide rates. Most notably, Koreans displayed consistently high suicide rates from 1980 to the mid-2010s, which were nearly twice as high as those of the Japanese population. Korean males and females in Japan had higher suicide rates than those in South Korea.
   Conclusions
   Immigrants in Japan were not necessarily influenced by the suicide rates of the host country. The high suicide rates among Korean residents in Japan might be explained by various disadvantages and adversities that they face in Japan.

AB Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death among youths. Comparatively few studies have studied recent trends over time, or examined rates and characteristics of service contact in well-defined national samples. Methods: Data on general population suicides and mid-year population estimates were used to calculate suicide rates (per 100,000/year) among youths aged 10-19 years in the United Kingdom. We then determined the proportion of youths who had been in mental health service contact in the year prior to death. Social and clinical data were collected via questionnaires sent to clinicians who had provided care. Results: The general population rate of suicide was higher in males than females, and was higher in 15-19-year-olds compared to 10-14-year-olds. Suicide rates for 10-19-year-olds declined by 28% between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2003 (compared with an 8% reduction in those aged > 19 years); the fall was particularly marked for males. Mental health service contact was low at 14% (compared with 26% for adults), especially for males (12%). Youths in mental health contact were characterised by: diagnosis of affective disorder, mental illness history, residential instability, self-harm, and substance misuse. Over half of youths were living with parents and one-fifth were in full-time education. Conclusions: The suicide rate for 10-19-year-olds in the UK appeared to fall between 1997 and 2003. Further monitoring of suicide rates is needed to determine whether this trend has continued for the most recent years (e. g., 2004-7). The fall in rates may have been related to socio-economic or clinical factors. The rate of contact with services was low compared to adults, particularly in males. This is concerning because young males have the highest suicide rate in the UK. Suicide prevention in young people is likely to require a multi-agency approach.

AB The highly charged debate about the moral status of assisted suicide features regularly in the news media in medically advanced countries. In the United Kingdom, the debate has been dominated in recent years by a new mode of death: assisted suicide in Switzerland, so-called suicide tourism. Drawing on in-depth interviews with people who were actively planning on going to Switzerland,' alongside participant-observation at a do-it-yourself self-deliverance workshop, I discuss how participants arrived at their decision to seek professionalized assistance. In doing so, I explore the constituent elements of people's suffering, examining how participants justified, rationalized, or sought authentication from a doctor for their decision to die in light of their own belief systems and aesthetic preferences for a good death.

AB Objective Accurate information about preferred suicide methods is important for devising strategies and programmes for suicide prevention. Our knowledge of the methods used and their variation across countries and world regions is still limited. The aim of this study was to provide the first comprehensive overview of international patterns of suicide methods.
   Methods Data encoded according to the International Classification of Diseases (10th revision) were derived from the WHO mortality database. The classification was used to differentiate suicide methods. Correspondence analysis was used to identify typical patterns of suicide methods in different countries by providing a summary of cross-tabulated data.
   Findings Poisoning by pesticide was common in many Asian countries and in Latin America; poisoning by drugs was common in both Nordic countries and the United Kingdom. Hanging was the preferred method of suicide in eastern Europe, as was firearm suicide in the United States and jumping from a high place in cities and urban societies such as Hong Kong Special, Administrative Region, China. Correspondence analysis demonstrated a polarization between pesticide suicide and firearm suicide at the expense of traditional methods, such as hanging and jumping from a high place, which lay in between.
   Conclusion This analysis showed that pesticide suicide and firearm suicide replaced traditional methods in many countries. The observed suicide pattern depended upon the availability of the methods used, in particular the availability of technical means. The present evidence indicates that restricting access to the means of suicide is more urgent and more technically feasible than ever.

DE search engines; suicide
ID GOOGLE SEARCH; INFORMATION; INTERNET; STRATEGIES; CHINESE; PEOPLE
AB Background: Search engines display helpline notices when people query for suicide-related information.
   Objective: In this study, we aimed to examine if these notices and other information displayed in response to suicide-related queries are correlated with subsequent searches for suicide prevention rather than harmful information.
   Methods: Anonymous suicide-related searches made on Bing and Google in the United States, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and Taiwan in a span of 10 months were extracted. Descriptive analyses and regression models were fit to the data to assess the correlation with observed behaviors.
   Results: Display of helpline notices was not associated with an observed change in the likelihood of or future suicide searches (P=.42). No statistically significant differences were observed in the likelihood of people making future suicide queries (both generally and specific types of suicide queries) when comparing search engines in locations that display helpline notices versus ones that do not. Pages with higher rank, being neutral to suicide, and those shown among more antisuicide pages were more likely to be clicked on. Having more antisuicide Web pages displayed was the only factor associated with further searches for suicide prevention information (hazard=1.18, P=.002).
   Conclusions: Helpline notices are not associated with harm. If they cause positive change in search behavior, it is small. This is possibly because of the variability in intent of users seeking suicide-related information. Nonetheless, helpline notice should be displayed, but more efforts should be made to improve the visibility and ranking of suicide prevention Web pages.

AB The British novelist Nicky Singer talks about becoming a writer, the role of editors and about who decides what can-and what can't-be published either side of the Atlantic. Her three novels explore territory which can make publishers nervous: Feather Boy (initiation rites and domestic violence), Doll (self-harm) and The Innocent's Story (terrorist suicide bombing). The sharply contrasting responses from publishers in the United Kingdom and the United States are described. Through Nicky Singer's sometimes extraordinary experiences with publishers runs the implicit question, perhaps as important now as it has ever been: What constraints should there be on what is explored in books for young readers?

AB Restricting access to suicide means and locations is a component in prevention strategies of almost all prevention centres worldwide. In this review, we describe the rationale underpinning such approaches in general, as well as for specific methods of suicide. We review the age, sex, and country distribution of several common methods of suicide, including medication overdose, pesticide poisoning, gas poisoning, jumping, firearms, and hanging. Current evidence supporting policies to restrict access to suicide means and hotspots is summarized. In the case of suicides involving self-poisoning and firearms, direct restrictions on selling/purchasing of these lethal or highly toxic means (e.g. guns, pesticides, pills) through regulatory controls is generally effective in reducing suicide. For suicide by self-poisoning, prevention approaches can also involve reducing the toxicity of substances used. Current evidence indicates the effectiveness of erecting barriers at jumping hotspots in reducing suicidal leaps. As ligature points and ligatures are universally available, restricting access to these suicide means is not a reasonable prevention strategy except in certain controlled environments such as psychiatric hospitals and prisons. Despite the limited opportunities in relation to hanging, restricting access to suicide means and hotspots are effective and feasible strategies in preventing suicide.

AB The suicide of doctors under regulatory investigation in the United Kingdom has recently been under scrutiny. Despite a commissioned report into the issues surrounding these deaths, we discuss a variety of procedural and legal lacunae not yet openly considered for reform. We identified that the UK coronial system has in place several legal instruments requiring coroners to report the physician suicides as preventable to the regulatory body, the General Medical Council ( GMC). We were unable to identify that these suicides were reported in line with established legislation. We also explored the relationship between the GMC and its registered doctors, concluding that the GMC does indeed have a duty of care towards its members on this important matter and that there should be procedural reform to tackle the inherent risk of suicide whilst under investigation.

ID GENDER; AGE; ILLNESS; OLD
AB Objective: Asian culture venerates elderly people. It was hypothesized that elderly suicides would be proportionately lower in Asian societies than in English-speaking countries (ESC).
   Method: Elderly (i.e. aged 75 years or more) to general population suicide ratios were compared for six Asian societies and six ESC. based upon the latest 5-year suicide rates.
   Results: Males: The general population suicide rate was highest in rural China (227 per million) and third highest in Japan (217 per million), but other countries with high rates were all ESC (ranging from 224 to 198 per million). Asian countries had the six highest elderly suicide rates, 1327-1373 per million, whilst the highest ESC elderly rate was in the United States (507 per million). Asian societies had the widest range of elderly/general ratios, ranging from 6.62 to 2.6. Females: The overall suicide rates were higher in Asian countries (5795 per million) than in ESC (40-56 per million). Asian elderly suicide rates differed (932 per million in rural China to 154 per million in Korea) but the highest ESC rate was in Australia (76 per million). The Asian countries elderly/general ratios ranged from 5.82 : 1 to 2.70 : 1, but the widest ESC ratio was 1.71 : 1, in the United Kingdom.
   Conclusion: There is a need for country-specific prevention measures in elderly people, and particularly for older women in Asian countries.

AB Background
   Suicide rates in Scotland have increased markedly relative to those in England in recent decades.
   Aims
   To compare changing patterns of suicide risk in Scotland with those in England & Wales, 1960-2008.
   Method
   For Scotland and for England & Wales separately, we obtained national data on suicide counts and population estimates. Gender-specific, directly age-standardised rates were calculated.
   Results
   We identified three distinct temporal phases: 1960-1967, when suicide rates in England & Wales were initially higher than in Scotland, but then converged; 1968-1991, when male suicide rates in Scotland rose slightly faster than in England & Wales; and 1992-2008, when there was a marked divergence in national trends. Much of the recent divergence in rates is attributable to the rise in suicide among young men and deaths by hanging in Scotland. Introduction of the 'undetermined intent' category in 1968 had a significant impact on suicide statistics across Great Britain, but especially so in Scotland.
   Conclusions
   Differences in temporal patterns in suicide risk between the countries are complex. Reversal of the divergent trends may require a change in the perception of hanging as a 'painless' method of suicide.

AB Suicidal thoughts and behaviors are highly prevalent in prisoners. Nevertheless, there have been scant attempts to understand suicidality in prisoners from a psychological perspective. The goals of this study were to characterize a prison sample at high risk of suicide in terms of hopelessness, defeat, and entrapment, and to determine which of these variables predicted suicidality. A cross-sectional questionnaire design was used. Measures of hopelessness, defeat, entrapment, and suicide probability were administered to male prison inmates in the United Kingdom. Defeat and hopelessness, especially the affective component of hopelessness, predicted the probability of suicide in this sample, but entrapment was not a significant predictor. Suicide risk assessment procedures in prisons tend to be sparse. Such procedures would benefit from using measures of hopelessness and defeat. Future work should aim to understand how the impact of these psychological constructs on suicidality in prisoners can be attenuated.

AB Trends in adolescent suicide rates (15-19 years) from 1979 to 1996 were compared with suicide trends in individuals of 20 years and over in 30 countries and with trends in rates of deaths due to undetermined causes in adolescents in 17 countries of the WHO European Region. In 21 of the 30 studied countries, male adolescent suicide rates increased during the study period (highest increases in Belarus, Kazakstan and Ireland) accompanied by far less increases or decreases in suicide rates of males of 20 years and over. Part of the observed increases in Sweden, Ireland and Greece can be attributed to improved suicide statistics, while increases in Finland, Belgium, Bulgaria and the United Kingdom can be even higher due to the rising classification of deaths as "undetermined". In Portugal, decreasing suicide trends seem to be misinterpreted by ignoring the vast increases in rates of undetermined deaths. Female adolescent suicide rates rose less markedly than in males in 18 countries, with the exception of strong increases in Norway, Ireland. Increases in female adolescent suicide rates were marginally affected by changes in classification practices and were accompanied primarily by declining suicide rates in females of 20 years and over.

AB Restriction of access to means for suicidal behavior, especially dangerous methods, is a key element in most national suicide prevention strategies. In this paper the rationale for this is discussed, including the fact that suicidal impulses are often brief, that availability of a method may influence both the occurrence and outcome of a suicidal act, and that if a favored means becomes less available it does not always result in substitution by another method. Examples of evidence for the effectiveness of restricting availability of suicidal methods on subsequent suicidal behavior are presented, plus the supporting findings from studies of long-term survivors of serious suicide attempts in which only a minority have gone on to die in subsequent suicide attempts. Finally, factors likely to determine the effectiveness of modifying access to means for suicide are considered, together with the main elements that need to be addressed in evaluation.

AB Background In order to achieve the national target of 20% reduction in suicide in the UK, many primary care trusts have developed local suicide prevention action plans. However, there is concern about a lack of a whole-system approach in some localities. Suicide surveys are a necessary component of any suicide reduction strategy.
   Methods All deaths by suicides and open verdicts of a multi-ethnic, socio-economically diverse London Borough's residents between February 2005 and February 2008 were identified (n = 54). Health records of the identified subjects were analysed by two researchers.
   Results The annual rate of suicide in the study period was 6.8 per 100 000 inhabitants. Of the 54 cases of suicide in the study period, 45% had a psychiatric diagnosis and 18% were in current contact with mental health services. Hanging was the most frequent mode of suicide. Twenty-four per cent were not registered with a GP, most of whom were immigrants. Twenty-five per cent had seen their GP within a month of suicide. The rate of suicide in those born in Ireland was 17.7 per 100 000.
   Conclusions Suicide survey is a feasible method of monitoring suicide, sharing data between key stakeholders and learning from the trends uncovered.

TI In Support of a Decisional Paradigm for Assisted Dying
SO CRIMINAL LAW JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID SUICIDE
AB In May 2018, a centenarian travelled from Australia to Switzerland to end his life. He was not suffering from a terminal or incurable illness. The deceased travelled to Switzerland because that country permits self-determination of death, unconditional on it being consequential to palliative treatment for a terminal illness. Australia, like the United Kingdom and most developed nations, does not permit euthanasia and assisted suicide is criminal. This article examines the discretionary issues around criminal culpability for the journey of the deceased from Australia to Switzerland for the known purpose of suicide. We argue the allocation of prosecutorial discretion in cases of assisted suicide is contrary to public interest. We consider the decisional framework that informed the centenarian's decision. We explain why a decisional paradigm, rather than medical, moral or other structures, should inform law and policy regarding assisted dying and give developed nations, such as Australia, cause for reform.

AB Recent debates have re-emerged in the field of terrorism studies concerning the role of group-based behaviors in the causation of violence and whether suicide bombers display distinct personality traits. This article contributes to both debates through a review of pertinent social psychology supplemented by illustrative examples of successful, failed, and foiled suicide bombing plots that emerged within the United Kingdom over the past decade. The findings suggest that the contextual, facilitative and causal dynamics of group-based behaviors differ dependent upon how the 'group' is defined. The narrower the definition, the more causality we can interpret in group-based behaviors. The more broadly defined, the more contextual and facilitative, group-based behaviors appear to be in relation to suicide terrorism. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent years have seen increasing awareness of the wide range of mental health problems faced by students. Gatekeeper training has been shown to have a positive impact on knowledge and attitudes about suicide prevention, although the evidence for skills acquisition is limited. We utilised the STORM (R) training package in an exploratory study to determine explore whether skills training could be successfully implemented in an educational establishment in the United Kingdom. In a pilot study assessing competence before and after the intervention there was evidence of acquisition of skills, improved attitudes and increased confidence. Further research should include a randomised controlled trial of such training.

AB The objective of this study was to identify the impact of a patient's suicide on psychiatrists in Thailand. A confidential coded postal questionnaire survey was sent to 320 eligible psychiatrists; with a response rate of 52.18%). The results showed that 94 (56.28%) of responding psychiatrists had a patient die by suicide, consistent with high rates found in similar large-scale studies in the United States and United Kingdom. Less than half (41.5%) of patients had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, 33% had a depressive disorder, and the others had a wide array of diagnoses. More than 50% of psychiatrists reported personally experiencing sadness, depression, hopelessness, and guilt; 74.5% reported professional reactions, most frequently a review of their practice (93.4% reported being more aggressive in assessment of suicidality). Respondents were diverse in their postvention; 90% of Thai psychiatrists reported that working through with colleagues was most helpful. Family and friends helped. A majority (72.4%) of psychiatrists prayed or did "merit" for the dead patient; 86.8% found it helpful. This finding suggests that cultural sensitivity may be needed to understand the impact of suicide on psychiatrists but also to its response.

TI The Effect of Catalytic Converter Legislation on Suicide Rates in
   Grampian and Scotland 1980-2003
SO SCOTTISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-KINGDOM; ENGLAND; WALES; GAS
AB Objective
   To examine the effect of catalytic converter legislation on suicide rates in Grampian and Scotland since its implementation in 1993.
   Methods
   1. Population study in Grampian and Scotland using national population and mortality statistics for 1980 to 2003.
   2. Retrospective, controlled cohort Study of individuals who had unsuccessfully attempted suicide by motor vehicle exhaust gassing to examine the theory of method substitution.
   Results
   There was a significant fall in suicides by motor vehicle exhaust gas inhalation in Scotland and Grampian following the introduction of compulsory catalytic converter legislation. However, in the same time period, there was a significant increase in numbers of suicides by hanging and total suicide rates in Scotland. There was a non-significant trend in a small sample of patients from a local hyperbaric unit for an increased rate of subsequent completed suicide between those who had previously attempted suicide by motor vehicle exhaust gas inhalation and controls.
   Conclusions
   Catalytic converter legislation has resulted in a decrease in the number of suicides by motor vehicle exhaust gas inhalation. Overall suicide rates have not decreased. There is evidence to suggest that those who would have previously committed suicide by motor vehicle exhaust gas inhalation find alternative methods of suicide, so called method substitution'. Initiatives to reduce suicide rates should be directed at those means that are used by impulsive suicide attempters, as other, determined individuals, will commit suicide by another method.

AB Background. Information on suicide by psychiatric patients from ethnic minority groups is scarce.
   Aims. To establish the number of patients from ethnic minorities who kill-themselves; to describe their suicide methods and, their social and clinical characteristics..
   Method. A national clinical survey was based on a 4-year sample of suicides in England and Wales. Detailed data were collected on those who had been in contact with mental health services-in the year before death.
   Results. In total 282 patients from ethnic minorities died by suicide - 6% of all patient suicides. The most common method of suicide was hanging; violent methods were more common than in White patient suicides. Schizophrenia was the most common diagnosis. Ethnic minority patients were more likely to have been unemployed than White patients and to have had a history of violence and recent non-compliance. In around half, this was the first episode of self-harm. Black Caribbean patients had the highest rates of schizophrenia (74%), unemployment, living alone, previous violence and drug misuse.
   Conclusions. In order to reduce the number of suicides by ethnic minority patients, services should address the complex health and social needs of people with severe mental illness.

DE Natural rate of suicides; Cointegration; Time series; OECD
ID COINTEGRATION; UNEMPLOYMENT
AB This paper provides further evidence on the hypothesis of the natural rate of suicide using the time series data for 15 OECD countries over the period 1970-2004. This hypothesis suggests that the suicide rate of a society could never be zero even if both the economic and the social conditions were made ideal from the point of view of suicide (Yang and Lester, 1991). This research relates the suicide rates to harmonized unemployment and divorce rates to test the natural hypothesis statistically. We also address methodological flaws by earlier suicide studies by employing autoregressive-distributed lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration advocated by Pesaran et al. (2001). In majority of regression equations, the constant term was positive and statistically significant, indicating a non-zero natural suicide rate. In particular, we find evidence that at aggregate level. Turkey has the lowest (3.64) and Japan has the highest (13.98) natural rate of suicides. In terms of the male natural suicide rates, the United Kingdom ranks the lowest (4.73) and Belgium ranks the top (15.44). As for the female natural suicide rates, japan takes the lead (16.76) and Italy has the lowest (5.60). The results are also compared and contrasted to each other with a view to drawing plausible policy conclusions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Informed by the theories of social construction of reality and social movement, this study examined how medical journals, the publications of social movement organizations, and newspapers portrayed Jack Kevorkian in the physician-assisted suicide (PAS) and euthanasia debate. The views of core general medical journals from the United Kingdom and the United States, newsletters of pro- and anti-PAS/euthanasia groups, and local and national American newspaper coverage of Kevorkian were explored. Overall, the findings show that the voices of these different communities converged in some areas of their coverage of Kevorkian. The British medical journals (the British Medical Journal and The Lancet) and a pro-PAS/euthanasia group (the Hemlock Society) shared themes mainly with the New York Times, whereas the American journals (the Journal of the American Medical Association and New England Journal of Medicine) and an anti-PAS/euthanasia group (the International Anti-Euthanasia Task Force) shared themes mainly with the Detroit News.

DT Article
AB Despite the recognition of the need for secure adolescent mental health provision, the extent and precise nature of the services required in the United Kingdom remains unquantified. The present study describes some of the key characteristics of 80 young people referred from around the United Kingdom for medium secure health care. The pattern of referrals indicates a substantial need for secure health care in the 14- to 18-year-old age range. Young people requiring such care present most commonly with psychotic, personality or post traumatic stress disorder. Nearly half of the young people (45%) were requiring constant observation. Over 90% of those assessed presented a risk of aggression and over 60% presented a suicide risk. Over half (53%) had been charged with one or more offence and 29% had at least one conviction. The need for the further development of an adolescent forensic specialism is supported by these data. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Introduction: Suicide is a major public health issue internationally, and the impact of positive or negative attitudes amongst the mental health professional workforce warrants scrutiny. The study aimed to examine English and Turkish nursing students' attitudes towards people with suicidal behaviour.
   Method: This cross-cultural study reports on attitudes of 240 nursing students towards suicide in Turkey and 82 nursing students in the UK. A reliable and valid 24 item "Attitudes towards Suicide Scale" and "Social Reactions to Suicidal Persons Scale" were used to measure attitudes.
   Results: The UK nursing students were found to display more accepting attitudes to suicide, and scored higher on acceptability of suicide, seeing suicide as a solution and open reporting and discussion of suicide subscales than their Turkish counterparts. Turkish nursing students scored higher on punishment after death and hiding suicidal behaviour subscales than the UK students. Turkish nursing students scored significantly higher on deterring subscale of reactions to a suicidal peer scale than the UK nursing students.
   Implications for practice: It is vital for nurse students to develop positive acceptance of suicide through education, reflection and clinical supervision to be more therapeutic towards suicidal patients.

TI Charcoal burning suicides in Hong Kong and urban Taiwan: an illustration

AB Objectives: Following the first case in Hong Kong in 1998, the method of committing suicide by charcoal burning has spread to other communities. This aim of this study was to examine the impact of charcoal burning suicides on both overall suicide rates and older-method suicide rates in Hong Kong and urban Taiwan.
   Design: Trend analysis of the overall and method-specific suicide rates between 1997 and 2002. Comparison of age and gender profiles of those who committed suicide by charcoal burning and other methods of suicide.
   Setting: Hong Kong and Urban Taiwan.
   Main results: Suicides by charcoal burning increased rapidly within five years in both Hong Kong and urban Taiwan. This increase was not paralleled by decreases in suicides by older methods and led to an increase of more than 20% in the overall suicide rates. Those in the 24 - 39 age range were more likely to choose charcoal burning than other methods.
   Conclusions: The lack of parallel decreases in the suicides rates of older methods with the rise of charcoal burning suicides suggests limited substitution between the methods. The preponderance of the rise in suicide deaths associated with charcoal burning suggests that its invention, followed by wide media dissemination, may have specifically contributed to the increase in suicides in both regions. As a similar increase was found in urban Taiwan as in Hong Kong, charcoal burning suicide should not be viewed as merely a local health problem and has the potential to become a major public health threat in other countries.

AB This review discusses the limitation of access to suicide methods as a way to prevent suicide, an approach which forms a major component of many national suicide prevention strategies. An important distinction is made between efforts that attempt to limit physical access to suicide methods and those that attempt to reduce the cognitive availability of suicide. Physical imitations will be reviewed with reference to restricting access to domestic gas, catalytic converters, firearms, pesticides, jumping, paracetamol and methods used in prisons. Impacts of cognitive availability will be discussed mainly with regard to the media in terms of providing access to technical information and sensational or inaccurate portrayals of suicide. Drawing on psychological models of suicidal ideation and behaviour, this review explores how processes leading to suicidal behaviour and issues around method choice may relate to the effectiveness of limiting access to methods. Potential problems surrounding method limitations are explored, in particular the factors contributing to substitution, the risk that alternative methods of suicide may be used if one is restricted. It is concluded that in appropriate contexts, where substitution is less likely to occur, and in conjunction with psychosocial prevention efforts, limitation of both physical and cognitive access to suicide can be an effective suicide prevention strategy.

AB The nature of rurality varies considerably across the world, and there is no single pattern of suicide in rural areas. However, some common themes are evident from countries as diverse as India, the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and China. Suicide rates tend to be higher in rural populations compared with urban, with relatively higher female rates in some areas. North American and Australian data suggest that indigenous people may be at particularly high risk. Specific rural occupations, such as farming, often seem to be associated with higher risk. Although mental illness plays an important role in suicide in rural areas, as it does elsewhere, it is unclear whether higher rural suicide rates are linked to a correspondingly higher prevalence of mental illness in such populations. Instead, other factors may be important including: adverse socio-economic conditions; higher rates of alcohol or substance misuse; greater access to potentially lethal methods, such as pesticides or firearms; cultural attitudes which promote independence and discourage help-seeking behaviour; poor access to services providing help at times of psychological crisis; and cultural discontinuity in traditional societies. Not all factors apply in all areas, hence, the literature on rural suicide prevention initiatives varies considerably. Strategies have involved: the restriction of access to lethal methods; improving attitudes to, and knowledge of, mental illness in high-risk populations; improving the accessibility of conventional mental health services; making the use of such supports more culturally acceptable; and the development of context-specific supports, such as programmes addressing specific cultural issues.

AB Objective To investigate the population impact on the incidence of suicide and non-fatal self harm of regulatory action in 2003 to restrict the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in under 18s.
   Design Ecological time series study.
   Setting United Kingdom.
   Populations Young people in the UK aged 12-19 years (prescribing trends), in England and Wales aged 12-17 years (mortality), and in England aged 12-17 years (hospital admissions).
   Main outcome measures Deaths from suicide and hospital admissions for self harm.
   Results Antidepressant prescribing doubled between 1999 and 2003 but fell to the 1999 level between 2004 and 2005. These large changes in prescribing did not seem to be associated with temporal trends in suicide or self harm. In the years 1993 to 2005 the annual percentage reduction for suicide among 1 2-17 year olds was -3.9% (95% confidence interval -6.2% to -1.5%) in mates and -3.0% (-6.6% to 0.6%) in females, with no indication of a substantial change in this rate of decrease during that period. Similarly, hospital admission rates for self harm in the years 1999 to 2005 indicated an annual percentage increase for mates of 1.1% (-0.5% to 2.7%) and for females of 5.7% (3.6% to 7.8%), again with no statistical evidence of a change in rate after the regulatory action.
   Conclusions The noticeable reduction in prescribing of antidepressants since regulatory action in 2003 to restrict the use of SSRIs in under 18s does not seem to have been associated with changes in suicidal behaviour in young people. Specifically, these data for England do not indicate that reductions in antidepressant use have led to an increase in suicidal behaviour.

AB This paper is concerned to map the phenomenon of filicide-suicide as it has been reported in academic research and the newspapers. It is focused on the findings of an exploratory investigation of newspaper reporting on these events in Britain and Eire between 1991 and 2011 and is concerned to address the potential relationship between this reporting behaviour and wider public understanding of these events. In so doing the paper falls into three parts. The first part presents an analysis of what is known about filicide-suicide: the academic narrative. The second part presents the findings of the empirical investigation referred to above: the media narrative. The third part explores the possible interconnection between these two narratives and the policy and professional context of responding to child abuse in the United Kingdom: the policy narrative. In the light of this analysis the paper considers what can be done about such family tragedies and the way in which we witness and make sense of them.

AB Background: Substance-related deaths account for a great number of suicides.
   Aim: To investigate levels and characteristics of suicide verdicts, as opposed to accidental deaths, in substance misusers.
   Methods: Psychological autopsy study of cases from the UK National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths (np-SAD) during the period 2001-2007.
   Results: Between January 2001 and December 2007, 2108 suicides were reported to the np-SAD. Typical suicide victims were White and older than 50 (respectively 95% and 41% of cases). Medications, especially antidepressants (44%), were prescribed to 87% of victims. Significantly fewer suicide victims than controls presented positive blood toxicological results for illicit drugs (namely: cocaine, heroin, amphetamines, ecstasy-type drugs, cannabis, and GHB/GBL) and alcohol.
   Conclusions: Suicide prevention programmes should devote specific attention to deaths among substance misusers who are at high risk of fatal intentional self-harm. Specific characteristics distinguish those at risk; caregivers should be better educated as to what these factors are. Limitations of the current study included lack of provision of comprehensive information relating to the victims' psychosocial variables. Furthermore, no differentiation between different classes of antidepressants in terms of involvement in suicide was here provided. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Ways of conceptualizing suicide prevention are reviewed briefly, and the preventive model: Universal, Selected, and Indicated prevention (USI) is chosen as the structure for the literature review, and the discussion. Universal preventive interventions are directed toward entire population; selective interventions are directed toward individuals who are at greater risk for suicidal behaviour; and indicated preventions are targeted at individuals who have already begun self-destructive behaviour.
   On the universal prevention level, an overview of the literature is presented with focus on restrictions in firearms and carbon monoxide gas. At the selective prevention level, a review of risk of suicide in homelessness and schizophrenia and risk factors for suicide in schizophrenia is conducted and possible interventions are mentioned together with the evidence for their effect. Suicide rate and preventive measures in affective disorder are also touched upon. At the indicated prevention level, studies of fatal and non-fatal suicide acts after suicide attempt are mentioned. The evidence of preventive measures to reduce repetition rates is presented.
   Finally, the state of the art is discussed with regard to prevention at the universal, the selected and the indicated level and clinical and research implications are outlined. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB People bereaved by suicide are at increased risk of suicide, but evidence is lacking that available interventions reduce suicide risk. Few large-scale studies have described the views of suicide-bereaved people regarding their needs for support. Our objective was to explore the nature of young adults' experiences of support after bereavement by suicide and their views on valued and unhelpful aspects. We conducted a cross-sectional study of staff and students aged 18-40 at 37 United Kingdom (UK) higher educational institutions in 2010, eliciting qualitative responses to two questions probing experiences of support and unmet needs after the suicide of a close contact. We conducted thematic analysis of responses from 420 adults bereaved by suicide, of whom 75% had received support after the loss. We identified three broad descriptive areas corresponding to important aspects of support: value and experiences of the support received; views on specific support needs; and reasons for not seeking support. We found that needs for emotional support exist throughout the social networks of people who die by suicide but are often hidden. Our findings suggest a need for proactive offers of support from family, friends, and professionals after suicide, repeated regularly in case a bereaved person does not feel ready for support early on.

TI Attitudes to suicide following the suicide of a friend or relative: a
   qualitative study of the views of 429 young bereaved adults in the UK
SO BMC PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article

AB Background: People bereaved by suicide are at increased risk of suicide attempt and suicide, but explanations for these associations remain theoretical. It is possible that the experience of suicide bereavement modifies personal attitudes towards suicide, but the nature of these changes remains unexplored. There is a need to understand personal attitudes to suicide following suicide bereavement, as this may inform the development of suicide prevention interventions. Our aim was to explore the attitudes of young adults bereaved by suicide towards their own likelihood of dying by suicide.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of staff and students aged 18-40 at 37 United Kingdom (UK) higher educational institutions in 2010. Ethical approval was granted by the UCL Research Ethics Committee. Qualitative responses to a question probing attitudes to own suicide were provided by 429 respondents who had experienced bereavement by the suicide of a close contact. We identified key themes in this dataset using thematic analysis.
   Results: Analysis identified four main themes: suicide as a more tangible option (whether feared or not); identification with the deceased and awareness of shared vulnerabilities to suicide; personal determination to avoid suicide; and beliefs regarding safeguards against suicide. These themes reflected a broad split in participants' views regarding own likelihood of dying by suicide, influenced by the degree to which own suicide was feared and the extent to which they felt in control of determining a suicide death. Whilst the majority described an aversion to the idea of attempting suicide themselves, largely through an awareness of the impact on others, a minority described their experiences as having normalised suicide as a personal option.
   Conclusions: The views of a sample of UK-based adults bereaved by suicide suggest that exposure to the suicide of a close friend or relative can influence attitudes to suicide in ways that could influence own risk of suicide attempt. The normalising attitudes to suicide observed in a minority of respondents could contribute to the observed association between suicide bereavement and suicide attempt.

   TRENDS
AB Although suicide accounts for a small percentage of deaths in Scotland (1.4% in 1999), it has been steadily increasing over the last two decades. In the US, Australia, England and Wales the greatest rises in suicide for this time period, occurred in rural areas. This study describes the pattern and magnitude of urban/rural variation in suicide in Scotland, examines methods of suicide within differing geographies and looks at trends in suicides over time.
   Scotland is split into four rurality types. Suicide data for all areas of Scotland (apart from Grampian which underwent changes in postcode sector boundaries in 1996) are investigated using Standardised Mortality Ratios (SMRs) and multilevel Poisson modelling, adjusting for age, sex and deprivation. SMRs for 1981-85, 1989-93 and 1995-99 are created across the four geographies, using the populations of Scotland in 1983, 1991 and 1997 as the standard populations (SMR = 100). The highest rates in 1995-99 are seen in "remote rural" areas, SMR = 125 (95% confidence interval 107-146). Models adjusted for age and deprivation show significantly greater risk of male suicide in remote rural areas relative to urban areas and significantly lower risk of female suicide in accessible rural areas. The method of suicide varies across ruralities for both males and females. The study considers how the relationship between suicides and rurality varies over time and how methods of suicide vary across different ruralities. The steepest rises in suicide amongst men, adjusting for age and deprivation, were seen to occur in accessible rural areas, however highest rates remain in remote rural areas. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

DT Article
ID HEALTH; UNEMPLOYMENT; RATES; CRISIS; IMPACT
AB Objective To determine whether English regions worst affected by the economic recession in the United Kingdom in 2008-10 have had the greatest increases in suicides.
   Design Time trend analysis comparing the actual number of suicides with those that would be expected if pre-recession trends had continued. Multivariate regression models quantified the association between changes in unemployment (based on claimant data) and suicides (based on data from the National Clinical Health Outcomes Database).
   Setting 93 English regions, based on the Nomenclature of Territorial Units Statistics level 3 groupings of local authorities at county level and groups of unitary local authorities.
   Participants Men and women with a record of death from suicide or injury of undetermined cause in 2000-10.
   Main outcome measure Number of excess suicides during the economic recession (2008-10).
   Results Between 2008 and 2010, we found 846 (95% confidence interval 818 to 877) more suicides among men than would have been expected based on historical trends, and 155 (121 to 189) more suicides among women. Historically, short term yearly fluctuations in unemployment have been associated with annual changes in suicides among men but not among women. We estimated that each 10% increase in the number of unemployed men was significantly associated with a 1.4% (0.5% to 2.3%) increase in male suicides. These findings suggest that about two fifths of the recent increase in suicides among men (increase of 329 suicides, 126 to 532) during the 2008-10 recession can be attributed to rising unemployment.
   Conclusion The study provides evidence linking the recent increase in suicides in England with the financial crisis that began in 2008. English regions with the largest rises in unemployment have had the largest increases in suicides, particularly among men.

SO JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS

DT Article
DE Suicide; Poisons; Hanging; Drowning; England and Wales
ID TIME-TRENDS; UNITED-KINGDOM; CHOICE; MORTALITY; RATES
AB Objective: To investigate changes in the range of suicide methods used in two time periods a century apart (1901-1907 and 2001-2007) in England and Wales.
   Method: Suicide mortality and population data were obtained for England and Wales from the ONS and used to calculate gender and method-specific mortality rates.
   Results: There have been striking changes in the methods of suicide used since the 1900s. Hanging was the most commonly used method during both time periods. However suicides involving drowning (22.5% of suicides in 1901-1907) and weapons (e.g. firearms and razors, 24.2% of suicides in 1901-1907) were rarely used in 2001-2007 (2.6% and 5.8% respectively). Although the use of poisons was popular in both time periods, the types of poisons used differed substantially over time. Household cleaning products and disinfectants accounted for almost half of poisoning suicides in the early 1900s whereas self-poisoning with medicines accounted for most poisoning suicides in 2001-2007.
   Limitations: There were changes in the coding of suicides over time. Additionally, deaths by drowning and poisoning are more difficult to confirm as suicides than those that occur due to hanging or the use of weapons.
   Conclusions: The changes in popularity of some suicide methods can be mainly attributed to changes in the physical availability (access) of these methods over time. Other methods which remain readily available have fallen out of fashion in recent times, suggesting a contributory role of other factors such as cognitive availability and personal preference/acceptability in influencing the choice of suicide method.

TI Antidepressants and Suicide: Clinical Considerations
SO BIOLOGY OF DEPRESSION: FROM NOVEL INSIGHTS TO THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES
LA English

ID PRIMARY-CARE; MENTAL-DISORDERS; ECONOMIC BURDEN; DEPRESSION;
   COMORBIDITY; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS; MORBIDITY
AB An association between antidepressant use and suicidality is currently the topic of considerable study, debate, and controversy. This has generated enormous public interest. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency have placed warnings on the use of antidepressants. In both countries only fluoxetine has been approved for use in children, while other drugs are not shown to be effective and can increase the risk of suicide in that age group. For adults use, the FDA has asked manufacturers to change the labels of 10 drugs to include stronger cautions and warnings about the need to monitor patients for the worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidal ideation, regardless of the cause of such worsening. These drugs are bupropion, citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, mirtazapine, nefazodone, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram and venlafaxine. Moreover, on October 15, 2004, the FDA directed the manufacturers of all antidepressants to add a "black box" warning that describes the increased risk of suicidality in children and adolescents given antidepressant medications and notes what uses the drugs have been approved or not been approved for in these patients. Antidepressants should no longer be associated with the terms "cosmetic psychopharmacology" and "lifestyle drugs". This is a medically necessary treatment that requires expertise and close monitoring. It should be kept in mind however that the greatest cause of suicide is not antidepressant use, but untreated depression. Over 50% of all suicides, including over 70% of suicides in children are caused by depression. At autopsy, less than 20% of suicide cases have measurable antidepressant in postmortem toxicology testing. Because most suicide victims suffer from major depression and commit suicide as a result of untreated or inadequately treated depression, suicide prevention in depression should therefore be addressed with expert treatment.

TI Is Hinduism ambivalent about suicide?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Hinduism; suicide; religion; India
AB Background: Hinduism is one of the oldest religions in the world and has over 1.1billion adherents comprising about 16% of the global population living mainly in India and Nepal. The stand of Hinduism on suicide has been ambiguous through the ages, on one hand, condemning general suicides, while condoning religious suicides on the other. This ambiguity is reflected in contemporary India and among the Indian diaspora.
   Aims: To examine the stand of Hinduism as a religion in the context of suicide.
   Method: A selected review of literature covering the major Hindu religious texts, cultural practices and suicide.
   Results: People who follow Hinduism have a suicide rate of about 21 per 100,000 population compared to the global average of 11.4. Hindu countries have higher rates of suicide compared to Islamic and Christian countries, but these rates are lower when compared to Atheist and Buddhist countries. This is reflected in the Indian diaspora as well with reports from Fiji, the Caribbean, Malaysia and the United Kingdom, indicating that suicide was disproportionately high among those of Indian origin. However, a strong faith in Hinduism acts as protective factor. The Hindu belief in karma fosters a sense of acceptance of the vicissitudes of life with equanimity, and the belief in the cycle of births and deaths renders suicide meaningless, as one's soul continues after death. Their religious beliefs makes the Hindus tolerate and accept hardships and calamities stoically.
   Conclusion: In certain situations, the Hindu religion acts as a protective factor, whereas at other times, it may increase the risk of suicide. It is important to understand these different nuances in the Hindu religion in formulating a culturally appropriate suicide prevention strategy.

AB Introduction: There has been a concern about indiscriminate use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in Asian countries. This study examined the rates of ECT use and the characteristics and outcomes of patients treated with ECT in Hong Kong. Method: A central database of ECT treatments was used to calculate annual rates of ECT use from 1997 to 2002. We surveyed prospectively patients received ECT over 12 months by a standardized questionnaire. Results: The ECT utilization rates varied from 0.27 to 0.34 patients treated per 10,000 population and 1.34 to 1.88 patients treated per 100 inpatients discharged. There were differences in the pattern of ECT use among Hong Kong, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Only 15% of ECT recipients were 65 years old or older and 23% had schizophrenia as primary diagnosis for ECT. Ninety-five percent of patients who received ECT improved with the treatment as assessed by clinicians. No severe complications and deaths occurred, and 6% stopped ECT due to undesirable results. Conclusion: The rate of ECT use in Hong Kong continues to be below that in the United States and the United Kingdom. Access to ECT is most limited to the elderly and private patients.

AB Entrapment is an emerging theoretical and empirical factor associated with suicide. The current study expanded our understanding of entrapment by examining the Entrapment Scale factor structure, demographic correlates, and association with suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). Data from an online cross-national study of suicide were analyzed from two samples of young adults aged 18-34 (United Kingdom [U.K.] sample N = 418; United States [U.S.] N = 414). Primary findings included: (1) factor-analytic support for a two factor (i.e., internal and external) Entrapment Scale structure; (2) variation in external entrapment subscale factor loadings by sample; (3) significant demographic correlates of elevated entrapment of younger age, female gender, and U.S. sample; (4) significant convergent positive associations for both entrapment types with cognitive (e.g., perceived burdensomeness), mental health (e.g., anxiety), and STB correlates; and (5) significant, robust associations of internal entrapment and perceived burdensomeness with STBs in the U.K. sample. Implications are reviewed for suicide prevention theory, research and practice.

ID ANTIDEPRESSANTS; DEPRESSION; RISK; ADOLESCENTS; TRIALS
AB After regulatory agencies in the United Kingdom and United States recommended severe restrictions on antidepressant use in children, many lessons were learned, although one was not that these drugs cause suicide. We learned that pharmaceutical companies selectively released data that reflected positively on their products and that combining suppressed and published data suggested that most of these medications had questionable efficacy. We also learned that the studies lacked uniformity both in which age groups constituted children and which behavior was considered suicidal. Several recent, large nonindustry studies indicated that rates of suicide and suicidal behavior were actually reduced in children who used antidepressants, despite piteous anecdotal tales in the popular press purporting that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) caused children to kill themselves. Patients in pharmaceutical trials probably do not represent typical patients in routine clinical practice. Emerging implications are that suicidal behavior-if it does occur-is most likely soon after starting antidepressant use and that prescribers must be both vigilant in educating patients and families about warning signs and available to manage worrisome behavior.

AB Regulatory agencies in the United Kingdom and United States have been critically examining the possible link between suicidality and antidepressant use in children and adults, which has resulted in an FDA directive to the manufacturers of all antidepressant medications to add a 'black box' warning that describes the increased risk of suicidal behaviour in children and adolescents who take antidepressants. A crucial issue in this debate, as we discuss here, is the assessment of the capacity of antidepressants to increase suicidality over and above what is caused by the underlying disorder, major depression, which is itself the principal cause of suicide.

ID RISK-MANAGEMENT; MENTAL-HEALTH; PREVENTION
AB Little is known about general practitioners' (GPs') perspectives, management of and interactions with suicidal patients prior to the patient's suicide. The aims of the study were to explore GPs' interpretations of patient communication and treatment in primary care leading up to suicide and to investigate the relationship between GPs and mental health services prior to a patient's suicide. Thirty-nine semi-structured interviews with GPs of people who had died by suicide were conducted as part of a retrospective study. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using a thematic approach. The following themes emerged from GP interviews: (i) GP interpretations of suicide attempts or self-harm; (ii) professional isolation; and (iii) GP responsibilities versus patient autonomy. GPs recruited for the study may have different views from GPs who have never experienced a patient suicide or who have experienced the death of a patient by suicide who was not under the care of specialist services. Our findings may not be representative of the rest of the United Kingdom, although many of the issues identified are likely to apply across services. This study highlighted the following recommendations for future suicide prevention in general practice: increasing GP awareness of suicide-related issues and improving training and risk assessment skills; removing barriers to accessing therapies and treatments needed in primary care; improving liaison and collaboration between services to provide better patient outcomes; and increasing awareness in primary care about why patients may not want treatments offered by focusing on each individual's situational context.

AB Cyberbullying: a worldwide trend of misusing technology to harass others.
   Technology has led to a new form of bullying in the 21(st) century called cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is using the Internet or a cell phone to harass a victim with pictures and text. There have been reports in the media of youth being harassed by e-mail, postings on websites, instant messages, and mobile text messages worldwide.
   This paper summarizes findings about the prevalence and effects of cyberbullying from studies conducted in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Results of the studies were compared to media reports of cyberbullying and traditional bullying research. Strategies to stop and prevent cyberbullying were discussed.
   The percentage of respondents experiencing incidents of cyberbullying in the studies ranged from 10% to 42%. The mobile phone was the predominant method of cyberbullying in Australia and the United Kingdom, whereas the Internet was the favoured method in the United States and Canada.
   Some victims of cyberbullying have been driven to suicide while others remain unaffected by it. The most common feelings of victims were anger, sadness, frustration, and fear. Independent studies in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada documented that parents and children do not discuss cyberbullying.
   It is recommended that schools establish and post acceptable use policies for the Internet. Parents need to be educated about cyberbullying so that they can impose consequences if their child is harassing another child. Real time computerized reporting systems such Text Someone can be used to augment reporting of incidents. Showing students how mobile phone calls and e-mail messages can be traced may deter cyberbullying.

   MEDICATIONS; SUICIDE; RISK; TRIALS; RATES
AB Objectives. We studied whether 5 regulatory agency advisories concerning the possible increased risk of suicidal behavior during antidepressant therapy had an effect on antidepressant prescription trends in Ontario.
   Methods. We conducted a population-based, time-series analysis of new monthly antidepressant prescriptions dispensed by the Ontario Drug Benefits program in 3 age groups (younger than 20 years, 20-65 years old, and older than 65 years) over a 7-year period (April 1998 to March 2005). The impact of five advisories about the possible risk of suicide during antidepressant therapy was also analyzed.
   Results. The number of new prescriptions for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as a group did not change after any antidepressant warning in any age group. However, the rate of new paroxetine prescriptions in patients younger than 20 years declined by 54% immediately after the first warning for paroxetine was issued in the United Kingdom in June 2003. That same warning had no effect on new paroxetine prescriptions in the other age categories.
   Conclusion. The warning about paroxetine use in depressed patients younger than 18 years that was issued in the United Kingdom led to a significant decrease in new paroxetine prescriptions for young patients in this country. By contrast, warnings in North America did not influence new antidepressant prescription rates in any patient group.

AB There has been a reported increase in the incidence of self-harm within the United Kingdom. This is of great concern, as a number of studies have shown self-harm to be a major risk factor to completed suicide. However, the identification of self-harm provides an opportunity for support and treatment. Mental health is an area that often receives little attention in the undergraduate dental curriculum. Yet dental practitioners, as healthcare professionals, need to be vigilant for any risk factors or signs of mental illness among their patients and make appropriate onward referrals. The purpose of this article is to examine the current evidence and aspects of self-harm, particularly in young adults and adolescents that are relevant within a dental settling.

SO IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE

DT Article
DE Biochemical toxicology; Blood immunoassays; Urine screens; Suicides
AB Biochemical toxicology in suicides provides a template to improve preventive interventions in cases of suicide. The menu for biochemical toxicological analysis in coroners' cases is not prescriptive in Ireland or in the United Kingdom. The aim of the study was to confirm that reliance on the results of an immunoassay screen for drugs of abuse and common analgesics in order to select samples for compound confirmation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is likely to understate the potential role of drugs in suicide. Blood and urine samples were analyzed using enzyme immunoassay, alcohols by gas chromatography and urines were screened by Bio-Rad's Rapid Emergency Drug Identification (REMEDi) system. Laboratory data from analysis of 132 cases of suicide, including 101 cases of hanging revealed that 83 % were male confirming suicide as a male epidemic. Overall, alcohol was a factor in 57 %, benzodiazepines in 26 %, cannabinoids in 11 %, opioids in 19.7 %, sympathomimetics in 7.5 %, cocaine in 4.5 %, antidepressants 22 %, antipsychotics in 10 %, hypnotics in 5 %, and antihistamines in 4 % of these cases. Screening compounds in cases of hanging and other suicides should extend beyond the narrow focus of alcohol and illicit drugs to include a wide spectrum of psychoactive and other compounds as a standard procedure. The wide range of licit and illicit compounds found in these cases reflects current experience and dictates the necessity for chromatographic screening with mass spectroscopy confirmation in all cases as best practice.

Aims: To describe the ligature points and ligatures used in ward hangings; to identify any trends over time in ligature points and ligatures used; and to compare these patient characteristics with other inpatient suicides. Methods: A national clinical survey of suicide cases in recent (< 1 year) contact with mental health services in England and Wales (1999-2007). Results: Of the 448 suicides that occured on psychiatric wards, 77% were by hanging. The number of hanging cases, however, has fallen by 74% since 1999. The most common ligature points and ligatures were doors, hooks/handles, windows, and belts or sheets/towels, respectively. Use of shoelaces, doors, and windows increased over time. These patient suicides had had high rates of self-harm, alcohol/drug misuse, and were more likely than other cases to have died early in admission and been formally detained for treatment. Conclusions: Despite the decrease in inpatient suicides by hanging, regular reviews of ward structures are needed, particularly as ligatures and ligature points change over time. Improving the ward environment to engage patients, especially early in admission, may also contribute to reducing risk.

TI Rational suicide: philosophical perspectives on schizophrenia

DT Article
DE Policy; Psychiatry; Rationality; Schizophrenia; Suicide
ID QUALITY-OF-LIFE; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS;
   MENTAL-CAPACITY; COMMUNITY
AB Suicide prevention is a National Health Service priority in the United Kingdom. People with mental illness are seen to represent one of the most vulnerable groups for suicide and recent British Government policy has focused on prevention and management of perceived risk. This approach to suicide prevention is constructed under a biomedical model of psychiatry, which maintains that suicidal persons suffer from some form of disease or irrational drive towards self-destruction. Many react to the idea of self-inflicted death with instinctive revulsion, which has prevented serious discussion of the concept of rational suicide, particularly in relation to those with schizophrenia. The idea that there may be circumstances in which suicide can be viewed as rational is discussed within the biomedical approach to ethics and wider literature primarily in relation to physical disease, terminal states and chronic pain. It is not deemed a viable choice for those who are considered 'non-autonomous' due to the controlling forces of mental illness. I propose that suicide is not a consequence of mental illness per se, and that it may be seen as a rational response to a realistic perspective on the course and consequences of living with schizophrenia. The denial of dialogue about the validity of suicidal ideation for people with schizophrenia has led to negative consequences for people with serious mental illness in terms of justice and recognition of person-hood.

   AVAILABILITY; SUICIDE; RESTRICTION; ADOLESCENTS; PREVENTION; REDUCTION
AB Objective To evaluate the long term effect of legislation limiting the size of packs of analgesics sold over the counter.
   Design Before and after study.
   Setting Suicides in England and Wales, data from six liver units in England and Scotland and five general hospitals in England, and UK data on sales of analgesics, between September 1993 and September 2002.
   Data sources Office for National Statistics; six liver units in England and Scotland; monitoring systems in general hospitals in Oxford, Manchester, and Derby; and Intercontinental Medical Statistics Health UK.
   Main outcome measures Deaths by suicidal overdose with paracetamol, salicylates, or ibuprofen; numbers of patients admitted to liver units, listed for liver transplant, and undergoing transplantations for paracetamol induced hepatotoxicity; non-fatal self poisonings with analgesics and numbers of tablets taken; and sales figures for analgesics.
   Results Suicide deaths from paracetamol and salicylates were reduced by 22% (95% confidence interval 11% to 32%) in the year after the change in legislation on 16 September 1998, and this reduction persisted in the next two years. Liver unit admissions and liver transplants for paracetamol induced hepatotoxicity were reduced by around 30% in the four years after the legislation. Numbers of paracetamol and salicylate tablets in non-fatal overdoses were reduced in the three years after the legislation. Large overdoses were reduced by 20% (9% to 29%) for paracetamol and by 39% (14% to 57%) for salicylates in the second and third years after the legislation. Ibuprofen overdoses increased after the legislation, but with little or no effect on deaths.
   Conclusion Legislation restricting pack sizes of analgesics in the United Kingdom has been beneficial. A further reduction in pack sizes could prevent more deaths.

AB Background: The suicide rate in young people in the United Kingdom has increased over the last decade. As there is a paucity of information about the characteristics of young suicides we have undertaken a detailed investigation of suicides in people aged 15-24 years by means of the psychological autopsy approach. Methods: The sample consisted of 27 subjects (25 males, two females) whose deaths received a verdict of suicide (N = 24) or undetermined cause (N = 3). information was collected from informant interviews, coroners' inquest notes, medical records and psychiatric case notes. A sub-sample of 22 male subjects was compared with an age-matched sample of male deliberate self-harm (DSH) patients. Results: Psychiatric disorders were diagnosed in 19 (70.4%) subjects. These were most commonly depressive disorders (55.5%). Very few individuals were receiving treatment for their disorders. Substance abuse disorders were uncommon but a substantial proportion of individuals had problems with alcohol or drug misuse. Personality disorders were present in 29.6% of subjects and disorders or personality trait accentuation in 55.6%. Comorbidity of psychiatric disorders was found in a third of subjects. The suicides were often the end-point of long-term difficulties extending back to childhood or early adolescence. In addition to mental disorders, relationship and legal difficulties were identified as relatively common contributory factors to the suicides. In comparison to deliberate self harm patients, male suicides were more likely to use dangerous methods and live alone. Limitations: Several potential informants could not be interviewed and there was no general population control sample. Conclusions: The process leading to suicide in young people is often long term, with untreated depression in the context of personality and/or relationship difficulties being a common picture at the time of death. The prevention of suicide in the young clearly requires multiple strategies. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

   PATTERNS
AB Objective: To identify the substances used by people who die from suicide by overdose in Toronto and to determine the correlates of specific categories of substances used.
   Method: Coroner's records for all cases of suicide by overdose in Toronto, Ontario, during a 10-year period (1998 to 2007) were examined. Data collected included demographic data, all substances detected, and those determined by the coroner to have caused death. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine demographic and clinical factors associated with suicide by different drug types.
   Results: There were 397 documented suicides by overdose (mean age 49.1 years, 50% female). Most substances detected were psychotropic prescription medications (n = 245), followed by other prescription medications (n = :143) and over-the-counter (OTC) medications (n = 83). More than one-half of all suicides by overdose were determined to have only one specific substance as the cause of death (n = 206). In suicides where only one class of substance was present in lethal amounts, OTC medication (n = 48), opioid analgesics (n = 44), and tricyclic antidepressants (n = 44) were most common.
   Conclusions: Suicides by overdose involved the use of different classes of substances, including psychotropic prescription medication, other prescription medications, as well as OTC medications. Physicians and pharmacists should be aware of commonly used prescription and OTC medications in overdose and exercise increased vigilance in prescribing or dispensing them to at-risk patients.

AB Aims: This review will focus on the rates, clinical characteristics, risk factors and methods of self-harm and suicide in different ethnic groups in the United Kingdom, providing an update synthesis of recent literature.
   Methods: Studies that met the inclusion criteria between 2003 and 2013 were reviewed using the following databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE and CINAHL. The methodological quality of each study was then assessed using a structured scoring system.
   Results: A total of 2,362 articles were retrieved, 10 of which matched the inclusion criteria were reviewed. Significant differences were found in the rates of self-harm between ethnic groups with Asian males being least likely to self-harm and Black females being most likely to self-harm. Also, Black and South Asian people were less likely to repeat self-harm. Factors that may help protect or predispose individuals to self-harm or attempt suicide (such as religion, mental health and coping styles) also differ between ethnic groups.
   Conclusions: There are clear ethnic differences in self-harm and suicide, which may be affected by factors such as cultural pressures and prevalence of mental illness. An awareness of these differences is vital to help prevent further attempts of self-harm and suicide. Further research into differences between ethnic and cultural groups and self-harm continues to be important.

AB Objective To determine whether rates of suicide changed in Toronto after a barrier was erected at Bloor Street Viaduct, the bridge with the world's second highest annual rate of suicide by jumping after Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.
   Design Natural experiment.
   Setting City of Toronto and province of Ontario, Canada; records at the chief coroner's office of Ontario 1993-2001 (nine years before the barrier) and July 2003-June 2007 (four years after the barrier).
   Participants 14 789 people who completed suicide in the city of Toronto and in Ontario.
   Main outcome measure Changes in yearly rates of suicide by jumping at Bloor Street Viaduct, other bridges, and buildings, and by other means.
   Results Yearly rates of suicide by jumping in Toronto remained unchanged between the periods before and after the construction of a barrier at Bloor Street Viaduct (56.4 v 56.6, P=0.95). A mean of 9.3 suicides occurred annually at Bloor Street Viaduct before the barrier and none after the barrier (P<0.01). Yearly rates of suicide by jumping from other bridges and buildings were higher in the period after the barrier although only significant for other bridges (other bridges: 8.7 v 14.2, P=0.01; buildings: 38.5 v 42.7, P=0.32).
   Conclusions Although the barrier prevented suicides at Bloor Street Viaduct, the rate of suicide by jumping in Toronto remained unchanged. This lack of change might have been due to a reciprocal increase in suicides from other bridges and buildings. This finding suggests that Bloor Street Viaduct may not have been a uniquely attractive location for suicide and that barriers on bridges may not alter absolute rates of suicide by jumping when comparable bridges are nearby.

AB Despite elevated rates of suicide and evidence of poor mental health among medical professionals, there is a paucity of research in the UK into the mental health of students destined for these careers. This study estimated and compared the prevalence of mental ill-health in students studying veterinary medicine, medicine, dentistry and pharmacy in the United Kingdom. A group of law students was also included, who, although subject to similar stressors as undergraduates, do not go on to share a heightened risk of suicide as professionals. A total of 1744 respondents completed a questionnaire with validated measures to assess wellbeing, psychological distress, depression and suicidal ideation and attempts. Results indicated that law students experienced the poorest mental health of the student groups studied. Wellbeing was highest among veterinary and medical students. However, the medical students were the most likely to have previously attempted suicide. These findings highlight the importance of directly comparing student groups and of appropriately supporting students as they progress through training and into the professions.

AB Following increasing concern in the UK about the mortality and morbidity associated with self-poisoning with analgesics, especially paracetamol (Tylenol, acetaminophen), legislation was introduced in 1998 to modify packs sold over-the-counter. The most important change was a reduction in the maximum size of packs, In this paper the background to the legislation, the rationale behind it, and its early impact are reviewed. The changes have had significant positive initial benefits on the mortality and morbidity associated with self-poisoning with analgesics.

TI Farming and mental health problems and mental illness
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY

ID DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; STRESS; SUICIDE; FARMERS; INJURIES; ENGLAND;
   SATISFACTION; PREDICTORS; COMMUNITY
AB Background: Farmers experience one of the highest rates of suicide of any industry and there is growing evidence that those involved in farming are at higher risk of developing mental health problems. This article provides an overview of the literature examining mental health issues experienced by farming populations in the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States and identifies areas for further research.
   Method: A literature review (Medline, Science Direct, Ingenta, Proquest and PsychINFO) was carried out using the words 'farmers', 'agriculture', 'depression', I mental health', 'mental illness', 'stress', and 'suicide', as well as a review of relevant papers and publications known to the authors. (Papers not written in English and those published prior to 1985 were excluded.)
   Results: Fifty-two papers were identified with the majority focusing on stress and coping styles in farmers (24). A number of studies also focused on neuropsychological functioning and agricultural chemical use (7), depression (7), suicide (9), general mental health (4) and injury and mental health (1). This body of research studied male farmers, female farmers, farm workers, farming families, and young people living on farms. Research to date indicates that farmers, farm workers and their respective families face an array of stressors related to the physical environment, structure of farming families and the economic difficulties and uncertainties associated with farming which may be detrimental to their mental health.
   Conclusion: Whilst suicide rates in some groups of farmers are higher than the general population, conclusive data do not exist to indicate whether farmers and farming families experience higher rates of mental health problems compared with the non-farming community. It is clear, however, that farming is associated with a unique set of characteristics that is potentially hazardous to mental health and requires further research.

AB Approximately 1 in 4 deaths of patients maintained on dialysis in the United States is preceded by a decision to discontinue treatment. Once considered to be a form of suicide, dialysis discontinuation is now increasingly common in most countries that are fortunate enough to offer renal replacement therapies. Given an aging and progressively sicker chronic kidney disease patient population, the rate of terminating dialysis is likely to increase. The literature on dialysis discontinuation includes studies principally from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The research is reviewed, critiqued, and examined to determine its relevance to practice. Future issues include the need to explore variability in dialysis practice as well as employment of a more patient-centered approach that is consistent with modern palliative medicine.

AB Background: Suicide mortality and the rates by specific methods in a population may change over time in response to concurrent changes in relevant factors in society. This study aimed to identify significant changing points in method-specific suicide mortality from 1969 to 2012 in Norway.
   Method: Data on suicide mortality by specific methods and by sex and age were retrieved from the Norwegian Cause-of-Death Register. Long-term trends in age-standardized rates of suicide mortality were analyzed by using joinpoint regression analysis.
   Results: The most frequently used suicide method in the total population was hanging, followed by poisoning and firearms. Men chose suicide by firearms more often than women, whereas poisoning and drowning were more frequently used by women. The joinpoint analysis revealed that the overall trend of suicide mortality significantly changed twice along the period of 1969 to 2012 for both sexes. The male age-standardized suicide rate increased by 3.1 % per year until 1989, and decreased by 1.2 % per year between 1994 and 2012. Among females the long-term suicide rate increased by 4.0 % per year until 1988, decreased by 5.5 % through 1995, and then stabilized. Both sexes experienced an upward trend for suicide by hanging during the 44-year observation period, with a particularly significant increase in 15-24 year old males. The most distinct change among men was seen for firearms after 1988 with a significant decrease through 2012 of around 5 % per year. For women, significant reductions since 1985-88 were observed for suicide by drowning and poisoning.
   Conclusions: The present study demonstrates different time trends for different suicide methods with significant reductions in suicide by firearms, drowning and poisoning after the peak in the suicide rate in the late 1980s. Suicide by means of hanging continuously increased, but did not fully compensate for the reduced use of other methods. This lends some support for the effectiveness of method-specific suicide preventive measures, such as restrictions to the access to firearms, which had been implemented in Norway during the relevant time period.

AB This article examines the impact of the 1889-93 'Russian' influenza on late Victorian society and culture. Using medical officer of health and national and local newspaper reports, and the poetry and memoirs of prominent survivors, I argue that the rapid progress of the influenza across Europe and the morbidity of leading politicians and other members of the British establishment occasioned widespread 'dread' and in some cases panic. This dread of influenza was fuelled by the high mortality rate in northern towns such as Sheffield, as well as by the disease's association with pneumonia, neurasthenia, psychosis and suicide. However, the key factor was the growth of mass circulation newspapers and the way that the influenza drew on fin de siecle cultural anxieties about urbanisation and the increasing speed of modern life.

TI Accident or suicide? Predictors of coroners' decisions in suicide and
   accident verdicts
SO MEDICINE SCIENCE AND THE LAW
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective To examine the factors used by Coroners to distinguish between suicide and accidental death among young men in Merseyside and Cheshire.
   Design - Retrospective epidemiological survey of deaths due to external causes. Data sources included Coroner's Inquest, GP and hospital data. Logistic regression was carried out to determine the multiple effect of individual factors on defining Coroner's verdict.
   Setting - Merseyside and Cheshire, United Kingdom.
   Subjects Males aged 15-39 years who died from unnatural causes during 1995 in Merseyside and Cheshire.
   Main outcome measure Coroner's verdict.
   Results An active mode of death was by far the strongest predictor of a suicide as opposed to an accident verdict. Other significant differentiating Factors included expressed intent, behavioural change, deliberate self-harm and psychiatric contact.
   Conclusion The validity of using method of death as a predictor of intent is questionable. Evidence left by drug users who kill themselves may differ from that left by nondrug users and may need to be sought in less conventional ways. There may be a discrepancy between those factors deemed important by health professionals as indicators of suicide, such as deliberate self-harm, and those given most weight by the Coroner. It may be more pragmatic, in terms of public health policy development, to challenge the concept that self-destructive behaviour can be categorized as being either intentional or unintentional. There is some evidence suggesting that deaths due to suicide and accidents both result from elements of self-destructive behaviour and therefore, the practice of categorizing deaths as either suicides or accidents could be misleading.

TI Maternal mortality and psychiatric morbidity in the perinatal period:

SO MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA

DT Editorial Material
ID PREGNANCY; POSTPARTUM; SUICIDE
AB Maternal mortality associated with psychiatric illness in the perinatal period (pregnancy to the end of the first year postpartum) has until recently been under-reported in Australia due to limitations in the scope of the data collection and methods of detection.
   The recent United Kingdom report Why mothers die 20002002 identified psychiatric illness as the leading cause of maternal death in the UK.
   Findings from the last three reports on maternal deaths in Australia (covering the period 1994-2002) suggest that maternal psychiatric illness is one of the leading causes of maternal death, with the majority of suicides occurring by violent means.
   Such findings strengthen the case for routine perinatal psychosocial screening programs, with clear referral guidelines and assertive perinatal treatment of significant maternal psychiatric morbidity.
   Data linkage studies are needed to measure the full extent of maternal mortality associated with psychiatric illness in Australia.

AB Objective To assess the long term effect of United Kingdom legislation introduced in September 1998 to restrict pack sizes of paracetamol on deaths from paracetamol poisoning and liver unit activity.
   Design Interrupted time series analyses to assess mean quarterly changes from October 1998 to the end of 2009 relative to projected deaths without the legislation based on pre-legislation trends.
   Setting Mortality (1993-2009) and liver unit activity (1995-2009) in England and Wales, using information from the Office for National Statistics and NHS Blood and Transplant, respectively.
   Participants Residents of England and Wales.
   Main outcome measures Suicide, deaths of undetermined intent, and accidental poisoning deaths involving single drug ingestion of paracetamol and paracetamol compounds in people aged 10 years and over, and liver unit registrations and transplantations for paracetamol induced hepatotoxicity.
   Results Compared with the pre-legislation level, following the legislation there was an estimated average reduction of 17 (95% confidence interval -25 to -9) deaths per quarter in England and Wales involving paracetamol alone (with or without alcohol) that received suicide or undetermined verdicts. This decrease represented a 43% reduction or an estimated 765 fewer deaths over the 11 1/4 years after the legislation. A similar effect was found when accidental poisoning deaths were included, and when a conservative method of analysis was used. This decrease was largely unaltered after controlling for a non-significant reduction in deaths involving other methods of poisoning and also suicides by all methods. There was a 61% reduction in registrations for liver transplantation for paracetamol induced hepatotoxicity (-11 (-20 to -1) registrations per quarter). But no reduction was seen in actual transplantations (-3 (-12 to 6)), nor in registrations after a conservative method of analysis was used.
   Conclusions UK legislation to reduce pack sizes of paracetamol was followed by significant reductions in deaths due to paracetamol overdose, with some indication of fewer registrations for transplantation at liver units during the 11 years after the legislation. The continuing toll of deaths suggests, however, that further preventive measures should be sought.

AB Depression affects around 4-10% of the general population in England. Depression can often lead to behaviors and thoughts related to suicide and aggression, which have a social and economic burden to the United Kingdom. One construct that has been theorized as having an association with these behaviors is alexithymia. People with alexithymia have difficulties identifying and describing their emotional experiences. To date, there is no consensus on types or causes of alexithymia. Whilst the literature evidences a strong relationship between alexithymia and suicidality and aggression, little is known about the nature of this relationship. The present article will attempt to describe the extant literature on this relationship, drawing out some of the contentions and unanswered questions.

TI A theory for the nursing care of patients at risk of suicide
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING

   psychiatric nursing; suicide; therapeutic relationship
ID GROUNDED THEORY; NURSES
AB Aim. This paper presents a nursing care theory developed to guide the care given to people with suicidal ideas and those with a previous suicide attempt.
   Background. Suicide is a major public health problem. According to the World Health Organization, international suicide rates range from highs of more than 20 per 100 000 people in Hungary (1997 figures), to fewer than 10 per 100 000 in the United Kingdom (2002 figures). In 2002, the number of completed suicides in Taiwan increased by nearly 10% over the previous year, and the Taiwanese Government has set targets to reduce this rate. Psychiatric nurses play a vital role in helping reduce the suicide rate through prevention, education and by providing care that promotes the healing of patients who attempt suicide.
   Methods. A grounded theory approach was used. Fifteen patients who had either suicidal ideas or had attempted suicide and 15 psychiatric nurses working on acute wards were interviewed and observed using an observer-as-participant strategy. Data were collected through field notes and by tape-recorded interviews during 2003, and analysed using open, axial and selective coding and the qualitative software program QRS NUD*IST.
   Findings. The core category that emerged from the data collected was the provision of 'safe and compassionate care via the channel of the therapeutic relationship'. Other key categories linked to and embraced within this core category were: providing holistic assessments; providing protection; providing basic care; and promoting healing through advanced care.
   Conclusion. The theory generated from the findings could be used by nurses as a guide as they initiate and maintain therapeutic relationships with patients who are at risk of suicide. The theory could advance the quality of care provided by nurses. In addition, it holds potential for instilling hope in patients who have lost their ability to cope with life events and perhaps life itself.

AB Quantitative studies have found that suicide bereavement is associated with suicide attempt, and is perceived as the most stigmatising of sudden losses. Their findings also suggest that perceived stigma may explain the excess suicidality. There is a need to understand the nature of this stigma and address suicide risk in this group. We aimed to describe and compare the nature of the experiences of stigma reported by people bereaved by suicide, sudden unnatural death, and sudden natural death, and identify any commonalities and unique experiences. We conducted a population-based cross-sectional survey of 659,572 staff and students at 37 British higher educational institutions in 2010, inviting those aged 18-40 who had experienced sudden bereavement of a close contact since the age of 10 to take part in an on-line survey and to volunteer for an interview to discuss their experiences. We used maximum variation sampling from 1398 volunteer interviewees to capture a range of experiences, and conducted individual face-to-face semi-structured interviews to explore perceptions of stigma and support. We continued sampling until no new themes were forthcoming, reaching saturation at n = 27 interviews (11 participants bereaved by suicide). We employed thematic analysis to identify any distinct dimensions of reported stigma, and any commonalities across the three groups. We identified two key themes: specific negative attitudes of others, and social awkwardness. Both themes were common to interviewees bereaved by suicide, sudden unnatural death, and sudden natural death. All interviewees reported the experience of stigmatising social awkwardness, but this may have been experienced more acutely by those bereaved by suicide due to self-stigma. This study provides evidence of a persistent death taboo in relation to sudden deaths. There is potential for anti-stigma interventions to reduce the isolation and social awkwardness perceived by people bereaved suddenly, particularly after suicide loss.

AB Despite overall improvements in life expectancy, rates of premature male mortality, particularly for men in areas of socioeconomic deprivation, remain an important issue of concern in the United Kingdom. Interventions to engage men and promote their health and wellbeing have developed, albeit sporadically, over recent decades in response to this health inequity. This paper provides a 10-year update on the state of men's health promotion in the United Kingdom. It begins by highlighting changes in male life expectancy and possible explanations for these shifts, including a relative failure to address mental health promotion and male suicide, before providing detail about how practice approaches to men's health promotion have evolved over the period 2005-2016. Such changes are not removed from the wider socioeconomic context. This paper therefore, then, considers movements in the policy context and possible influences of this before exploring the challenges that remain for men's health promotion. We suggest that despite certain improvements in the practice of men's health promotion and in men's health outcomes, issues remain in terms of premature mortality, particularly for certain groups of men. We further suggest that many of the difficulties in improving and promoting the health of men further lie with a market-driven neoliberal policy context that engenders inequality through the inequitable distribution of and access to material resources and through individualistic approaches to health promotion that serve men from economically and socially disadvantaged locations least well.

AB There is evidence from outside the United Kingdom to show that physicians' religious beliefs influence their decision making at the end of life. This UK study explores the belief system of consultants, nurse key workers and specialist registrars and their attitudes to decisions which commonly must be taken when caring for individuals who are dying. All consultants (N = 119), nurse key workers (N = 36) and specialist registrars (N = 44) working in an acute hospital in the north-east of England were asked to complete a postal questionnaire. In all, 65% of consultants, 67% of nurse key workers and 41% of specialist registrars responded. Results showed that consultants' religion and belief systems differed from those of nurses and the population they served. Consultants and nurses had statistically significant differences in their attitudes to common end of life decisions with consultants more likely to continue hydration and not withdraw treatment. Nurses were more sympathetic to the idea of physician-assisted suicide for unbearable suffering. This study shows the variability in belief system and attitudes to end of life decision making both within and between clinical groups. This may have practical implications for the clinical care given and the place of care. The personal belief system of consultants was not shown to affect their overall attitudes to withdrawing life-sustaining treatment or physician-assisted suicide.

AB Depression affects 10-15% of people over 65 living at home in the United Kingdom. It is the commonest and the most reversible mental health problem in old age. Depression is associated with physical illness and disability, life events, social isolation and loneliness. Depression in old age carries an increased risk of suicide and natural mortality. Recognition and simple intervention can reduce morbidity, demand on health and social services and the cost of community care. Despite a favourable response to treatment, depression remains largely undetected and untreated.

SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE

ID SURVIVORS
AB This study in the UK examined how the suicide inquest can affect bereaved relatives and impact upon their grief. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with a sample of 16 individuals bereaved by suicide in order to explore their experiences of the inquest. Thematic analysis was used to identify recurrent problems and their effects. Several interviewees had been significantly traumatised by the inquest process. They were particularly disturbed by the judicial atmosphere, media activity, the invasion of privacy, and giving evidence. Exposure to graphic evidence, delayed inquests, confiscated suicide notes and the inquest's failure to provide explanation and deal with blame also presented problems. Difficulties were compounded by a widespread lack of preparation and communication prior to the event. The inquest adversely affected resolution of grief in two main ways: by exacerbating common grief reactions associated with bereavement by suicide, such as, shame, guilt and anger; and, by interfering with necessary grief work, most notably, the task of arriving at a meaningful and acceptable account of the death. Other interviewees described more positive experiences, one of whom regarded the inquest as helpful to their resolution of grief. Whereas these results may not typify all inquest experiences, the findings do suggest that a number of reforms are necessary to avoid the possibility of the inquest distressing this vulnerable group. Ideally, there should be a clear protocol for dealing with bereaved relatives. This is currently lacking in the coroners' system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Suicide reduction and prevention: strategies and interventions
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE & COUNSELLING
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper focuses on suicide reduction and prevention. It considers what the United Kingdom government and associated bodies such as Department of Health, the National Health Service and Prison Service could do and are considering doing to prevent suicide in Britain. UK suicide statistics for the period 1971 and 1997 are compared and the Highland Health Board suicide prevention strategy for the 1990s is considered. The articles in this symposium are introduced and the recent UK legal cases involving Ms B and Diane Pretty are included.
   Counsellors and psychotherapists have always been concerned, to varying degrees, about clients committing or attempting suicide [1]. It is a topic which can trigger much concern and interest with both neophyte and experienced therapists [2]. In the past decade there has been a growth in individual membership of counselling and psychotherapeutic professional bodies with more therapists becoming accredited and/or registered as qualified practitioners. Thus there has been additional pressure on therapists to adhere to professional codes of practice and ethics. To take the correct action and to be seen to take the correct action within client-therapist relationships is now paramount. It could be argued that this has always been the case. However, therapists not working within a professional framework may have had less incentive to act in a professional manner. A proactive approach may be recommended when seeing clients with suicidal ideation and/or intention (Palmer, 1995). In these cases, inaction can sometimes prove fatal so it is incumbent upon the therapist to support and help the client through the difficult period (Curwen, 1997).

AB Evidence indicates that suicide rates are higher in South Asian women in the United Kingdom compared with other ethnic groups, suggesting increased vulnerability to attempted suicide and mental distress in these women. Specialist Community Public Health Nurses (SCPHNs, including health visitors) are in an ideal position to assess such risk. The objectives are to determine whether SCPHNs assess known risk factors for depression, self-harm, and suicide during initial contact with South Asian mothers in London; the extent to which these risk factors are documented in the nursing records; and whether their assessments of South Asian women differ from those of other ethnic groups. Structured content analysis of semistructured interviews with 8 SCPHNs and analysis of 60 matched pairs of SCPHN records were carried out in an inner London community. The results revealed that SCPHNs assessed general risk factors for postnatal depression and some culture-specific factors when assessing South Asian mothers. Documentation of risk factors was under-represented in the SCPHN records and there was a significant difference between the documented risk factors for South Asian women and women from other ethnic groups. While SCPHNs understood some aspects of South Asian culture, service improvements must be made to ensure better care provision.

AB We systematically quantified excess mortality in epilepsy patients by cause of death using the population-attributable fraction and epilepsy-attributable years of potential life lost (YPLL) by age 75 years at ages 15 and over. We updated and undertook a re-review of mortality studies from our previous systematic review following PRISMA guidelines to identify cohort studies of general epilepsy populations reporting a relative risk (RR) of death by cause relative to the background rates in the population. Studies on epilepsy prevalence were identified through published reviews. Country-specific mortality figures were obtained from the WHO World Mortality Database. We performed a pooled analysis with the DerSimonian-Laird random effects method. In countries with very high Human Development Indices, epilepsy contributed to 0.5-1.1 % of all deaths in the total population. Among external causes, suicides (RR 2.9, 95 % confidence interval 2.2-3.8; I-2 52 %) were the major contributor to YPLL, corresponding to 6.7 % and 4.2 % of excess YPLL due to epilepsy in the United States (US) and in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2010, with 541 (346-792) and 44 (28-65) excess suicide cases, respectively. Fatal accidental falls were more common, with 813 (610-1064) and 95 (71-125) excess deaths in the US and in the UK, but these caused only 2.0 % of excess YPLL as they occurred in older age groups. Suicides were the most important external cause of death in epilepsy patients in terms of excess YPLL, whereas other external causes were either more common in older ages or caused less excess deaths.

AB Bullying and stalking through cyberspace have become serious phenomena in the Internet era, impacting mainly young users and teenagers. Many tragic incidents have occurred, especially in the West, including self-harm and suicide due to these problems. To protect the victims many countries such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK) and Canada have codified laws dealing with cyber-crimes, including cyber-harassment. To determine the adequacy of such laws in addressing these issues, we present in this paper a legal analysis of the existing anti-bullying and stalking laws in the UAE, US, UK, and Canada. The purpose is to gain perspective on the characteristics of the laws and their ability to protect society from various forms of crimes associated with cyberbullying and cyberstalking. The paper also presents recommendations to help combat cyberbullying and cyberstalking and protect our youth from these issues.

TI Access to means of lethal overdose among psychiatric patients with

   series data from the United Kingdom
SO JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Suicide; Means restriction; Overdose; Physical health co-morbidities;

AB Background: Many physical health problems are associated with elevated suicide risk whilst also providing access to means of overdose. We aimed to investigate whether psychiatric patients with physical co-morbidities who die by suicide were more likely than those without co-morbidities to self-poison with non-psychotropic medications.
   Methods: We analysed data on 14,648 psychiatric patients who died by suicide in England & Wales during 2004-2015, as recorded by the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Safety in Mental Health. Using logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, and primary drug dependence/misuse we compared patients diagnosed with physical co-morbidities versus those without to assess whether a greater proportion of the former had died by overdose, and medication prescribed to treat such disorders (e.g. opioids, insulin).
   Results: 24% (n = 3525) were recorded as having physical co-morbidity. A greater proportion of these individuals died by self-poisoning than those without physical co-morbidity (37% vs. 20%, p < .001; adjusted OR 2.47; 95% CI 2.26-2.70), and they were more likely to have used medications for a physical health disorder in overdose (50% vs. 34%; adjusted OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.80-2.46), particularly opioids (30% vs. 22%; p < .001), paracetamol/opioid compounds (11% vs. 7%, p < .001) and insulin (4% vs. 1%, p < .001).
   Limitations: Use of survey data may have resulted in under-reporting of physical health problems and/or overdose medications.
   Conclusions: Overdose, rather than hanging, is the leading cause of suicide among psychiatric patients with physical co-morbidities, particularly using non-psychotropic medications. There is potential for means restriction in preventing suicide among these patients.

AB In the United Kingdom, one in five of the population is an older man, many of whom live alone. Loneliness and social isolation is a growing issue for many of these older men, one that has been associated with elevated blood pressure, poor physical health, increased mortality and mental ill-health, including depression, suicide and dementia. Lone dwelling and social isolation have tended to be viewed largely as issues affecting older women due to their greater life expectancy (LE), but the LE gap between men and women is closing, presenting new challenges for the health and wellbeing of older men. This is not unique to the United Kingdom. Yet whilst inclusionary social spaces and supportive social ties can be important for enhancing physical and mental wellbeing amongst older people, evidence suggests that lone-dwelling older men can experience greater difficulty in accessing effective social support, relative to older women. Understanding those spaces of communal activity that are likely to be successful in promoting health and wellbeing amongst older men is thus important if we are to improve their quality of life. In this paper, we draw on research with a 'Men in Sheds' pilot programme in the United Kingdom, to illustrate how everyday spaces within local communities might be designed to both promote and maintain the health and wellbeing of older men. In doing so, we aim to offer insights into how Sheds, as created and gendered spaces, may not only engage older men in ways that help to maintain their perceived health and wellbeing, but also provide sites within which older men can perform and reaffirm their masculinity.

AB Suicide is a catastrophic event to both families and communities yet it is potentially preventable. This study aims to determine incidence and patterns of suicide in children and young adolescents in our region, raise awareness of this entity as a potentially preventable cause of death in this age group, and identify its possible associated risk factors. We retrospectively reviewed suicide cases presenting as sudden unexpected death in children and adolescents that underwent coronial post-mortems at our institution. This is the largest pathological review of completed suicide in children and young adolescents within a single institution in the United Kingdom. We identified 23 suicide cases during a 12 year period from 2003 to 2015, in which 18 cases (78%) were male and 5 cases (22%) were female. The age range was from 8 to 16 years (mean age 12.82 +/- 2.52 SD). With the exception of one case, all of the victims were Caucasian. The majority, 19 cases (81%), were found dead inside their place of residence, 15 of whom were discovered in their own bedrooms. Twenty-one cases (91%) died from neck compression due to hanging; 6 cases (26%) had used the cord of a dressing gown and 5 (22%) opted to use a belt as the ligature. Two cases (9%) that died from multiple-drug toxicity were female. In 7 cases (30.5%) there was evidence of self-harm and in 3 cases (13%) there was a history of previous suicide attempts. Petechial hemorrhages were found at autopsy in more than half of hanging victims and only three cases (14%) displayed dual distribution of post-mortem hypostasis (back and legs). Seven victims (30.5%) left some form of suicide message to family members and friends, 2 of which wrote the message on their arm. Parental separation, conflict with parents, and depression, were common amongst decedents prior to committing suicide. Substance abuse was uncommon in suicide within our cases. Valuable information is available from thorough review of suicide data in children and young adolescents from a single institution. Pathologists and clinicians can play crucial roles in identifying potential risk factors that may contribute to prevent future deaths.

AB Aims - Most of the available evidence on the relationship between socioeconomic indicators of social deprivation and patterns of use of mental health services has been produced in the United Kingdom, where the Ministry of Health has developed a resource allocation formula based upon the results of those studies. The main aim of the paper is to evaluate the replicability in the Italian context of such research, and of the resulting allocation strategies. Methods - Detailed description of the resource allocation method currently adopted in the United Kingdom, whose main purpose consists in reaching the best balance between available funding and patterns of need. Detailed description of resource allocation processes in Italy; discussion of the main methodological and statistical limitations restraining the replicability of the British formula in the Italian context. Conclusions - There is a growing interest in Italy towards the introduction of evidence-based methods in health decision making, in order to correct the overwhelming influence of political issues. What is needed is a better understanding of the relationship between higher levels of equity in health services access, and their effects in terms of better outcomes.

AB Background: Recent United Kingdom strategies focus on preventable suicide deaths in former psychiatric in-patients, but natural causes of death, accidents and homicide may also be important. This study was intended to find the relative importance of natural and unnatural causes of death in people discharged from long-term psychiatric care in Scotland in 1977 - 1994.
   Methods: People discharged alive from psychiatric hospitals in Scotland in 1977 - 94 after a stay of one year or longer were identified using routine hospital records. Computer record linkage was used to link hospital discharges to subsequent death records. Mortality was described using a person-years analysis, and compared to the general population rates.
   Results: 6,776 people were discharged in the time period. 1,994 people (29%) died by the end of follow-up, 732 more deaths than expected. Deaths from suicide, homicide, accident and undetermined cause were increased, but accounted for only 197 of the excess deaths. Deaths from respiratory disease were four times higher than expected, and deaths from other causes, including cardiovascular disease, were also elevated.
   Conclusion: Suicide is an important cause of preventable mortality, but natural causes account for more excess deaths. Prevention activities should not focus only on unnatural causes of death.

By interrogating the geographic variations in the findings, such as high rates of poor mental health outcomes in the United Kingdom, large gay-heterosexual disparities in the Netherlands, and lower and improving rates of both outcomes and risk factors in Vermont and British Columbia, this study asserts that policy regimes, health programming, and the ways in which sexual minorities are constructed in places all contribute to their mental health.

Institutions set rules for national integration and communal recognition and send signals regarding social views of diversity. Testing these theorised links, however, requires two steps. First, careful conceptualisation of citizenship, both in individual and communal dimensions, categorises states' citizenship regimes. Second, unique cross-national polling of Muslim minorities in France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States permits analysis of the relationship between institutions and minority political attitudes. Findings demonstrate strong institutional effects on attitudes. However, these effects vary depending on the question asked. Institutions impact on cross-national variation in opinion regarding national identification and women's place in society. There is no evidence of institutional roots of support for suicide terrorism.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the attitudes of Pakistani families living in an urban area of the United Kingdom, towards mental health issues, to identify the emic models used and compare them with the etic model, predominant in Western medicine. This would allow the exploration of some of the inconsistencies in the research literature relating to the incidence of mental illness in this cultural group. The second aim was to explore the needs of this community, particularly women, in relation to mental health services. Due to problems gaining access to females on their own, interviews were held with family groups. Findings suggested that there were differences in the models of mental illness being employed with greater somatisation of symptoms in the Pakistani group and an emphasis on aggressive behaviour as a significant symptom. Treatment expectations also varied with some emphasis on traditional Pakistani treatments such as Faith healers and Hakims as well as General Practitioners and hospital treatments. Language difficulties, religious and cultural practices were also identified as barriers to female treatment in particular. Recommendations were made for improved training for interpreters and more emphasis on cultural factors and emic models of mental illness as part of medical training.

TI Antidepressant treatment and the risk of fatal and non-fatal self harm

AB Objective To compare the risk of non-fatal self harm and suicide in patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with that of patients taking tricyclic antidepressants, as well as between different SSRIs and different tricyclic antidepressants.
   Design Nested case-control study.
   Setting Primary care in the United Kingdom.
   Participants 146 095 individuals with a first prescription of an antidepressant for depression.
   Main outcome measures Suicide and non-fatal self harm.
   Results 1968 cases of non-fatal self harm and 69 suicides occurred. The overall adjusted odds ratio of non-fatal self harm was 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.14) and that of suicide 0.57 (0.26 to 1.25) in people prescribed SSRIs compared with those prescribed tricyclic antidepressants. We found little evidence that associations differed over time since starting or stopping treatment. We found some evidence that risks of non-fatal self harm in people prescribed SSRIs compared with those prescribed tricyclic antidepressants differed by age group (interaction P = 0.02). The adjusted odds ratio of non-fatal self harm for people prescribed SSRIs compared with users of tricylic antidepressants for those aged 18 or younger was 1.59 (1.01 to 2.50), but no association was apparent in other age groups. No suicides occur-red in those aged 18 or younger currently or recently prescribed tricyclic antidepressants or SSRIs.
   Conclusion We found no evidence that the risk of suicide or non-fatal self harm in adults prescribed SSRIs was greater than in those prescribed tricyclic antidepressants. We found some weak evidence of air increased risk of non-fatal self harm for current SSRI use among those aged 18 or younger. However, preferential prescribing of SSRIs to patients at higher risk of suicidal behaviour cannot be ruled out.

ID PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; RISK-FACTORS
AB IMPORTANCE: People with epilepsy have a 5-fold increased risk of suicide. Less is known about attempted suicide and whether psychiatric disorders and antiepileptic drugs modify the risk of attempted suicide. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the magnitude of the association between attempted suicide and epilepsy by comparing a first suicide attempt and a second suicide attempt (hereafter referred to as a recurrent suicide attempt) among people before they received a diagnosis of epilepsy (case patients) with a first suicide attempt and a recurrent suicide attempt among people without epilepsy (control patients), and to evaluate the effect of comorbid psychiatric disorders and the exclusion of antiepileptic drug prescriptions on this association. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based retrospective cohort study in the United Kingdom of case patients with incident epilepsy and control patients without a history of epilepsy in a general practice setting using Clinical Practice Research Datalink. The case patients with incident epilepsy were identified between 1987 and 2013 and were 10 to 60 years of age. The control patients for each case patient were 4 randomly selected people who did not receive a diagnosis of epilepsy before the case patient's epilepsy was diagnosed (the index date), matched by year of birth, sex, and general practice for a control to case ratio of 4 to 1. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hazard ratio for incident and recurrent suicide attempts among case patients with epilepsy compared with control patients without. RESULTS: For 14 059 case patients (median age, 36 years [range, 10-60 years]) who later had an onset of epilepsy vs 56 184 control patients (median age, 36 years [range, 10-60 years]), the risk was increased 2.9-fold (95% CI, 2.5-to 3.4-fold) for a first suicide attempt during the time period before the case patients received a diagnosis of epilepsy. For 278 case patients (median age, 37 years [range, 10-61 years]) who later had an onset of epilepsy vs 434 control patients (median age, 35 years [range, 11-61 years]), the risk was increased 1.8-fold (95% CI, 1.3- to 2.5-fold) for a recurrent suicide attempt up to and including the day that epilepsy was diagnosed. Exclusion of antiepileptic drugs prescribed before the index date did not meaningfully alter the findings, nor did separate analyses of patients with and patients without diagnosed psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Suicide attempts and recurrent suicide attempts are associated with epilepsy even before epilepsy manifests, suggesting a common underlying biology. Our findings indicate that both incident and recurrent suicide attempts are associated with incident epilepsy in the absence of antiepileptic drugs and in the absence of diagnosed psychiatric disorders, further strengthening the evidence for a common underlying etiology with an as-yet-unknown mechanism.

AB Perinatal depression (PND) affects up to 15% of women within the United Kingdom and has a lasting impact on a woman's quality of life, birth outcomes and her child's development. Suicide is the leading cause of maternal mortality. However, it is estimated that at least 50% of PND cases go undiagnosed. This paper presents the results of the first feasibility study to examine the potential of mobile devices to engage women in antenatal mental health screening. Using a mobile application, 254 women attending 14 National Health Service midwifery clinics provided 2,280 momentary and retrospective reports of their wellbeing over a 9-month period. Women spoke positively of the experience, installing and engaging with this technology regardless of age, education, wellbeing, number of children, marital or employment status, or past diagnosis of depression. 39 women reported a risk of depression, self-harm or suicide; two-thirds of whom were not identified by screening in-clinic.

AB Suicide bombing attacks have emerged as a lethal weapon in the hands of terrorist groups. Our aim was to review the medical experience acquired in Israel, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States in managing terrorist attacks, and prepare medical systems for the difficult task of managing these events. EMS protocols are amended to deal with a large number of victims in an urban setting who must be rapidly evacuated to a medical center where resuscitative as well as definitive care is delivered. A combination of extensive soft tissue damage caused by penetrating injuries, blast injury to the lungs and tympanic membranes, and burns are common among survivors. Preparation must include establishment of a clear chain-of-command lead by a general surgeon who manages the event and is responsible for decisions regarding OR preferences and ICU admissions. The emergency department is re-organized to handle the influx of numerous severely injured casualties. Professional personnel and resources are recruited and re-directed away from routine tasks towards treating the victims. This is achieved by deferring non-urgent operations, procedures and imaging studies. Victims are frequently re-assessed and re-evaluated to control chaos, minimize missed injuries and ensure delivery of an adequate level of care.

AB Context: Most previous studies have examined suicide risk in relation to a single physical disease.
   Objectives: To estimate relative risk across a range of physical diseases, to assess the confounding effect of clinical depression and effect modification by sex and age, and to examine physical illness multimorbidity.
   Design: Nested case-control study.
   Setting: Family practices (n = 593) registered with the General Practice Research Database from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2008. The case-control data were drawn from approximately 10.6 million complete patient records, pertaining to approximately 8% of the total population of the United Kingdom, with complete linkage to national mortality records.
   Participants: A total of 873 adult suicide cases and 17 460 living controls matched on age and sex were studied. The reference group for relative risk estimation consisted of people without any of the specific physical illnesses examined. Main Outcome Measures: Suicide and open verdicts.
   Results: Among all patients, coronary heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and osteoporosis were linked with elevated suicide risk, and, with the exception of osteoporosis, the increase was explained by clinical depression. The only significantly elevated risk in men was with osteoporosis. Female effect sizes were greater, with 2-or 3-fold higher risk found among women diagnosed as having cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and osteoporosis. In women with cancer and coronary heart disease, a significant elevation persisted after adjustment for depression. Overall, heightened risk was confined to physically ill women younger than 50 years and to older women with multiple physical diseases.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that clinical depression is a strong confounder of increased suicide risk among physically ill people. They also demonstrate an independent elevation in risk linked with certain diagnoses, particularly among women. Health care professionals working across all medical specialties should be vigilant for signs of undetected psychological symptoms.

DT Article
AB As a young man, Graham Greene (1904-1991) experienced several episodes of loss of consciousness, which were confidently diagnosed as epilepsy by a Harley Street specialist who saw him on two occasions during the 1920s. The diagnosis was initially concealed from him by his family and the specialist, but when it was revealed, it had a profound effect such that he contemplated suicide. He was particularly concerned about his impending marriage and the risk of having children. His anxiety was not relieved by being told that the famous author, Dostoevsky, had epilepsy. Graham Greene is the only public figure in the United Kingdom, of whom I am aware, who has admitted and discussed the impact of epilepsy, even though this was more than 40 years later when there was some doubt about the diagnosis.

AB Context. Continuous deep sedation (CDS) until death can form an effective part of palliative care. In The Netherlands and Belgium, CDS is sometimes regarded as an alternative to euthanasia, and the involvement of palliative care specialists is low. Provision of CDS through opioids alone is not recommended.
   Objectives. This study investigates the use of CDS in the United Kingdom.
   Methods. A survey of 8,857 doctors, of whom 3,733 (42%) replied, with 2,923 reporting on their last patient who died.
   Results. In total, 18.7% (17.3-20.1) of the doctors attending a dying patient reported the use of CDS. CDS was more likely when patients were younger or were dying of cancer. Specialists in care of the elderly were least. likely to report the use of CDS; doctors in other hospital specialties were most likely to report its use. CDS was associated with a higher rate of requests from patients or relatives for a hastened death and with a greater incidence of other end-of-life decisions containing some intent to end life by the doctor. Doctors supporting legalization of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide, or who were nonreligious, were more likely to report using CDS. There was palliative care team involvement in half of all CDS cases, and prescription of opioids alone for sedation occurred in one-fifth of the cases but was not reported by specialists in palliative care.
   Conclusion. This study provides baseline data for monitoring future trends in the United Kingdom and highlights the need for a fuller understanding of the circumstances in which CDS occurs in particular care settings.

AB This chapter we focus on the challenges presented in nursing patients who attend an Emergency Room following an incident of self-harm or attempted suicide. The international research literature indicates that similar issues of patient management are found in many countries. We discuss this in relation to the most pressing problems faced by nurses in dealing with the self-harm patient. Throughout, our discussion is informed by our own research in the United Kingdom, where well over 200,000 self-harm patients every year attend hospital accident and emergency departments. We have found indications that certain particularly vulnerable patient groups tend to receive a service in the emergency room that is far from satisfactory. Our discussion focuses on these vulnerable patients, including older citizens and those with mental health problems as well as less visible groups such as those who take premature discharge from the hospital and those who survive an episode of self-injury despite having left a suicide note. The chapter ends with a discussion of the challenges presented by the need to improve the education and training of clinical staff in the emergency room and we make some suggestions for the improvement of services and the direction of future research.

DT Article
ID COMORBIDITY SURVEY REPLICATION; RISK-FACTORS; BIPOLAR DISORDER;
   EPILEPSY; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; UK; PREVENTION; VALIDATION; ALGORITHM; DEATH
AB BACKGROUND
   A previous meta-analysis of data from clinical trials showed an association between antiepileptic drugs and suicidality (suicidal ideation, behavior, or both). We used observational data to examine the association between the use or nonuse of antiepileptic drugs and suicide-related events (attempted suicides and completed suicides) in patients with epilepsy, depression, or bipolar disorder.
   METHODS
   We used data collected as part of the clinical care of patients who were representative of the general population in the United Kingdom to identify patients with epilepsy, depression, or bipolar disorder and to determine whether they received antiepileptic drugs. We estimated the incidence rate of suicide-related events and used logistic regression to compute odds ratios, controlling for confounding factors.
   RESULTS
   In a cohort of 5,130,795 patients, the incidence of suicide-related events per 100,000 person-years was 15.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.6 to 15.5) among patients without epilepsy, depression, bipolar disorder, or antiepileptic-drug treatment, 38.2 (95% CI, 26.3 to 53.7) among patients with epilepsy who did not receive antiepileptic drugs, and 48.2 (95% CI, 39.4 to 58.5) among patients with epilepsy who received antiepileptic drugs. In adjusted analyses, the use of antiepileptic drugs was not associated with an increased risk of suicide-related events among patients with epilepsy (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.98) or bipolar disorder (1.13; 95% CI, 0.35 to 3.61) but was significantly associated with an increased risk among patients with depression (1.65; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.19) and those who did not have epilepsy, depression, or bipolar disorder (2.57; 95% CI, 1.78 to 3.71).
   CONCLUSIONS
   The current use of antiepileptic drugs was not associated with an increased risk of suicide-related events among patients with epilepsy, but it was associated with an increased risk of such events among patients with depression and among those who did not have epilepsy, depression, or bipolar disorder.

   Machine learning; Explainability; Interpretability; Feature reduction;

AB BackgroundIn recent years, the availability of publicly available data related to public health has significantly increased. These data have substantial potential to develop public health policy; however, this requires meaningful and insightful analysis. Our aim is to demonstrate how data analysis techniques can be used to address the issues of data reduction, prediction and explanation using online available public health data, in order to provide a sound basis for informing public health policy.MethodsObservational suicide prevention data were analysed from an existing online United Kingdom national public health database. Multi-collinearity analysis and principal-component analysis were used to reduce correlated data, followed by regression analyses for prediction and explanation of suicide.ResultsMulti-collinearity analysis was effective in reducing the indicator set of predictors by 30% and principal component analysis further reduced the set by 86%. Regression for prediction identified four significant indicator predictors of suicide behaviour (emergency hospital admissions for intentional self-harm, children leaving care, statutory homelessness and self-reported well-being/low happiness) and two main component predictors (relatedness dysfunction, and behavioural problems and mental illness). Regression for explanation identified significant moderation of a well-being predictor (low happiness) of suicide behaviour by a social factor (living alone), thereby supporting existing theory and providing insight beyond the results of regression for prediction. Two independent predictors capturing relatedness needs in social care service delivery were also identified.ConclusionsWe demonstrate the effectiveness of regression techniques in the analysis of online public health data. Regression analysis for prediction and explanation can both be appropriate for public health data analysis for a better understanding of public health outcomes. It is therefore essential to clarify the aim of the analysis (prediction accuracy or theory development) as a basis for choosing the most appropriate model. We apply these techniques to the analysis of suicide data; however, we argue that the analysis presented in this study should be applied to datasets across public health in order to improve the quality of health policy recommendations.

AB This paper summarizes key recent policy and practice developments within general adult mental health services in United Kingdom. The National Service Framework For Mental Health, published in September 1999, provides a national blueprint for mental health services for adults of working age over the next decade. The fundamental principles underlying the framework are outlined, the key stakeholders are identified, and the seven standards are discussed. The standards apply to: mental health promotion, primary-care and access to services, severe mental illness, caring about carers, and preventing suicide. This new national policy is based upon the evidence of cost effective services and treatments. Such services can be described in terms of 5 categories of a Basic Service Profile: outpatient and community services, day services, acute inpatient services, longer-term residential services, and interfaces between services and agencies.

AB Objective. To report on the epidemiology of schizophrenia and other common mental health disorders in the English-speaking Caribbean.
   Methods. The MEDLINE, MEDCARIB and West Indiana electronic databases were searched with the phrases Caribbean AND psychiatry OR mental OR suicide, and items with specific reference to epidemiology were culled and reviewed.
   Results. The age-corrected incidence rate for schizophrenia per 10 000 is 2.09 in Jamaica, 2.2 per 1000 in Trinidad, and 2.92 in Barbados. These rates are lower than the incidence rates reported for white British people, and significantly lower that the 6- to 18-fold higher risk ratio incidence reported for African Caribbeans living in Britain. A comparative diagnostic study carried out in the United Kingdom (UK) suggests that misdiagnosis plays a significant role in this difference. Relatively low incidence figures for affective disorders, anxiety states, suicide and attempted suicide have been reported for Jamaica, Trinidad, and Barbados.
   Discussion. Most published epidemiological studies of Caribbean populations center on schizophrenia, because of the startling findings of a large increase in risk ratios for African Caribbean people living in England compared to the white native British people. The etiological evidence is shifting toward factors of racism and social alienation experienced by black people in the UK, and to misdiagnosis by white British psychiatrists. Studies of the role of colonial enslavement and social engineering raise the etiological possibility of a role for social and structural community organization in the genesis of schizophrenia. The Caribbean thus represents a rich crucible for research in the epidemiology and etiology of mental health disorders.

AB Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and Suicide Bombing have become the headline news for every other day. It is a growing global phenomenon that is happening from Iraq to Afghanistan, Syria to United Kingdom and Spain to Pakistan. An average US soldier in Iraq receives 6 to 23 blast wave shocks over his/her tenure in Iraq. Pakistan has witnessed 120 suicide bombing attacks in last six years. While various attempts have been made to assess the impact of blast overpressure on buildings and animals, little has been done on crowd formation, crowd density and underlying geometry to mitigate the effects. This paper is set to make geometrical recommendations to reduce the casualties in case of such an incident for high value targets, like mosques and army facilities in the frontline countries fighting the global war on terrorism. A virtual simulation tool has been developed which is capable of assessing the impact of crowd formation patterns and their densities on the magnitude of injury and number of casualties during a suicide bombing attack. Results indicated that the worst crowd formation is street (Zig-Zag) where 30% crowd can be dead and 45% can be injured, given typical explosive carrying capacity of a single suicide bomber. Row wise crowd formations was found to be the best for reducing the effectiveness of an attack with 18% crowd in lethal zone and 38% in injury zones. For a typical suicide bombing attack, we can reduce the number of fatalities by 12%, and the number of injuries by 7%. Simulation results were compared and validated by the real-life incidents and found to he in good agreement. Line-of-sight with the attacker, rushing towards the exit, and stampede were found to be the most lethal choices both during and after the attack. These findings, although preliminary, may have implications for emergency response and counter terrorism.

AB Background: Despite an increased awareness of non-binary identity in the current social landscape, the experiences and needs of this heterogeneous community are poorly understood and represented in the research literature. Evidence indicates that social exclusion is not uncommon for individuals expressing a non-binary gender identity, with reflections in the literature that this may in turn have an impact on their psychological wellbeing.
   Aim: As non-binary individuals are increasingly presenting at UK gender identity clinics and requesting medical interventions, the aim of this study was to better understand their experiences and needs.
   Method: Two focus groups were run consisting of eight service users of a National Health Service (NHS) gender identity clinic in the United Kingdom. The transcripts of these focus groups were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Results: Five themes were identified: Invisibility, Managing non-binary gender identity in a binary world, Individuality, Gender dysphoria and Seeking interventions.
   Discussion: Clinical implications are discussed, with the recommendation for an affirmative approach that offers space for the non-binary individual to articulate their desires and come to terms with their identity. This exploration must take into consideration the person's place within a social world that can be transphobic and limited in terms of potential medical interventions. Further research is needed to better understand this marginalised community.

AB Background: Extensive debate surrounds the practice of continuous sedation until death to control refractory symptoms in terminal cancer care. We examined reported practice of United Kingdom, Belgian and Dutch physicians and nurses.
   Methods: Qualitative case studies using interviews.
   Setting: Hospitals, the domestic home and hospices or palliative care units.
   Participants: In all, 57 Physicians and 73 nurses involved in the care of 84 cancer patients.
   Results: UK respondents reported a continuum of practice from the provision of low doses of sedatives to control terminal restlessness to rarely encountered deep sedation. In contrast, Belgian respondents predominantly described the use of deep sedation, emphasizing the importance of responding to the patient's request. Dutch respondents emphasized making an official medical decision informed by the patient's wish and establishing that a refractory symptom was present. Respondents employed rationales that showed different stances towards four key issues: the preservation of consciousness, concerns about the potential hastening of death, whether they perceived continuous sedation until death as an alternative' to euthanasia and whether they sought to follow guidelines or frameworks for practice.
   Conclusion: This qualitative analysis suggests that there is systematic variation in end-of-life care sedation practice and its conceptualization in the United Kingdom, Belgium and the Netherlands.

AB Objective To investigate external-cause mortality among 21 609 Norwegian male military peacekeepers deployed to Lebanon during 1978-1998.
   Methods The cohort was followed from the 1st day of deployment through 2013, and mortality during deployment and post discharge was assessed using SMRs calculated from national rates in Norway. Poisson regression was used to see the effect of high-conflict versus low-conflict exposure.
   Results For the total cohort, external-cause mortality was within expected values during deployment (SMR = 0.80) and post discharge (SMR = 1.05). In the low-conflict exposure group, a lower mortality from all external causes (SMR = 0.77), transport accidents (SMR = 0.55) and accidental poisoning (SMR = 0.53) was seen. The high-conflict exposure group showed an elevated mortality from all external causes (SMR = 1.20), transport accidents (SMR = 1.51) and suicide (SMR = 1.30), but these risks were elevated only during the first 5 years after discharge. This group also showed elevated mortality from all external causes (rate ratio, RR = 1.49), and for transport accidents (RR = 3.30) when compared with the low-conflict exposure group.
   Conclusions Overall external-cause mortality among our peacekeepers was equal to national rates during deployment and post discharge. High-conflict exposure was associated with elevated mortality from all external causes, transport accidents and suicide during the first 5 years after discharge from service.

   CHILDREN; RISK; FLUOXETINE; SERTRALINE
AB Background
   Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are prescribed by general practitioners (GPs) for adolescents. GPs' prescribing patterns for SSRIs changed following warnings issued by United Kingdom and United States drug advisory bodies on the use of antidepressants in children and adolescents in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Recent studies shed further light on the safety profile of SSRIs with adolescents.
   Objective
   To provide a narrative review of the physical and psychiatric side effects of SSRIs as reported by adolescents. To provide GPs with practical advice regarding the prevalence and nature of side effects of SSRIs when prescribed for adolescents.
   Discussion
   The research literature Suggests that adolescents taking SSRIs are at a small, but increased, risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours. The prescribing GP needs to be aware of a number of potential side effects and interactions. Monitoring for common physical side effects and possible emerging suicidal ideas and behaviours, especially early in treatment, is recommended.

AB Objectives: One of the first stages in the development of new clinical decision rules (CDRs) is determination of need. This study examined the clinical priorities of emergency physicians (EPs) working in Australasia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States for the development of future CDRs.
   Methods: The authors administered an e-mail and postal survey to members of the national emergency medicine (EM) associations in Australasia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Results were analyzed via frequency distributions.
   Results: The total response rate was 54.8% (1,150/2,100). The respondents were primarily male (74%), with a mean age of 42.5 years (SD +/- 8), and a mean of 12 years of experience (SD +/- 7). The top 10 clinical priorities (% selected) were: 1) investigation of febrile child < 36 months (62%); 2) identification of central or serious vertigo (42%); 3) lumbar puncture or admission of febrile child < 3 months (41%); 4) imaging for suspected transient ischemic attack (39%); 5) admission for anterior chest pain (37%); 6) computed tomography (CT) angiography for pulmonary embolus (30%); 7) admission for suicide risk (29%); 8) ultrasound for pain or bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy (28%); 9) nonspecific weakness in elders (26%); and 10) CT for abdominal pain (25%). Between study countries, there was consistency in identification of clinical problems, but variation in prioritization.
   Conclusions: This international survey identified the sampled EPs' priorities for the future development of CDRs. The top priority overall was investigation of the febrile child < 36 months. These results will be valuable to researchers for future development of CDRs in EM that are relevant internationally.

ID CO-PROXAMOL; OVERDOSE; PATTERNS; SCOTLAND; SUICIDE; SAFETY; UK
AB The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) is the government body with responsibility for regulating new and existing medicines and medical devices in the United Kingdom. The Yellow Card scheme is a well-established pharmacovigilance system that collects voluntary reports of adverse effects associated with therapeutic drug use. In contrast, data concerning clinical toxicological effects are more poorly characterised. No comparable surveillance processes exist in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in Europe that might allow systematic collection of clinical data and outcomes after drug overdose. Toxicological effects are normally ascertained from individual patient reports or small case series from a few specialised poisons units, so that these data are generally under-represented in post-marketing consideration of risks and benefits. Safety concerns may lead to withdrawal of the Marketing Authorisation or restricted prescribing conditions, which are conveyed to health care professionals by means of safety warnings. These may have a variable impact, and three selected examples are presented to illustrate the complex interaction between drug regulation and clinical toxicology. First, the effects of the withdrawal of rofecoxib in 2004 shows that regulatory responses may reduce the prescribing of drugs across a particular class, and this has resulted in fewer enquiries to Poisons Control Centres regarding all cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors. Secondly, data concerning the impact of safety warnings about antipsychotic medications illustrate that regulatory decisions may have a variable impact due to other factors that influence prescribing, including clinical guidelines, marketing pressures, and lack of alternative safe medications. Finally, the recent withdrawal of co-proxamol serves as an example of how clinical toxicology data can inform the drug regulation process and improve safety by minimising the risk of death associated with overdose. Greater reliance on clinical toxicology data could better inform the drug regulation process, perhaps through coordinated data collection systems that already exist in certain national poisons centres. Routine collection of high quality data concerning the effects of drug overdose could allow a more comprehensive review of risk and benefit by the regulatory authorities.

AB Over the past decade, there has been great interest in both the development and delivery of early intervention in psychosis services in the United Kingdom, supported by national policy and a Policy Implementation Guide (PIG). Despite this, the PIG fails to distinguish the delivery of early intervention services to different population groups. The paper aims to augment available literature with the range of complex issues that practitioners may face when working in rural settings and link this to the development of early intervention services in rural communities. This paper will also outline some of the fundamental factors that challenge delivery of early intervention to individuals with a first episode of psychosis and their families in rural communities. Important key areas for consideration will be highlighted for both the planning and delivery of early intervention to rural communities.

LA English
DT Article
DE altruism; Bauman; Durkheim; liquid modernity; martyr; suicide bomber
AB Liquid life is the name that Zygmunt Bauman gives to the experience of life within 'liquid modernity' - a form of modernity in which social frameworks and institutions experience a process of accelerating liquefaction. On the basis of a narrative analysis of martyr videos recorded by the 7 July 2005 London bombers and eight men who stood trial in the United Kingdom for planning to bomb transatlantic airliners with home-made liquid explosives, a core set of altruistic motivations were found to emerge. Liquid modernity appears to have no space for martyrs who reject the instant survival-and-gratification consumerism for other longer term communal goals. Such a stance is incomprehensible and irrational for the liquid moderns. Fundamentalism rooted in a form of Durkheimian altruism provides confidence, trust and self-assurance to people who would otherwise be stripped of human dignity and humiliated in the face of consumer revelry.

AB Objective: To study the prospective link between involvement in bullying (bully, victim, bully/victim), and subsequent suicide ideation and suicidal/self-injurious behavior, in preadolescent children in the United Kingdom. Method: A total of 6,043 children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort were assessed to ascertain involvement in bullying between 4 and 10 years and suicide related behavior at 11.7 years. Results: Peer victimization (victim, bully/victim) was significantly associated with suicide ideation and suicidal/self-injurious behavior after adjusting for confounders. Bully/victims were at heightened risk for suicide ideation (odds ratio [OR]; 95% confidence interval [CI]): child report at 8 years (OR = 2.84; CI = 1.81-4.45); child report at 10 years (OR = 3.20; CI = 2.07-4.95); mother report (OR = 2.71; CI = 1.81-4.05); teacher report (OR = 2.79; CI = 1.62-4.81), as were chronic victims: child report (OR = 3.26; CI = 2.24-4.75); mother report (OR = 2.49; CI = 1.64-3.79); teacher report (OR = 5.99; CI = 2.79-12.88). Similarly, bully/victims were at heightened risk for suicidal/self-injurious behavior: child report at 8 years (OR = 2.67; CI = 1.66-4.29); child report at 10 years (OR = 3.34; CI = 2.17-5.15); mother report (OR = 2.09; CI = CI = 1.36-3.20); teacher report (OR = 2.44, CI = 1.39-4.30); as were chronic victims: child report (OR = 4.10; CI = 2.76-6.08); mother report (OR = 1.91; 1.22-2.99); teacher report PR = 3.26; CI = 1.38-7.68). Pure bullies had increased risk of suicide ideation according to child report at age 8 years (OR = 3.60; CI = 1.46-8.84), suicidal/self-injurious behavior according to child report at age 8 years (OR = 3.02; CI = 1.14-8.02), and teacher report (OR = 1.84; CI = 1.09-3.10). Conclusions: Children involved in bullying, in any role, and especially bully/victims and chronic victims, are at increased risk for suicide ideation and suicidal/self-injurious behavior in preadolescence.

TI Erotomania vs. Amnesia: The Metaphor of Disease in Alasdair Gray's
   <i>Poor Things</i>
SO FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES
LA Chinese
DT Article
DE Poor Things; disease; erotomania; amnesia; Scotland
AB Erotomania and amnesia are the two dominant metaphors of disease in Alasdair Gray's Poor Things (1992), which stand for different attitudes towards women in Victorian age. The freedom-pursuing Bella is diagnosed with erotomania by his former husband's private doctor. She chooses to commit suicide for she cannot accept the "treatment". Godwin Baxter resuscitates the drowned Bella through the transplanting of her unborn baby's brain and diagnoses her choice of remarriage as the aftermath of her amnesia. Erotomania is a metaphor of disease imposed upon a free woman in Victorian age, whereas amnesia is a therapy to escape from the social restraints. The full name of Bella has the connotation of "beautiful Scotland" and Scotland is often feminized in English historical narrative; therefore, Bella's fate may be as well taken as Scotland's fate in the United Kingdom.

DT Article
ID TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS; DEATH PRACTICES; EUTHANASIA; DESIRE;
   DEPRESSION; CONSULTATION; VIEWS
AB Background: Physician-assisted suicide (PAS) is an important subject of the public debate. So far, legal regulations exist in the Netherlands, Belgium and in Oregon (USA). This review reports results of nine empirical studies from Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the U.S. which examine attitudes of psychiatrists toward PAS. Results: The approval of PAS by psychiatrists varies between the four countries (40-69%). Comparisons with the attitudes of other physicians show a greater agreement among the psychiatrists. A psychiatric examination in order to evaluate competence even in patients with severe somatic illness was advocated by the majority of psychiatrists. Conclusion: Psychiatrists' attitudes toward PAS vary and are compared with other medical specialities, as well as in different legal and cultural contexts. Therefore, and because of missing empirical studies, results can not be transferred into the context of German speaking countries easily. So far, no acknowledged criteria for the assessment of competence exist. Further empirical research is needed on German psychiatrists' attitudes towards PAS and on competence assessment at the end of life. It remains an open question how legal changes and future developments of palliative care will influence attitudes toward PAS.

AB Background: Studies show higher lifetime prevalence of suicidality in individuals with pathological gambling. However, less is known about the relationship between pathological gambling and current suicidal ideation.
   Objectives: We investigated socio-demographic, clinical and gambling-related variables associated with suicidality in treatment-seeking individuals.
   Methods: Bivariate analyses and logistic regression models were generated on data from 903 individuals to identify measures associated with aspects of suicidality.
   Results: Forty-six percent of patients reported current suicidal ideation. People with current suicidal thoughts were more likely to report greater problem-gambling severity (p < 0.001), depression (p < 0.001) and anxiety (p < 0.001) compared to those without suicidality. Logistic regression models suggested that past suicidal ideation (p < 0.001) and higher anxiety (p < 0.05) may be predictive factors of current suicidality.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the severity of anxiety disorder, along with a lifetime history of suicidal ideation, may help to identify treatment-seeking individuals with pathological gambling with a higher risk of suicidality, highlighting the importance of assessing suicidal ideation in clinical settings.

DT Article
ID OXFORD; HARM; ADOLESCENTS; EDINBURGH; EFFICACY; SUICIDE; PEOPLE; TRENDS
AB A large (n = 14,892) consecutive sample of deliberate self-harm (attempted suicide) patients who presented to a general hospital in the United Kingdom during a 23-year study period was examined (over two consecutive time periods) in order to compare the characteristics of those who used self-cutting (n = 428) and those who self-poisoned (n = 11,065). Patients who used different methods on other occasions, or were not assessed by the psychiatric service, were excluded. In the first time period (January 1976-June 1988), the self-cutters were distinguished from the self-poisoners by more often being male, single, not employed, and having a history of previous deliberate self-harm. In the second time period (July 1988-December 1998) the self-cutters were again distinguished by more often being male and having a history of previous deliberate self-harm, but also by being more likely to live alone, misuse alcohol, and have low suicidal intent scores. The finding of an excess of males among the self-cutters is contrary to the impression in the literature that self-cutting presentations to general hospitals more often involve females. It also indicates that the treatment needs of those who deliberately cut themselves are likely to differ from those of self-poisoners.

AB Objectives: To investigate whether physicians' prescribing preferences were valid instrumental variables for the antidepressant prescriptions they issued to their patients.
   Study Design and Setting: We investigated whether physicians' previous prescriptions of (1) tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) vs. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and (2) paroxetine vs. other SSRIs were valid instruments. We investigated whether the instrumental variable assumptions are likely to hold and whether TCAs (vs. SSRIs) were associated with hospital admission for self-harm or death by suicide using both conventional and instrumental variable regressions. The setting for the study was general practices in the United Kingdom.
   Results: Prior prescriptions were strongly associated with actual prescriptions: physicians who previously prescribed TCAs were 14.9 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.4, 15.4) more likely to prescribe TCAs, and those who previously prescribed paroxetine were 27.7 percentage points (95% CI, 26.7, 28.8) more likely to prescribe paroxetine, to their next patient. Physicians' previous prescriptions were less strongly associated with patients' baseline characteristics than actual prescriptions. We found no evidence that the estimated association of TCAs with self-harm/suicide using instrumental variable regression differed from conventional regression estimates (P-value = 0.45).
   Conclusion: The main instrumental variable assumptions held, suggesting that physicians' prescribing preferences are valid instruments for evaluating the short-term effects of antidepressants. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study estimates the frequency of different medical end-of-life decisions (ELDs) made in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2007-2008, comparing these with 2004. Postal survey was carried out with 8857 medical practitioners, of whom 3733 (42%) practitioners replied, with 2869 having attended a person who died in the previous year. The proportion of UK deaths involving (1) voluntary euthanasia (0.21%; CI: 0-0.52), (2) physician-assisted suicide (0.00%) and (3) ending of life without an explicit request from the patient (0.30%; CI: 0-0.60) is low. Better questions about ELDs showed both non-treatment decisions (21.8%; CI: 19.0-24.5) and double effect measures (17.1%; CI: 14.6-19.6) to be much less common than suggested in earlier estimates, rarely involving intent to end life or being judged to have shortened life by more than a day. Continuous deep sedation (16.5%; CI: 14.3-18.7) is relatively common in UK medical practice, particularly in hospitals, home care settings and with younger patients. Further findings about the distribution of ELDs across subgroups are also reported. Survey research in this area requires careful control over question wording if valid estimates and comparisons of the prevalence of ELDs are to be made. The high rate of sedation compared with other countries may be a cause for concern. Palliative Medicine (2009); 23: 198-204

AB Background Self-harm is a major healthcare problem in the United Kingdom, but monitoring of hospital presentations has largely been done separately in single centres. Multicentre monitoring of self-harm has been established as a result of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy for England. Method Data on self-harm presentations to general hospitals in Oxford (one hospital), Manchester (three hospitals) and Leeds (two hospitals), collected through monitoring systems in each centre, were analysed for the 18-month period March 2000 to August 2001. Results The findings were based on 7344 persons who presented following 10,498 episodes of self-harm. Gender and age patterns were similar in the three centres, 57.0% of patients being female and two-thirds (62.9%) under 35 years of age. The largest numbers by age groups were 15-19 year-old females and 20-24 year-old males. The female to male ratio decreased with age. Rates of self-harm were higher in Manchester than Oxford or Leeds, in keeping with local suicide rates. The proportion of patients receiving a specialist psychosocial assessment varied between centres and was strongly associated with admission to the general hospital. Approximately 80% of self-harm involved self-poisoning. Overdoses of paracetamol, the most frequent method, were more common in younger age groups, antidepressants in middle age groups, and benzodiazepines and sedatives in older age groups. Alcohol was involved in more than half (54.9%) of assessed episodes. The most common time of presentation to hospital was between 10 pm and 2 am. Conclusions Multicentre monitoring of self-harm in England has demonstrated similar overall patterns of self-harm in Oxford, Manchester and Leeds, with some differences reflecting local suicide rates. Diurnal variation in time of presentation to hospital and the need for assessment of non-admitted patients have implications for service provision.

ID BUSINESS-CYCLE; UNITED-STATES; UNEMPLOYMENT; SUICIDE
AB Thinking in France on relations between crime rate trend and evolution of socio-economic context over time is underdeveloped. Recent studies in the United Kingdom suggest that the business cycle influences fluctuations in both property offenses and violent crime. Whereas pre-1970 research in the United States only rarely pointed up a direct link between crime rate and unemployment, post-1970 American studies are dominated by demonstrations of a direct correlation between the two. In this article, analysis of trends in unemployment, prices and wages, marriage among men, and schooling leads to an interpretation of delinquency and crime over the long term in which it is affirmed that an increase in opportunity, such as that attested to by increased consumer prices and wages over time, has a more pronounced role in the strong growth period of the cycle and influences property offenses more than violent crime, and that unemployment among young people without educational degrees is a factor working in favor of both theft and violent crime. This phenomenon was partially masked in periods where it was common to remain in the school system, such as early in the last decade of the twentieth century in France. Lastly, the fact that starting in the early 1980s fewer young people settled in couples and, more generally, the tension in relations between the sexes may also have worked to favor delinquency.

AB This paper will consider the issues that affect UK medical responses to terrorism. It will place the medical response to terrorism in the context of the UK response to any major incident, and contrast responses to terrorist attacks with responses to other medical emergencies in the UK. In doing this, it will focus specifically on the elements within such responses that are unique to terrorism.
   The first part of this paper will outline the legislation and guidance covering major incident response in the UK at the national, regional and local level. The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 will be considered in its context as the national framework for managing major incidents, and the national guidelines of the UK Government's Department of Health, the National Health Service (NHS) 1 and the Health Protection Agency (HPA) 2 will also be discussed. At the regional level, London will be taken as a case study, outlining the roles of the London Resilience Team, the London Emergency Services Liaison Panel (LESLP) and the London Ambulance Service (LAS) in the medical response to terrorism. At the local level, the plans and response procedures relating to individual hospitals will also be examined.
   The paper will then discuss how the medical response to terrorist incidents differs from the response to other major incidents, looking in particular at the number of casualties; the type of injuries; the command and control challenges of dealing with multiple incident sites; and the need to consider that the incident site is also a crime scene. Particular consideration will be given in this section to planning for and responding to a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) attack.
   The second part of the paper will explore the UK medical response to terrorism in more detail by focusing on two recent case studies: the 7 July 2005 suicide bombings on London's public transport system and the poisoning of the former Soviet agent Alexander Litvinenko with the radiological isotope Polonium-210 in November 2006. These case studies will be used to identify specific challenges that arose during these responses. The unique challenges presented by each case will be directly contrasted with those of the other to show that a single medical response framework cannot deal with all terrorist incidents: different types of attack present different challenges that require different responses.
   The paper will also consider the long-term psychological effects of terrorism and the healthcare provisions that need to be made before, during and after the incident, including the need for a robust system for recording those who may require follow-up health and psychiatric care to enable the availability of this care to be communicated to them.

ID CO-PROXAMOL; PHARMACIES; SUICIDE; MARKET
AB Online pharmacies are increasingly common, and some of them have been reported to inappropriately supply prescription-only medicines. Dextropropoxyphene- containing compounds are addictive and frequently implicated in fatalities occurring in the United Kingdom. We aimed here at assessing the online availability of dextropropoxyphene for purchase over a time-span of 2 years (September 2003-August 2005). A Google T search was run in September 2003 using different sets of keywords and the first 100 links identified were thoroughly assessed. In March 2005, the same e-pharmacies websites identified at baseline were accessed again and a Google T search using the same sets of keywords previously used was run as well. Furthermore, a specialized search with Froogle (TM) was run both in March and August 2005. Although an illegal practice in most countries, a number of websites willing to sell the compound internationally were identified at the time of the baseline search. In March 2005, the Google T search for vending websites identified 361,000 links, compared with 40,000 18 months before. Only half of dextropropoxyphene vending e-pharmacies were still active by March 2005 but, at that point in time, access to Froogle (TM) apparently facilitated the task of online dextropropoxyphene purchase. By August 2005, however, the same Froogle T search identified only one link aimed at online dextropropoxyphene shopping. In the United Kingdom, dextropropoxyphene-related products will be withdrawn later this year but this may have only limited impact on the availability of the compound. The emergence of Internet as an unregulated source of controlled substances is an important development that may have significant public health implications. This issue needs to be dealt with at both international and national level.

AB Aims. This paper is a report of a study that compared relevant attitudinal dimensions of Registered Nurses and nursing aides working within a Young Offenders Institute and two young peoples forensic units in the United Kingdom towards young people in their care who self-harm. Background. Nurses caring for young people within secure environments may engage at some point with patients who harm themselves. These staff often experience strong negative emotional reactions which can lead to antipathy and alienation. Methods. Forty seven Registered Nurses and 22 nursing aides completed the Self-Harm Antipathy Scale, which consists of 30 attitudinal self-report items. The data were collected between June 2008 and December 2008, and analysed using spss version 17. Results. Results displayed that age per se, length of service with self-harming clients, and whether the participant was a Registered Nurse or nursing aide, and number of self-harming clients worked with did not influence the Self-Harm Antipathy Scale score or any of its component sub-scores. However, field of nursing the nurse was registered under, previous study of self-harm, year first registered and gender showed significant effects. Conclusions. Given that responses reflect a degree of both empathy and apathy it seems that there is a need to promote greater therapeutic alliances and communication; for example, the use of positive regard to help reduce the incidence of labelling and the negative effects this has upon relationships. There is a significant need for nursing staff working with young people who self-harm to have access to relevant educational programmes. A focus on harm minimization could be key areas for further development.

ID AVAILABILITY; OVERDOSE; SIZE; SCOTLAND; SUICIDE; IMPACT; UK
AB Background Paracetamol poisoning is implicated in about 150-200 poisoning deaths per year in England and Wales. We review previous studies assessing the effectiveness of regulations introduced in 1998 to restrict sales of paracetamol and reduce paracetamol poisoning.
   Methods We searched the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL, HIMIC, COCH, APC, CENTRAL and DARE. English language publications between 1998 and 2003 were included. Studies were included if they took place in the United Kingdom and assessed changes in any aspect of paracetamol poisoning following the introduction of the 1998 regulations.
   Results Twelve studies were identified, which examined several different outcomes. Three studies examined admissions to liver transplant units; all reported reductions. Eight studies evaluated severity of paracetamol poisoning; three reported reductions but five did not. Five out of six studies reported reductions in hospital admissions. One study reported reduced mortality in England and Wales after 1 year while another found no difference in Scotland 2 years after the regulations were introduced. Two studies observed a significant reduction in over-the-counter sales. Studies suffered from several limitations including short follow-up periods, no case definition for paracetamol poisoning and lack of comparison groups.
   Conclusions The limitations of these studies makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions. They do, however, suggest that the 1998 regulations may have been associated with reduced admissions to liver units and liver transplants, reduced hospital attendance due to paracetamol poisoning and reduced sales of paracetamol. Further research is needed to fully evaluate the impact of the 1998 regulations. In the future, formal evaluation of the impact of similar interventions should be an integral part of policy formation.

AB Background: Establishing patient safety priorities in psychiatry has received less international attention than in other areas of health care. This study aimed to identify safety issues as described by people in the United Kingdom identifying as mental health service users, carers and professionals.
   Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was distributed via social media. Identified safety issues were mapped onto the Yorkshire Contributory Factors Framework (YCFF) which categorizes factors that contribute to patient safety incidents in general hospital settings. Service user and carer responses were described separately from professional responses using descriptive statistics.
   Results: One hundred and eighty-five responses from 95 service users and carers and 90 professionals were analysed. Seventy different safety issues were identified. These were mapped onto the 17 existing categories of the YCFF and two additional categories created to form the YCFF-MH. Most frequently identified issues were as follows: "Individual characteristics" (of staff) which included competence and listening skills; "Service process" that contained concerns about waiting times; "Management of staff and staffing levels" dominated by staffing levels; and "External policy context" which included the overall resourcing of services. Professionals identified staffing levels and inadequate community provision more frequently than service users and carers, who in turn identified crisis care more frequently.
   Conclusions: This study updates knowledge on stakeholder perceived safety issues across mental health care. It shows a far broader range of issues relating to safety than has previously been described. The YCFF was successfully modified to describe these issues and areas for further coproduced research are suggested.

AB Objective. - The review aims to identify the extent and nature of research on mental disorders and their care in immigrant populations in three major European countries with high levels of immigration, i.e. Germany, Italy, United Kingdom (UK).
   Method. - Peer-reviewed publications on the subject from the three countries between 1996 and 2004 were analyzed. The research questions addressed, the methods used, and the results obtained were assessed.
   Results. - Thirteen papers reporting empirical studies were found from Germany, four from Italy and 95 front the UK. Studies addressed a range of research questions and most frequently assessed rates of service utilization in different immigrant groups, The most consistent finding is a higher rate of hospital admissions for Afro-Caribbean patients in the UK. Many studies had serious methodological shortcomings with low sample sizes and unspecified inclusion criteria.
   Discussion. - Despite large scale immigration in each of the three studied countries. the numbers of relevant research publications vary greatly with a relatively high level of empirical research in the UK. Possible reasons for this are it generally stronger Culture of mental health service research and a higher number of researchers who are themselves front immigrant backgrounds ill the UK,
   Conclusion. - Overall the evidence base to guide the development of mental health services for immigrant populations appears limited. Future research requires appropriate funding, should be of sufficient methodological quality and may benefit from collaboration across Europe. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

ID COTININE
AB Tobacco is one of the most easily accessible and commonly abused drugs world-wide. Nicotine, one of its principal constituents, can cause serious or fatal overdoses. Whilst the deliberate ingestion of this substance appears to be relatively rare, often the important signs of its consumption are not recognised, sometimes with fatal results. Here we describe two cases of intentional fatal ingestion of nicotine. The nicotine was extracted from tobacco using instructions available on the Internet. The first case involved a male aged 19 who died in 2008. The post-mortem blood and urine levels of nicotine were 5.5 mg/l and >80 mg/l respectively; the blood level is in line with the generally recognised fatal level of >5 mg/l. The levels of nicotine's mainmetabolite, cotinine, for this case were 2.5 mg/l and 7.9 mg/l for blood and urine respectively. A comparative case in 1999 involved a 32 year-old male. The level of post-mortem nicotine in his blood was 1.0 mg/l. These are believed to be the first UK suicides by nicotine using instructions from the Internet reported in the literature. Information that nicotine was the agent responsible only became apparent some time after death. There may be more deaths due to this cause that go unrecognised because quantification of nicotine and cotinine levels is not often conducted, due to the wide prevalence of smoking. It is important that all evidence at the scene of a sudden and unexplained death is carefully evaluated, including potential clues on PCs and lap-tops. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB This article aims to increase accuracy in estimating the postmortem submersion interval (PMSI) for bodies recovered from rivers in the United Kingdom. Data were collected from closed case files, crime scene reports, and autopsy files concerning bodies recovered over a 15-year period from the River Clyde, Scotland, and the River Mersey and canals in northwest England. One hundred and eighty-seven cases met the study criteria and were scored by quantifying the overall amount of decomposition observed in each case. Statistical analysis showed that the duration of a body's submergence in water and the temperatures to which it was exposed, as measured in accumulated degree days (ADD), had a significant effect on the decay process. Further analysis indicated that there were no significant differences in decomposition between the waterways. By combining the data from all study samples, it was possible to produce a single linear regression model for predicting ADD from observed decomposition.

AB The present study explored the differences between adult male prisoners with and without a history of suicidal behavior on adult attachment dimensions, coping styles, and hopelessness. The role of adult attachment and coping styles as predictors of hopelessness was also explored. The sample included 206 male prisoners from two Category B prisons in the United Kingdom. The Attachment Styles Questionnaire (ASQ), Coping Styles Questionnaire (CSQ-3), and Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) measured attachment, coping, and hopelessness. Prisoners with a history of suicidal behavior reported significantly higher levels of attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance, and maladaptive coping strategies. Elevated levels of attachment difficulties and maladaptive coping styles were associated with heightened levels of hopelessness. Emotional coping strategies mediated the influence of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance on hopelessness. The study highlights the potential utility of adult attachment conceptualizations and coping skills interventions with prisoners at risk of suicidal behavior.

AB The Italian mental health care is based on Law 180 (it. Legge 180), also called Legge Basaglia, from the name of the author of the reform, Franco Basaglia. It was adopted on May 13th 1978. The new legislation resulted from the actions of a strong anti-psychiatric movement and it brought about a major change in the organization of psychiatric care. The reform and its consequences were widely studied by the researchers, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The authors point out many successes of the reform, especially in its beginning. They seek the sources of its failure in a faulty and incomplete implementation. Legge Basaglia completely changed the structure of mental health care in Italy, finally bringing psychiatry back to medicine and the general hospitals, as well as promoting community-based psychiatry. Deinstitutionalization in Italy was not related to an increase in compulsory psychiatric hospitalizations, suicide attempts by the mentally ill, nor did it raise the number of crimes committed by them. It also did not cause common trans-institutionalization, with the transfer of patients to the private sector, as predicted by its opponents.

ID FATALITY
AB The mandate of a formal child death review (CDR) system is to advance understanding of how and why children die, to improve child health and safety, and to prevent deaths and injuries in the future. Areas in which CDR has provided valuable information and/or intervention include sudden death in infancy, unintentional injuries (the leading cause of death in Canadian children and youth one to 19 years of age), suicide in youth, and deaths due to homicide or child maltreatment. When collected systematically using common definitions, information regarding deaths in children and youth can help with understanding the scope of problems. Information about the context of a death can inform potential prevention or intervention activities. CDR can improve medical and mental health best practices, child welfare policies and procedures, and legislation and education relevant to public health and safety. In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, CDR processes are mandated by legislation. In Canada, death review teams have diverse structures and functions, and the CDR system is less well developed. The present statement addresses the need for formal, organized child and youth death review in Canada to help strengthen and systemize injury and death prevention efforts.

TI Six-Year Follow-Up of Impact of Co-proxamol Withdrawal in England and
   Wales on Prescribing and Deaths: Time-Series Study
SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-KINGDOM; SUICIDE; LEGISLATION; POISONINGS; HEALTH; UK
AB Background: The analgesic co-proxamol (paracetamol/dextropropoxyphene combination) has been widely involved in fatal poisoning. Concerns about its safety/effectiveness profile and widespread use for suicidal poisoning prompted its withdrawal in the UK in 2005, with partial withdrawal between 2005 and 2007, and full withdrawal in 2008. Our objective in this study was to assess the association between co-proxamol withdrawal and prescribing and deaths in England and Wales in 2005-2010 compared with 1998-2004, including estimation of possible substitution effects by other analgesics.
   Methods and Findings: We obtained prescribing data from the NHS Health and Social Care Information Centre (England) and Prescribing Services Partneriaeth Cydwasanaethau GIG Cymru (Wales), and mortality data from the Office for National Statistics. We carried out an interrupted time-series analysis of prescribing and deaths (suicide, open verdicts, accidental poisonings) involving single analgesics. The reduction in prescribing of co-proxamol following its withdrawal in 2005 was accompanied by increases in prescribing of several other analgesics (co-codamol, paracetamol, codeine, co-dydramol, tramadol, oxycodone, and morphine) during 2005-2010 compared with 1998-2004. These changes were associated with major reductions in deaths due to poisoning with co-proxamol receiving verdicts of suicide and undetermined cause of -21 deaths (95% CI -34 to -8) per quarter, equating to approximately 500 fewer suicide deaths (-61%) over the 6 years 2005-2010, and -25 deaths (95% CI -38 to -12) per quarter, equating to 600 fewer deaths (-62%) when accidental poisoning deaths were included. There was little observed change in deaths involving other analgesics, apart from an increase in oxycodone poisonings, but numbers were small. Limitations were that the study was based on deaths involving single drugs alone and changes in deaths involving prescribed morphine could not be assessed.
   Conclusions: During the 6 years following the withdrawal of co-proxamol in the UK, there was a major reduction in poisoning deaths involving this drug, without apparent significant increase in deaths involving other analgesics.

AB Background: The aim of the study was to compare the hospital management and direct costs of self-poisoning in six United Kingdom hospitals and to investigate whether hospital management influences outcome. Method: This was a prospective descriptive study carried out at three teaching hospitals and three district general hospitals in North West England on adults (aged 16 or over) presenting to the study centres with deliberate self-poisoning over a 5-month period. Data were based on demographic and clinical characteristics, management of the current episode, direct costs and repetition of self-poisoning within 12 weeks of index episode. Results: There were 1778 episodes of selfpoisoning during the study period. There were marked differences in management between centres. There was a fivefold difference in the rate of admission to a medical bed (16.5%-81.3%), and a twofold difference in the rate of psychosocial assessment (28.5%-57.7%). These differences remained after adjustment for demographic and clinical factors. Hospital costs per episode varied from pound228 to pound422 and repetition rate ranged from 10% to 16%. Psychosocial assessment was associated with a twofold reduction in the risk of repetition. Conclusions: The marked variability of services for self-poisoning continue. It seems likely that this is having a detrimental effect on patient outcomes. Large scale intervention studies are required to inform both clinical practice and service provision.

AB Background: Patients admitted to hospital because of self-harm should receive psychosocial assessment before discharge. In practice many of these assessments in the United Kingdom and elsewhere are undertaken by trainee rather than specialist psychiatrists. Aims: To compare psychosocial assessments, aftercare, and the pattern of non-fatal repetition for patients admitted to general hospital after self-harm: comparing assessments carried out by trainee psychiatrists, allocated to the task alongside other duties on a roster, or by mental health nurses with a designated role in self-harm services. Methods: Arrangements for aftercare and rates of non-fatal repetition of self-harm in 787 consecutive psychosocial assessments in a large UK city were compared, according to whether the assessments were carried out by trainee psychiatrists or mental health nurses. Results: Compared with nurses, psychiatrists were much more likely to arrange psychiatric admission or outpatient follow-up. Nurses more often pointed people towards voluntary sector help - such as drug, alcohol or relationship counselling. Repetition of self-harm was equally common among those assessed by nurses or psychiatrists (33%; hazard ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.2). Conclusions: Despite making fewer aftercare arrangements that involved statutory mental health care services, psychosocial assessment by mental health nurses showed no sign of detrimental effects on repetition of self-harm.

AB Data concerning factors associated with mortality among heroin users under methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) in the Han Chinese population are limited. This study examined mortality risk among heroin users after seeking treatment with methadone in a catchment area using a cohort of 1616 Taiwanese heroin users between October 2006 and December 2008. During the study period, 26 (1.6%) people died, with an all-cause mortality rate per 100 person years of 3.42. The primary cause of death among our patients was accidents, followed by suicide and drug overdose. Older age, HIV infection, psychiatric treatment history, and alcohol abuse/dependence were risk factors for all-cause mortality; remaining on MMT was protective for survival. Our findings suggest that although mortality is mainly associated with medical and psychiatric comorbidities, continuing with the MMT program is still an important predictor for survival.

AB Using two new scales, this study examined beliefs in genetic determinism and attitudes towards psychiatric genetic research in student samples from Austria, Malaysia, Romania, and the United Kingdom. For both constructs, effects of culture were detectable, whereas those related to key demographics were either small and inconsistent across samples (political orientation and religiosity) or zero (sex and age). judged from factorial dimensionality and internal consistency, the psychometric properties of both scales were satisfactory. Belief in genetic determinism had lower prevalence and corresponded only modestly to positive attitudes towards psychiatric genetic research which had higher prevalence. The correlations of both constructs with a preference of inequality among social groups (social dominance orientation) were modest and inconsistent across samples. Both scales appear appropriate for cross-cultural applications, in particular for research into lay theories and public perceptions regarding genetic vs environmental effects on human behavior, mental disorders, and behavioral and psychiatric genetic research related to these.

AB Background Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) such as physical and emotional abuse are strongly associated with self-harm, but mechanisms underlying this relationship are unclear. Inflammation has been linked to both the experience of ACEs and self-harm or suicide in prior research. This is the first study to examine whether inflammatory markers mediate the association between exposure to ACEs and self-harm. Methods Participants were 4,308 young people from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a population-based birth cohort in the United Kingdom. A structural equation modelling approach was used to fit a mediation model with the number of ACEs experienced between ages 0 and 9 years old (yo), levels of the inflammatory markers interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein measured at 9.5 yo, and self-harm reported at 16 yo. Results The mean number of ACEs young people experienced was 1.41 (SE 0.03). Higher ACE scores were associated with an increased risk of self-harm at 16 yo (direct effect relative risk (RR) per additional ACE 1.11, 95% CI 1.05, 1.18, p < 0.001). We did not find evidence of an indirect effect of ACEs on self-harm via inflammation (RR 1.00, 95% CI 1.00, 1.01, p = 0.38). Conclusions Young people who have been exposed to ACEs are a group at high risk of self-harm. The association between ACEs and self-harm does not appear to be mediated by an inflammatory process in childhood, as indexed by peripheral levels of circulating inflammatory markers measured in childhood. Further research is needed to identify alternative psychological and biological mechanisms underlying this relationship.

AB Natural experimental studies are often recommended as a way of understanding the health impact of policies and other large scale interventions. Although they have certain advantages over planned experiments, and may be the only option when it is impossible to manipulate exposure to the intervention, natural experimental studies are more susceptible to bias. This paper introduces new guidance from the Medical Research Council to help researchers and users, funders and publishers of research evidence make the best use of natural experimental approaches to evaluating population health interventions. The guidance emphasises that natural experiments can provide convincing evidence of impact even when effects are small or take time to appear. However, a good understanding is needed of the process determining exposure to the intervention, and careful choice and combination of methods, testing of assumptions and transparent reporting is vital. More could be learnt from natural experiments in future as experience of promising but lesser used methods accumulates.

AB Studies assessing premature mortality in people with severe mental illness (SMI) are usually based in one setting, hospital (secondary care inpatients and/or outpatients) or community (primary care). This may lead to ascertainment bias. This study aimed to estimate standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) for all-cause and cause-specific mortality in people with SMI drawn from linked primary and secondary care populations compared to the general population. SMRs were calculated using the indirect method for a United Kingdom population of almost four million between 2004 and 2013. The all-cause SMR was higher in the cohort identified from secondary care hospital admissions (SMR: 2.9; 95% CI: 2.8-3.0) than from primary care (SMR: 2.2; 95% CI: 2.1-2.3) when compared to the general population. The SMR for the combined cohort was 2.6 (95% CI: 2.5-2.6). Cause specific SMRs in the combined cohort were particularly elevated in those with SMI relative to the general population for ill-defined and unknown causes, suicide, substance abuse, Parkinson's disease, accidents, dementia, infections and respiratory disorders (particularly pneumonia), and Alzheimer's disease. Solely hospital admission based studies, which have dominated the literature hitherto, somewhat over-estimate premature mortality in those with SMI. People with SMI are more likely to die by ill-defined and unknown causes, suicide and other less common and often under-reported causes. Comprehensive characterisation of mortality is important to inform policy and practice and to discriminate settings to allow for proportionate interventions to address this health injustice.

DT Article
ID BUSINESS-CYCLE; UNITED-STATES; UNEMPLOYMENT; SUICIDE
AB Reflection on the relations between temporal evolution of criminality and the evolution of the socioeconomic situation is rather rough at the present time in France. In the United Kingdom. recent studies suggest that the economic cycle influences at the same time fluctuations in crimes on property, and fluctuations in crimes on people, In the USA, if before 1970 it is rarely said that there is a direct link between the criminality rate and unemployment, there is however a direct correlation which dominates in studies after 1970. The analysis of temporal evolution in unemployment, prices and salaries, in the male marriage rate and schooling put forward an interpretation of long-term delinquency and crime. The idea becomes apparent that the increase in opportunities, indicated by en evolution in consumption prices and in salaries, plays a more marked role during a period of sharp growth and has a stronger influence on predation than on violence, that the unemployment of unqualified young people is a factor which favours both delinquency for appropriation and violence. This phenomenon is masked partially in the periods where keeping young people in the school system was in full action, during the last decade of the 20th century, Finally. a reduction in the number of couples setting up. and more generally the tension in relations between sexes. could also have encouraged delinquency from the beginning of the 1980s.

AB High-profile child murders lead parents to fear for their childrens safety, but perception of risk is often at variance with reality. We explore the numbers of potential Extra-familial child homicide assailants in the United Kingdom and estimate their actual murder rate to determine risk levels. A South of England study, equivalent to a 4 per cent sample of the UK population, of a decade of consecutive child homicides identified the characteristics of child homicide assailants, finding that the most frequent assailantsthe Intra-familialwere very different from Extra-familial assailants. Extra-familial killers were all males, aged nineteen to forty-two, with convictions for Violent-Multi-Criminal-Child-Sex-Abuse (VMCCSA) offences and Multi-Criminal-Child-Sex-Abuse (MCCSA), whose victims were aged seven-plus years. Projecting these characteristics onto the male UK population enables us to estimate the numbers of potential UK Extra-familial assailants, which are set against known UK child (five to fourteen) homicides (WHO, 2005). To account for any hidden child homicides, deaths in the undetermined violent death category, designated Other External Cause (OEC), are calculated to provide a maximum child homicide rate. There were potentially 912 VMCCSA and 886 MCCSA Extra-familial offenders in the United Kingdom, who could be responsible for the WHO-reported UK three-year average of Extra-family fifteen child homicide and seventeen OEC deaths per annum; a homicide rate of 12,061 per million (pm) for VMCCSA and 3,386 pm for MCSA, which is 1.21 and 0.34 per cent; however, the VMCCSA homicide rate was 403 times greater than the all children accident and cancer death rates. Though the vast majority of these potential assailants did not kill, comparatively, they are extremely dangerous. Practice and ethical issues are debated, which considers active outreach for the treatable to possible reviewable custodial sentences for the VMCCSA.

DT Editorial Material; Book Chapter
AB Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition triggered by seeing or experiencing an event that caused or threatened serious harm or death (National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), 2007. http://www.nimh.nih. gov/health/publications/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-research-fact-sheet/index. shtml; Mayo Clinic, 2011. http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/post-traumaticstress- disorder/DS00246). PTSD can be difficult to diagnose, but if left untreated, it can lead to a variety of serious personal, familial, and societal problems (e.g., domestic violence, suicide, unemployment). Current available therapeutic interventions for PTSD and major depression vary substantially in their effectiveness. Major impediments to the development of transformational interventions include a lack of basic disease-level knowledge, availability of biomarkers and translational tools, the clinical evidence to identify patients at-risk, and absence of personalized treatment approaches. The governments of the United States, United Kingdom and other countries have identified PTSD as a serious condition affecting many Service members returning from deployments. Many organizations have identified the need to develop new methods for detection and analysis of symptoms and for outreach to Service members suffering from psychological illnesses including PTSD. At present, a large percentage of Service members returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer clinical levels of major depressive disorder and/or PTSD. This book presents technologies demonstrating high accuracy in detection of PTSD signals in textual documents.

AB Background: No definitive guidelines have been established in the United States for postexposure immunization and prophylaxis ( PEP) to hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the event of a traumatic explosive event.
   Methods: The American Medical Association's Center for Public Health Preparedness and Disaster Response assembled a US-Israeli panel of experts, including representatives from disaster medicine, trauma surgery, occupational health, and infectious disease to determine guidelines for adult and pediatric victims following a traumatic explosive event. The panel reviewed the existing Israeli and United Kingdom protocols, previously published Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance on occupational and nonoccupational exposures to HBV, HCV, and HIV, before reaching consensus on preliminary guidelines for the United States.
   Results: These guidelines recommend an age-appropriate dose and schedule for HBV PEP for individuals presenting from the scene with nonintact skin or mucous membrane exposure, and they also consider HCV and HIV testing in individuals presenting with possible nonintact skin or mucous membrane exposure. The guidelines do not recommend PEP for individuals presenting from the scene with possible superficial skin exposure.
   Conclusions: These recommendations offer PEP guidance for bloodborne pathogens and are limited in scope. These recommendations do not address general wound PEP such as tetanus or the need for antibiotics. It is hoped that these guidelines will fill an urgent gap in preparedness until definitive, comprehensive guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are published.

AB The present study provides the first known qualitative examination of heterosexual undergraduate men's conceptualization and experiences of the bromance, outside research on cinematic representations. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 30 undergraduate men enrolled in one of four undergraduate sport-degree programs at one university in the United Kingdom, we find these heterosexual men to be less reliant on traditional homosocial boundaries, which have previously limited male same-sex friendships. Contrary to the repressive homosociality of the 1980s and 1990s, these men embrace a significantly more inclusive, tactile, and emotionally diverse approach to their homosocial relationships. All participants provided comparable definitions of what a bromance is and how it operates, all had at least one bromantic friend, and all suggested that bromances had more to offer than a standard friendship. Participants described a bromance as being more emotionally intimate, physically demonstrative, and based upon unrivalled trust and cohesion compared to their other friendships. Participants used their experiences with romances and familial relations as a reference point for considering the conditions of a bromance. Results support the view that declining homophobia and its internalization has had significantly positive implications for male expression and intimacy. Conclusions are made about the bromance's potential to improve men's mental health and social well-being because participants indicate these relationships provide a space for emotional disclosure and the discussion of potentially traumatic and sensitive issues.

TI Poverty in Global Perspective: Is Shame a Common Denominator?
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Focussing on the psychosocial dimensions of poverty, the contention that shame lies at the 'irreducible absolutist core' of the idea of poverty is examined through qualitative research with adults and children experiencing poverty in diverse settings in seven countries: rural Uganda and India; urban China; Pakistan; South Korea and United Kingdom; and small town and urban Norway. Accounts of the lived experience of poverty were found to be very similar, despite massive disparities in material circumstances associated with locally defined poverty lines, suggesting that relative notions of poverty are an appropriate basis for international comparisons. Though socially and culturally nuanced, shame was found to be associated with poverty in each location, variably leading to pretence, withdrawal, self-loathing, 'othering', despair, depression, thoughts of suicide and generally to reductions in personal efficacy. While internally felt, poverty-related shame was equally imposed by the attitudes and behaviour of those not in poverty, framed by public discourse and influenced by the objectives and implementation of anti-poverty policy. The evidence appears to confirm the negative consequences of shame, implicates it as a factor in increasing the persistence of poverty and suggests important implications for the framing, design and delivery of anti-poverty policies.

DE pharmaco-economics
ID ANTIRETROVIRAL REGIMEN COMPLEXITY; ADHERENCE; HEALTH; INDEX; SF-36
AB Background Veterans with serious mental illnesses face increased risk of both poor medication adherence and death by overdose or suicide. Blister packaging of medications has been associated with population reductions in suicide in the United Kingdom and may improve adherence. Yet, the lack of studies of cost and outcomes has led to controversy about its use. Objective To conduct a cost-utility analysis of blister packaging versus bulk dispensing using in a randomized controlled trial among Veterans with serious mental illnesses or substance abuse. Methods We conducted a cost-utility analysis of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of 303 Veterans (243 of whom completed the 12-month trial) with post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major affective disorder in a large VA academic medical center in the West from the perspective of the VA. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated from a monthly SF-36. Total healthcare utilization and costs were derived from the VHA Corporate Data Warehouse. Incremental cost-utility ratio and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were estimated. Costs were modeled with regression. Results Mean total VA healthcare costs (including inpatient, outpatient and pharmacy costs) for intervention and control groups were not statistically different at $28 591 and $30 732, respectively. All subjects survived the 12-month trial period, with similar mean QALYs (0.59 and 0.58). Conclusions In this group of veterans with serious mental illnesses, our results suggest that blister packaging all outpatient prescription medications was budget-neutral. Blister packaging may be a cost-effective barrier to intentional overdose with prescribed medications.

AB Background A regulatory signal suggested that sertindole was associated with a 10-fold increased risk of death. This observational study aimed to identify deaths and their causes in patients treated with sertindole.
   Methods Sertindole-treated patients in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Hungary, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom were identified and their vital status ascertained. Eventual cause of death and patient and treatment characteristics were ascertained. A nested case-control study compared on-treatment cardiac or unexplained deaths with randomly selected survivors matched on age and gender for potential risk factors.
   Results Eight thousand six hundred eight patients were identified as having initiated treatment with sertindole, for a total 3819 person-years exposure. Thirty-five had died since (all-cause mortality rate 0.92 per 100 person-years exposed). Of these, 15 (43%) had been previously reported to the regulatory authorities. Eight deaths were suicides, of which 2 (25%) had been previously reported; 11 were cardiac deaths, of which 8 (73%) had been reported. On average, patients who died because of cardiac disorders were older, and patients who committed suicide were younger than the other patients who died. The nested case-control study revealed that patients receiving sertindole were at a higher risk of premature cardiac or unexplained death if they had hypertension or other cardiovascular disorders associated with diabetes or metabolic disorder.
   Conclusion Overall and cardiovascular death rates were similar or lower than those observed in premarketing clinical trials. There was a very high reporting rate of all-cause and cardiovascular deaths that could have contributed to the regulatory alert. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Long-term inpatient treatment for personality disorders has become infrequent in the last two decades, and the gap left in service provision has been filled by psychodynamically and cognitively oriented partial hospitalization and outpatient, community-based approaches. It is still uncertain how these low-cost, lower-intensity models have fared relative to residential models that treat patients with severe personality disorders with the containment and control offered by the inpatient setting. In this article, we describe key features of a community-based psychodynamic program developed at the Cassel Hospital in the United Kingdom and present preliminary findings of a 2-year prospective naturalistic outcome study that monitored psychiatric morbidity (Brief Symptom Inventory General Severity Index [BSI-GSI]) and clinical outcome (self-mutilation, suicide attempts, and hospital admissions) in 68 patients with personality disorders who were consecutively admitted to the program. Improvements shown by the community-based sample on all variables were compared with the results in a comparable sample of inpatients treated in a long-term psychosocial treatment program in the same institution. The naturalistic comparison of the two non-randomized treatment models revealed that the community-based sample improved to a significantly greater degree on all three clinical outcome dimensions and had significantly lower early dropout rates than those who received the long-term residential treatment. The findings indicate that, at least in terms of impulsive behavior and treatment adherence, the community-based program appears to offer a viable adequate alternative to long-term inpatient admission.

AB Purpose Cancer is associated with an increased risk of suicide and attempted suicide. However, we do not know how many cancer patients have thoughts that they would be better off dead or thoughts of hurting themselves. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of such thoughts in cancer outpatients and which patients are most likely to have them. Patients and Methods A survey of consecutive patients who attended the outpatient clinics of a regional cancer center in Edinburgh, United Kingdom. Patients completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), which included Item 9 that asks patients if they have had thoughts of being better off dead or of hurting themselves in some way in the previous 2 weeks. Those who reported having had such thoughts for at least several days in this period were labeled as positive responders. Patients also completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( HADS) and a pain scale. The participating patients' cancer diagnoses and treatments were obtained from the cancer center clinical database. Results Data were available on 2,924 patients; 7.8% (229 of 2,924; 95% CI, 6.9% to 8.9%) were positive responders. Clinically significant emotional distress, substantial pain, and-to a lesser extent older age, were associated with a positive response. There was strong evidence of interactions between these effects, and emotional distress played the most important role. Conclusion A substantial number of cancer outpatients report thoughts that they would be better off dead or thoughts of hurting themselves. Management of emotional distress and pain should be a central aspect of cancer care.

   EMERGENCY
AB Deliberate self-harm (DSH) is a major public health problem in many countries and varies by age group, gender, and ethnicity. Having engaged in an act of DSH is the strongest predictor of future suicidal behaviour, both non-fatal and fatal. Development and implementation of effective assessment procedures for DSH patients are required in order to assess risk of repetition and prevent repeated suicidal behaviour. In this chapter we present the outcomes of a review of studies addressing the extent of the problem of DSH and repetition, prediction of factors associated with repeated DSH including age, gender, ethnicity, and assessment procedures for DSH patients presenting to hospital emergency departments.
   The extent of the problem of DSH varies across countries, with relatively high rates in the United Kingdom and Belgium and low rates in Scandinavia. DSH rates are consistently higher in females compared to males. However, recent studies in Ireland indicate that rates of repeated DSH are similar for men and women. Factors predicting repeated DSH vary by age (young, adults, older adults) with some overlap. A history of previous DSH is a predictor for repetition in both young people and adults. Even though most national suicide prevention programmes prioritize the implementation of uniform guidelines for the assessment of DSH patients, there is still considerable variation within and across countries with regard to the types of assessment and aftercare offered to DSH patients. A four-question tool (Manchester Self-Harm Rule) is an example of an evidence-based screening tool for identifying risk of repeated suicidal behaviour (non-fatal and fatal) and is recommended for wider implementation.

AB Background We have examined secular trends in age- and sex-specific prescribing of antidepressants to determine whether these mirror changes in other population measures of mental health.
   Method An analysis was carried out of age- and sex-specific rates of antidepressant prescribing by a representative sample or panel of UK general practitioners (GPs) in the period 1975-1998.
   Results The number of antidepressant prescriptions issued increased more than twofold in the period 1975-1998 and, in 1998, a total of 23.4 million antidepressant prescriptions were issued by GPs in the United Kingdom. Rates of antidepressant prescribing increased markedly in all age and sex groups with as much as a threefold increase in the older age groups. With the exception of 12-19-year-olds, these increases have been more marked in males, although absolute levels of prescribing are still at least two times higher in females.
   Conclusions Antidepressant prescribing has increased in all age and sex groups. This indicates either that there have been changes in the presentation, recognition and management of depression in general practice or that the prevalence of depression has increased, or a combination of these two phenomena. The higher prescribing rate in females is in keeping with evidence from psychiatric morbidity surveys suggesting that women experience higher levels of psychiatric morbidity than men. Decreases in the ratio of female to male prescribing, however, support other data indicating that, relative to females, the mental health of young males has declined in recent years. Changes in patterns of help seeking may also contribute to the observed trends.

   databases; Coding and classification
ID UNDETERMINED MANNER; SUICIDE; CLASSIFICATION; PREVENTION; TIME
AB Background: In countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, systematic variation in the classification of intent in pharmaceutical poisoning deaths have been identified between jurisdictions. This study aimed to explore whether the coronial determination of intent (unintentional, intentional, undetermined) for pharmaceutical-related poisoning deaths may have affected death rates over time and by jurisdiction in Australia.
   Methods: A retrospective examination of mortality records in the National Coronial Information System (NCIS) during 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2013 was conducted. The NCIS is a national internet-based data storage and retrieval system for deaths that were notified to a coroner. Pharmaceutical deaths due to unintentional, intentional or undetermined intent were identified using the NCIS classification. Proportions of the different intent classifications and the mortality rates by intent over time were compared between jurisdictions.
   Results: There were 17,895 pharmaceutical-related poisoning deaths in Australia between 2001 and 2013 that had closed cases in the NCIS. Proportions of deaths classified as unintentional (48.3-66.3%), intentional (24.7-35.9%) and undetermined (6.7-24.7%) varied significantly among Australian jurisdictions. There were significant increases in the rate of classification of unintentional poisoning for some states, and significant increases in intentional poisoning classification in Western Australia, and decreases in New South Wales and Victoria. There was no significant change in classification of undetermined intent.
   Conclusions: Significant variation in classifications of intent, both between state jurisdictions and over time, may be the result of regional differences in demographics and increases in prescription drug misuse. However, the inconsistent use of 'undetermined' intent between state jurisdictions suggests coroners may experience varying difficulty in retrospectively ruling on intent in the equivocal circumstances of pharmaceutical poisoning. The widespread use of psychological autopsy may assist coroners to classify intent, while the implementation of new classifications for pharmaceutical poisoning death may overcome some of the inherent difficulty in intent classification and improve the potential for injury surveillance irrespective of intent.

ID QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; INPATIENTS; ETHICS
AB Background: People with mental health problems continue to present a disproportionately high risk of suicide. Despite the relevance of suicide to psychiatric/mental health (P/MH) nurses, there is a documented paucity of research in this substantive area undertaken by or referring specifically to P/MH nurses; there is currently no extant theory to guide P/MH nursing care of the suicidal person.
   Objectives: Accordingly, this paper reports on a study undertaken to determine if P/MH nurses provide meaningful caring response to suicidal people, and if so how.
   Design: The study used a modified grounded theory method and was conducted in keeping with the Glaserian tenets of Grounded Theory.
   Settings: The study was conducted in two geographical locations within the United Kingdom, one in the North and the other in the Midlands; both locations contained large urban centres.
   Participants: A total of 20 participants were selected across the locations by means of theoretical sampling. All the participants were over 18 years old, had made a serious attempt on their lives or felt they were on the cusp of so doing and had received 'crisis' care from the 'emergency' psychiatric services.
   Methods: The study adhered to the principle features of Glaserian grounded theory namely-(a) theory generation, not theory verification; (b) theoretical sampling, (c) the constant comparative method of data analysis; and (d) theoretical sensitivity (searching for/discovering the core variable, one which identified the key pychosocial process and contains temporal dimensions stages). Further, the authors ensured that the study was concerned with generating conceptual theory.. not conceptual description.
   Findings/Conclusion: The findings indicate that this key psychosocial problem is addressed through the core variable, 're-connecting the person with humanity'. This parsimonious theory describes and explains a three-stage healing process consisting of the sub-core variables: 'reflecting an image of humanity', 'guiding the individual back to humanity' and 'learning to live'.

AB Objectives: To investigate the views and experiences of British pharmacists in physician-assisted suicide ( PAS) and voluntary active euthanasia (VAE) and to examine whether differences in views were associated with personal characteristics.
   Method: A postal questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of 500 registered pharmacists, with addresses in England or Wales, stratified according to sex and community/hospital working environments.
   Main outcome measure: Pharmacists' reports of their views and experiences of PAS and VAE.
   Results: Completed questionnaires were received from 295 respondents (response rate: 59%). The majority of respondents (83%) reported that at times, a person had the right to choose their own manner of death; 61% and 53% thought that there should be changes in the Law to legalise VAE and PAS, respectively. If it were legal to do so, 63% stated that they would be willing to dispense medication for VAE and 64% for PAS. However, only 45% agreed that the pharmacist should have a role in advising the prescriber on the choice and dose of drugs used. Sex, age, and years registered as a pharmacist were not found to be significantly associated with views on the practices of PAS and VAE. However, pharmacists who reported having a religion were significantly less likely to favour such practices. On comparing the views of community and hospital pharmacists, community pharmacists were significantly less likely than expected to want to be informed about the intended purpose of lethal drugs.
   Conclusion: In this survey, while over half of British pharmacists did not disagree in principle to the legalisation of VAE and/or PAS, they were less supportive of direct involvement in such procedures. Religion was a discriminatory factor associated with negative views of VAE and PAS. The significant minority of pharmacists not wanting to know the purpose of drugs they suspected might be for PAS or VAE is not in accordance with professional accountability, reflecting the complex and sometimes conflicting legal and moral aspects of such practices when deciding upon a course of action.

AB Background: Misuse of gammahydroxybutrate (GHB) and its prodrugs gammabutyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4 butanediol (1,4-BD) has increased greatly since the early 1990s, particularly amongst lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals in recreational and sexual settings, e.g. 'chemsex'.
   Objective and Method: This paper presents an overview of GHB pharmacotoxicology and provides analyses of cases in the LGBT population associated with the use of these substances extracted from the UK's National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths database, to which notification is voluntary.
   Results: From 1995 to September 2013, 21 GHB/GBL-associated fatalities were reported. None involved 1,4-BD. Typical victims were: Male (100%); White (67%), young (mean age 34 years); employed (90%); with a drug misuse history (81%). Most deaths were accidental (67%) or related to recreational drug use (19%), the remaining (potential) suicides. The majority of fatalities (83%) occurred in private residences, typically following recreational use; others occurred in specific 'gay'-oriented locales including clubs and saunas. Three London boroughs accounted for 62% of all notified deaths, reflecting the concentration of both resident and visiting 'gay' individuals. However, this may be an artefact of the voluntary nature of the data submission procedure in particular areas. GHB/GBL alone was implicated in 10% of fatalities. The following substances were implicated either alone or in combination in the remaining cases (percentages may add to more than 100%): cocaine (38%); alcohol (33%); amphetamines (29%); ecstasy (29%); diazepam (24%); ketamine (24%); mephedrone (24%). Post-mortem blood levels: mean 660 (range 22 - 2335; S.D. 726) mg/L.
   Conclusion: Significant caution is needed when ingesting GHB/GBL, particularly with alcohol, benzodiazepines, stimulants, and ketamine. Risk of death is increased due to their CNS-depressant properties. Of these, 'chemsex' drugs such as cocaine, mephedrone and ketamine are of note. More awareness is needed in the 'gay' community about risks associated with the consumption of such substances.

TI 'Blowback' for Britain? Blair, Bush, and the war in Iraq
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID INTELLIGENCE
AB As debate continues over the conduct, the legality and the morality of the war in Iraq, this article addresses how and why Prime Minister Blair decided on the British road to war in Iraq. The article argues that Tony Blair was working within a mindset at both the domestic and international levels that meant he was predisposed to use military force against Iraq and indeed against other perceived threats to the West. His rnindset arose, we will argue, through fear rather than arrogance, through the experiences of the past two decades as much as contemporary events, and this meant that he systematically over-estimated the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. We postulate that Blair was not pressured into invading Iraq by President Bush. Rather, he believed that it was the right path for Britain to take, and that the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was actually the logical outcome of the 'Doctrine of the International Community' outlined in his Chicago speech in 1999. We go on to make the claim that by concentrating on Supporting the United States in its grand strategy, Tony Blair misunderstood the pattern of politics at home and perhaps more seriously of the 'threat' to the domestic security of the United Kingdom. This was not a danger from Iraqi WMD or even from 'foreign' terrorists as had happened on 9/11 but from home-grown suicide bombers, some of whom claimed to be inspired by opposition to Blair's wars. This was the blowback that mattered - and will continue to do so - for the UK.

ID NEWS; TERRORISM; MEDIA
AB The suicide bombings of 7 July 2005 remain the most serious terror attacks in the United Kingdom to date in the so-called 'war on terror'. Much has been published on the war on terror but few journalists have reflected on their practice post 9/11 and none on their domestic coverage of the 7/7 attacks. This article is written by a journalist who covered the London bombings for a UK national newspaper and more recently is a practitioner-academic. Using academic texts focusing on the domestic reporting of the war on terror as stimuli for scholarly reflection, this article reviews the author's own coverage using reflexive practice and content analysis. This article places 7/7 in the continuum of reporting subsequent to 11 September 2001 (9/11) and issues discussed. Some 63 authored articles were considered from the period. Scholarly texts have proposed a range of concepts to analyse coverage from including political ritual, trauma, national wound and hegemony. This article concludes by noting that while many academic texts see coverage of terrorism as an elite discourse, dominated by political economy drivers and responding to events in a homogeneous reactivity, in practice, news organisations can have complex responses and journalists, agency in their coverage of major terrorism events.

ID ATTEMPTED-SUICIDE; WEST LONDON; PARASUICIDE
AB Background to the study: When compared to the United Kingdom general population, rates of deliberate self-harm (DSH) are increased among certain ethnic groups, particularly in those from the Indian diaspora. Aim: To investigate differences between ethnic groups in the demographic and clinical features of patients admitted after episodes of DSH and subsequently assessed by a nurse-led DSH liaison team. Method: A retrospective case-note study (N = 297) with completion of a standardized data collection instrument. The ethnic origin of each patient was assessed by a variety of means. Results: Asian patients (n = 38) were more likely to be female (p = 0.043), married (p = 0.027), and cite problems with their partner (p = 0.017) as a precipitant to DSH. The indigenous group (n = 234) were more likely to have previous contact with psychiatric services (p = 0.023), to have used alcohol preceding DSH (p = 0.014), and to have a criminal record (p = 0.007). Conclusions: In this population, the demographic and clinical features of patients assessed after DSH vary significantly with ethnic group. A case-control study is warranted to examine these differences in more detail.

AB Psychoanalytically oriented day hospital therapy, later manualized and named mentalization-based treatment (MBT), has proven to be a (cost-) effective treatment for patients with severe borderline personality disorder and a high degree of psychiatric comorbidity (BPD) in the United Kingdom (UK). As to yet it has not been shown whether manualized day hospital MBT would yield similar results when conducted by an independent institute outside the UK. We investigated the applicability and treatment outcome of 18-month, manualized day hospital MBT in the Netherlands by means of a prospective cohort study with 45 Dutch patients with severe BPD and a high degree of comorbid Axis I and Axis II disorders. Outcomes were assessed each six months. Symptom distress, social and interpersonal functioning, and personality pathology and functioning all improved significantly, with effect sizes between 0.7 and 1.7. Suicide attempts, acts of self-harm, and care consumption were also significantly reduced. The results indicate that MBT can effectively be implemented in an independent treatment institute outside the UK.

AB Background: In the United Kingdom, specialist treatment and intervention services for doctors are underdeveloped. The MedNet programme, created in 1997 and funded by the London Deanery, aims to fill this gap by providing a self-referral, face-to-face, psychotherapeutic assessment service for doctors in London and South-East England. MedNet was designed to be a low-threshold service, targeting doctors without formal psychiatric problems. The aim of this study was to delineate the characteristics of doctors utilising the service, to describe their psychological morbidity, and to determine if early intervention is achieved.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study including all consecutive self-referred doctors ( n = 121, 50% male) presenting in 2002 - 2004 was conducted. Measures included standardised and bespoke questionnaires both self-report and clinician completed. The multi-dimensional evaluation included: demographics, CORE ( CORE-OM, COREWorkplace and CORE-A) an instrument designed to evaluate the psychological difficulties of patients referred to outpatient services, Brief Symptom Inventory to quantify caseness and formal psychiatric illness, and Maslach Burnout Inventory.
   Results: The most prevalent presenting problems included depression, anxiety, interpersonal, self-esteem and work-related issues. However, only 9% of the cohort were identified as severely distressed psychiatrically using this measure. In approximately 50% of the sample, problems first presented in the preceding year. About 25% were on sick leave at the time of consultation, while 50% took little or no leave in the prior 12 months. A total of 42% were considered to be at some risk of suicide, with more than 25% considered to have a moderate to severe risk. There were no significant gender differences in type of morbidity, severity or days off sick.
   Conclusion: Doctors displayed high levels of distress as reflected in the significant proportion of those who were at some risk of suicide; however, low rates of severe psychiatric illness were detected. These findings suggest that MedNet clients represent both ends of the spectrum of severity, enabling early clinical engagement for a significant proportion of cases that is of importance both in terms of personal health and protecting patient care, and providing a timely intervention for those who are at risk, a group for whom rapid intervention services are in need and an area that requires further investigation in the UK.

AB Compared to the general population, military personnel are particularly vulnerable to developing gambling problems. The present study examined the presentation of gambling-including gambling frequency, personal thoughts on reducing gambling and recommendations from others to reduce gambling-across these populations. Additionally, the study measured the association between gambling and various psychosocial risk and protective factors-including psychological distress, suicidal ideation, external encouragement to reduce substance use, days out of role, personal wellbeing, resilience, social support and intimate bonds. Data was extracted from the Global Health & Wellbeing Survey, an online self-report survey conducted in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. Of the 10,765 eligible respondents, 394 were military veterans and 337 were active military personnel. Consistent with previous research, a higher proportion of gambling behaviours were observed in both current and ex-serving military samples, compared to the general population. To varying degrees, significant associations were found between the different gambling items and all psychosocial risk and protective factors in the general population sample. However, the military sample yielded only one significant association between gambling frequency and the protective factor 'resilience'. A post hoc stepwise linear regression analysis demonstrated the possible mediating role resilience plays between gambling frequency and other psychosocial risk (psychological distress, and suicidal thoughts and behaviour) and protective factors (personal wellbeing) for the military sample. Given the findings, it is recommended that routine screening tools identifying problem gambling are used within the military, and subsequent resilience focused interventions are offered to at risk personnel.

AB This article reviews evaluation studies of interventions aimed at preventing and reducing incidents of suicide and self-harm among incarcerated individuals. Study design, sample characteristics, intervention procedures, study measures, and relevant results of each study are reviewed. The outcomes of interest include severity and frequency of self-harm episodes and suicidal ideation, scores on adaptive coping methods, scoring on the Beck Hopelessness scale and risk scores. The six evaluated studies are peer-reviewed, published between 1990 and 2015, and took place in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Pakistan. Treatment modalities widely vary across studies and include cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, peer programming, staff intervention training, and uniquely-designed courses that incorporate various aspects from other treatment modalities. Due to the nature of the studies, only one multi-randomized controlled trial was identified. All identified studies had a pre- and post-treatment design either lacking a comparison group or containing 1-2 comparison groups and conduct follow-up of varying times. While Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) interventions and uniquely-tailored intervention programs suggest promising results, the general absence of comparison groups, the shortage of relevant evaluation studies and the inconsistency of behavioral outcome measurements compromise the capacity of this review. Further, definitional variances, particularly for self-injury (self-harm, non-suicidal self-injury [NSSI], deliberate self-harm, suicidal behavior, etc.) affect the ability to synthesize study results. This article aims to synthesize the literature results to identify the most effective interventions that would benefit from additional research.

TI THE CALCULUS OF SHAREHOLDERS' CONSENT: A CONSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS THEORY
   OF CORPORATE CHARTER AMENDMENT RULES

LA English
DT Article

AB The charter of a corporation is the "constitution" agreed to by all its members. The charter, however, is not a "suicide pact," it can be amended according to the charter amendment rules in corporate law when circumstances change. These charter amendment rules vary significantly across jurisdictions. In Delaware, shareholders can amend the charter with a simple majority vote of shares. The amendment must be initiated by the board of directors and decisions to amend the charter are made usually by a supermajority vote of shares. Board approval is not necessary in the United Kingdom, Germany, or France. Within a given jurisdiction, the rules governing the amendment of different provisions are also very different. This Article makes the first attempt to employ the constitutional economic theory developed by Buchanan and Tullock to explain different charter amendment rules. It identifies a fundamental tradeoff between the needs of adaptation and commitment. If charter amendment rules are too procedurally burdensome, they may harm the adaptation of corporate charters. If they do not impose meaningful regulation on charter amendment, minority shareholders cannot be sure that corporate insiders or controlling shareholders would not amend the charter in the midstream to harm shareholders' interests. Different states may choose different charter amendment rules to achieve a balance between adaptation and commitment. The choice between different charter amendment rules made by different states can be explained by several factors, including institutional investors and judicial capacity. This theory sheds new light on a series of issues in the corporate law literature, including the explanation for mandatory rules and appraisal rights in corporate law, the debate of increasing shareholder power in the United States, and why law, rather than contract, is important in corporate governance.

AB Background: It has been estimated that, at any point in time, about 1% of the general adult population of the United Kingdom is receiving long-term (ie, >= 3 months) oral glucocorticoid therapy. These patients may develop neuropsychiatric disorders when the drug is discontinued.
   Method: Data were obtained for all adult patients registered from January 1, 1990, through December 31, 2008, at UK general practices that were contributors to The Health Improvement Network database. Data from 21,995 adult patients who had been exposed to long-term oral glucocorticoids and who had discontinued the drugs after an exposure ranging from 1 to 3 years were analyzed. The within-person incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for Read codes and/or prescriptions for depression, delirium/confusion, mania, panic disorders, and suicide or suicide attempt during the withdrawal period were estimated using a self-controlled case series methodology. The predictors of the outcomes were ascertained using Cox proportional hazards models.
   Results: The risk of depression (IRR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.00-1.28; P = .04) and of delirium/confusion (IRR = 2.67; 95% CI, 1.96-3.63; P < .001) was significantly higher during the discontinuation period compared to a reference period defined as ranging from 5 to 3 months before the drug cessation. Older people were at higher risk of delirium/confusion. The use of long-acting glucocorticoids was associated with a higher risk of both depression (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.92; 95% CI, 1.07-3.46) and delirium/confusion (adjusted HR = 4.96; 95% CI, 2.60-9.49) during the withdrawal period.
   Conclusions: Discontinuation of long-term glucocorticoid therapy is associated with an increased risk of both depression and delirium/confusion. People treated with long-acting glucocorticoids are particularly at risk. (C) Copyright 2013 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB Self-poisoning in adults is an important public health problem across the world, but evidence to guide psychological management is lacking. In the current cohort study we wished to investigate whether aspects of routine Emergency Department management such as receiving a psycho-social assessment, or being referred for specialist follow up, affected the rate of repetition of self-poisoning. The study was carried out in four inner city hospitals in Greater Manchester, United Kingdom, over a 5-month period. We used hospital information systems and reviewed the case notes of every patient presenting to the Emergency Department to identify prospectively all adult patients presenting with deliberate self-poisoning. Data regarding the Emergency Department management of each episode were collected. The Manchester and Salford self-harm database was used to determine the number of individuals who went on to repeat self-poisoning within 6 months of their index episode. During the recruitment period 658 individuals presented with self-poisoning. Traditional risk factors for repetition such as substance dependence, psychiatric contact, and previous self-poisoning were associated with a greater likelihood of receiving a psycho-social assessment or being referred for specialist follow-up. Ninety-six patients (14.6%) repeated self-poisoning within 6 months of their index episode. After adjustment for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics and hospital, receiving a psycho-social assessment was not associated with reduced repetition but being referred for specialist follow-up was [adjusted hazard ratio for repetition (95% Cl): 0.49 (0.25 to 0.84), P=.01]. We found that being referred for active follow-up after self-poisoning was associated with a reduced risk of repetition. The implications of this finding are discussed. Further studies using both cohort and randomized controlled study designs will help inform management strategies for patients who poison themselves. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB IMPORTANCE Some reports have raised concerns regarding a potential psychiatric worsening associated with first-time use of aripiprazole in patients already treated with other antipsychotic medications. Whether aripiprazole use, particularly in the long term, increases the risk for serious psychiatric events is unclear.
   OBJECTIVE To assess whether switching to or adding aripiprazole is associated with serious psychiatric treatment failure compared with switching to or adding another antipsychotic drug in patients previously exposed to antipsychotic medications.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based cohort study was conducted from January 1, 2005, to March 31, 2015. Data were obtained from the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink, one of the world's largest computerized databases linked to the Hospital Episodes Statistics repository and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality database. Within a base cohort of new users of antipsychotic drugs, patients switching or adding aripiprazole (n = 1643) were propensity matched 1: 1 to patients switching to or adding another antipsychotic medication (n = 1643). All patients were followed up until psychiatric treatment failure, for 365 days (1 year) after cohort entry, until death from any cause other than suicide, until end of registration or linkage with the databases, or end of the study period (March 31, 2016).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of serious events of psychiatric treatment failure (psychiatric hospitalizations, self-harm, or suicide) associated with switching to or adding aripiprazole compared with other antipsychotic drugs. In addition to propensity score matching, all models were adjusted for age, number of psychiatric hospitalizations or self-harm events in the 6 months before cohort entry, number of different antipsychotic drugs before cohort entry, and quintiles of the Index of Multiple Deprivation.
   RESULTS The study cohort included 1643 patients (949 [57.8%] were women with a mean [SD] age of 42.1 [16.8] years) starting aripiprazole use; they were matched 1: 1 to 1643 patients (871 [53.0%] were women with a mean [SD] age of 42.4 [17.1] years) starting use of another antipsychotic drug. During 2692 person-years of follow-up, 391 incident serious psychiatric treatment failures occurred, with a crude incidence rate of 14.52 (95% CI, 13.16-16.04) per 100 person-years. First-time use of aripiprazole was not associated with an increased rate of psychiatric treatment failure (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.71-1.06), psychiatric hospitalizations (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.69-1.06), or self-harm or suicide (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.68-1.36) compared with starting use of another antipsychotic drug. Results were consistent across several sensitivity analyses.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Initiating aripiprazole use, compared with another antipsychotic medication, after a previous antipsychotic exposure did not appear to be associated with psychiatric hospitalization, self-harm, or suicide; these findings warrant replication in large observational studies.

ID PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCES
AB This article examines how mephedrone, the most popular legal high sold freely in the United Kingdom until its classification as a high-risk drug, in April 2010, was constructed by the British popular media as a moral epidemic that threatened the very symbolic heart of the nation - its youth. News of teenagers committing suicide after taking the drug or dying of overdose had been presented in the pages of tabloid dailies for months when the government decided to ban the substance despite the lack of solid scientific data on the medical and social risks it posed. Drawing on Teun van Dijk's socio-cognitive approach to critical discourse studies, this article demonstrates how in its attempt to influence national policy the media largely responded to the new drug problem with panic discourses that perpetuated the old 'war on drugs' ideology, choosing to frame mephedrone as an agent of death and moral downfall even when its destructive influence was questionable. In this perspective, a blueprint made of multiple layers of historical drug scares and repressive drug policies shaped the metaphors and narratives used by the media to codify a sense of threat and by the audiences to interpret the symptoms of a social pathology.

AB Objective: To determine the degree of adherence to legislation introduced in 1998 restricting the availability of over the counter paracetamol.
   Design: A prospective observational study.
   Setting: An emergency department in an inner city London teaching hospital. Pharmacy and non-pharmacy outlets in south London.
   Main outcome measures: ( 1) The source of paracetamol ingested by 107 patients presenting with an acute paracetamol overdose ( 2001 - 2003) and ( 2) the ability to purchase paracetamol from pharmacy and non-pharmacy outlets in a manner contravening paracetamol pack size legislation ( 2004).
   Results: Potentially toxic amounts of paracetamol in excess of pack size restrictions were purchased in 70% ( 17 of 24) of outlets. Forty six per cent of patients who had ingested a potentially toxic dose of paracetamol obtained the tablets in a manner contravening the 1998 legislation.
   Conclusion: Legislation limiting the availability of over the counter paracetamol is not being adhered to in south London. A significant number of patients ingesting a potentially toxic dose of paracetamol report purchasing the tablets in a manner contravening the legislation. Studies that attempt to assess the impact of the legislation need to be interpreted in the context of these results. Measures to enforce current legislation may help to reduce the severity of paracetamol poisoning in the UK.

SO BEHAVIOURAL AND COGNITIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY
LA English
DT Article
DE Deliberate self harm; DBT; dissociation
AB Deliberate self-harm (DSH) presents a significant health problem, especially as treatments have not been particularly successful in reducing repetition. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT; Linehan, 1993) is one approach that has reported some success in reducing self-harm rates in borderline personality disorder patients, who self-harm frequently, though it remains largely untested outside its original setting. The present study aimed to assess the effectiveness of DBT in self-harming women in an institutional setting in the United Kingdom where self-harm is common. Female patients at Rampton Hospital who were displaying self-harming behaviour and met criteria for borderline personality disorder (N = 10) participated in the full one-year treatment package of DBT. Patients were assessed on self-harm rates and on a number of psychological variables, pre-, during- and post-therapy, including a 6-month follow-up. There was a significant reduction in DSH during therapy, which was maintained at 6-month follow-up. This was paralleled by a reduction in dissociative experiences and an increase in survival and coping beliefs, alongside improvements in depression, suicide ideation, and impulsiveness. The findings are preliminary but the results suggest that DBT might provide an effective treatment for severe self-harm in institutional settings, and also highlight some of the psychological mechanisms that might mediate these improvements in self-harming behaviour.

AB Misuse of gamma hydroxybutrate (GHB) and gamma butyrolactone (GBL) has increased greatly since the early 1990s, being implicated in a rising number of deaths. This paper reviews knowledge on GHB and derivatives, and explores the largest series of deaths associated with their non-medical use. Descriptive analyses of cases associated with GHB/GBL and 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD) use extracted from the UK's National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths database. From 1995 to September 2013, 159 GHB/GBL-associated fatalities were reported. Typical victims: White (92%); young (mean age 32 years); male (82%); with a drug misuse history (70%). Most deaths (79%) were accidental or related to drug use, the remainder (potential) suicides. GHB/GBL alone was implicated in 37%; alcohol 14%; other drugs 28%; other drugs and alcohol 15%. Its endogenous nature and rapid elimination limit toxicological detection. Post-mortem blood levels: mean 482 (range 0-6500; SD 758) mg/L Results suggest significant caution is needed when ingesting GHB/GBL, particularly with alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiates, stimulants, and ketamine. More awareness is needed about risks associated with consumption. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Prisoner parasuicide is a major public and mental health concern worldwide and within the United Kingdom.
   Objectives: This study used a cross-sectional design to examine the association between a self-reported history of mental health problems and a history of parasuicide in male prisoners.
   Methods: A total sample of 192 convicted prisoners who were about to be released from a local category "B" prison ill the UK were approached and asked to complete the "Toolkit for Healthcare Needs Assessment in Prisons" which contained a range of demographic, mental and physical health questions. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) were determined using logistic regression.
   Results: Fifty-one prisoners participated. The unadjusted odds ratio for having a self-reported history of mental health problems and a self-reported history of parasuicide was 15.6 (95% C.I., 2.96-82.16). Following adjustment for age, living alone, homelessness, illegal drug use and alcohol problems the odds ratio was 11.32 (95% C.I., 1.80-71.13).
   Discussion: This study provides good evidence of an association between a history of mental health problems and a history of parasuicide in a group of UK male prisoners. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE risk management; policing; United Kingdom
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to improve the police, policy makers' and researchers' understanding of the likelihood of fatal outcomes befalling missing persons.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data on the age, sex, duration missing and outcome (fatal or non-fatal) of over 32,000 cancelled reports of missing persons were extracted from a police database of missing persons in the London metropolitan area. The analysis highlights the risk of a cancelled missing person report resulting in a fatal outcome by the same variables.
   Findings - Shows that the risk of a cancelled missing person report resulting in a fatal outcome is overall very low, though it does increase with the age of the person reported missing and the duration they remain missing for. Males face a higher risk of being found dead than females.
   Research limitations/implications - The risk estimations use a base rate of all cancelled missing person reports, therefore excluding persons who have never being found. The estimations are based on missing person reports rather than individuals. Insufficient detail was available to analyse the fatal cases by type of death (e.g. suicide, homicide, accident, etc.).
   Originality/value - This paper provides new empirical evidence on what happens to people reported missing. The findings provide an actuarial context in which clinical risk assessment by police officers can take place.

AB center dot Ecological studies have shown conflicting evidence in relation to associations between trends in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) prescription rates and suicide rates in adolescents.
   center dot After regulatory warnings in the UK against SSRI use in children and adolescents, prescribing of antidepressants in general declined in this group; there were no related changes in rates of suicide or hospital admissions for self-harm.
   WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
   center dot Based on all presentations to general hospitals, nonfatal self-poisoning with SSRI antidepressants (but not fluoxetine) declined in 12-19-year-olds in three centres in England in line with UK prescribing trends.
   center dot There was some evidence of a possible small substitution effect from use of other SSRIs for nonfatal self-poisoning to use of fluoxetine
   center dot Overall rates of nonfatal self-harm in 12-19-year-olds in three centres in England were stable, indicating no major substitution of method to self-injury or overall adverse impact of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority warning.
   AIMS
   To assess the impact of the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) warning in December 2003 not to prescribe selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, except fluoxetine, to under-18-year-olds.
   METHODS
   Interrupted time series analysis of prescriptions (UK) and general hospital presentations for nonfatal self-poisoning (three centres in England) for 2000-2006.
   RESULTS
   Following the MHRA warning in December 2003 there were significant decreases in prescribing of SSRI antidepressants (conservative estimate 51%) to young people aged 12-19 years. Surprisingly, this decrease also affected fluoxetine (conservative estimate 20%) and tricyclics (conservative estimate 27%). Nonfatal self-poisoning in this age group following the warning also declined significantly for SSRIs (conservative estimate 44%), but not for fluoxetine, tricyclic antidepressants, or all drugs and other substances. Rates of nonfatal self-harm did not change significantly over the study period.
   CONCLUSIONS
   The reduction in both prescribing and self-poisoning with SSRI antidepressants (except fluoxetine) following the MHRA warning is in keeping with reduced availability of these drugs. There was some evidence of substitution from other SSRIs to fluoxetine for use in self-poisoning. Importantly, overall rates of nonfatal self-harm and self-poisoning did not change, indicating no substitution of method or increases in self-injury.

DE co-proxamol; paracetamol poisoning; self-harm; suicide
ID UNITED-KINGDOM; PACK SIZES; OVERDOSE; UK
AB Aims To describe how changes in legislation to restrict paracetamol sales have affected overdose discharges and death associated with the drug in Scotland.
   Methods A descriptive analysis of routine death and hospital discharge data for the entire Scottish population between 1995 and 2004. Patients in Scotland participated who were discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of poisoning; deaths in Scotland from diagnosis of poisoning 1995-2003 were also analysed. Outcome measures were changes in mortality and overdose due to poisoning involving paracetamol. A comparison was made of in-hospital and out-of-hospital mortality in fatalities involving paracetamol.
   Results The majority of paracetamol-associated deaths were due to co-proxamol. Deaths associated with paracetamol alone or with ethanol occurred principally in hospital and were a minority of deaths overall. The proportion of in-hospital deaths attributed to paracetamol increased (post/pre ratio 1.347; 95% confidence interval 1.076, 1.639; P = 0.013). Overall numbers of cases discharged with poisoning fell. The proportion of these involving paracetamol in any form increased significantly in all groups except young men aged 10 to < 20 years.
   Conclusions Legislation has not reduced mortality or proportional use of paracetamol in overdose, both of which appear to have increased in Scotland since pack-size limitations. Other approaches are necessary to reduce the death rate from overdoses involving paracetamol.

TI Non-NHS residential alcohol resources are allocated in an inconsistent
   manner: some preliminary data
SO DRUGS-EDUCATION PREVENTION AND POLICY
LA English
DT Article
ID ABUSE; MEN
AB The National Health Service and Community Care Act transferred the responsibility for the funding of residential alcohol services to social services in the United Kingdom. To date there has been minimal investigation into the impact of these changes. A questionnaire and semi-structured interview was administered to a designated community care assessor (CCA) from ten (eight women and two men) randomly selected London Boroughs. Eight were social workers, two of these were not professionally qualified. Nine respondents had previous professional contact with alcohol dependent subjects, but only two received any training for their new role. There were three areas of enquiry: first, training received; second, financial resources available, and third those areas which an expert panel thought would be important in relation to the allocation of funds. These were sixfold: equal opportunities; alcohol-related; medical; poly-drug; psychiatric, and forensic factors. The mean annual resources allocated by each borough were $71,000, range 6,000-150,000, (figures from 1998). The only area that was consistently endorsed as being a factor in the allocation of residential resources were psychiatric factors. Each respondent felt that a recent attempt at suicide or self-harm would be very important in their decision to grant funding. We conclude that there are no nationally agreed standards in the allocation of residential alcohol resources. Furthermore this study has shown training deficiencies, inconsistencies and the need for nationally agreed multidisciplinary standards in this area.

AB Aim: The study aimed to identify the incidence, clinical presentation, and demographic features of drug-and alcohol-related deaths diagnosed at a pediatric pathology department between 2004 and 2010.
   Material and Methods: Databases of the histopathology and toxicology departments were searched. Three groups were defined as follows: (1) cause of death is toxicologically related; (2) drugs present are consistent with therapeutic range use; and (3) a drug was detected, but the contribution of this drug to the mechanism of death was not clear.
   Results: Fifty-five cases (36 males, 19 females; mean, 4.8 years; range, 2 hours to 17 years) were identified. This corresponded to 3.3% (55/1669) of all postmortems. Ten cases were group 1, 42 cases were group 2, and 3 cases were group 3. The results in group 1 were methadone (n = 2); methadone, alcohol, and dothiepin (n = 1); diazepam (n = 1); dothiepin (n = 1); carbon monoxide (n = 2); tramadol (n = 1); codeine and paracetamol (n = 1); and dihydrocodeine, citalopram, amitriptyline, and paracetamol (n = 1). The types of death were considered accidental (n = 2), suicide (n = 2), and undetermined (n = 6).
   Conclusions: The presence of a toxin in lethal concentration was found in 10 (0.6%) of 1669 of any kind of postmortem examinations. This increased to 2.2% when the analysis was restricted to "sudden deaths.'' These results demonstrate the need to conduct toxicological screening in all postmortems of this sort.

AB Objectives To test whether frequent bullying victimisation in childhood increases the likelihood of self harming in early adolescence, and to identify which bullied children are at highest risk of self harm.
   Design The Environmental Risk (E-Risk) longitudinal study of a nationally representative UK cohort of 1116 twin pairs born in 1994-95 (2232 children).
   Setting England and Wales, United Kingdom.
   Participants Children assessed at 5, 7, 10, and 12 years of age.
   Main outcome measures Relative risks of children's self harming behaviour in the six months before their 12th birthday.
   Results Self harm data were available for 2141 children. Among children aged 12 who had self harmed (2.9%; n=62), more than half were victims of frequent bullying (56%; n=35). Exposure to frequent bullying predicted higher rates of self harm even after children's pre-morbid emotional and behavioural problems, low IQ, and family environmental risks were taken into account (bullying victimisation reported by mother: adjusted relative risk 1.92, 95% confidence interval 1.18 to 3.12; bullying victimisation reported by child: 2.44, 1.36 to 4.40). Victimised twins were more likely to self harm than were their non-victimised twin sibling (bullying victimisation reported by mother: 13/162 v 3/162, ratio=4.3, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 14.0; bullying victimisation reported by child: 12/144 v 7/144, ratio=1.7, 0.71 to 4.1). Compared with bullied children who did not self harm, bullied children who self harmed were distinguished by a family history of attempted/completed suicide, concurrent mental health problems, and a history of physical maltreatment by an adult.
   Conclusions Prevention of non-suicidal self injury in young adolescents should focus on helping bullied children to cope more appropriately with their distress. Programmes should target children who have additional mental health problems, have a family history of attempted/completed suicide, or have been maltreated by an adult.

AB Background: Most of the research conducted on people who harm themselves has been undertaken in secondary healthcare settings. Little is known about the frequency of self-harm in primary care patient populations. This is the first study to describe the epidemiology of self-harm presentations to primary care using broadly representative national data from across the United Kingdom (UK).
   Methods: Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), we calculated directly standardised rates of incidence and annual presentation during 2001-2013. Rates were compared by gender and age and across the nations of the UK, and also by degree of socioeconomic deprivation measured ecologically at general practice level.
   Results: We found significantly elevated rates in females vs. males for incidence (rate ratio -RR, 1.45, 95 % confidence interval -CI, 1.42-1.47) and for annual presentation (RR 1.56, CI 1.54-1.58). An increasing trend over time in incidence was apparent for males (P < 0.001) but not females (P = 0.08), and both genders exhibited rising temporal trends in presentation rates (P < 0.001). We observed a decreasing gradient of risk with increasing age and markedly elevated risk for females in the youngest age group (aged 15-24 years vs. all other females: RR 3.75, CI 3.67-3.83). Increasing presentation rates over time were observed for males across all age bands (P < 0.001). We found higher rates when comparing Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales with England, and increasing rates of presentation over time for all four nations. We also observed higher rates with increasing levels of deprivation - most vs. least deprived male patients: RR 2.17, CI 2.10-2.25.
   Conclusions: Incorporating data from primary care yields a more comprehensive quantification of the health burden of self-harm. These novel findings may be useful in informing public health programmes and the targeting of high-risk groups toward the ultimate goal of lowering risk of self-harm repetition and premature death in this population.

AB Objective: Meta-analyze all published epidemiologic studies reporting pediatric mania or bipolar disorder to investigate whether pediatric bipolar disorder is becoming more prevalent and whether rates vary significantly by country.
   Data Sources: Searches of PubMed and PsycInfo were conducted through the spring of 2010 using the following search terms: child, pediatric, young, adolescent, epidemiology, prevalence, bipolar, mania, suicide, and psychiatric. We also manually reviewed references in recent reviews of epidemiology of bipolar disorder.
   Study Selection: All studies reporting rates for mania or hypomania in community epidemiologic samples with participants up to 21 years of age.
   Data Extraction: All articles were coded to extract relevant variables. Prevalence rates were calculated from reported number of cases with bipolar disorders, then logit transformed. Twelve studies were included, enrolling 16,222 youths between the ages of 7 and 21 years during a period from 1985 to 2007. Six samples were from the United States; 6 were from other countries (the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain, Mexico, Ireland, and New Zealand).
   Results:The overall rate of bipolar disorder was 1.8% (95% CI, 1.1%-3.0%). There was no significant difference in the mean rates between US and non-US studies, but the US studies had a wider range of rates. The highest estimates came from studies that used broad definitions and included bipolar disorder not otherwise specified. Year of enrollment was negatively correlated with prevalence (r=-0.04) and remained nonsignificant when controlling for study methodological differences.
   Conclusions: Mean rates of bipolar disorder were higher than commonly acknowledged and not significantly different in US compared to non-US samples, nor was there evidence of an increase in rates of bipolar disorder in the community over time. Differences in diagnostic criteria were a main driver of different rates across studies. J Clin Psychiatry 2011;72(9):1250-1256 (C) Copyright 2011 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB When the general public look from the outside at the armed services, their impression is often one of earnest young men and women who are the pinnacle of physical fitness and health, and put their lives on the line for their country. There is usually sadness and respect for those killed on active operations, having put themselves in harm's way. Therefore, when the public discover that more than 1 in 10 deaths in the UK Armed Forces are due to cardiovascular disease, the air of sadness is invariably replaced with surprise and disbelief. These figures, while lower than those due to deaths in accidents, are approaching the numbers of those due to suicide in the armed services; yet deaths from cardiac disease are barely recognised by society, in spite of many of them being avoidable. This article reviews the epidemiology of cardiac disease in the UK Armed Forces, both in terms of morbidity and mortality. It outlines current understanding and gaps in the knowledge regarding the burden of cardiovascular disease in the military population. The particular demographics of the Armed Forces and its influence on cardiac disease burden are discussed. The role of inherited and congenital diseases in younger servicemen and women is highlighted, as is the trend that with increasing age, the burden of disease shifts to ischaemic heart disease, which becomes the dominant cause of both death and disability.

TI Students' attitudes and potential behaviour to a competent patient's
   request for withdrawal of treatment as they pass through a modern
   medical curriculum
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID IMPACT
AB Objective: To examine students' attitudes and potential behaviour to a competent patient's request for withdrawal of treatment as they pass through a modern medical curriculum.
   Design: Cohort design.
   Setting: University of Glasgow Medical School, United Kingdom.
   Subjects: A cohort of students entering Glasgow University's new learner centred, integrated medical curriculum in October 1996.
   Methods: Students' responses before and after year 1, after year 3, and after year 5 to the assisted suicide vignette of the Ethics in Health Care Survey instrument, were examined quantitatively and qualitatively. Analysis of students' multichoice answers enabled measurement of the movement towards professional consensus opinion. Analysis of written justifications helped determine whether their reasoning was consistent with professional consensus and enabled measurement of change in knowledge content and recognition of the values inherent in the vignette. Themes on students' reasoning behind their decision to withdraw treatment or not were also identified.
   Results: Students' answers were found to be consistent with professional consensus opinion precurriculum and remained so throughout the curriculum. There was an improvement in the knowledge content of the written responses following the first year of the curriculum, which was sustained postcurriculum. However, students were found to analyse the section mainly in terms of autonomy, with few responses considering the other main ethical principles or the wider ethical perspective. Students were unclear on their legal responsibilities.
   Conclusions: Students should be encouraged to consider all relevant ethical principles and the wider ethical perspective when deliberating ethical dilemmas. Students should have a clear understanding of their legal responsibilities.

SO PSYCHIATRY-INTERPERSONAL AND BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES
LA English
DT Article
ID SERIOUS VIOLENT; INVOLVEMENT; DISORDERS; YOUTH
AB Objective: Little is known about the differences between gang members and gang affiliates-or those individuals who associate with gangs but are not gang members. Even less is known about how these groups compare with other violent populations. This study examined how gang members, gang affiliates, and violent men compare on mental health symptoms and traumatic experiences. Method: Data included a sample of 1,539 adult males, aged 19 to 34 years, taken from an earlier survey conducted in the United Kingdom. Participants provided informed consent before completing questionnaires and were paid 5 pound for participation. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to compare participants' symptoms of psychiatric morbidity and traumatic event exposure. Results: Findings showed that, compared to violent men and gang affiliates, gang members had experienced more severe violence, sexual assaults, and suffered more serious/life-threatening injuries. Compared to violent men, gang members and gang affiliates had made more suicide attempts; had self-harmed more frequently; and had experienced more domestic violence, violence at work, homelessness, stalking, and bankruptcy. Findings further showed a decreasing gradient from gang members to gang affiliates to violent men in symptom levels of anxiety, antisocial personality disorder, pathological gambling, stalking others, and drug and/or alcohol dependence. Depression symptoms were similar across groups. Conclusions: The identified relationship between gang membership, affiliation, and adverse mental health indicates that mental health in gang membership deserves more research attention. Findings also indicate that criminal justice strategies need to consider gang members' mental health more fully, if gang membership is to be appropriately addressed and reduced.

ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; UNITED-KINGDOM; US PHYSICIANS; ATTITUDES;
   EUTHANASIA; COUNTRIES; PROFILE
AB Background and Aims The prevalence of religious faith among doctors and its relationship with decision-making in end-of-life care is not well documented. The impact of ethnic differences on this is also poorly understood. This study compares ethnicity and religious faith in the medical and general UK populations, and reports on their associations with ethically controversial decisions taken when providing care to dying patients.
   Method A postal survey of 3733 UK medical practitioners, of whom 2923 reported on the care of their last patient who died.
   Findings Specialists in care of the elderly were somewhat more likely to be Hindu or Muslim than other doctors; palliative care specialists were somewhat more likely to be Christian, religious and 'white' than others. Ethnicity was largely unrelated to rates of reporting ethically controversial decisions. Independently of speciality, doctors who described themselves as non-religious were more likely than others to report having given continuous deep sedation until death, having taken decisions they expected or partly intended to end life, and to have discussed these decisions with patients judged to have the capacity to participate in discussions. Speciality was independently related to wide variations in the reporting of decisions taken with some intent to end life, with doctors in 'other hospital' specialities being almost 10 times as likely to report this when compared with palliative medicine specialists, regardless of religious faith.
   Conclusions Greater acknowledgement of the relationship of doctors' values with clinical decision-making is advocated.

AB Title. Benchmarks for effective primary care-based nursing services for adults with depression: a Delphi study.
   Aim. This paper is a report of a study conducted to identify and gain consensus on appropriate benchmarks for effective primary care-based nursing services for adults with depression.
   Background. Worldwide evidence suggests that between 5% and 16% of the population have a diagnosis of depression. Most of their care and treatment takes place in primary care. In recent years, primary care nurses, including community mental health nurses, have become more involved in the identification and management of patients with depression; however, there are no appropriate benchmarks to guide, develop and support their practice.
   Method. In 2006, a three-round electronic Delphi survey was completed by a United Kingdom multi-professional expert panel (n = 67).
   Findings. Round 1 generated 1216 statements relating to structures (such as training and protocols), processes (such as access and screening) and outcomes (such as patient satisfaction and treatments). Content analysis was used to collapse statements into 140 benchmarks. Seventy-three benchmarks achieved consensus during subsequent rounds. Of these, 45 (61%) were related to structures, 18 (25%) to processes and 10 (14%) to outcomes.
   Conclusion. Multi-professional primary care staff have similar views about the appropriate benchmarks for care of adults with depression. These benchmarks could serve as a foundation for depression improvement initiatives in primary care and ongoing research into depression management by nurses.

TI Burns inflicted by self or by others - An 11 year snapshot
SO BURNS
LA English
DT Article
DE assault; self inflicted; burn injury; suicide
ID ASSAULT
AB Introduction: in the United Kingdom, the incidence of assault by burning and of self inflicted burns increased significantly over the last decade. This has major implications both for service providers and society as a whole. Our aim was to investigate the differences in patients' characteristics, management and outcome following a burn sustained by either an assault or self immolation.
   Methods: Acute admissions to a tertiary Burn Centre were retrospectively reviewed over an 11 year period (1994-2005). Demographic data and information regarding the circumstances surrounding the incident, burn severity, treatment and outcomes of the patients were collected.
   Results: Over an 11 year period, 1745 patients were admitted to the tertiary Burn Centre. Of this total, 41 patients (mean age 29 years +/- 16) sustained burns following an assault, a further 86 patients (mean age of 37 years 12) had self inflicted burn injuries; males were preponderant in both groups. In this series, a history of alcohol or substance abuse was present in 25% of both cohorts, 63% of the patients with self inflicted injuries having a previously diagnosed psychiatric disorder.
   Petrol, accelerants and other flammable liquids were the main agents chosen to inflict injury in both the assault and self inflicted groups.
   The burn depth and surface area distribution was greater in the self inflicted group compared to those assaulted (29% versus 21%). A difference was also noted in the pattern of distribution of burns between the two groups, as well as between genders although this difference was not significant. Two-thirds (67.4%) of the self immolated patients and 56% of the assaulted group required surgery.
   The length of hospital stay was similar for both groups, averaging 20 days. The crude mortality for the self inflicted group was 29%, whereas in the assaulted patients, the overall mortality was 4.9%.
   Conclusion: Although the incidence of bums caused either by assault or attempted suicide is low, the affected patients require a multidisciplinary approach. Their management requires significant medical, psychological occupational and social support. Increased awareness and education of those vulnerable individuals maybe of benefit to help prevent self inflicted injuries by burning. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To describe the incidences and causes of occupational police deaths in New York City in the United States and Greater London in the United Kingdom during the twentieth century. To assess the relation between overall societal violence and violence directed toward police officers in these metropolitan areas.
   Design and setting: Ecological study of New York and London from 1900 through 1999.
   Main outcome measures: Intentional and unintentional occupational police mortality rates for New York and London were estimated for each decade. The general population homicide rates of both New York and London were assessed for their correlation with their respective intentional occupational police mortality rates.
   Results: During the 20th century, 585 police officers in New York and 160 police officers in London died while participating in law enforcement activities. New York had markedly greater intentional police mortality rates compared to London throughout most of the 20th century, but these differences decreased significantly by the end of the century. Intentional gunshot wounds comprised 290 police deaths in New York, but only 14 police deaths in London. In New York, gun shot wounds ( both intentional and unintentional) accounted for more occupational police deaths (51.6%) than did all other injury mechanisms combined. In London, motor vehicle collision was the most common cause (47.5%) of occupational police death. There were no apparent correlations between the general population homicide rates and intentional police mortality rates in either New York (r(2) = 0.05, 95% CI -0.77 to 0.81) or London (r(2) = 0.34, 95% CI 20.61 to 0.89).
   Conclusions: During the 20th century, both intentional and unintentional occupational police mortality rates were significantly greater in New York compared to London. These differences are likely from several socioeconomic, cultural, and occupational factors. The declines in police deaths in New York during the latter part of the 20th century indicate that at least some measures taken by the New York Police Department have been successful at significantly reducing the incidence of both intentional and unintentional police deaths.

AB Drug utilization studies have applied different methods to various data types to describe medication use, which hampers comparisons across populations. The aim of this study was to describe the time trends in antidepressant prescribing in the last decade and the variation in the prevalence, calculated in a uniform manner, in seven European electronic healthcare databases.
   Annual prevalence per 10,000 person-years (PYs) was calculated for 2001-2009 in databases from Spain, Germany, Denmark, the United Kingdom (UK), and the Netherlands. Prevalence data were stratified according to age, sex, antidepressant type (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors [SSRIs] or tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs]) and major indications.
   The age- and sex-standardized prevalence was lowest in the two Dutch (391 and 429 users per 10,000 PYs) and highest in the two UK (913 and 936 users per 10,000 PYs) populations in 2008. The prevalence in the Danish, German, and Spanish populations was 637, 618, and 644 users per 10,000 PY respectively. Antidepressants were prescribed most often in 20- to 60-year-olds in the two UK populations compared with the others. SSRIs were prescribed more often than TCAs in all except the German population. In the majority of countries we observed an increasing trend of antidepressant prescribing over time. Two different methods identifying recorded indications yielded different ranges of proportions of patients recorded with the specific indication (15-57 % and 39-69 % for depression respectively).
   Despite applying uniform methods, variations in the prevalence of antidepressant prescribing were obvious in the different populations. Database characteristics and clinical factors may both explain these variations.

TI Looking behind the bars: emerging health issues for people in prison
SO BRITISH MEDICAL BULLETIN
LA English
DT Review
DE prison health; research; ageing; deaths in custody
ID PREVALENCE
AB There are more than 10 million people imprisoned worldwide. These individuals experience a higher burden of communicable and non-communicable disease, mental health and substance misuse problems than the general population and often come from marginalized and underserved groups in the community. Prisons offer an important opportunity for tackling health problems in a way that can deliver benefits to the individual and to the community. This paper focuses specifically on emerging health issues for prisons across the world.
   This paper uses sources of international data from published systematic reviews and research studies, the Ministry of Justice for England and Wales, the Prisons and Probations Ombudsmen Review and other United Kingdom government briefing papers.
   Deaths in custody are a key concern for the justice system as well as the health system.
   Suicide is the leading cause of mortality in prisons worldwide but non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, are increasing in importance in high-income countries and are now the leading cause of mortality in prisons in England and Wales.
   The prison population is ageing in most high-income countries. Older people in prison typically have multiple and complex medical and social care needs including reduced mobility and personal care needs as well as poor health.
   Further research is needed to understand the complex relationship between sentencing patterns, the ageing prison population and deaths in custody; to model its impact on prisons and healthcare provision in the future and to determine effective and cost-effective models of care.
   Research into the health of prisoners is important in improving the health of prisoners but there is considerable variation in quantity and quality between countries. Recent innovations seek to address this disparity and facilitate the sharing of good practice.

TI Varenicline and suicidal behaviour: a cohort study based on data from

   PARTIAL AGONIST; SMOKING-CESSATION; DEPENDENCE; PLACEBO; RISK
AB Objective To determine whether varenicline, a recently licensed smoking cessation product, is associated with an increased risk of suicide and suicidal behaviour compared with alternative treatments bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy.
   Design Cohort study nested within the General Practice Research Database.
   Setting Primary care in the United Kingdom.
   Participants 80 660 men and women aged 18-95 years were prescribed a new course of a smoking cessation product between 1 September 2006 and 31 May 2008; the initial drugs prescribed during follow-up were nicotine replacement products (n=63 265), varenicline (n=10 973), and bupropion (n=6422).
   Main outcome measures Primary outcomes were fatal and non-fatal self harm, secondary outcomes were suicidal thoughts and depression, all investigated with Cox's proportional hazards models.
   Results There was no clear evidence that varenicline was associated with an increased risk of fatal (n=2) or non-fatal (n=166) self harm, although a twofold increased risk cannot be ruled out on the basis of the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval. Compared with nicotine replacement products, the hazard ratio for self harm among people prescribed varenicline was 1.12 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.88), and it was 1.17 (0.59 to 2.32) for people prescribed bupropion. There was no evidence that varenicline was associated with an increased risk of depression (n=2244) (hazard ratio 0.88 (0.77 to 1.00)) or suicidal thoughts (n=37) (1.43 (0.53 to 3.85)).
   Conclusion Although a twofold increased risk of self harm with varenicline cannot be ruled out, these findings provide some reassurance concerning its association with suicidal behaviour.

AB Objectives. 1) To investigate ECG changes following co-proxamol (paracetamol 325 mg and dextropropoxyphene 32.5 mg) overdose in comparison to co-codamol (paracetamol and codeine) or co-dydramol (paracetamol and dihydrocodeine) in a prospective study. 2) To examine the relationship between estimated dextropropoxyphene dose and ECG changes in a larger patient population. Background. Co-proxamol is a common cause of drug-induced death and hospital admission in the United Kingdom. ECG changes following dextropropoxyphene have been reported in animals and man, including QRS prolongation. Methods. The prospective study was conducted on 15 patients and controls with overdose. A retrospective study of a cohort of 159 co-proxamol overdoses from a combined data set from Edinburgh and Newcastle, Australia was also conducted. The measured or estimated "four hour" plasma paracetamol level was used as a surrogate of the amount of dextropropoxyphene ingested. Results. In the prospective study co-proxamol overdose caused statistically significant QRS prolongation (mean [95% CII 99.36 [96.19, 102.53] msec), compared to the other combination opioid-paracetamol products (82.84 [80.81, 84.88] msec) but no effect on PR or QTc. QRS duration increase was evident soon after exposure and remained prolonged and stable over the following 24 h. In the retrospective cohort study a dose dependency of effect on QRS was documented, although the correlation coefficient relating paracetamol level to effect was relatively weak (r=0.338, Sig. [2-tailed] 0.003, n=74). Conclusions. QRS is significantly prolonged in co-proxamol overdose, and this prolongation is dose dependent. These findings have clinical relevance to the management of patients with coproxamol poisoning.

AB Forecasting cause-specific mortality can help estimate the future burden of diseases and provide a clue for preventing diseases. Our objective was to forecast the mortality for causes of death in the future (2013-2032) based on the past trends (1983-2012) in Korea. The death data consisted of 12 major causes of death from 1983 to 2012 and the population data consisted of the observed and estimated populations (1983-2032) in Korea. The modified age-period-cohort model with an R-based program, nordpred software, was used to forecast future mortality. Although the age-standardized rates for the world standard population for both sexes are expected to decrease from 2008-2012 to 2028-2032 (males: -31.4%, females: -32.3%), the crude rates are expected to increase (males: 46.3%, females: 33.4%). The total number of deaths is also estimated to increase (males: 52.7%, females: 41.9%). Additionally, the largest contribution to the overall change in deaths was the change in the age structures. Several causes of death are projected to increase in both sexes (cancer, suicide, heart diseases, pneumonia, and Alzheimer's disease), while others are projected to decrease (cerebrovascular diseases, liver diseases, diabetes mellitus, traffic accidents, chronic lower respiratory diseases, and pulmonary tuberculosis). Cancer is expected to be the highest cause of death for both the 2008-2012 and 2028-2032 time periods in Korea. To reduce the disease burden, projections of the future cause-specific mortality should be used as fundamental data for developing public health policies.

AB Objective: To examine self-harm risk across the adult age range in patients diagnosed with various physical illnesses using the General Practice Research Database - a broadly representative sample of all people registered with a family practice in the United Kingdom.
   Methods: We conducted a large nested case-control study sampled from the whole primary care cohort. During 2001-2008 we studied 2306 cases of self-harm and 46,120 age and gender-matched controls without such an episode recorded. Relative risks were estimated against reference patients with none of the examined physical illnesses. Additionally, we assessed confounding by recorded depression, effect modification by gender and multi-morbidity effects.
   Results: Risk was significantly elevated in relation to any of the physical illnesses (male OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.18-1.54; female OR 1.62,95% CI 1.40-1.86). For both genders combined, risk was raised with each specific illness. Effects sizes were consistently larger in women. Adjustment for recorded depression explained much of the elevated risk, but not so in women with asthma, back pain, diabetes, epilepsy or hypertension. Raised risk was seen in younger adults and during middle age, but not among older people. There was a dose-response relationship with increasing number of physical illnesses, and in women this was independent of depression.
   Conclusion: Heightened risk was seen with a variety of physical illnesses. The findings indicate a need for tackling psychological distress and reducing self-harm risk in physically ill patients who attend primary healthcare services for non-psychiatric reasons, particularly so for women and younger and middle aged adults.

AB Background: Gender differences in depression are well established. Whether these differences persist into late life and in the years preceding death is less clear. There is a suggestion that there is no increased likelihood of depression in late life, but that there is an increase in depressive symptomology, particularly with proximity to death. We compared trajectories of probable depression and depressive symptomology between men and women over age and distance-to-death metrics to determine whether reports of depressive symptoms are more strongly related to age or mortality.
   Methods: Participants (N = 2,852) from the Dynamic Analyses to Optimise Ageing (DYNOPTA) project had a mean age of 75 years (SD = 5.68 years) at baseline and were observed for up to 16 years prior to death. Multi-level regression models estimated change in depressive symptomology and probable depression over two time metrics, increasing age, and distance-to-death.
   Results: Increases in depressive symptomology were reported over increasing age and in the years approaching death. Only male participants reported increased probable depression in the years preceding death. Models that utilized distance-to-death metrics better represented changes in late-life depression, although any changes in depression appear to be accounted for by co-varying physical health status.
   Conclusions: As death approaches, there are increases in the levels of depressive symptomology even after controlling for socio-demographic and health covariates. In line with increases in suicide rates in late life, male participants were at greater risk of reporting increases in depressive symptomology.

   spontaneous/mortality; abortion; criminal; comparative study;
   prospective studies; Russian Federation
AB Objective To study the levels and causes of maternal mortality in St. Petersburg, Russian Federation.
   Methods We collected data about all pregnancy-related deaths in St. Petersburg over the period 1992-2003 using several sources of information. An independent research group reviewed and classified all cases according to ICD-1 0 and the Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths in the United Kingdom. We tested trends of overall and cause specific ratios (deaths per 100 000 births) for four 3-year intervals using the chi(2) test.
   Findings The maternal mortality ratio for the study period was 43 per 100 000 live births. A sharp decline of direct obstetric deaths was observed from the first to fourth 3-year interval (49.8 for 1992-94 versus 18.5 for 2001-03). Sepsis and haemorrhage were the main causes of direct obstetric deaths. Among the total deaths from sepsis, 63.8% were due to abortion. Death ratios from sepsis declined significantly from the first to second study interval. In the last study interval (2001-03), 50% of deaths due to haemorrhage were secondary to ectopic pregnancies. The death ratio from thromboembolism remained low (2.9%) and stable throughout the study period. Among indirect obstetric deaths a non-significant decrease was observed for deaths from cardiac disease. Death ratios from infectious causes and suicides increased over the study period.
   Conclusions Maternal mortality levels in St. Petersburg still exceed European levels by a factor of five. Improved management of abortion, emergency care for sepsis and haemorrhage, and better identification and control of infectious diseases in pregnancy, are needed.

ID ECOLOGICAL MOMENTARY ASSESSMENT; DEPRESSION; EXPERIENCE; ANXIETY
AB Background: Maternal mental health impacts both parental well-being and childhood development. In the United Kingdom, 15% of women are affected by depression during pregnancy or within 1 year of giving birth. Suicide is a leading cause of perinatal maternal mortality, and it is estimated that >50% of perinatal depression cases go undiagnosed. Mobile technologies are potentially valuable tools for the early recognition of depressive symptoms, but complex design challenges must be addressed to enable their use in public health screening.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the issues and challenges surrounding the use of mobile phones for the self-report of psychological well-being during pregnancy.
   Methods: This paper presents design research carried out as part of the development of BrightSelf, a mobile app for the self-report of psychological well-being during pregnancy. Design sessions were carried out with 38 participants, including pregnant women, mothers, midwives, and other health professionals. Overall, 19 hours of audio were fully transcribed and used as the basis of thematic analysis.
   Results: The study highlighted anxieties concerning the pregnancy journey, challenges surrounding current approaches to the appraisal of well-being in perinatal care, and the midwife-patient relationship. Designers should consider the framing of perinatal mental health technologies, the experience of self-report, supporting self-awareness and disclosure, providing value to users through both self-report and supplementary features, and designing for longitudinal engagement.
   Conclusions: This study highlights the needs, motivations, and anxieties of women with respect to technology use in pregnancy and implications for the design of mobile health technologies.

TI Rates, risk factors & methods of self harm among minority ethnic groups
   in the UK: a systematic review
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID ATTEMPTED-SUICIDE; WEST LONDON; SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS; SMALL-AREA;
   ADOLESCENTS; POPULATION; BIRMINGHAM; REPETITION; PSYCHOSIS; PEOPLE
AB Background: Studies suggest that the rates of self harm vary by ethnic group, but the evidence for variation in risk factors has not been synthesised to inform preventive initiatives.
   Methods: We undertook a systematic literature review of research about self harm that compared at least two ethnic groups in the United Kingdom.
   Results: 25 publications from 1765 titles and abstracts met our inclusion criteria. There was higher rate of self harm among South Asian women, compared with South Asian men and White women. In a pooled estimate from two studies, compared to their white counterparts, Asian women were more likely to self harm (Relative Risk 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1 to 1.8, p = 0.005), and Asian men were less likely to self harm (RR 0.5, 95% CI: 0.4 to 0.7, p < 0.001). Some studies concluded that South Asian adults self-harm impulsively in response to life events rather than in association with a psychiatric illness. Studies of adolescents showed similar methods of self harm and interpersonal disputes with parents and friends across ethnic groups. There were few studies of people of Caribbean, African and other minority ethnic groups, few studies took a population based and prospective design and few investigated self harm among prisoners, asylum seekers and refugees.
   Conclusion: This review finds some ethnic differences in the nature and presentation of self harm. This argues for ethnic specific preventive actions. However, the literature does not comprehensively cover the UK's diverse ethnic groups.

TI What can be done to reduce mortality from paracetamol overdoses? A

DT Article
ID ACUTE LIVER-FAILURE; PACK SIZE RESTRICTIONS; DELIBERATE SELF-HARM;
   UNITED-KINGDOM; TIME-SERIES; ACETAMINOPHEN; AVAILABILITY; LEGISLATION;
   UK; PATTERNS
AB Background: Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is the most common self-poisoning agent in the UK and a leading cause of fatal hepatotoxicity. Following legislation in 1998 to limit pack sizes, beneficial effects on paracetamol-related mortality and morbidity were reported in England. However, there are still over 100 deaths a year and evidence of breaches of sales guidelines. Aim: To investigate characteristics of people taking larger paracetamol overdoses and compliance with sales guidelines, to inform possible further initiatives to reduce paracetamol fatalities.
   Design and methods: Interview study of 60 general hospital patients who took overdoses of over 16 paracetamol tablets (8 g).
   Results: Half of all paracetamol overdoses involved over 16 tablets. Patients were predominantly young (three-quarters aged 16-40 years) and female (58.3%); over half (53.3%) had taken a previous paracetamol overdose. Three-quarters said they wanted to die. Half took the overdose within an hour of first thinking of it, half (53.3%) took tablets already in the home and 58.3% bought tablets specifically for the overdose. Ten people tried to buy more than 32 tablets in one transaction; four succeeded. Most knew that a paracetamol overdose could cause death or permanent damage (88.3%) and harm the liver (80.0%) but 70.0% thought they would lose consciousness. Warnings on packs had little deterrent effect. Media and internet influences were identified. Patients chose paracetamol because it was cheap and easily available.
   Conclusions: Further measures to reduce breaches of sales guidelines and the dangers of paracetamol overdose are required. Media and internet site producers should follow guidelines on reporting suicide.

   PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; GENERAL-PRACTICE; MORTALITY; METAANALYSIS; HAZARDS;
   SAFETY; TRIAL
AB Background: A possible association between lipid-lowering drug therapy and psychological well-being remains an issue of debate. To provide more information, we performed a nested case-control study to evaluate the effect of lipid-lowering drugs on depression and suicidal behavior.
   Methods: Within the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database, we identified all cases with newly treated depression needing a referral or hospitalization and all cases with first-recorded diagnosis of suicidal behavior between January 1, 199 1, and December 31, 1999, from a study base that comprised all patients who were aged between 40 and 79 years and who had various exposures of interest. Each case was matched with up to 4 controls, randomly selected from the study base, on age, sex, medical practice, calendar time, and years since enrollment in the General Practice Research Database.
   Results: A nested case-control analysis comprised 458 newly diagnosed cases of depression with 1830 controls, and 105 cases of suicidal behavior with 420 controls. The adjusted odds ratio of depression was 0.4 (95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.9) for current statin use, compared with hyperlipidemic nonuse. The adjusted odds ratios for other exposures were all around 1.0. None of the adjusted odds ratios for suicidal behavior were significantly different from unity.
   Conclusions: The use of statins and other lipid-lowering drugs is not associated with an increased risk of depression or suicide. On the contrary, individuals with current statin use may have a lower risk of developing depression, an effect that could be explained by improved quality of life due to decreased risk of cardiovascular events or more health consciousness in patients receiving long-term treatment.

ID UNITED-KINGDOM; FATAL TOXICITY; SUICIDE; DRUGS; SCOTLAND
AB Objective. To investigate likelihood of self-harm by overdose with antidepressant drugs of different types by examining hospital admission data and poisons inquiries and relating them to prescribing.
   Design. Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on overdose admissions, poisons inquiries and prescribing of antidepressants in Edinburgh and Scotland.
   Setting. Poisons treatment unit of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and its surrounding catchment for overdose cases and Scotland for poisons inquiries.
   Participants. All patients admitted to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2002 with an overdose involving an antidepressant.
   Main outcome measures. Overdose admissions (patients) in relation to prescribing in Edinburgh and poisons inquiries in relation to prescription rates in Scotland.
   Results. There were 1656 admissions involving 1343 patients. The likelihood of admission for an individual patient in relation to volume of prescribing (likelihood ratio: 95%CI) in the catchment was somewhat smaller for amitriptyline (0.83:0.74-0.92) and sertraline (0.79:0.63-0.99), and somewhat greater for mirtazapine (1.99:1.57-2.51), trazadone (1.30:1.09-1.54) and venlafaxine (1.33:1.13-1.55). For poisons inquiries in Scotland, the excess for venlafaxine and mirtazapine was confirmed and likelihood of an inquiry lowest for selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
   Conclusions. There was no evidence of an excess likelihood of presentation with overdose with SSRIs, and the likelihood was reduced with sertraline. There was a small excess of both admissions and poisons inquiries for mirtazapine and venlafaxine. This is a concern in view of the increased toxicity of venlafaxine in overdose in comparison with SSRIs.

AB ObjectivesMortality in young people with perinatally acquired HIV infection (PHIV) following transfer to adult care has not been characterized in the UK. We conducted a multicentre audit to establish the number of deaths and associated factors.
   MethodsFourteen adult clinics caring for infected young people reported deaths to 30 September 2011 on a proforma. Deaths were matched to the Collaborative HIV Paediatric Study, a clinical database of HIV-infected children in the UK/Ireland, to describe clinical characteristics in paediatric care of those who died post-transition.
   ResultsEleven deaths were reported from 14 clinics which cared for 248 adults with PHIV. For the 11 deaths, the median age at transfer to adult care was 17 years (range 15-21 years), and at death was 21 years (range 17-24 years). Causes of death were suicide (two patients), advanced HIV disease (seven patients) and bronchiectasis (one patient), with one cause missing. At death, the median CD4 count was 27 cells/L (range 0-630 cells/L); five patients were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) but only two had a viral load <50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL. Nine had poor adherence when in paediatric care, continuing into adult care despite multidisciplinary support. Eight had ART resistance, although all had potentially suppressive regimens available. Nine had mental health diagnoses.
   ConclusionsOur findings highlight the complex medical and psychosocial issues faced by some adults with PHIV, with nine of the 11 deaths in our study being associated with poor adherence and advanced HIV disease. Novel adherence interventions and mental health support are required for this vulnerable cohort.

TI Admissions to hospital for deliberate self-harm in England 1995-2000: an
   analysis of Hospital Episode Statistics
SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE deliberate self-harm; self-poisoning; self-injury
ID SUICIDE; PARASUICIDE
AB Background Rates of deliberate self-harm (DSH) were increasing in the United Kingdom during the 1980s and early 1990s, particularly among young adult males. Self-poisoning with paracetamol was the most common means, with overdoses of anti-depressants becoming more frequent. Changes to paracetamol pack size regulations in 1997 have been followed by a reduction in overdoses, and there has been more prescription of anti-depressants less likely to necessitate hospitalization if overdosed. Improved liaison psychiatry services and increased levels of employment are among the factors that would suggest an impact on hospital admissions for self-harm. This study analysed DSH admissions to hospitals in England from 1995/96 to 1999/2000 to examine changes.
   Methods A retrospective analysis of the Hospital Episode Statistics database was carried out.
   Results Hospital admissions for DSH rose to 153 per 100 000 in 1997/98, then declined to 143 per 100 000 in 1999/2000. Paracetamol overdoses decreased from 77 to 67 per 100 000. The use of anti-depressants or tranquillizers grew from 56 to 75 per 100 000 during the 5 years. Self-injury, narcotics overdoses and the use of alcohol continued to increase over time.
   Conclusions Yearly increases in admissions for DSH to hospitals in England reversed in 1998/99 and stabilized in 1999/2000. These changes were most noticeable for the 16-24 years age group. The use of paracetamol decreased, whereas other means of self-harm increased. Regional differences and the relationship between rates of DSH in the community and hospital should be explored further.

   ADULTS
AB Objective: Repeated intentional self-harm (SH) is associated with economic costs and increased risk of suicide. Estimates of repetition vary according to method of data capture and are limited by short periods of follow-up observation. Some sources use hospital records and others self-reported SH (SRSH). Our aim was to examine the relationship between SRSH and hospital-verified SH (HVSH) and later repetition of SH (predictive validity). Wealso aimed to examinewhether rates of SH repetition differ between first-time presenters and non-first-time presenters using either definition of SH.
   Method: We conducted a large prospective study tracking SH attempts through an Accident and Emergency (A& E) department within the United Kingdom. We took a representative sample of 774 patients (30% of total who reported SH) and followed them for 5.6 years on average. The index episode of SH was recorded at the time of referral to staff in A& E. Prior episodes of SH were determined from an electronic search of A& E patient database, and in addition, recollection of prior SH as reported by the patient to their clinician at the time of index presentation was recorded.
   Results: Across the whole sample 32.0% of patients repeated SHwithin 1 year, which rose to 54.1% at completion of follow-up. Repetition rateswere considerably higher in patients with a prior SH history than those presenting with a first SH episode after 1 year (47.9% vs. 19.6%) and by the end of follow-up (73.8% vs. 39.4%) (Pb. 001). Of 411 with self-reported first presentations, 45.2% repeated over the study period. In terms of predictive validity, 65.2% of those with previous SRSH repeated vs. 73.8% with previous HVSH (Pb. 001). There was low agreement between SRSH and HVSH (Kappa= 0.353, 95% confidence interval 0.287-0.419, low).
   Conclusions: Wefound relatively poor agreement between hospital-defined and self-reported SH. A total of 62.8% of those who denied SH actually had a hospital-verified previous episode. Patients with recorded prior SH and those who recall previous SH have significantly higher rates of repetition, but the two samples imprecisely overlap and predictive validity is stronger for HVSH.

ID PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; PREVALENCE; RISK
AB Background: There are conflicting reports with regard to the relationship between suicidal ideations and tinnitus and hyperacusis. Audiology departments play a major role in offering therapy and support for patients experiencing tinnitus and hyperacusis. If suicidal and self-harm ideations among patients seen in audiology clinics are high, then it would be important to screen for them to make onward referrals to mental health services.
   Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of and factors related to suicidal and self-harm ideations in patients with tinnitus and hyperacusis seen at an audiology outpatient service.
   Research Design: This study was a part of a service evaluation survey using a correlational design.
   Study Sample: All patients who sought help concerning their tinnitus or hyperacusis from an audiology clinic of the National Health Service in the United Kingdom in a 1-yr period were asked to complete the survey questionnaires (n = 402).
   Data Collection and Analysis: The focus of this article is on analysis of the patients' responses about suicidal and self-harm ideations as measured via the Patient Health Questionnaire, item 9, and their associated factors.
   Results: A total of 150/402 of patients answered the question about suicidal and self-harm ideations. Of these, 13% indicated that they had suicidal or self-harm ideations in the past 2 weeks. Suicidal and self harm ideations were moderately correlated with scores on the anxiety and depression subscales of the hospital anxiety and depression scale. Suicidal and self-harm ideations decreased with increasing age. There were small statistically significant correlations between suicidal and self-harm ideations and tinnitus handicap, hyperacusis handicap, insomnia, and scores on the visual analog scale (VAS) of effect of tinnitus on life. The correlations between suicidal and self-harm ideations and gender, pure-tone average of the worse and better ears, uncomfortable loudness levels of the worse ears, and VAS of tinnitus loudness and annoyance were not statistically significant. A regression model showed that abnormal depression scores increased the chance of suicidal and self-harm ideations by a factor of 6.2 (95% confidence interval = 1.13-34.1, p = 0.036).
   Conclusions: Audiologists offering tinnitus and hyperacusis rehabilitation should screen for suicidal and self-harm ideations among patients, especially for those with comorbid depression, and make onward referral to appropriate services when needed.

AB In 1978 Italy implemented Law Number 180, the reform law that blocked all new admissions to public mental hospitals. After 40 years without mental hospitals, we aim at understanding the consequences of the Italian reform in terms of mental health care facility and staff availability. We compared the organization of the Italian mental health system with that of countries belonging to the Group of 7 (G7) major advanced economies. Italy has nearly 8 psychiatrists, 20 nurses, 2 social workers and less than 3 psychologists per 100,000 population, while for example in France there were 22 psychiatrists, in Japan 102 nurses, in the United States 18 social workers, and in Canada and France more than 45 psychologists per 100,000 population. In terms of inpatient facilities, no beds in mental hospitals were available in Italy, while in the other G7 countries mental hospital beds ranged from 8 in the United Kingdom to 204 in Japan per 100 000 population. In Italy there were fewer beds for acute care in general hospitals but more beds in community residential facilities than in the other G7 countries. Service use data showed variability in the provision of mental health care throughout the country. Soon after the implementation of the Italian reform the absolute number of compulsory admissions progressively declined, from more than 20,000 in 1978 to less than 9000 in 2015. Alongside the progressive decline of psychiatric beds imposed by Law 180, the age-adjusted suicide rate remained stable, ranging from 7.1/100,000 population in 1978 to 6.3/100,000 population in 2012. The population of psychiatric patients placed in Italian forensic psychiatric hospitals progressively declined. During the last 40 years without mental hospitals, Italy has seen a progressive consolidation of a community-based system of mental health care. We highlighted, however, reasons for concern, including a decreasing staffing level, a potential use of community residential facilities as long-stay residential services, a still too high variability in service provision across the country, and lack of national data on physical restraints. At a national level, the resources allocated to mental health care are lower in Italy than in other high-income countries.

AB Introduction In Australia there is an overwhelming need to provide effective treatment to patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) in mental health crisis. We adapted Improving Access to Psychological Therapies service model (IAPT) from the National Health Service (NHS) method for the large scale delivery of psychological therapies throughout the United Kingdom to an Australian ED setting. This telephone-based low intensity therapy was provided to people presenting in crisis to the EDs with combinations of anxiety, depression, substance use, and suicidal thinking.
   Methods This uncontrolled study utilised session-by-session, before-and-after measures of anxiety and depression via Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7).
   Results Of 347 eligible post-crisis ED referred patients, 291 (83.9%) engaged with the IAPT team. Most patients (65%) had attended the ED previously on an average of 3.9 (SD=6.0) occasions. Two hundred and forty one patients received an average of 4.1 (SD=2.3) contacts of low-intensity psychological therapies including 1.2 (SD=1.7) community outreach visits between 20th Oct 2011 and 31st Dec 2012. Treated patients reported clinically significant improvements in anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. Uncontrolled effect sizes were moderate for anxiety (0.6) and depression (0.6).
   Discussion The Australian ED IAPT program demonstrated that the UK IAPT program could be adapted for emergency mental health patients and be associated with similar clinical benefits as the original program.
   Funding The Flinders Medical Centre IAPT program received Emergency Department project funding from the Australian Commonwealth Government through the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) and the South Australian Government initiative, Every Patient Every Service (EPES).

AB Rates of self-harm appear high in South Asian young women in the United Kingdom (UK) although previous studies were mostly small. Data on treatment and outcomes for South Asians are lacking. This study compared rates of self-harm, socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, provision of services and risk of repetition by ethnicity.
   A prospective cohort of adult self-harm attendees (n = 7185), aged 15 and over presenting to four emergency departments in the cities of Manchester and Salford, UK over a 4-year period.
   The study included 299 South Asians. South Asian women aged 16-24 years were more likely to self-harm than Whites of the same age group (1010.9 vs. 754 per 100,000). Across all age groups the rates of self-harm were lower in South Asian men compared to White men and to South Asian women. South Asian women were significantly more likely to report relationship problems within the family than White women (32% vs. 19%, P = < 0.001). South Asians were less likely than Whites to report depressive symptoms and to be offered specialist mental health services (Rate ratio = 0.75), and more likely to be referred back to the GP (Rate ratio = 1.83). South Asians were less likely to attend with a repeat episode (Rate ratio = 0.56).
   Young South Asian women are at high risk of self-harm, but their clinical risk appears to be lower in terms of the accepted contextual factors contributing to risk. Potentially useful service provision may include an interpersonal problem solving approach although to be effective, interventions would need to be acceptable to South Asian women and culturally appropriate.

TI Do welfare benefit reassessments of people with mental health conditions
   lead to worse mental health? A prospective cohort study

ID IMPACT
AB Background: There have been cases of suicide following the Work Capability Assessment (WCA), a questionnaire and interview for those claiming benefits due to ill health or disability in the United Kingdom. Aims: To examine whether experiencing problems with welfare benefits, including WCA, among people with pre-existing mental health conditions was associated with poorer mental health and wellbeing and increased health service use and costs. Methods: A prospective cohort study of an exposed group (n = 42) currently seeking help from a Benefits Advice Service in London and a control group (n = 45) who had recently received advice from the same service. Questionnaires at baseline and 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Results: The exposed group had higher mean scores for anxiety (p = .008) and depression (p = .016) at baseline and the control group higher mean scores for wellbeing at baseline (p = .034) and 12 months (p = .035). However, loss to follow-up makes overall results difficult to interpret. The control group had higher incomes throughout the study, particularly at the 12-month follow-up (p = .004), but the differences could have been accounted for by other factors. Health service costs were skewed by a few participants who used day-care services intensively or had inpatient stays. Over the study period the proportion of exposed participants engaged in benefits reassessment ranged from 50% to 88%, and 40% to 76% of controls. Conclusion: The hardship of living with financial insecurity and a mental health condition made it difficult for our participants to sustain involvement in a 12-month study and the frequency of benefit reviews meant that the experiences of our controls were similar to our exposed group. These limitations limit interpretation but confirm the relevance of our research. The control data raise the question of whether people with mental health conditions are being disproportionately reassessed.

AB This article analyses domestic and foreign reactions to a 2008 report in the British Medical Journal on the complementary and, as argued, synergistic relationship between palliative care and euthanasia in Belgium. The earliest initiators of palliative care in Belgium in the late 1970s held the view that access to proper palliative care was a precondition for euthanasia to be acceptable and that euthanasia and palliative care could, and should, develop together. Advocates of euthanasia including author Jan Bernheim, independent from but together with British expatriates, were among the founders of what was probably the first palliative care service in Europe outside of the United Kingdom. In what has become known as the Belgian model of integral end-of-life care, euthanasia is an available option, also at the end of a palliative care pathway. This approach became the majority view among the wider Belgian public, palliative care workers, other health professionals, and legislators. The legal regulation of euthanasia in 2002 was preceded and followed by a considerable expansion of palliative care services. It is argued that this synergistic development was made possible by public confidence in the health care system and widespread progressive social attitudes that gave rise to a high level of community support for both palliative care and euthanasia. The Belgian model of so-called integral end-of-life care is continuing to evolve, with constant scrutiny of practice and improvements to procedures. It still exhibits several imperfections, for which some solutions are being developed. This article analyses this model by way of answers to a series of questions posed by Journal of Bioethical Inquiry consulting editor Michael Ashby to the Belgian authors.

   treatment they are offered
SO SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PARASUICIDE; TRENDS; OXFORD
AB Background Rates of deliberate self-harm (DSH) in the United Kingdom are much higher in lower than upper social class groups. Previous investigations have shown differences in socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of male patients according to social class. In two studies of DSH patients in Edinburgh the extent of provision of psychiatric aftercare was inversely related to social class. These findings have not been investigated in other areas. Method Data collected through the Oxford Monitoring System for Attempted Suicide were used to examine the association between social class and socio-demographic and clinical characteristics in male and female DSH patients who presented to the general hospital in Oxford between mid-1988 and 1996 and to determine whether the previously reported social class differences in provision of psychiatric aftercare were replicated. Results Data on social class were available for 2,828 DSH patients (1,290 males, 1,538 females). In both genders, lower social class group tended to be associated with younger age. In males, the main social class differences were found in under-35-year-olds, in whom lower social class was related to criminal record, violence to others and drug misuse. In females, psychiatric disorders were diagnosed more frequently in the higher social class groups, but only in the under-35 age group. In neither gender was there a significant association between social class and the frequency of offer of psychiatric aftercare following DSH. Conclusions There are considerable variations in socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of both male and female DSH patients in different social classes, especially in younger patients. The reason for the absence of a marked social class gradient in psychiatric aftercare found in this study in contrast to the results from previous investigations may be related to differences in styles of service.

   Cutting-Down Programme; Adolescents; Short-term therapy
ID COMMUNITY SAMPLE; ABUSE CECA; INTERVIEW; BEHAVIOR; SUICIDE; HARM; CARE;
   QUESTIONNAIRE; VALIDATION; VALIDITY
AB Background: Worldwide, prevalence rates of adolescent non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) range between 13 and 45%. In Germany, lifetime prevalence of NSSI is around 25% in non-clinical samples, and the one-year prevalence for repetitive NSSI is 4%. NSSI is present in the context of several axis I and II disorders (for example, affective disorders or borderline personality disorder); however, preliminary evidence suggests that it would be justified to consider NSSI as its own diagnostic category. Despite the large impact of this behavior, there is still a lack of evidence-based, specific, and effective manualized treatment approaches for adolescents with NSSI.
   Methods/Design: The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effectiveness of a new cognitive-behavioral treatment manual for self-harming adolescents - the 'Cutting-Down-Programme' (CDP). A total of 80 adolescents aged between 12 and 17 years from a region in Southern Germany who have engaged in repetitive NSSI (>= 5 incidents) in the last 6 months will be randomized into a treatment group (CDP) or a control group that will receive treatment as usual (TAU). The adolescents will be assessed by means of structured interviews and questionnaires at three time points (before treatment, directly after treatment and six months after treatment). Primary outcome criterion is a significant reduction (or remission) in the frequency of NSSI. Secondary outcome criteria are depressivity as well as general well-being and self-worth. Additionally, comorbid psychiatric disorders and childhood adversity will be evaluated as predictors of therapeutic outcome.
   Discussion: Recently, a pilot study in the United Kingdom showed significant reductions in self-harming behavior, depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. This is the first RCT to test the effectiveness of a short-term psychotherapeutic intervention in outpatients engaging in NSSI.

TI Medical students' views about an undergraduate curriculum in psychiatry

SO BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID HOUSE OFFICERS VIEWS; UNITED-KINGDOM; CAREER; DOCTORS; IMPACT
AB Background: It has been suggested that medical students wish to focus their learning in psychiatry on general skills that are applicable to all doctors. This study seeks to establish what aspects of and skills they consider to be important. It is relevant to consider whether these expectations about learning needs vary prior to and post-placement in psychiatry. To what extent these opinions should influence curriculum development needs to be assessed.
   Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to medical students before they commenced their psychiatry placement and after they had completed it. The questionnaire considered the relevance of psychiatry to their future careers, the relevance of particular knowledge and skills, the utility of knowledge of psychiatric specialties and the utility of different settings for learning psychiatry.
   Results: The students felt skills relevant to all doctors, such as assessment of suicide risk, were more important than more specialist psychiatric skills, such as the management of schizophrenia. They felt that knowledge of how psychiatric illnesses present in general practice was important and it was a useful setting in which to learn psychiatry. They thought that conditions that are commonly seen in the general hospital are important and that liaison psychiatry was useful.
   Conclusion: Two ways that medical students believe their teaching can be made more relevant to their future careers are highlighted in this study. Firstly, there is a need to focus on scenarios which students will commonly encounter in their initial years of employment. Secondly, psychiatry should be better integrated into the overall curriculum, with the opportunity for teaching in different settings. However, when developing curricula the need to listen to what students believe they should learn needs to be balanced against the necessity of teaching the fundamentals and principles of a speciality.

AB Background: Little research has compared the mental health and victimization experiences of non-binary youth depending on their sex assigned at birth (SAAB), or compared these two groups with binary transgender youth.
   Aims: To compare mental health, self-harm and suicidality, substance use and victimization experiences between non-binary and binary transgender young adults, both male assigned at birth (MAAB) and female assigned at birth (FAAB).
   Methods: Online survey data from 677 participants from the "Youth Chances" community study of 16 to 25 year olds in the United Kingdom was analyzed, comparing across binary participants (transgender females (n = 105) and transgender males (n = 210)) and non-binary participants (MAAB (n = 93) and FAAB (n = 269)).
   Results: Female SAAB participants (binary and non-binary) were more likely to report a current mental health condition and history of self-harm than male SAAB participants (binary and non-binary). Similarly, female SAAB participants (binary and non-binary) were more likely to report childhood sexual abuse than male SAAB participants (binary and non-binary); the reverse pattern was found for lifetime physical assault relating to being LGBTQ. Non-binary MAAB participants were less likely than the other groups to report past suicide attempts and previous help-seeking for depression/anxiety. Binary participants reported lower life satisfaction than non-binary participants. For all four groups, mental health problems, self-harm, suicidality, alcohol use and victimization experiences were generally higher than that of youth in general population studies.
   Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of considering both non-binary versus binary gender identity and SAAB in relation to mental health problems, self-harm, suicidality and substance use in transgender youth. The roles of sexual abuse, other abuse and discrimination in contributing to increased rates of mental illness and self-harm in non-binary and binary transgender individuals, particularly those who were assigned female at birth, relative to those assigned male, require investigation.

AB Those born in the United Kingdom post-1979 have been described as a jilted generation', materially disadvantaged by economic and social policy; however, it is unclear whether this resulted in their experiencing poorer mental health than previous cohorts. Following the 2008 recession, UK austerity reforms associated with worsening mental health also disproportionately impacted those of younger working-age. This study aimed to identify any historic cohort changes in population mental health, and whether austerity widened generational inequalities. Repeat cross-sectional data from the Health Survey for England (1991-2014) were used to calculate prevalence of psychopathology for those of younger and older working-age (16-30 and 31-64 years) and retirement-age (65+ years), measured by General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ) score a >= 4 (caseness). Descriptive age-period-cohort analysis was performed for 15-year birth cohorts, including the jilted generation (born 1976-90). Logistic regression tested differences in outcome between groups.
   Age-specific GHQ caseness between successive birth cohorts did not significantly change for men, and significantly improved between 2.8% (95% CI 0.1%-5.5%) and 4.4% (95% CI 2.2%-6.7%) for women. Secondary analysis adjusting for education partially explained this improvement. Following the recession, GHQ caseness worsened in men of younger and older working-age by 3.7% (95% CI 1.2%-6.2%) and 3.5% (95% CI 2.1%-5.0%) respectively before returning to baseline during austerity. All women experienced non-significant increases post-recession, but trends diverged during austerity with caseness worsening by 2.3% (95% CI 1.094-3.6%) for older working-age women versus 17% (95% CI 1.3%-6.2%) for younger working-age women. Those of retirement-age experienced little change throughout. In summary, mental health has historically improved between successive cohorts, including for the jilted generation. However, the 2008 recession and subsequent austerity could be most impacting those of younger working-age, particularly women, to create a new cohort effect. Policymakers should consider the differential impact economic and social policy may have across society by age.

AB Objectives To investigate the association between antidepressant treatment and risk of several potential adverse outcomes in older people with depression and to examine risks by class of antidepressant, duration of use, and dose.
   Design Cohort study of people aged 65 and over diagnosed as having depression.
   Setting 570 general practices in the United Kingdom supplying data to the QResearch primary care database.
   Participants 60 746 patients diagnosed as having a new episode of depression between the ages of 65 and 100 years from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2007 and followed up until 31 December 2008.
   Main outcome measures Hazard ratios associated with antidepressant use for all cause mortality, attempted suicide/self harm, myocardial infarction, stroke/transient ischaemic attack, falls, fractures, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, epilepsy/seizures, road traffic accidents, adverse drug reactions, and hyponatraemia, adjusted for a range of potential confounding variables. Hazard ratios were calculated for antidepressant class (tricyclic and related antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, other antidepressants), dose, and duration of use and for commonly prescribed individual drugs.
   Results 54 038 (89.0%) patients received at least one prescription for an antidepressant during follow-up. A total of 1 398 359 antidepressant prescriptions were issued: 764 659 (54.7%) for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 442 192 (31.6%) for tricyclic antidepressants, 2203 (0.2%) for monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and 189 305 (13.5%) for the group of other antidepressants. The associations with the adverse outcomes differed significantly between the antidepressant classes for seven outcomes. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were associated with the highest adjusted hazard ratios for falls (1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.58 to 1.73) and hyponatraemia (1.52, 1.33 to 1.75) compared with when antidepressants were not being used. The group of other antidepressants was associated with the highest adjusted hazard ratios for all cause mortality (1.66, 1.56 to 1.77), attempted suicide/self harm (5.16, 3.90 to 6.83), stroke/transient ischaemic attack (1.37, 1.22 to 1.55), fracture (1.64, 1.46 to 1.84), and epilepsy/seizures (2.24, 1.60 to 3.15), compared with when antidepressants were not being used. Tricyclic antidepressants did not have the highest hazard ratio for any of the outcomes. Significantly different associations also existed between the individual drugs for the same seven outcomes; trazodone (tricyclic antidepressant), mirtazapine, and venlafaxine (both in the group of other antidepressants) were associated with the highest rates for some of these outcomes. Absolute risks over 1 year for all cause mortality were 7.04% for patients while not taking antidepressants, 8.12% for those taking tricyclic antidepressants, 10.61% for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and 11.43% for other antidepressants.
   Conclusions Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and drugs in the group of other antidepressants were associated with an increased risk of several adverse outcomes compared with tricyclic antidepressants. Among individual drugs, trazodone, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine were associated with the highest risks for some outcomes. As this is an observational study, it is susceptible to confounding by indication, channelling bias, and residual confounding, so differences in characteristics between patients prescribed different antidepressant drugs that could account for some of the associations between the drugs and the adverse outcomes may remain. Further research is needed to confirm these findings, but the risks and benefits of different antidepressants should be carefully evaluated when these drugs are prescribed to older people.

TI Public stigma in health and non-healthcare students: Attributions,
   emotions and willingness to help with adolescent self-harm

AB Background: For people who self-harm, there is growing evidence to suggest that services and treatment outcomes can be adversely affected by healthcare staffs' stigmatising attitudes and behaviours. To date, the empirical literature has tended to focus on the attitudes of experienced healthcare professionals working with adults who self-harm. Additionally, there has been few theory or model-driven studies to help identify what healthcare students think and feel about young people who self-harm.
   Objectives: The aim of the present study was to explore the way healthcare and non-healthcare students think and feel about adolescent self-harm behaviour using Corrigan et al.'s [Corrigan, P.W., Markowitz, F.E., Watson. A., Rowan. D., Kubiak, M.A., 2003. An attribution model of public discrimination towards people with mental illness. Journal of Health and Social Behaviour 44, 162-179] attribution model of public discrimination towards people with mental illness.
   Design: The study was a questionnaire-based, cross-sectional. survey that consisted of two hypothetical vignettes.
   Settings: Two universities in England, United Kingdom.
   Participants: One hundred and eighty-four final-year students, covering health (medicine, nursing, clinical psychology) and non-health care (physics) professions.
   Methods: Students were presented with vignettes describing a young female who self-harms. Attributions of controllability were experimentally manipulated across the vignette conditions and students were asked to complete self-report questionnaires measuring attitudes towards self-harm. familiarity with self-harm and social desirability.
   Results: Consistent with the public discrimination model. students who believed that a young person was responsible for their self-harm reported higher feelings of anger towards them. Anger. in turn, was associated with a belief in the manipulatory nature of the self-harm and with less willingness to help. Perceived risk was found to be associated with higher levels of anxiety and increased support for the use of coercive and segregatory strategies to manage self-harming behaviour. Gender and student type were important influences on public stigma. with both men and medical students reporting more negative attitudes towards self-harm.
   Conclusions: This study provides evidence that a number of factors may adversely affect the care and treatment received by young people who self-harm, namely: students' causal attributions, the gender and profession of healthcare students, and familiarity with self-harm behaviour. To improve the effectiveness of service provision and treatment outcomes for people who self-harm, it is important that health care service providers and teaching institutions consider the implications of these factors when developing staff and services. and base interventions on theoretical models of stigma and discrimination.

TI Are maternal deaths on the ascent in Singapore? A review of maternal

   PREGNANCY
AB Introduction: In Singapore, published maternal mortality rates (MMR) over the last decade (1990 to 1999) have been so low (0.0 to 1.0 per 1000 live births and still births) as to imply that maternal deaths are rare to the point of being non-existent in some years. This inference is counterintuitive, and earlier studies on maternal mortality, amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) have also suggested otherwise. Accordingly, local trends in maternal mortality warrant further examination. Materials and Methods: A descriptive and comparative study, comprising a clinico-pathological review of maternal deaths,for which autopsies were conducted by the Centre for Forensic Medicine, during a 10-year period from 1990 to 1999. The annual necropsy-based, MMR (estimated MMR), as well as the prevalence of maternal deaths during this time, were estimated with the aid of the relevant, published demographic data on live births and still births. These were compared with the corresponding rates calculated (calculated, MMR) from raw demographic data on maternal deaths classified as such in the published data. Results: Coronial autopsies were conducted on a total of 51 cases of maternal death, of which 33, 17 and I were direct, indirect and fortuitous deaths, respectively. The annual, estimated MMR ranged from 0.4 to 1.8 per 10,000 live births and still births. The estimated MMR was twice as high as the calculated MMR and a statistically significant upward linear trend was demonstrated for the former (P = 0.046). AFE (16151) and PTE (10151) were the two most common causes of maternal death; their corresponding cause-specific, 10-year prevalence being 0.33 and 0.21 per 10,000 live births and stillbirths, respectively. There was apparent clustering of the cases of PTE during the earlier part of the last decade (1990 to 1995), corresponding to a statistical l, significant, upward trend in its overall necropsy incidence during that time (P = 0.019). Cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders constituted the bulk of indirect deaths (13/17), while antenatal suicides accounted for 3 of these deaths (0.06 per 10,000 live births and still births). Conclusions: This was an upward trend in MMR, as reflected in coronial casework, over the last decade. It would appear that the local, estimated (direct and indirect) maternal mortality prevalence compares favourably with the MMR reported in developed countries. The apparent rate of AFE was no less than 4 times higher than that reported in the United Kingdom, while the maternal mortality rate from PTE was at least as high. Allowing for the possibility that such deaths were under-reported, the actual annual MMR and 10-year prevalence could be appreciably, higher than the estimates presented here. There in ay well be a case for the establishment of a comprehensive database of maternal deaths, that is updated continually and contemporaneously, in Singapore.

AB Terrorism and insurgence of varying magnitude at the national and international levels have continued to threaten global peace and kept most governments and communities of the world on toes. Terrorism is the use of violence against a civilian population or non-combatant group to compel government or an international organization to act or abstain from doing an act [1], [2]. The 11th September, 2001 (9/11) simultaneous attacks in US on the World Trade Centre in New York, the Pentagon in Virginia and site at Pennsylvania claiming over 3,996 lives and leaving over 6000 others injured and which brought down to rabbles one of the biggest edifices of our time and stirred the whole world out of complacency is a typical act of terrorism. This singular event more than any previous cases of terrorism has put most nations on red alert while similar affronts to human peace and comfort continue to heighten as they last in other parts of the globe[2]. For more than a decade now, terrorism and insurgence have taken the nations of the world by storm. What started as pockets of disaffection and protests reactions at different parts of the world has assumed unimaginable sophistication and startling dimensions. The bombing and sinking of British Palestine Ship at Haifa killing 267 persons on board and Leaving 172 injured in 1940 and the poisoning of bread for prisoners in Camp Stalag 13, Germany in 1946 where 148 persons died and 124 injured [3], are nothing to compare with the 9/11 attack. The hijacking of planes and detonating of bombs by suicide bombers killing themselves and their unsuspecting victims in aircrafts, trains and train platforms, parks and garages, churches, market places, hotels, night clubs, cinema houses and even hospitals and schools where our young go to learn to improve the quality of humanity is an unparalleled dimension of terrorism[3],[2]. The Beslan school hostage in Russia in September 1-3, 2004 where 385 persons died and 783 were injured; the multiple bombing in London, United Kingdom in 2005 where 65 people died and over 700 were injured; Peshawar School attack in Pakistan in December, 2014 where 170 persons died and un-estimated number injured, and the abduction of 300 school girls in Chibok, Nigeria and taken to unknown destination since 2014 as well as the coordinated attack on Paris and St Denis, France in November 13, 2015, killing 130 persons and leaving hundreds injured is not only a clear indication of extreme radicalization of local affairs but an attempt to annihilate the world. As a matter of fact, peace is eluding many nations of the world including Nigeria [4],[5]. Of a truth, peace is eluding the whole world. Peace is when people are able to resolve conflicts without violence and can work together to improve the quality of their lives; when everyone live in safety, without fear or threat of violence and no form of violence is tolerated[6]. If this definition of peace is true then no nation today is at peace with itself thus making the concern in this study more compelling.
