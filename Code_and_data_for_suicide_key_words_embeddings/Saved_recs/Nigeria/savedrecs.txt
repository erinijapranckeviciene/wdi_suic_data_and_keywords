AB Objective: There is paucity of information on epilepsy and suicide in Nigeria. The objective of this study therefore was to assess the prevalence and determinants of suicide risk among adults with epilepsy (AWE) in Kaduna, Nigeria.
   Method: We administered the suicidality module of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, the three-item Oslo Social Support Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to 170 consecutive AWE attending the outpatient clinic of Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital, Kaduna, between January and June 2011 to determine the prevalence of suicide risk, the level of social support and the psychological symptoms, respectively. We also recorded the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects.
   Results: There are 99 males and 71 females. The subject's mean age was 28.7 +/- 12.1 years. The prevalence of suicide risk was 20.0%. Short seizure-free periods (chi(2)=4.658, P=.031), previous suicide attempts (chi(2)=12.216, P<.001), anxiety symptoms (chi(2)=5.075, P=.024) and depressive symptoms (chi(2)=5.093, P=.016) were significantly associated with suicidal tendencies. However, after a logistic regression analysis, none of the above variables predicted suicide risk.
   Conclusion: Suicide risk is common among AWE. Poor seizure control, previous suicidal attempts and emotional distress are associated factors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DE suicide bombing; terrorism; Boko Haram; Nigeria
ID TERRORISM
AB Boko Haram first began using the tactic of suicide bombings in 2011 and in 2014 started using female suicide bombers. This research focuses on gender differences in the use of suicide bombers. The data were collected using open sources from June 16, 2011 to June 15, 2018. Using this longitudinal data, trends are described over that 7-year period, focusing on the use of females. A majority of the suicide bombings target civilians in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. More than half of the bombers were women and girls, some as young as 7 years old, whereas there were more than 60 incidents where the bomber was below the age of 15. More female bombers were used to targets civilians, whereas men were used more often to target government, police, and military targets. Female suicide bombers were used in Cameroon, whereas males were used in Nigeria more often. Additionally, females used suicide belts or vests more often, whereas men comprised the overwhelming majority of vehicle-borne suicide bombings. There were coercive aspects in many cases in the use of the women as bombers. The unprecedented use of female suicide bombers, particularly young girls, needs to be a focal point of any policy moving forward.

AB Female suicide bombers are increasingly seen in conflicts throughout the world; in recent years, they have become much more prevalent in religious-fundamentalist conflict. Specifically, global jihadist groups are increasingly incorporating female suicide bombers into their operations, a significant ideological and operational shift for most of these groups. Jihadist groups are using women to fill a recruiting void, to achieve tactical surprise, and for strategic purposes. Female suicide bombers are likely to emerge in jihadist conflicts throughout the world, from Nigeria to Pakistan and beyond.

AB Background. Adolescents are prone to various forms of behavioral problems. These behavioral issues in adolescents can have serious consequences for the adolescents. Objectives. The objectives of the study are to determine the causative factors of adolescent problems and specific manifestations. Methods. Behavioral problems were investigated using a random sampling of adolescents from secondary schools in southeast Nigeria from February to April, 2014. A self-administered questionnaire was developed from Health Kids Colorado Questionnaire. Results. A total of 763 subjects completed the questionnaire. Adolescents who reported to have used tobacco 3 to 5 and 6 to 9 times during the last 30 days are just 3.14% and 3.4%, respectively. Nineteen (2.49%) adolescents claimed that they have had sex before but not in the last 3months. Adolescents who attempted suicide are from 15 years and peaked at 18. Eighty-three (11%) adolescents who are 15 years old attempted suicide in a year; this peaks at 17 years where 235 (30.8%) committed suicide. Majority of adolescents with behavioral disorder are from the upper class family. Conclusion. This study revealed that adolescents exhibit several forms of behavioral problems.

AB Background: People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) face various day-to-day and long-term personal, interpersonal, social, physical and psychological challenges as a result of, and in addition to the health conditions they are susceptible to due to their HIV status. There is a dearth of large-scale research to provide robust prevalence estimates of mental health problems among PLHIV, especially in Nigeria. This study aimed to ascertain the prevalence and factors associated with major depressive episodes, suicidality, and alcohol use disorder among people living with HIV/AIDS in Nigeria.
   Methods: A survey of 1187 participants aged 18 years and above was conducted within three HIV treatment centres in Abuja, Nigeria. Depression, suicidality, and alcohol use disorder modules of the WHO World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview questionnaire were used for this study. A socio-demographic questionnaire was also used to collect other health and demographic data. Descriptive statistics (frequency distribution, percentage, mean, median, mode, and standard deviation) and regression analyses were conducted to explore associations between mental health problems and demographic and other health-related factors.
   Results: Twelve-month prevalence rates were 28.2% for major depressive episodes, 2.9% for suicidal ideation, 2.3% for suicide attempts, 7.8% for harmful alcohol use, 7.0% for alcohol abuse, and 2.2% for alcohol dependence. Major depressive episodes were significantly associated with having planned suicide and marital status. Suicidal ideation was significantly associated with major depressive episodes, marital status, and religion. Females were less likely to be diagnosed with alcohol disorders.
   Conclusions: Some people living with HIV/AIDS also tend to suffer from depression, suicidality, and alcohol use disorders. These findings highlight the need for the integration of mental health services into HIV/AIDS care in Nigeria.

LA English
DT Article
DE Boko Haram; Children; Suicide bombing; Terrorist group; Women
AB Terrorism has taken a new and frightening dimension in Nigeria. The manifestation is the incessant use of women and children in suicide bombing by the Boko Haram terrorist group. Examining this operational shift provided further impetus and insights into understanding the core of the problem. It brought to light the fact that Nigeria is a society where patriarchy holds sway and certain salient socio-political structures (culture, religion, economy and polity) of the society are unjust and unbalanced, thus placing women and children on the receiving end, while men are at advantage. This was elucidated in the predictions of radical feminist and political economy theories, which we combined to explain why and how this particular group is now widely exploited in suicide missions. The rationale behind their used is to beat security networks and carry out their operations with ease and huge success. Because women and children possess and demonstrate less suspicious behaviour and covert criminogenic tendencies, they stand to escape the scrutiny of security personnel. These natural characteristics confound security operatives and thereby prolonging the war on terrorism. However, many women and children who indulge in terror campaigns do that out of ignorance and usually under extreme indoctrination, brainwashing and manipulations. To remedy the situation, effective and trusted infra and inter-border surveillance/ patrol and intergovernmental security partnership using state-of-the-art crime combating appurtenances, and acquisition of analytical skills in counterintelligence and counterterrorism, are highly recommended. Co-ordinated efforts are needed in the area of psychosocial rehabilitation and consequent reintegration, aftercare and follow-up of released or escaped abducted victims who were once forcefully used by this group in attacking their family and community for their reacceptance and to guard against stigmatisation and rejection. Our cultural and national values should be revisited and overhauled by the government and significant others in society for enduring public safety.

AB Boko Haram insurgency has caused the death and displacement of thousands of Nigerians. Its means of terror has evolved from the use of crude weapons to bombs, kidnappings and the use of children as suicide bombers. Its reach has expanded beyond Nigeria into neighbouring West African countries and it has pledged allegiance to Al-Qaida and Islamic State. To address this security concern, its cause should first be ascertained. This paper argues that to do this, Boko Haram should be located in northern Nigerian historical context/environment. This paper reviews economic greed and grievance, extreme religious ideology and political opportunity in historic insurgencies in northern Nigeria. It finds that while the interplay of different factors shaped these insurgencies; it was political opportunity that ignited their onsets. Finally, the article submits that as long as these factors remain the same, military quelling of Boko Haram will not prevent a re-emergence of its likes.

AB The study sought to predict the acquired capability for suicide from length of sentence and socio-demographic characteristics of offenders in a Nigerian prison population. Participants were 139 inmates (mean age = 33.67, SD = 9.24 years; mean length of stay = 6.25 years, SD = 5.02 years), males (95.7%), They were predominantly incarcerated for armed robbery (39.6%), burglary/stealing (18.0%), homicide (9.4%), and rape (8.6%) in Abeokuta prisons, Nigeria. The participants completed the Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale, and socio-demographic characteristic questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, t-test for independence, and multiple regression analysis were computed to predict suicidal capability among prison population from their socio-demographics. Results revealed that demographic characteristics of type of offence, family membership, and type of family were co-joint predictors of suicide capability among prison inmates. Shorter duration of stay (short termers), being incarcerated for aggravated assault, drug related offences, and stealing were risk factors for acquired suicide capability. The role of family membership and family type were negligible as suicidal risk factors. Correctional services should attend to offender demographics in their suicide prevention support for offenders.

Design and Methods Four hundred and ten participants were administered a socio-demographic and clinical history questionnaire, the 40-item Berger's HIV-stigma scale, and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to diagnose suicidality and depression in a cross-sectional study. Findings Fifty-four (13.2%) reported suicidality; suicidal ideation was commonest and suicide plans least, in the month preceding the study. Higher suicidality risk was significantly associated with stigma (P < 0.001) and major depressive disorder (P < 0.001). Practice Implications Suicidality is common and is associated with HIV-related stigma.

AB Background: Sudden deaths are common findings in Rivers state of Nigeria. The victims of such deaths are subjects, of coroners' autopsies, and the records there from constitute important sources of epidemiological data.
   Aims: To determine the pattern, causes and demographic features of all deaths reported to the coroner for medico legal autopsies in Rivers state of Nigeria.
   Materials and methods: Retrospective descriptive study on reports of coroner autopsies carried out between January 2000 and December 2010 in different mortuaries located across Rivers state was undertaken. The autopsies were unlimited and standardized. Information analyzed were: gender, age, circumstances of death and, autopsy-defined cause of death.
   Results: Of the 1987 cases reviewed, 83.4% were males. The age range was 2 weeks to 98 years with a mean of, 31.7 years. The peak age range was 21-30 years with 46.5%. The manners of deaths in descending order include: homicides with 50.5%, accidents with 32%, sudden natural deaths with 14.1%, maternal deaths with 2.6% and suicides with 0.8%. Males were most affected in homicidal death with average male: female ratio of 12.4:1. Gunshots constituted the commonest means of homicidal deaths, with 67.9% while decapitation was the least with 0.1%. The commonest cause of accidental death was, road traffic accident with 63.6%. Cardiovascular system pathologies were the commonest causes of natural deaths with 46.1%. Illegal abortions with 41.1% were the commonest causes of maternal, deaths and all suicidal cases were committed by hanging.
   Conclusions: Homicides were by far the commonest findings of medico legal autopsies, followed by accidental and natural deaths respectively while suicides were the least in Rivers state of Nigeria. Firearms were the, most frequently used weapons for homicides and road traffic accidents remain the major causes of accidental deaths while cardiovascular system pathologies account for the highest proportion of sudden natural deaths and suicides are committed by hanging. Males within the productive age, brackets of 20-49 years are more affected by sudden deaths of all manners. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The science of the brain and nervous system cuts across almost all aspects of human life and is one of the fastest growing scientific fields worldwide. This necessitates the demand for pragmatic investment by all nations to ensure improved education and quality of research in Neurosciences. Although obvious efforts are being made in advancing the field in developed societies, there is limited data addressing the state of neuroscience in sub-Saharan Africa. Here, we review the state of neuroscience development in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and its largest economy, critically evaluating the history, the current situation and future projections. This review specifically addresses trends in clinical and basic neuroscience research and education. We conclude by highlighting potentially helpful strategies that will catalyse development in neuroscience education and research in Nigeria, among which are an increase in research funding, provision of tools and equipment for training and research, and upgrading of the infrastructure at hand.

AB Nigeria views the HIV self-test (HIVST) as a possible mechanism to help increase HIV testing uptake and capture otherwise undiagnosed HIV cases. The purpose of this survey was to obtain perspectives of informed members of the Nigerian public on the use of the HIVST. A convenience sample of 1712 researchers, academics, journalists, community advocates, activists and HIV policy-makers and programmers including those working in the development sectors enlisted on the New HIV Vaccine and Microbicide Advocacy Society listserv were sent a brief survey. Respondents were asked to provide a 'yes' or 'no' response to an enquiry if they support the introduction of HIVST into Nigeria. Reasons for their response were also recorded. Information was collected anonymously with no identifiers. Only 157 (9.2%) provided a response. While the majority (54.8%) supported the introduction of HIVST, a significant number of respondents were concerned about possible risk associated with self-testing, especially suicide and partner violence. Others were concerned about poor linkages to care. Introduction of HIVST would need to be paired with intense media campaigns and education about its use. Once Nigeria commences HIVST, efforts should also focus on approaches to reach people in hard to reach areas of the country.

AB Background. Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide but information about it is sparse in Sub-Saharan Africa. Suicide-related behaviours can provide an insight into the extent of this compelling consequence of mental illness.
   Method. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with a representative sample of persons aged 18 years and over (n = 6752) in 21 of Nigeria's 36 states (representing about 57 % of the national population). Suicide-related outcomes, mental disorders, as well as history of childhood adversities were assessed using the World Health Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).
   Results. Lifetime prevalence estimates of suicide ideation, plan and attempts were 3.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-6.5], 1-0% (95% CI 0.4-7.5) and 0.7% (95% CI 0.5-1.0) respectively. Almost two of every three ideators who made a plan went on to make an attempt. The highest risks for transition from ideation to plan and from plan to attempt were in the first year of having ideation or plan respectively. Mental disorders, especially mood disorders, were significant correlates of suicide-related outcomes. Childhood adversities of long separation from biological parents, being raised in a household with much conflict, being physically abused, or being brought up by a woman who had suffered from depression, anxiety disorder, or who had attempted suicide were risk factors for lifetime suicide attempt.
   Conclusions. History of childhood adversities and of lifetime mental disorders identify persons at high-risk for suicide-related outcomes. Preventive measures are best delivered within the first year of suicide ideation being expressed.

DE Suicide; Suicide survivor; Perception; Attitude; Complicated grieving;
   Stigma
ID STIGMA; PERCEPTIONS
AB Background Annually, 800, 000 die from suicide worldwide. However, suicide is believed to be rare in our environment. Suicide causes significant life disruptions in people bereaved by it. These disruptions result from associated complicated grieving pattern characterised by stigma, feeling of shame, responsibility, guilt, etc. People therefore usually want to be certain that their relation indeed died from suicide. Being certain can in part help survivors achieve closure. A pathologist is often called upon to diagnose the actual cause of death in suspected suicide. The aim of this paper is to highlight the perception and attitude of survivors to suicide in our environment. Methods This is a prospective study carried out in Enugu State University Teaching Hospital, Enugu, Nigeria. Data was obtained by audio-recording and transcription of face-to-face interviews of 8 groups of relatives who had presented to the pathologist for autopsy of their relation suspected to have committed suicide. Transcribed data was double checked for accuracy and analysed. Informed consent was obtained from participants. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Ethical Committee of the hospital. Results There were 8 cases of suspected suicide over a 7-year period accounting for 0.6% of all violent deaths in the period. The central attitude of survivors in all the cases was denial of the event. At all the meetings survivors desired the pathologist to report cause of death differently than suicide. Also, in all cases, the extended family felt affected by the event. The following six themes in descending order of importance were identified to underlie survivors' attitude to suicide: fear of stigma and its consequent isolation, fear of economic repercussions, a conflict of choice of cause of death stemming from religious beliefs about the afterlife, feeling of shame and anger against the deceased and fear that acknowledging the event may bring a repeat in the family. Conclusion There is profound fear of stigma and associative concerns which leads to outright suicide-denial. There is a need to educate the society about the reality and dynamics of suicide. This will make a bereaved person open to receiving requisite care.

AB Suicidality has been reported to be common in persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Reports from sub-Saharan countries have been scanty. We surveyed the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempt among PLWHAs (n = 150) and compared them with staff of a local government who acted as controls. Over a third (34.7%) of PLWHAs versus 4% of controls expressed suicidal ideation in the preceding month, with 9.3% attempting suicide in the six months prior to the study. Commonest type of attempt was a drug overdose. Female gender, unemployment, co-morbid illness, living alone and having a partner with the disease were associated with suicidal ideation. Clinicians should routinely enquire about suicidality in PLWHAs to reduce mortality.

AB Objective: Aggression is a common feature in psychiatric in-patient units in Africa. The attitudes of psychiatric nurses and their perceptions of the frequency of in-patient aggression have not been explored in the Nigerian context. Method: Using a cross-sectional study design, two self-report questionnaires (the Attitudes toward Aggression Scale (ATAS) and the Perception of the Prevalence of Aggression Scale (POPAS)) were administered to nursing staff (n=73) at two psychiatric facilities in Benin City, Nigeria. Results: Overall, nurses viewed aggression as offensive, destructive and intrusive. They were less likely to view it as a means of communication or serving protective functions. Verbal aggression was the commonest type of aggression experienced while sexual intimidation and suicide attempts were least common. Male nurses were more likely to experience physical violence and aggressive 'splitting' behaviours, while nurses with over a decade of professional experience were more likely to experience verbal and humiliating aggressive behaviours. In contrast to previous studies, fewer nurses required days off work due to aggressive behaviour, Conclusion: Aggression is commonly experienced by nurses in in-patient units in Nigeria. Their views were predominantly negative. Training programmes are required to change staff attitudes as well as research on the cultural factors mediating these attitude dispositions.

AB Objective: This study attempted to explore the feasibility of use of the 18-item Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R) as a subjective suicide risk assessment tool in a cross-sectional sample of Nigerian patients with schizophrenia. Materials and Methods: Two hundred and thirty-two outpatients with schizophrenia were recruited from the mental health clinic of a university teaching hospital in Southwestern Nigeria. They completed the OCI-R in addition to the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and a sociodemographic and illness-related questionnaire. The patients were objectively interviewed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview suicidality module items to assess their suicide risk. Results: The 18-item OCI-R demonstrated satisfactory sensitivity (0.900) and specificity (0.662) at a total cutoff score of 10 in relation to the identification of Nigerian patients with schizophrenia with significant suicide risk. At this cutoff score, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.817 (95% confidence interval: 0.735-0.898), and positive predictive value (0.726) and negative predictive value (0.869) were also satisfactory. The OCI-R also demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency and construct validity. Conclusion: The OCI-R has demonstrated to be useful as a subjective suicide risk assessment tool among Nigerian schizophrenia patients.

AB The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, and the Millennium Development Goals, brought the inclusion of women in the security agenda into the international limelight. Although these global frameworks, and other international resolutions, underscore the importance of women's participation in the politics of peace and security, Nigeria's frameworks have not been inclusive. Extant literature has examined the role of women within the context of mainstream responsibilities for "counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency" that are held by the military and paramilitary forces. This study interrogates the role of women-led civil society organizations in "countering violent extremism" activities in Nigeria. Using a mixed-methods approach, it demonstrates that the participation of women-led civil society organizations in "countering violent extremism" activities has generated certain positive results for achieving women's inclusion and gender equality in politics and society.

TI Boko Haram insurgency and gendered victimhood: women as corporal victims

SO SMALL WARS AND INSURGENCIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Boko Haram; gender; insurgency; objectification; women; victimhood
AB Boko Haram insurgency in North East Nigeria has exposed women (girls, ladies, and mothers) to a complex jeopardy. While some women have suffered untimely widowhood or child-lack as a result of the Boko Haram onslaught, others have suffered death, forced abduction, and allied assaults on the main and side lines of the insurgency. Oftentimes, women have faced direct violence that essentially degrade their humanity. This is evident in the deployment of women as war-front sex slaves, human shields, and suicide bombers by the insurgents. The virtual expendability of women in the context of Boko Haram insurgency has been vividly demonstrated by the gale of female suicide bombings in Nigeria over the recent years. By means of a textual and contextual analysis of library sources and/or documentary data, as well as an adroit application of the theory of objectification, this study posits that, in addition to suffering collateral vulnerabilities, women have equally been instrumentalized as objects of terror in the context of Boko Haram insurgency. The paper further argues that the 'weaponization' of women's bodies as bomb vessels and human shields by the insurgents highlights the height of women's corporal victimization and objectification in contemporary asymmetric warfare.

AB To estimate the prevalence, types and comorbidity of the most common mental disorders and the spread of suicide risk in a primary care practice in Kenya.
   This was a cross-sectional descriptive study. A total of 300 adult outpatients were randomly selected while they were consulting their general practitioner. The M.I.N.I. Plus interview five was used to diagnose psychiatric disorders and suicide risk.
   Thus, 56.3 % of the sample (n = 169) presented one or more psychiatric disorders. The most prevalent disorders were Affective (39.0 %), Anxiety (31.3 %), and Somatoform (13.0 %). Regarding specific disorders, the most common were Major Depressive Disorder (26.3 %), Agoraphobia (16.7 %), Pain Disorder (12.5 %), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (9.3 %) and Bipolar Disorder (9 %). We found three cases of Bulimia Nervosa (1 %); 29.7 % had more than one current mental disorder. Suicide risk was present in 12.7 % of participants. No associations were identified between socio-demographic factors and the presence of mental disorder. Suicide risk was higher in women and in patients who came from slum areas. Gastric pain was positively associated with presence of mental disorder.
   High prevalence of mental disorders and suicide risk calls for integrating mental health services in primary health care; in particular, this study highlights the importance of differentiating between specific types of mental disorders (which require different therapeutic approaches), and of diagnosing comorbidities.

AB To plan effective school-based adolescent suicide prevention strategies, there is need for valid epidemiology data. The aim of this study was to estimate the current (1 month) prevalence and associated factors of suicidal behaviours (ideation, planning, and attempt) amongst secondary school adolescents in Lagos, Nigeria. A total of 9441 adolescents (4684 males and 4757 females) with mean age 15.61 years (SD 1.49) recruited from 47 public senior secondary schools self-completed questionnaire consisting of sociodemographic, family, school, physical health, and mental health-related variables. Suicidal behaviours (ideation, planning, and attempt) in the past 1 month were also assessed. The weighted 1-month prevalence for suicidal ideation was 6.1% (95% CI 5.5-6.7), suicidal planning was 4.4% (95% CI 3.8-4.9), and suicidal attempt was 2.8% (95% CI 2.4-3.2). The factors significantly associated with suicidal behaviours included being female, not staying with the mother, maternal drinking, witnessing domestic violence, past and present academic difficulties, having no close friend in school and having problems relating with peers and teachers. Also, presence of chronic physical illnesses, depression, anxiety, behavioural disorders, and psychotic-like experiences were associated with adolescent suicidal behaviour. We have shown that a substantial percentage of adolescent have suicidal behaviours, and that there were demographic, family, school, physical health, and psychological health-related factors. We believe that our findings will be important when planning suicide prevention services that could be incorporated into the school mental health services

ID SECONDARY-SCHOOLS; KNOWLEDGE; SUICIDE; ASSOCIATION; PREVALENCE;

AB Background: Depression is a leading cause of disability and has been projected to become the 2nd most burdensome disease by the year 2020; depression has also been found to be the strongest single risk factor for attempted or completed suicides. Adolescent-onset mood disorders are frequently unrecognized or misdiagnosed and often go untreated. While there is a growing literature on the mental health literacy of adults, there has not been a parallel interest in the mental health literacy of young people in Nigeria.
   Methods: The study was a cross-sectional descriptive survey conducted among students of a Federal Government College (high school) in south-east Nigeria. All consenting students in the senior secondary classes (grades 10-12) were recruited, making a total of 285 participants. The participants were presented with the 'friend in need' questionnaire designed to elicit the participants' recognition of the disorder depicted in two vignettes and their recommendation about the appropriate source of help-seeking. One vignette was of a clinically depressed case while the other vignette was about a girl undergoing normal life crisis.
   Results: Out of the 285 students recruited into the study, 277 questionnaires were adequately completed indicating a response rate of 97.2%. A total of 4.8% (n = 13) participants correctly identified and labelled the depression vignette. Only four respondents (1.5%) recommended professional help from a Psychiatrist or Psychologist. Insomnia was the most identified symptom of distress for depression (17.1%). Females demonstrated higher mental health literacy, in terms of their ability to correctly label the depression vignettes, their expression of greater concern over a depressed peer than males, their expectation that depression requires a longer recovery than normal teenage problems and in their ability to identify individual symptoms of depression. Family and friends were the most recommended source of help.
   Conclusion: Mental health literacy was abysmally low amongst the adolescents surveyed. There's an urgent need to increase mental health awareness in Nigeria.

AB Objective: To determine and classify the various types of medicolegal deaths as seen at University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH), Benin City, Nigeria. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study of all the medicolegal deaths seen in the Department of Histopathology, (UBTH, Benin City over a 20 year period (January 1990-December 2009) as recorded in the autopsy registers of the department. Result: A total of 5035 autopsies were done during the period, 89% of which were coroner cases. Four thousand, four hundred and eighty-one coroner cases representing 12.5% of all bodies received by the mortuary during the period were studied. The male to female ratio was 1.9:1, with an overall mean age of 38.3 years. The ages ranged from 1 day to 101 years with a peak incidence in the 25-44 years age group. A total of 553 children and 3928 adults were involved. The commonest indication for coroners autopsy was sudden unexpected natural deaths (SUNDs) which accounted for 65.5% of the cases. Other causes of death were accidents, homicide, suicide, and undetermined causes representing 28.6, 5.0, 0.5, and 0.4%, respectively. Commonest cause of SUND was cardiovascular diseases with complications of hypertension being the most common CVS disease (26.9%). Road traffic accident was the commonest form of accident causing death (88.7%). Public enlightenment and health education about routine medical screening will help to reduce causes of natural deaths. Conclusion: This study shows the pattern of medicolegal autopsies in UBTH and this preliminary data will provide a baseline for future research and help in formulating policies to help in reduction of preventable causes of death.

ID NEWS; FRAMES
AB Media coverage of the 'War on Terror' has generated different frameworks of understanding that have been shaped by meanings and images that emerged after September 11, 2001. These frameworks of meanings are routinely used to structure and contextualize news stories and events associated with terrorism. This article investigates news frames that four Nigerian newspapers applied to the coverage of an attempted suicide attack on a US-bound aircraft on Christmas Day in 2009. It analyses the newspapers' interpretation of the aborted act of terrorism by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a 23-year-old Nigerian man, which resulted in the United States categorizing Nigeria as a 'country of interest in the context of terrorism'. The article outlines recurrent themes and issues that the newspapers primed for their audiences by interrogating a selection of editorial contents of the publications. It seeks to highlight how discursive fields in the coverage emphasized specific understanding of the event. The article argues that the constructed accounts of the foiled attack were framed and structured to create a distance between Abdulmutallab and his country and that the news frames the newspapers used narrowed public understanding of the significance of Abdulmutallab's radicalization and its possible implications for Nigeria.

AB Background: Despite being recognized by the World Health Organization as a significant social and health concern, information on suicidal behaviours in Nigerian adolescents is unknown.
   Aims: To establish the prevalence and associated psychosocial correlates of suicidal ideation and attempts in Nigerian youth.
   Methods: Stratified sampling was used to identify youth aged 10-17 years who completed the Nigeria version of the Global School Health Questionnaire (GSHQ) and the Diagnostic Predictive Scale (DPS) for youths (suicidal behaviour questions) in a classroom setting.
   Results: A total of 1429 youth completed the instruments. Over 20% reported suicidal ideation and approximately 12% reported that they had attempted suicide in the last year. Adolescents living in urban areas, from polygamous or disrupted families, had higher rates of suicidal behaviour. Multiple psychosocial factors such as sexual abuse, physical attack and involvement in physical fights were significant predictors of suicidal behaviour.
   Conclusion: Factors associated with suicidal ideation and behaviours are similar to those found in other studies but the rates of both suicidal ideation and attempts are towards the upper limit of rates for youth. This study suggests that there is an urgent need for Nigerian policymakers and health providers to review and address this issue.

   Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the psychometric characteristics of the 4 item Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) as a screening tool for suicide risk assessment among university undergraduate students in South-western Nigeria.
   Method: This is a cross-sectional descriptive study involving 536 undergraduate Nigerian students. The students completed the SBQ-R, in addition to a sociodemographic and academic related questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the 12 item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ12). Suicidal risk categories among the students were determined by interviewing them with the items of the suicidality module section of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).
   Results: Cronbach's alpha for the SBQ-R items was 0.80. Construct validity was supported through significant positive correlations with the HADS-Anxiety and Depression subscales, and the GHQ-12. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve evaluation suggests that the best cut-off total score with the optimal sensitivity (0.882), specificity (0.875) and highest accuracy (0.879) was 8 in terms of identifying the students at high risk of suicide (Area Under the Curve = 0.928; 95% Confidence Interval = 0.890-0.966; Standard Error = 0.019).
   Conclusions: The use of the SBQ-R may be an important and vital step in the prevention of suicidal attempts among Nigerian university students. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An upsurge in gun violence in recent times in our environment necessitated this study, which aims to document the patterns of fatal gunshot injuries with the hope of finding a solution to this problem. The study was a retrospective analysis of cases of fatal gunshot injuries on which autopsies were carried out over the 5-year period from January 1998 to December 2002 at Police Medical Services, Benin City - a Nigerian ancient town located in the South-South zone of the country. Most cases of medico-legal death in Benin City and environs are referred to the Police Pathologist at the center for autopsy. A total of 210 cases representing 27.2% of all medico-legal deaths during the study period were reviewed. Males were far more affected than females (M:F = 10.7:1). The intent for the fatal gunshots was murder (88.5%), excusable homicide (4.8%), accident (4.3%) and suicide (0.5%). In 1.9% of the deaths, the circumstances were not clear. Armed robbers, thugs and assassins accounted for 88.1% of the fatal shots, while the Police accounted for 9.0%. The trunk was affected much more than the head, neck and limbs. There is a need to improve security in the country and reduce poverty. Illegal firearms should also be removed from circulation. An improvement in emergency health services will reduce deaths from gunshots.

AB Substantial evidence indicates that adolescents and young adults have a disproportionately high incidence of most forms of violence, including suicide. Suicidality often includes suicidal ideation. The present study examined the relationship between bullying and suicidal ideation, and further tested whether social support moderates the association between the dimensions of bullying (verbal bullying, physical bullying, and bullying victimization) and suicidal ideation among adolescent secondary school students. A cross-sectional design was adopted for the study. Participants were 394 students (249 boys, 145 girls) drawn from two secondary schools in Nsukka semi-urban area, in southeast Nigeria. Participants completed the Illinois Bully Scale, the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Hayes' regression-based PROCESS macro was used to analyze the data. Verbal bullying, physical bullying, and victimization were independently positively associated with suicidal ideation. Social support was not independently significantly associated with suicidal ideation, but it moderated the relationship between victimization and suicidal ideation. The positive relationship between victimization and suicidal ideation was strongest for adolescents who had low social support, compared to those who had moderate or high social support. This finding is consistent with the buffering hypothesis of social support, suggesting that supportive relationships for victims can mitigate suicidal ideation.

AB Background: Alcohol-related problems are increasing among Nigerian University students. However, very few studies have explored the ways in which hazardous drinking practices facilitate these problems in Nigerian University students, aside from quantitative studies focussing on students in South-Western Nigeria. Methods: Drawing on qualitative semi-structured interviews involving students from a South-Eastern Nigerian University, this study begins to address these gaps. The participants were recruited through convenience and snowballing sampling techniques, and the data were analysed thematically. Results: The findings show that 24 out of 31 participants engaged in heavy drinking by consuming between 3 and 9 bottles of beer/stout or flavoured spirits regularly. These heavy drinkers had suffered financial, academic, and health problems. Some lost valuable personal items such as mobile phones, wallets, and money as a result of drinking, while others missed examinations because drinking had rendered them either too ill or had caused them to oversleep and missed the examination. Almost all participants had suffered multiple health-related problems such as hangovers, accidents and injuries, liver enlargement, stomach ache, attempted suicide (under the influence of alcohol), and sex with strangers. Conclusion: Evidence-based public health interventions to address easy alcohol availability and heavy drinking should be implemented in Nigerian Universities.

AB The aims of the study were to examine: the frequency of the subtypes and symptoms of depression, the stability of symptoms in 3 months and to compare the data with previous studies. Ninety-six consecutive patients (31 males, 65 females) fulfilling ICD-10 criteria were assessed. Compared with the WHO study, the core symptoms of depression were similar; pathological guilt and suicidal behaviour were less prevalent, and psychoticism was more prevalent. Overall, 61.5% had severe depression, 64.6% had somatic syndrome, and subjects were in remission at follow-up. The results were similar to those of a report from the hospital 26 years earlier. The purported rarity of guilt, self-depreciation, suicide and psychotic symptoms should not imply rarity of severe depression among Africans; for these are not its commonest symptoms.

AB Introduction: Coerced and forced sexual initiation (FSI) can have detrimental effects on children and youth. Understanding health outcomes that are associated with experiences of FSI is important for developing appropriate strategies for prevention and treatment of FSI and its consequences.
   Methods: The Violence Against Children Surveys were conducted in Nigeria, Uganda, and Zambia in 2014 and 2015. We examined the prevalence of FSI and its consequences (sexual high-risk behaviors, violence experiences, mental health outcomes, and sexually transmitted infections (STI)) associated with FSI among youth aged 13-24 years in three countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
   Results: Over one in ten youth aged 13-24 years who had ever had sex experienced FSI in Nigeria, Uganda, and Zambia. In multivariable logistic regression, FSI was significantly associated with infrequent condom use (OR = 1.4, 95%CI = 1.1-2.1), recent experiences of sexual violence (OR = 1.6, 95%CI: 1.1-2.3), physical violence (OR = 2.2, 95%CI: 1.6-3.0), and emotional violence (OR = 2.0, 95%CI: 1.3-2.9), moderate/serious mental distress (OR = 1.5, 95%CI: 1.1-2.0), hurting oneself (OR = 2.0, 95%CI: 1.3-3.1), and thoughts of suicide (OR = 1.5, 95%CI: 1.1-2.3), after controlling for demographic characteristics. FSI was not statistically associated with engaging in transactional sex, having multiple sex partners, or having a STI.
   Conclusion: FSI is associated with infrequent condom use, recent experiences of violence and mental health outcomes among youth in sub-Saharan Africa, which may increase the risk for HIV and other consequences. Developing strategies for prevention is important for reducing the prevalence of FSI and its effects on children and youth.

AB Background: In order to facilitate case identification of incident (untreated and recent onset) cases of psychosis and controls in three sites in India, Nigeria and Trinidad, we sought to understand how psychoses (or madness) were conceptualized locally. The evidence we gathered also contributes to a long history of research on concepts of madness in diverse settings.
   Methods: We conducted focus group discussions and individual interviews to collect information about how informants in each site make sense of and respond to madness. A coding framework was developed and analyses of transcripts from the FGDs and interviews were conducted.
   Results: Analyses suggest the following: a) disturbed behaviors are the primary sign of madness; b) madness is attributed to a wide range of causes; and, c) responses to madness are dictated by cultural and pragmatic factors. These findings are congruent with similar research that has been conducted over the past 50 years.
   Conclusions: The INTREPID research suggests that concepts about madness share similar features across diverse settings: a) terms for madness are often derived from a common understanding that involves disruptions in mental processes and capacities; b) madness is recognized mostly by disruptive behaviours or marked declines in functioning; c) causal attributions are varied; and, d) help-seeking is a complex process.

AB Purpose: Globally, adolescents are at risk of depression, traumatic stress, and suicide, especially those living in vulnerable environments. This article examines the mental health of 15- to 19-year-old youth in five cities and identifies the social support correlates of mental health.
   Methods: A total of 2,393 adolescents aged 15-19 years in economically distressed neighborhoods in Baltimore, MD; New Delhi, India; Ibadan, Nigeria; Johannesburg, South Africa; and Shanghai, China were recruited in 2013 via respondent-driven sampling to participate in a survey using an audio computer-assisted self-interview. Weighted logistic regression and general linear models were used to explore the associations between mental health and social supports.
   Results: The highest levels of depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms were displayed in Johannesburg among females (44.6% and 67.0%, respectively), whereas the lowest were among New Delhi females andmales (13.0% and 16.3%, respectively). The prevalence of suicidal ideation ranged from 7.9% (New Delhi female adolescents) to 39.6% (Johannesburg female adolescents); the 12-month prevalence of suicide attempts ranged from 1.8% (New Delhi females) to 18.3% (Ibadan males). Elevated perceptions of having a caring female adult in the home and feeling connected to their neighborhoods were positively associated with adolescents' levels of hope across the sites while negatively associated with depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms with some variation across sites and gender.
   Conclusions: Adolescents living in the very economically distressed areas studied register high levels of depression and posttraumatic stress. Improving social supports in families and neighborhoods may alleviate distress and foster hope. In particular, strengthening supports from female caretakers to their adolescents at home may improve the outlooks of their daughters. (C) 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB Objectives: Suicide is best studied by deconstructing the psychological experiences preceding suicidal death. We assessed the characteristics of tedium vitae (feeling tired of life) after first ever stroke in Nigerian survivors. Methods: Using the Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry, tedium vitae was assessed in 130 stroke survivors attending rehabilitation in a large Nigerian university hospital. Global cognitive and executive dysfunctions were evaluated, respectively, using the Mini Mental State Examination and the modi?ed Indiana University Token test. All participants had their index stroke 3 to 24 months before recruitment into the study. We also examined a comparative group of 130 age, gender, and education matched apparently normal persons who were unrelated to the stroke survivors. Associations were explored using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results: Tedium vitae was experienced by 16 (12.3%) stroke survivors compared with 5 (3.9%) in the comparative group (O. R = 3.5, 95% C. I = 1.3-9.9, p = 0.018). Among stroke survivors, those who were retired were more likely to experience tedium vitae (56.2%, p = 0.045). In analyses adjusting for the effect of systemic hypertension, cognitive dysfunction, retirement and marital separation, there was a 3.5-fold increase in the odds of experiencing tedium vitae after surviving a stroke (O. R = 3.5, 95% C. I = 1.1-11.6, p = 0.042). Conclusions: Tedium vitae is a common suicidal experience after stroke and may be among the earliest perceptible pointer to impending poststroke suicide. It is easy to assess and may be less costly to obtain an adequate sample size in studies aiming to understand the phenomenon of suicide in the stroke population.

AB Purpose: To examine the chief causes and influences of morbidity and mortality among young people throughout the world.
   Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted that included WHO's Global Burden of Disease, UNFPA's State of the Worlds' Population, Medline, Popline, Sociological Abstracts, as well as data collected from UNICEF, UNAIDS, Population Reference Bureau, and the United Nations Headquarters. Experts in the fields of substance use, suicide, and infectious diseases were also contacted for unpublished and published sources. Studies were restricted to those completed after 1985, had a sample size of at least 100, focused primarily on the age group of 10-24 years, and examined trends related to unintentional injuries, HIV/AIDS, suicide, homicide, war, maternal mortality, pregnancy, abortion, sexually transmitted diseases, substance abuse, and infectious diseases.
   Results: Trends in adolescent morbidity and mortality have shifted over the past decade from predominately infectious to social etiologies. Currently, unintentional injury is the leading killer of young people in nearly every region of the world, with homicide, war, and interpersonal violence following closely behind.
   Conclusions: The changes in population, migration, age of marriage, and education have had profound impact on the mortality and morbidity among adolescents. As we come to learn about the factors that influence adolescent morbidity and mortality, we begin to have a better understanding of how to improve the health of youth throughout the world.

AB Background Bipolar disorder impacts negatively on the patient, the family, as well as the society. It taxes the health care services due to a combination of the illness with associated medical and psychiatric comorbidities. In Africa, unfortunately, knowledge of the epidemiology and burden of bipolar disorder is based mainly on studies from the USA and Europe. In this systematic review of literature from Africa, we highlight the epidemiology and burden of bipolar disorder.
   Methods A systematic review of publications from Africa relating to the epidemiology and burden of bipolar disorder was conducted.
   Result Data from community surveys conducted in Nigeria and Ethiopia indicated a lifetime prevalence estimate of 0.1 % to 1.83 for bipolar disorder. Missed diagnosis rate of bipolar disorder was up to 36.2 %. In one study, 8.1 % of the males and 5.4 % of the females reported a previous suicide attempt. A study showed that up to 60 % of patients with bipolar disorder had at least one comorbidity. There were no reports on all-cause mortality and cost of illness.
   Conclusion Bipolar disorder is a major mental health problem in Africa. Scientific findings on bipolar disorder from Africa are consistent with the existing literature from other parts of the world. There still exists a dearth of high quality studies addressing the epidemiological, clinical, social, and economic burden of the disorder.

Six illustrative patients are presented, each with a peculiar injury. All the patients except one, who died prior to surgery, had wound debridement and elevation of associated fractures with removal of the metallic foreign body. With the exception of the patient that died prior to surgical intervention, all did well without noticeable neurological deficits. Missile injury to the head is increasing. Firearm-related death is also on the increase and our environment is not exempted. Accidental injuries from stray bullets are fairly common; however, self-inflicted injuries are usually due to the improper handling of. rearms, particularly by novices, suicide attempts and faulty technology of locally made firearms.

Socio-demographic questionnaire, Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Suicidality module of the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Inventory were administered.Results: The prevalence of OCS was 54.3% among patients with schizophrenia, and washing symptom was the most common (51.7%). Patients with schizophrenia that had OCS had more severe psychopathologies and higher levels of suicidality. OCS among patients with schizophrenia were also associated with the use of second-generation antipsychotic medications.Conclusions: OCS are common in schizophrenia. Hence, there is a need for routine screening of patients with schizophrenia for OCS and then, manage them appropriately.

ID RISK-FACTORS; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; INDIVIDUALS; DEPRESSION; BEHAVIOR
AB Introduction: Adolescents with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) have been reported to have a higher prevalence of suicidal behavior compared to those who were HIV negative. Suicidal ideation is an important comorbidity in adolescents with HIV because it has been shown to be a good predictor of both attempted and completed suicide in this group of people.
   Material and methods: Participants (n = 201) who met the inclusion criteria were consecutively recruited from Lagos State University Teaching Hospital and the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research. Confidentiality was maintained. All the questionnaires were filled by participants, except for the MINI-Kid, which was administered by the researcher.
   Results were analyzed with SPSS version 20. Results: Prevalence of current and lifetime suicidal ideation was 14.9% and 33.3% respectively. Non-disclosure (p = 0.021) and physical and emotional abuse (p = 0.009, p = 0.020) were associated with lifetime suicidal ideation, while gender (p = 0.025), primary school (p = 0.017), polygamous family (p = 0.040), poor social support (p = 0.031), decline in academic performance (p = 0.005), loss of family member (p = 0.007), discrimination (p = 0.040), and physical and emotional abuse (p = 0.027, p = 0.002) were associated with current suicidal ideation. Only loss of family member to HIV (p = 0.003) was associated with current suicidal ideation after a binary logistic regression analysis.
   Conclusions: Findings from this study highlight the need for clinicians to regularly assess adolescents with HIV infection for suicidal behavior, as failure to do this may further worsen the patients' condition.

AB In recent years, jihadists across the world have transformed their gendered violence, shocking the world by breaking from prior taboos and even celebrating abuses that they had previously prohibited. This behavior is surprising because jihadists represent a class of insurgents that are deeply bound by rules and norms. For jihadists, deviating from established Islamist doctrines is no easy feat. What then explains these sudden transformations in the rules and norms governing jihadist violence? An inductive investigation of contemporary jihadist violence in Pakistan and Nigeria reveals a new theory of jihadist normative evolution. Data from these cases show that dramatic changes in jihadist violence occur when an external trigger creates an expanded political space for jihadist entrepreneurs to do away with normative constraints on socially prohibited types of violence. As these jihadist leaders capitalize on the triggers, they are able to encourage a re-socialization process within their ranks, resulting in the erosion of previously held taboos, the adoption of proscribed behaviors, and the emergence of toxic new norms.

AB Introduction: The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of HIV/AIDS among long distance drivers.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out among 350 long distance drivers on transit through Benin-City, Edo-State, Nigeria.
   Result: Only 18.9% of the respondents had correct knowledge of means of transmission of HIV/AIDS and only 5.1% knew that a virus causes HIV/AIDS. One hundred and twenty-three (35.1%) will commit suicide if confirmed to be HIV positive. Only 26.6% of the respondents will educate others if confirmed positive to HIV/AIDS. Two hundred and sixty-four (75.4%) would either abstain from casual sex or use condoms.
   Conclusions: Knowledge and attitude to HIV/AlDS was generally poor. However their protective sexual practices in terms of the use of condoms and abstinence was good as 75.4% would either abstain from casual sex or use condoms. There is a dire need for public enlightenment and the need to focus on the target group is imperative.

AB Objective: To provide baseline data about bad-breath perception and misconceptions among Nigerian adults. Methods: Multi-center cross-sectional study of individuals aged 18-64 years using examiner-administered questionnaires. Age comparisons were based on the model of emerging adults versus full adults. Data were recoded for statistical analyses and univariate and secondary log-linear statistics applied. Results: Participants had lopsided perceptions about bad-breath. While 730 (90.8%) identified the dentist as the expert on halitosis and 719 (89.4%) knew that bad-breath is not contagious, only 4.4% and 2.5% associated bad-breath with tooth decay and gum disease respectively. There were no significant sex differences but the older adults showed better knowledge in a few instances. Most respondents (747, 92.9%) would tell a spouse about their bad-breath and 683 (85%) would tell a friend. Conclusions: Participants had lop-sided knowledge and perceptions about bad-breath. Most Nigerian adults are their "brothers keepers" who would tell a spouse or friend about their halitosis so they could seek treatment.

TI Deities in a Changing Igbo Society: Ndi Nsukka, 1960-2016

AB Deities have always been an important factor in the socio-political life of the Nsukka people, defining and regulating inter-personal and inter-group relations. In other words, the institution ensured that there were cordial relationships not only at the horizontal but also at the vertical levels of society. Deities were, therefore, believed to have provided Nsukka - and the entire Igbo - with an ultimate vision of themselves and the world. This institution that hitherto promoted peace and harmony among the people through its impartiality in administrating justice and arbitration, has, in recent years, been faced with relentless attacks from organised religion particularly from Christianity. Unfortunately, this aspect of Nsukka history has been neglected, uninvestigated and unharvested. As a result of this our knowledge of this hitherto time-honoured institution is patchy and distorted. This study explores this neglected area so as to broaden and enrich our knowledge of the history of the Nsukka people. The year 1960 is chosen as the commencement date for this study for two obvious reasons. It witnessed Nigeria's independence which was expected to have ushered in a cultural rebirth that would encourage Nsukka people to reorganise their violated gods or battered deities. With the establishment of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka in 1960, numerous Christian sects 'invaded' and drew huge numbers of converts from the indigenous people. The year 2016 marks the end of the study because of the landmark events which culminated in two young men committing suicide apparently at the instance of a deity. Apart from depleting the numbers of traditionalists, some misguided and overzealous Christian converts, under spurious guises, have blatantly destroyed and burnt some effigies of sacred deities. Ironically, some of these apostates have had recourse to return to these deities in times of challenges and troubles. Such patronage of deities would seem to have sustained their relevance in the lives of the traditionalists in the Nsukka cultural zone. Rather than disappearing, as claimed by the universal religions, deities have continued to soldier on in Nsukka, just as they have done elsewhere in Igboland. The focus of this study is to examine the continued relevance of these deities in this age of Christianity and westernisation.

AB Background: Previous studies from the developed western countries have repeatedly demonstrated that hopelessness positively correlates with an increased risk of suicide in the context of chronic mental disorders such as schizophrenia and affective disorders. Despite this persistently strong association, the construct of hopelessness in terms of its factorial structure and correlates has not been explored among Nigerian psychiatric outpatients.
   Objective: The aim of this present study is to examine the psychometric characteristics of the Yoruba language culturally adapted version of the Beck Hopelessness Scale in a cross-sectional sample of psychiatric outpatients in South-western Nigeria.
   Method: The participants were 327 Nigerian adult outpatients receiving treatment for schizophrenia, bipolar and depressive disorders, consecutively recruited from the outpatient psychiatric clinics of a university teaching hospital in South-western Nigeria. The outpatients were recruited over a one year period. They completed the Yoruba translated version of the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS-Y), a sociodemographic and illness-related questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Their level of functioning was assessed with the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF), psychopathology was evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the level of disability measured with the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WIODAS-II). Suicidality and confirmation of the diagnoses of schizophrenia, bipolar and depressive disorders were evaluated with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). The construct of hopelessness in terms of factorial structure, reliability, validity and correlates was explored. Exploratory Factor Analysis using Principal Component Analysis with Varimax rotation was used to examine the factorial structure of the BHS-Y. Internal consistency was examined with Cronbach's alpha, and the construct validity of the scale was assessed using correlational analyses with the MINI suicidality module, BDI-II, GAF and WHODAS-II domain scores. We also tested the hypothesis that a shortened version of the BHS-Y will possess psychometric properties similar to the 20 item version.
   Results: Exploratory Factor Analysis using Principal Component Analysis with Varimax rotation showed that the construct of hopelessness among our outpatients was best explained by a 3 factor model. Reliability of the translated version of the scale was adequate as indicated by a Cronbach's alpha of 0.92. Construct validity was also satisfactory as reflected by the strong correlations with MINI suicidality, Beck Depression Inventory-II and Global Assessment of Functioning scores. The shortened 4 item single factor BHS-Y composed of items 8, 9, 13 and 15 demonstrated psychometric properties similar to those of the full item version.
   Conclusion: The Beck Hopelessness Scale (Yoruba Version) demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity and therefore may be useful in measuring the construct of hopelessness and in clinical suicide risk assessments among Nigerian psychiatric outpatients. There is the need for more studies to further explore the psychometric features and correlates of this scale among other Nigerian ethnic groups in addition to other medical patients' populations.

DE Rooftop riding; Nigerian Railway Corporation; Operations; Mass Transit
   Train; Diesel Multiple Units; Lagos Metropolis
AB Media reports on train mishaps and havocs emanating from rooftop riding abound; however, there has been very limited effort on the empirical investigation of why daredevils embark on this utter suicide mission. Besides, studies that rigorously examined profiles of the perpetrators of the dastardly act are hard to come by in the literature of railway transport. Against this background, this study examined the menace of train rooftop riding in Lagos Metropolis, Nigeria, with a view to evolving a policy response that could curtail the life-threatening nuisance. Towards achieving this aim, specific objectives were formulated. These were to examine the socioeconomic characteristics of train rooftop riders in Lagos Metropolis, determine the motivations for train rooftop riding in the study area, assess the efforts made by the authorities to discourage train rooftop riding in the study area, and proffer policy recommendations towards engendering a safe rail transport milieu. Data were obtained through participant observation, interview and questionnaire administration. The respondents comprised 64 conveniently sampled rooftop riders, 183 law-abiding passengers of three Diesel Multiple Units and three Mass Transit Trains selected using multistage sampling, and the 113 staff members of the Nigerian Railway Corporation consisting of 20 engineers, 79 conductors and 14 ticket vendors. The study found that train rooftop riding had defied all the measures taken against it in the study area. It characterized most trips but was prevalent at the morning and evening peak periods (35.2% and 59.2%, respectively). All the rooftop riders were middle-aged men. None of them admitted to ever falling off before; however, 28 (43.8%) admitted to being scared of falling off, while 40 (62.5%) boasted they could not possibly fall off. Two categories of motivations for rooftop riding were found: 'perceived' and 'real'. Smoking (47.0%), substance abuse (23.0%) and criminal tendencies (19.7%) were among the perceived motivations, while space inadequacy (37.5%), queue avoidance (50.0%) and adventure (34.4%) were among the real motivations. Given an overall improvement in the railway services, 28 (43.8%) would stop, 18 (28.1%) would not stop, and 18 (28.1%) were unsure they would stop rooftop riding. The study concluded that the menace of train rooftop riding was undesirable. Consequently, practical policy recommendations were proffered towards curbing the menace.

AB Purpose of Study: Esophageal stricture is a debilitating condition with significant morbidity and mortality, occurring often as a complication of the ingestion of corrosives. In the adult, majority of cases are intentional whilst being accidental in the pediatric population. We therefore sought to describe the circumstances of intentional corrosive ingestion and determine the presence and impact of psychiatric illness on the outcome of management. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of case folders of patients managed with this condition over a ten-year period (2000-2009) was done by comparing sociodemographics and outcome of management in patients with and without psychiatric disorders. Results: Twenty seven cases were reviewed. Mean age was 30.7 (SD =16.01), with a M:F ratio of 1.25:1.86.2 had a diagnosable psychiatric condition, the most common being depression in 55.6 of the patients. Caustic soda (55.6) was the most common corrosive ingested. There was a significant difference in mean duration before presentation in patients with (1.7 days) and without (6.6 days) previous psychiatric illness (P = 0.01). A significant positive association was also found between surgical outcome and previous history of psychiatric disorder (P = 0.02). Conclusion: Early recognition of psychosocial distress is important to prevent deliberate self-harm. Counter-intuitively, a previous history of psychopathology limits esophageal injury by early presentation and therefore improve chances of a good surgical outcome.

AB Terrorism and insurgence of varying magnitude at the national and international levels have continued to threaten global peace and kept most governments and communities of the world on toes. Terrorism is the use of violence against a civilian population or non-combatant group to compel government or an international organization to act or abstain from doing an act [1], [2]. The 11th September, 2001 (9/11) simultaneous attacks in US on the World Trade Centre in New York, the Pentagon in Virginia and site at Pennsylvania claiming over 3,996 lives and leaving over 6000 others injured and which brought down to rabbles one of the biggest edifices of our time and stirred the whole world out of complacency is a typical act of terrorism. This singular event more than any previous cases of terrorism has put most nations on red alert while similar affronts to human peace and comfort continue to heighten as they last in other parts of the globe[2]. For more than a decade now, terrorism and insurgence have taken the nations of the world by storm. What started as pockets of disaffection and protests reactions at different parts of the world has assumed unimaginable sophistication and startling dimensions. The bombing and sinking of British Palestine Ship at Haifa killing 267 persons on board and Leaving 172 injured in 1940 and the poisoning of bread for prisoners in Camp Stalag 13, Germany in 1946 where 148 persons died and 124 injured [3], are nothing to compare with the 9/11 attack. The hijacking of planes and detonating of bombs by suicide bombers killing themselves and their unsuspecting victims in aircrafts, trains and train platforms, parks and garages, churches, market places, hotels, night clubs, cinema houses and even hospitals and schools where our young go to learn to improve the quality of humanity is an unparalleled dimension of terrorism[3],[2]. The Beslan school hostage in Russia in September 1-3, 2004 where 385 persons died and 783 were injured; the multiple bombing in London, United Kingdom in 2005 where 65 people died and over 700 were injured; Peshawar School attack in Pakistan in December, 2014 where 170 persons died and un-estimated number injured, and the abduction of 300 school girls in Chibok, Nigeria and taken to unknown destination since 2014 as well as the coordinated attack on Paris and St Denis, France in November 13, 2015, killing 130 persons and leaving hundreds injured is not only a clear indication of extreme radicalization of local affairs but an attempt to annihilate the world. As a matter of fact, peace is eluding many nations of the world including Nigeria [4],[5]. Of a truth, peace is eluding the whole world. Peace is when people are able to resolve conflicts without violence and can work together to improve the quality of their lives; when everyone live in safety, without fear or threat of violence and no form of violence is tolerated[6]. If this definition of peace is true then no nation today is at peace with itself thus making the concern in this study more compelling.

AB This is the synthesis of a study on admissions of migrants to hospitals in Sicily, from January 2011 to June 2014. Migrants arrived in Lampedusa were 49,000 in 2011; 4,000 in 2012; 15,000 in 2013; 6,000 in 2014; 378 patients requiring hospitalizationwere transported exclusively by the 118 Helicopter Emergency Medical Service in 6 Sicilian hospitals: 203 in 2011, 62 in 2012, 95 in 2013, 18 in 2014. The mean age was 25 years; more frequent areas of provenance were Horn of Africa, North Africa, Syria, and Nigeria. Women were hospitalised almost exclusively for obstetric-gynaecological problems, with a high prevalence of abortions (17/140 pregnancies) secondary to the long journey; men were hospitalised especially for bone fractures, burns, dehydration, infectious diseases, suicide attempts, and, recently, for CO poisoning of people locked in the holds of boats. Infectious diseases were mainly due to respiratory and intestinal distress, 20 people had tuberculosis (TB), 3 had HIV and 1 had malaria. No suspicious of Ebola virus infection was registered. The causes of hospitalisation do not depend on the nationality of patients and are constant over the years. Infectious diffusible diseases, mainly TB, are more common than in the Italian population, and consequently the best surveillance systems, aimed at identifying and treating patients immediately, should be activated. Mare Nostrum Operation helped migrants while they are in sea and allowed the reduction of serious health problems, mainly related to the hardships and duration of the journey, and also anticipating arrivals directly in Lampedusa, permitting a more efficient organisation of the relief in the sea.

AB Background: Community-based studies of the rates and profile of depression among Africans are still sparse.
   Methods: As part of the World Mental Health Surveys initiative, a clustered multi-stage sampling of households in 21 of Nigeria's 36 states (representing 57% of the national population) was implemented to select adults aged 18 years and over (N=6752) for face-to-face interviews using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0). Diagnosis of major depressive episode (MDE) was based on the Criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition.
   Results: Lifetime and 12-month estimates of MDE were 3.1% (standard error 0.3) and 1.1% (s.e. 0.1). receptively. Increasing age was associated with higher estimates of positive responses to stem (screen) questions for depression and of life time disorders among stem-positive respondents. The mean age of onset was about 29.2 years. The median (inter quantile range, IQR) duration of an episode among lifetime cases was 1.0 (2.0-2.4) year and the median (IQR) number of lifetime episodes was 1.5 (2.0-2.8). MDE was highly comorbid with anxiety disorders, musculoskeletal conditions, chronic pain and ulcer. The odds ratio of life time suicide attempt among persons with lifetime MDE was 11.6 (95% confidence interval, 3.9-34.9). Over 25% of 12-month cases were rated as severely disabled in the performance of usual roles. Only 16.9% (s.e. 5.0) of 12-month cases had received any treatment.
   Limitations: All data were based on self-reports.
   Conclusion: MDE, defined according to DSM-IV, is a risk factor for mental and physical comorbidity as well as disability in Nigerians. Age-related telescoping or denial may partly explain the low rates in this young population. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB IMPORTANCE The literature focuses on mortality among children younger than 5 years. Comparable information on nonfatal health outcomes among these children and the fatal and nonfatal burden of diseases and injuries among older children and adolescents is scarce.
   OBJECTIVE To determine levels and trends in the fatal and nonfatal burden of diseases and injuries among younger children (aged < 5 years), older children (aged 5-9 years), and adolescents (aged 10-19 years) between 1990 and 2013 in 188 countries from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 study.
   EVIDENCE REVIEW Data from vital registration, verbal autopsy studies, maternal and child death surveillance, and other sources covering 14 244 site-years (ie, years of cause of death data by geography) from 1980 through 2013 were used to estimate cause-specific mortality. Data from 35 620 epidemiological sources were used to estimate the prevalence of the diseases and sequelae in the GBD 2013 study. Cause-specific mortality for most causes was estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble Model strategy. For some infectious diseases (eg, HIV infection/AIDS, measles, hepatitis B) where the disease process is complex or the cause of death data were insufficient or unavailable, we used natural history models. For most nonfatal health outcomes, DisMod-MR 2.0, a Bayesian metaregression tool, was used to meta-analyze the epidemiological data to generate prevalence estimates.
   FINDINGS Of the 7.7 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 7.4-8.1) million deaths among children and adolescents globally in 2013, 6.28 million occurred among younger children, 0.48 million among older children, and 0.97 million among adolescents. In 2013, the leading causes of death were lower respiratory tract infections among younger children (905 059 deaths; 95% UI, 810304-998 125), diarrheal diseases among older children (38 325 deaths; 95% UI, 30 365-47 678), and road injuries among adolescents (115 186 deaths; 95% UI, 105 185-124 870). Iron deficiency anemia was the leading cause of years lived with disability among children and adolescents, affecting 619 (95% UI, 618-621) million in 2013. Large between-country variations exist in mortality from leading causes among children and adolescents. Countries with rapid declines in all-cause mortality between 1990 and 2013 also experienced large declines in most leading causes of death, whereas countries with the slowest declines had stagnant or increasing trends in the leading causes of death. In 2013, Nigeria had a 12% global share of deaths from lower respiratory tract infections and a 38% global share of deaths from malaria. India had 33% of the world's deaths from neonatal encephalopathy. Half of the world's diarrheal deaths among children and adolescents occurred in just 5 countries: India, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Ethiopia.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Understanding the levels and trends of the leading causes of death and disability among children and adolescents is critical to guide investment and inform policies. Monitoring these trends over time is also key to understanding where interventions are having an impact. Proven interventions exist to prevent or treat the leading causes of unnecessary death and disability among children and adolescents. The findings presented here show that these are underused and give guidance to policy makers in countries where more attention is needed.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess the level of psychological distress of offenders newly brought into prison custody in a Nigerian prison and investigate the relationship with socio-demographic and penal characteristics.
   Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional study involving 236 new prison entrants who were assessed for psychological distress using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).
   Findings - A total of 267 prison inmates were newly brought to prison custody over a three-month period. Out of this, 236 (88.4 per cent) of them participated in the study. Majority of the inmates were males 225 (95.3 per cent), awaiting-trial inmates 208 (88.1 per cent), single 144 (61 per cent), Christian 224 (94.9 per cent), first time offenders 218 (92.4 per cent) and charged with violent offences 136 (57.6 per cent). Majority of the inmates scored above cut-off points on the GHQ-12 and the HADS. In total, 157 (66.5 per cent) on HADS anxiety subscale, 201 (85.2 per cent) on HADS depression subscale and 199 (84.3 per cent) on GHQ-12. Significant relationship was observed between GHQ-12 "caseness", prison category and type of offence. Prison situation and type of offence were significantly associated with HADS depression subscale, whereas age was associated with HADS anxiety subscale.
   Research limitations/implications - Some limitations were encountered in the course of the study. First, the study relied on self-report questionnaires for collection of data. Second, information given by the respondents could neither be corroborated by family members, who were not present during the interview, nor by the officers and men of the Nigeria Prisons Service, who knew little or nothing about the respondents. Participants in this study had spent maximum of three days in prison during the interview, thus certain levels of distress within three days after incarceration may not entail "caseness" in the sense of the presence of a psychiatric disorder. Therefore assessment over a longer period is needed.
   Practical implications - Screening prison inmates on reception into prison custody provides a vista of opportunity to identify mental health problems and socio-demographic and forensic correlates of psychological distress among new entrants into prison custody. This will facilitate early identification and management of prison inmates with health needs. Health screening on reception will also help in identifying the various penal or forensic characteristics of prison inmates, which will be put into consideration during selection of appropriate rehabilitation and reformation activities that best fit a particular prison inmate. Early screening of prison inmates upon reception in the prison will also help in identifying prison inmates who have high risk of suicide and self-harm, thus preventing cases of death that may arise as a result of these mental health problems. Findings from this study will also enrich the body of knowledge on mental health problems of prison inmates entering the prison; this will also help the criminal justice system in decision making, especially with emphasis on psychological evaluation of prison inmates before dispensing judgment. On the part of the prison authority, the prison inmates identified to have psychological distress and some forensic characteristics can be properly classified, and kept in cells that will not aggravate their distress. Finally, this is the first study of prison inmates on reception into Enugu Maximum Security Prison, Enugu State Nigeria. The implication of this is that findings from this research will form a baseline on which further research on prison inmates upon reception in the prison can be conducted.
   Originality/value - This study demonstrated that prison inmates are faced with high level of psychological distress during their early days in prison, and that some socio-demographic and forensic variables had significant association with psychological distress as itemised in Tables III and IV. Therefore, screening new inmates on prison reception will help in early identification and treatment of vulnerable groups. This will also help in proper classification and allocation into appropriate cells of prison inmates by the prison authority.
