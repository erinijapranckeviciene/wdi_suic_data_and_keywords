AB Background: The epidemiology of suicide within the elderly is unique to each cultural setting. In most countries, despite the higher rate of suicide attempts among adolescents and young people, the rate of suicide deaths in the elderly is higher than other age groups. The purpose of this study was to investigate the suicide rates among persons 65 years and above in Fars, Iran.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we investigated suicide cases (65 years and older) during 2011-2016 in Fars, Iran. The data were collected from the Mental Health and Suicide Surveillance Systems of Fars province, using filled forms that included suicide and demographic information. After eliminating duplications, suicidal rates were calculated.
   Results: Of 299 suicide attempts, 64.9% were men, and 69.6% were urban residents. The rate of suicide attempts and deaths were 21.47 and 4.52 per 100,000 population, respectively; and the case fatality rate (CFR) of suicide was 21.07% during the study period. The rate of suicide attempts and deaths in this population showed an increase during the study years.
   Conclusions: Considering the increasing trend of suicide rates in the elderly in Fars, Iran, measures should be taken to facilitate the access of this group to the mental health care system and psychological counseling.

AB The present article describes the process of developing a national suicide registry in Iran and evaluates the obstacles in this respect. We established a systematic and uniform portal data collection system in the country and evaluated it from March 2009 for a year. The quality of database and data registration challenges were assessed from different aspects. A total number of 41,109 suicide attempts and 1,338 completed suicides were reported from an area that covered 83.6% of Iran's population in 2009. The rate of suicide attempt was 65.8 per 100,000 people. This study revealed some of the obstacles and challenges of implementing a national registration system. Nationwide suicide registry can serve as a solid foundation for conceptual work, data collection, and preventive interventions. A concerted effort between various organizations is required to efficiently collect data on suicide behaviors.

AB OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to measure income-related inequality in completed suicide across the provinces of Iran.
   METHODS: This ecological study was performed using data from the Urban and Rural Household Income and Expenditure Survey-2010 conducted by the Iranian Center of Statistics, along with data on completed suicide from the Iranian Legal Medicine Organization in 2012. We calculated the Gini coefficient of per capita income and the completed suicide rate, as well as the concentration index for per capita income inequality in completed suicide, across the provinces of Iran.
   RESULTS: The Gini coefficients of per capita income and the completed suicide rate in the provinces of Iran were 0.10 (95% confidence interval [ CI], 0.06 to 0.13) and 0.34 (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.46), respectively. We found a trivial decreasing trend in the completed suicide incidence rate according to income quintile. The poorest-to-richest ratio in the completed suicide rate was 2.01 (95% CI, 1.26 to 3.22). The concentration index of completed suicide in the provinces of Iran was -0.12 (95% CI, -0.30 to 0.06).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study found that lower income might be considered as a risk factor for completed suicide. Nonetheless, further individual studies incorporating multivariable analysis and repeated cross-sectional data would allow a more fine-grained analysis of this phenomenon.

AB In this study, we investigated the sociocultural contexts of suicide attempts among women in Iran. Fifty women who attempted suicide and were admitted to the two main hospitals in Isfahan in 2006 were interviewed. The main themes identified were family problems, marriage and love, social stigma, pressure of high expectations, and poverty. We observed significant sociocultural influence on attempting suicide among the Iranian women in this study. Based on our findings we conclude that the women in the study were affected by social changes and the interplay between traditional and modern values and attitudes. Understanding sociocultural aspects of suicide in Iran is critical in providing effective and culturally sensitive suicide prevention and care programs.

AB Background: Today there is an increased risk of suicide among young people throughout the world.
   Objectives: Due to the high prevalence of suicide in Iran and its important psychological and social effects, the epidemiology of suicide death and its associated factors were evaluated in Ilam as a deprived area of Iran.
   Methods: A Longitudinal study was conducted in Ilam, Iran, during a five-year period from 2012 -2016. The basic data were recorded through the registration centers of legal medicine and governmental medical centers in Ilam, Iran. The suicide death ratio was calculated based on the number of suicide deaths per 100,000 populations each year. Data analysis was carried out with IBM SPSS for Windows vesion 20.0 using descriptive and inferential statistics. A P value less than 0.05 was considered as significant level.
   Results: In total, there were 475 suicide deaths, with 41.1% being female and 58.9% male. The highest rate of suicide deaths is found in 2012 at 20 per 100,000. More than half of the suicide deaths occurred in individuals between the ages of 21- 40. 78.9% of all suicide deaths occurred in individuals without an income and 21.1% in individuals with a personal income. A substantial number of all suicide deaths occurred in individuals without a personal income.
   Conclusions: Most likely, individuals who are financially dependent will experience lower self-esteem and a higher risk of mental disorders. All of these factors increased the risk of suicide.

AB Background and objectives: This paper aimed to study the epidemiology of suicide and causes related to fatal suicide in Ilam province, west of Iran.
   Methods: All data related to attempted suicide and fatal suicide during 2011-2012 were extracted from the suicide registry of authorized directorates in Ilam Province, Iran. Risk factors for fatal suicide were evaluated using logistic regression modeling and discrimination of model assessed using ROC curve.
   Results: A total of 1537 registered cases were analyzed, among which 130 were recorded as fatal suicides (1227 attempted suicides). Overall, 805 (52.4%) cases were female, 9.2% had a history of suicide, 59.3% were married and 63.3% of cases were aged under 24 years. The most common suicide method was overdose of medications (75.5%). In multivariable analysis, male gender (OR: 0.50; CI 95% 0.25 to 0.99) and higher education (OR: 0.36; CI 95% 0.20 to 0.65) were protective factors and application of physical methods (OR: 11.61; 95% CI 5.40 to 24.95) was a risk factor for fatal suicide.
   Conclusions: Female gender, low education level and use of physical methods of suicide were revealed as risk factors of fatal suicide. We suggest population based case-control studies based on the suicide registry data for further assessing the risk factors of suicide in Ilam.

AB ObjectivesSuicide is a major global public health problem and much burden in the societies. This study aims to calculate the years of life lost (YLL) due to suicide and investigate its trend in Iran.MethodsInformation on deaths due to suicide in Iran was extracted from Iran Legal Medicine Organization. The years of life lost was calculated in each year according to gender and age-groups. To examine the trend for different years, joinpoint regression was used.ResultsThe 35,297 deaths due to suicide were recorded in 2006-2015. The total YLL in the 10-year period was 34.52 per 1000 persons in males, 13.61 per 1000 persons in females and 23.35 per 1000 persons in both sexes. Hanging comprised the largest YLL of suicide. The annual percent change of YLL rate was 3.3%.ConclusionsThe results revealed that male shows an increasing trend in YLL specifically among youth and adult, while there is no improvement in females. There is a national need to implement an effective health policy intervention in Iran.

AB Aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of suicide ideation and behavior in a community sample of an Iranian city, Karaj. Study sample consisted of 2,300 subjects, chosen randomly from the community. The WHO/SUPRE-MISS survey questionnaire, used in this study. Lifetime prevalence for suicide thoughts, plans and attempts were 12.7, 6.2 and 3.3%, respectively and for the previous year they were 5.7, 2.9 and 1%, respectively. Although it is not possible to generalize the results to the country, but in some area of Iran, the prevalence of suicide ideation, plan and attempt appeared to be similar to that of many developed countries.

Adult Attachment Questionnaire (AAQ) and Beck Suicide Scale Ideation (BSSI) were used in this study. Findings suggest that there are positive statistically significant correlation between adolescents unsecure attachment style with suicide ideation and negative statistically significant correlation between secure attachment style and suicide ideation. Attachment styles are an important predictor of suicide ideation. Interventions designed to reduce suicide ideation may help reduce suicide ideation in adolescents. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

ID GLOBAL BURDEN; DETERMINANTS; DISEASE; AGE
AB Background: Research in source of inequality and enhance of knowledge can be reducing the inequalities in the coming decades. Therefore, we aimed to ascertain effects of income inequality measured by Gini-coefficient to death from suicide in Iran.
   Methods: This is an ecological study on the relation of Gini-coefficient and suicide death in Iran. Data were obtained from Iranian Urban and Rural Household Income for Gini-coefficient and Expenditure Survey and Iranian Forensic Medicine Organization for suicide. Concentration Index was used to determine of inequality by Gini-coefficient in suicide death and prediction model was applied by Stata software. Significant level considered less than 5%.
   Results: A Gini-coefficient between 0.2523 and 0.3755 (mean, 0.3092) was observed. The overall concentration index CI was -0.10 (95% CI= -0.19 to -0.01), therefore our results confirmed a positive inequality in incidence suicide rate result from income inequality in Iran.
   Conclusion: Our results showed a positive inequality due to Gini-coefficients in suicide death. This study could be a start for investigation of inequality source in geographical units and at the individual level in all provinces

AB Objectives: Suicide is a major global health problem imposing a considerable burden on populations in terms of disability-adjusted life years. There has been an increasing trend in fatal and attempted suicide in Iran over the past few decades. The aim of the current study was to assess overall, gender and social inequalities across Iran's provinces during 2006-2010.
   Design: Ecological study.
   Setting: The data on distribution of population at the provinces were obtained from the Statistical Centre of Iran. The data on the annual number of deaths caused by suicide in each province were gathered from the Iranian Forensic Medicine Organization.
   Methods: Suicide mortality rate per 100 000 population was calculated. Human Development Index was used as the provinces' social rank. Gini coefficient, rate ratio and Kunst and Mackenbach relative index of inequality were used to assess overall, gender and social inequalities, respectively. Annual percentage change was calculated using Joinpoint regression.
   Results: Suicide mortality has slightly increased in Iran during 2006-2010. There was a substantial and constant overall inequality across the country over the study period. Male-to-female rate ratio was 2.34 (95% CI 1.45 to 3.79) over the same period. There were social inequalities in suicide mortality in favour of people in better-off provinces. In addition, there was an increasing trend in these social disparities over time, although it was not statistically significant.
   Conclusions: We found substantial overall, gender and social disparities in the distribution of suicide mortality across the provinces in Iran. The findings showed that men in the provinces with low socioeconomic status are at higher risk of suicide mortality. Further analyses are needed to explain these disparities.

AB Background: Suicide in Iran is more or less the problem of the western region of the country. Although previous studies have described the features of suicide, they didn't study the trends through reliable methodology.
   Objectives: We study changes in temporal trends of suicide mortality in the west of Iran using joinpoint regression analysis.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. Data for all registered suicide cases in western province of Kermanshah in Iran during 2003-2014 was retrieved from the death registry of Iranian legal medicine organization. After direct standardization of the rates, we analyzed data by joinpoint regression analysis to discover the main changes of the trends.
   Results: Overall suicide mortality has increased from 10.6 per 100,000 in2003 to 12.4 in 2014, which equals to 1.5% (+0.1-+2.8) annual percentage change (APC). Increase in suicide rate for women was remarkably higher than men(APC = 4.5 for women and 0.5 for men (P value < 0.001)). Majority of increase belonged to age group 20-29 in women and 30-39 in men. Old men have an increasing trend during the last decade. Hanging constantly increased in both genders with APC of 4.2 (+1.9-+6.5) while self-burning decreased after 2006 in women with APC of -5.9 (-12.6-+1.2) and poisoning increased in 2011 in men with APC of 17.0 (-4.0-+42.5). The number of suicide death in married couples has increased for both genders while for single women decreased in 2007. For women, suicide in low educated or illiterate decreased and in high educated increased, while in men it increased in both educational levels.
   Conclusions: Suicide in the west of Iran has increased slightly during 2003-2014 with remarkable differences for men and women. Suicide in old men and women has increased profoundly and may be due to losing their familial and social support in modern life. Pattern of suicide in women has changed dramatically from most rural, uneducated, and self-burned to most urban, high educated, and hanging use form.

AB Introduction: The investigations on suicide Conducted Within low- and middle-income countries are limited. This study evaluated the trend of suicide and its associated risk factors in the west of Iran.
   Methods: This six year population based Survey was conducted in Kermanshah Province, in 2012. The data on suicide was extracted from the suicide database of the Provincial Health Center, which was collected for six successive years. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed and odds ratio (OR) as well as its 95% confidence intervals(CI) was reported.
   Results: During the study period, 13,810 attempted Suicides occurred of:which 1,564(11.33%) were completed. The incidence rate of suicide has increased in recent years. Based on logistic regression analysis, OR estimate of Completed suicide increased 1.46 (95% Cl: 1.36, 1.56) fold for every 10-year increase in age. Moreover, OR estimate Of completed suicide was 2.53 (95% CI: 1.94, 3.31) in men compared to women, Compared to married people, the OR estimate of completed suicide was 1.41 (95% Cl: 1.15, 1.72) in single people, 1.92 (95% Cl: 1.15, 323) in widowed people, and 1.97 (1.32, 2.95) in divorced people. The lower the educational level, the higher the risk of completed suicide: Compared to school/college students, the risk of completed suicide was higher among housewives, employed people or employees, and retirees. A majority of the suicides (90.05%) occurred at home. Taking medications Was the most common way (69.13%) of a suicide attempt.
   Conclusion: We indicated that associated factors with completed suicide vary in Iran compared to other developed and developing countries and that factors associated with attempted suicide are different from that of completed suicide.

ID SUICIDE ATTEMPTS; DISORDER; RATES
AB Background: Suicide/suicide attempt, as a major public health problem, has been included among anti-social behaviors. We aimed to investigate the epidemiology of suicide and some associated individual, family, and social factors.
   Methods: A historical cohort study was conducted among all cases (748 persons) reports related to suicide/suicide attempt that register in hospital reporting system and health care center in Gonabad and Bajestan, Iran, from 2009 to 2014. The required data were extracted through a checklist. Descriptive (mean and standard deviation) and analytic statistics (t-test, Chi-square, and logistic regression) applied to analyzed data. All data were analyzed using SPSS software.
   Results: Of the 748 reported suicide attempters, 17 cases (2.3%) had completed suicide. The annual average incidence rate of suicide was 110.03 per 100,000 populations. The mean age of suicide attempt had significantly decreased during the time (P=0.007). Furthermore, a significant association was observed between outcome of suicide and place of residence (P=0.019), history of physical illnesses (P=0.002), and method of suicide (P= 0.001) .
   Conclusion: Due to trend of age among suicide attempters, considering intervention programs of suicide prevention for school pupils and university students especially individuals residing in rural areas, as well as individuals suffering from physical illness would be effective to reduce the rate of suicide.

TI Is self-immolation a distinct method for suicide? A comparison of
   Iranian patients attempting suicide by self-immolation and by poisoning

ID BURNS; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Objective: Patients who attempted suicide by self-immolation were compared to patients who attempted suicide by poisoning to identify features that might discriminate risk of self-immolation from other suicide methods.
   Methods: Consecutive referrals for attempted suicide were recruited over a 4-month period (June-September 2008) from Kermanshah Imam Khomeini Hospital, Iran. Using questionnaire and interview techniques, demographic characteristics (age, gender, marital status, education level), psychosocial risk factors (prior suicide attempt, family history of suicide attempt, previous history of physical and mental disorders, family/marital conflict), and suicidal intent behavior were assessed from 200 patients who had attempted suicide (n = 63 by self-immolation; n = 137 by poisoning).
   Results: Several significant differences between the groups emerged. Patients who had attempted suicide by self-immolation were more frequently female (p < 0.001), older (p < 0.007), less educated (p < 0.001), and married (p < 0.001). Suicidal intent was associated with increased risk of suicide by poisoning (p < 0.001). No other significant differences were found.
   Conclusion: In Iran, patients who attempt suicide by self-immolation have distinct and specific risk factors compared to patients who commit suicide by poisoning. Results have implications for intervention development targeting at-risk populations. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people. Although completed suicide is rare before puberty, the incidence of adolescent suicide has increased significantly at the late ages of 10-19. Hence, this study investigates the adolescent suicide, aged 10-19, in southern Iran.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, all data regarding the demographics, causes, methods, outcomes, past medical history of suicide attempts and suicide death were collected from the Mental Health and Suicide Surveillance Systems of Fars province between 2011 and 2016.
   Results: Overall 6-year incidence rate of suicide attempts and death were 193.49/100,000 and 7.91/100,000, respectively. Case-fatality rate was 4.09%. During the period of 6 years, an increasing trend has been observed for both the rates of suicide attempt and death. Family conflicts were the major cause and medication overdose was the main method of suicides. After controlling the effects of confounders by logistic regression, male gender, living in the rural area and age are among the risk factors of fatality in suicide attempts.
   Conclusions: Suicide attempts and deaths have been increased in adolescents. Therefore, due to the vulnerability of this age group, we need to understand all components of suicide to educate families and to help policy makers.

SO NEUROSCIENCES

DT Review
ID INFLICTED BURNS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; SOUTHWEST; INJURIES
AB Suicide by self-immolation, or lighting oneself on fire, is the most common method of suicide used among women in rural Iran. Understanding the underlying mechanisms that may lead women to commit suicide by self-immolation is necessary for the development of empirically-supported prevention programs. Currently, no integrative approach to the risk factors for self-immolation among women in rural areas, or the interactions between them, is available. Based in ecology theory, we review the risk factors for suicide by self-immolation and present them in terms of ecological theory in an attempt to offer an integrative approach for prevention of self-immolation among women in rural Iran. We conclude by recommending a multifaceted approach to prevention of self-immolation. Neurosciences 2012; Vol. 17(4): 309-313

AB Objective: Understanding warning signs for suicide is a crucial aspect of suicide prevention. This study was designed to compare warning signs prior to suicide attempt by self-immolation versus suicide attempt by self-poisoning among consecutive referrals for treatment after suicide-attempt at Kermanshah Imam Khomeini Hospital, Iran.
   Methods: Over a 4-month period (June-September 2008), first degree relatives of 200 consecutive patients referred to Kermanshah Imam Khomeini Hospital, Iran, following a suicide attempt were interviewed. Sixty-three patients had attempted suicide by self-immolation and 137 by self-poisoning. Interviews addressed demographic characteristics (gender, age, marital status, and educational status) and three sets of psychosocial warning signs for suicide (verbal, behavioral, and environmental).
   Results: Four significant differences in types of warning signs were found between the two groups. Those patients who had attempted suicide by self-poisoning were more likely to have shown seeking behavior for killing devices prior to the suicide (p < 0.001), to have shown depressed mood and severe changes in mood (p < 0.01), to have shown a lack of interest in work and education (p < 0.02), and to have shown reckless behaviors (p < 0.01). Other symptoms were not significantly different between the groups. Analyses considering warning signs in clusters of behavior patterns (verbal, behavioral, and environmental warning signs) indicated behavioral warning signs were more common in patients who had attempted suicide by self-poisoning. Further, the total number of warning behaviors was greater in the self-poisoning group (p < 0.001), indicating that the group who attempted suicide by self-poisoning seemed to do so with more substantial planning and warning than those who attempted suicide by self-immolation.
   Conclusion: Warning signs for suicide by self-immolation were different and fewer than warning signs for suicide by self-poisoning among this sample of 200 Iranian patients who had attempted suicide. Prediction and prevention of suicide by self-immolation may be more difficult than prevention of suicide by other methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB Sources of data about the occurrence of domestic violence are scarce in Iran. The aim of this study was to evaluate the behavioral effects of different types of domestic violence on women who had attempted suicide by deliberate self-poisoning (DSP). A total of 195 women who had attempted suicide by DSP in response to violence and abuse were followed up for 2 years. The most common type of violence, as mentioned by the women themselves as the motive of self-poisoning, was physical abuse (92%) followed by verbal abuse (2.1%), multi-abuses (2.1%), emotional abuse (1.6%), and sexual abuse (1.1%). Suicidal ideation and attempt were more common in those who were consulted sometime after they had initially presented to the hospital with DSP or those who had suffered repeated domestic abuse. It was concluded that invention of methods other than the current consultation system is necessary to prevent repeated suicide attempts among abused women in Iran.

AB Introduction: Iran's western provinces have higher suicide rate compared to the other province of the country. Although suicide rates fluctuate over time, suitable statistical models can describe their underlying stochastic dynamics. Methods: This study was conducted to explore the fluctuations of the monthly suicide rates in the most populated western province of Iran using exponential smoothing state space model to compute the forecasts. For this reason, the monthly frequencies of completed suicides were converted to rates per 100,000 and a state-space approach was identified and fitted to the monthly suicide rates. Diagnostic checks were performed to determine the adequacy of the fitted model. Results: A significant seasonal variation was detected in completed suicide with a peak in August. Diagnostic checks and the time series graph of the observed monthly suicide rates against predicted values from the fitted model showed that in the study period (from March 2006 to September 2013), the observed and predicted values were in agreement. Thus, the model was used to obtain the short-term forecasts of the monthly suicide rates. Conclusions: In this study, we had no significant trend but seasonal variations in the suicide rates that were identified. However, additional data from other parts of the country with longer duration are needed to visualize the reliable trend of suicide and identify seasonality of suicide across the country.

AB Background: Suicide is a major global health problem, especially among youth. Suicide is known to be associated with a variety of social, economic, political and religious factors, vary across geographical and cultural regions. The current study aimed to investigate the effects of socioeconomic factors on suicide mortality rate across different regions in Iran.
   Methods: The data on distribution of population and socio-economic factors (such as unemployment rate, divorce rate, urbanization rate, average household expenditure etc.) at province level were obtained from the Statistical Centre of Iran and the National Organization for Civil Registration. The data on the annual number of deaths caused by suicide in each province was extracted from the published reports of the Iranian Forensic Medicine Organization. We used a decomposition model to distinguish between spatial and temporal variation in suicide mortality.
   Results: The average rate of suicide mortality was 5.5 per 100,000 population over the study period. Across the provinces (spatial variation), suicide mortality rate was positively associated with household expenditure and the proportion of people aged 15-24 and older than 65 years and was negatively associated with the proportion of literate people. Within the provinces (temporal variation), higher divorce rate was associated with higher suicide mortality. By excluding the outlier provinces, the results showed that in addition to the proportion of people aged 15-24 and older than 65, divorce and unemployment rates were also significant predictors of spatial variation in suicide mortality while divorce rate was associated with higher suicide mortality within provinces.
   Conclusion: The findings indicate that both spatial and temporal variations in suicide mortality rates across the provinces and over time are determined by a number of socio-economic factors. The study provides information that can be of importance in developing preventive strategies.

AB BACKGROUND: Identification of factors in the choice of suicide methods is important in understanding the phenomenon.
   OBJECTIVES: We aimed to quantify the effect of gender, age, living area, education level and marital status on the choice of suicide method among residents of Kermanshah province in the west of Iran.
   DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of all completed suicides from March 2006 to September 2013.
   SETTING: Kermanshah Province, Iran
   METHODS: Data were extracted from suicide forms in the electronic files of the Forensic Medicine Organization. A total of 1901 (1138 men), suicide cases were identified. After preliminary analysis, a multinomial logistic model was fitted to the data to test and quantify the impact of each influential factor on the choice of suicide method. The relative risk of each suicide method over hanging as the reference method was estimated by calculating relative-risk ratios from the multinomial logistic model.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative risk of suicide by self-immolation, drug and toxic poisoning and firearms.
   RESULTS: We found that women are at a higher relative risk than men for suicide by self-immolation, intentional drug poisoning and toxic poisoning. The relative risk of suicide by self-immolation and intentional drug poisoning was higher for urban residents and young individuals. On the other hand, men and rural residents were at higher relative risk of suicide by firearm.
   CONCLUSION: In Kermanshah province, the impact of rapid social changes on women and the availability of firearms in rural areas and drugs in urban households require more attention in any suicide prevention planning.
   LIMITATIONS : The lack of data prevented analysis of factors that may be more influential in choosing suicide.

AB Background: Suicide is an important social tragic phenomenon which occurs by different tools or methods in different communities. Considering deliberate poisoning as a common and important method in Ilam province for suicide, the present study was launched to epidemiologically assess committing suicide in Ilam province, Iran, based on intentional poisoning.
   Methods: By a retrospective study, all the recorded data associated with intentional poisoning suicide in Ilam Province during 1993-2013 were analyzed. All the demographic variables and the suicides' outcomes were analyzed using the Chi-Square test, and the univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.
   Results: Totally, 6794 cases of suicide (annual incidence rate of 87.28/100, 000) associated with poisoning were evaluated. The incidence rate of suicide attempts was 84.63/100, 000 (94.51 in female and 74.98 in male) and the incidence rate of completed suicide was 2.17/100, 000 (1.94 in female and 2.40 in male). Also, the highest rates of attempted and completed suicide (annual incidence rate of 172.42 and 4.14, respectively) were attributed to the age group of 15-24 year.
   Conclusion: Females had a greater tendency to commit suicide by poisoning, and the lower level of education, the age group of 15-24 years and single individuals were more associated with suicide using poisonings. The incidence of attempted suicide in females and completed suicide in males was higher in this method. Considering the high rate of suicide by poisoning, further attention and supervision on the sale and reserve of drugs and poisons is necessary.
   Meanwhile, it seems that due to momentary emotions during the pubertal stage, the risk of committing suicide is increased especially among unemployed individuals; therefore, performing an extensive psychotherapy intervention is needed in the societies with younger populations.

AB Objective: The objective of the present study was to determine the temporal trend of the rate of completed suicides in Iran during 2006-2010.
   Material and methods: Data on completed suicides were collected from the national suicide registry of the Iranian Forensic Medicine Organization. The rates were calculated for males and females for each year of the study period, from which the temporal trends were determined. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software, using chi-squared and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests.
   Results: The overall rate of suicide was 4.7/100,000, with a male/female ratio of 2.4. The mean age of suicide was 31.9 years, which was significantly higher in males. Hanging was the most common method, followed by poisoning and self-immolation. During the study period, the rate of drug poisoning almost doubled, while that of firearms halved. The rates of hanging and self-immolation also increased in the last years of the study period.
   Conclusion: According to the results of this study, it can be concluded that Iran has had a constant rate of completed suicides over the past decade. Our study also indicated the need for future nationwide studies on the risk factors of suicidal behavior and on different suicide methods in the entire Iranian population.

AB Objectives: Suicide is a conscious act in which the individual deliberately commit and unusual act with the intention of self-harm. The present study aims to examine some epidemiological factors affecting attempted and completed suicide rate during 2012-2016 in NajafAbad, a city in Isfahan province.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. The subjects are 2138 cases involved in suicide attempt during 2012-2016 that gone to Montazeri and Al-Zahra hospital. Chi-square, logistic regression and Cochran-Armitage test was used for data analysis.
   Result: Totally, 1385 (64.8%) patients were female and 47.8% were younger than 24 years of age. The most common method of suicide was medication overdose (91.1%). In multivariable analysis, male gender (OR: 2.67; CI 95% 1.53 to 4.64) was a risk factor for fatal suicide and application of chemical methods (OR: 0.018; CI 95% 0.010 to 0.032) was a protective factor. Results regarding completed suicide trend analysis shows that this trend has had a significant statistical difference in men (p = 0.019) but in women this trend doesn't statistically significant difference. (p = 0.209).
   Conclusions: According to the findings of the present study, attempted and completed suicide rate in Najafabad is relatively high compared to other regions in Islamic Republic of Iran. The completed suicide rate was significant in men which achieved its greatest value in 2015. Suicide attempt rate didn't show a significant statistical difference in both men and women.

AB Intentional self-poisoning that is widely used all over the world is one of the most common methods of suicide. This study aim was to determine the rate of attempted intentional self-poisoning and to identify high risk persons in the west of Iran (Kermanshah). A total of 3138 people (1279 M and 1859 F) studied. The average annual rate of suicide in Kermanshah was 153 persons per 100 000 people. The most number of attempted intentional self-poisoning (55.5%) were in the 20-29 year age group. The most popular toxic substances for self-poisoning were drugs (71%) and oil and fuels (15%), respectively. The most number of intentional self-poisoning suicides are attempted by drugs. By considering the high rate of intentional self-poisoning, low age of suicide attempts and also its high mortality rate in Kermanshah, it is necessary to stop the opportunity to buy over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, especially those being most misused.

AB Introduction: Suicide by self-immolation is one of the great health concerns in developing countries such as Iran. Exploration of motives for attempting suicide by self-immolation in different point of view of people with experience and information on can be considered as a crucial aspect in self-immolation prevention. The study aimed to explore motives for suicide by self-immolation in Kermanshah, Iran.
   Methods: A qualitative approach using semi-structure interview was employed to explore motives for attempting suicide by self-immolation in Kermanshah, Iran (2012). 15 participants including 9 self-immolated patients, a patient's husband, and 5 members of medical staff of these patients were interviewed. The interviews were taped and transcribed. A content analysis using constant comparison was performed for transcribed interviews.
   Results: Five main categories were emerged that explore motives for suicide by self-immolation including mental health problems, family problems, cultural context, self-immolation as a threat, and the distinct characteristics of the method. All categories had their specific subcategories which had been integrated based on distinct properties in a given category. More than one motive might be addressed by study participants, which listed in the appropriate categories.
   Conclusion: There are several reasons for suicide by self-immolation that should be considered in prevention programs. There may be an interactional pattern among the motives. Further study to explore process of the interactional pattern is recommended. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and ISBIElsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB This paper is divided into two parts. First I argue for the existence of a death-conscious culture in Iran, traceable in religious and literary texts, and manifested strongly in the discourse following the Iran-Iraq war. I then look at how this culture influences articulations and experiences of depression as felt by Iranian patients. Adopting a phenomenological perspective and drawing on empirical data, I show how death-consciousness, as a point of cultural divergence between the UK and Iran, can be used to account for some of the phenomenologically significant cultural variations in the experience of depression. These include attitudes towards suicide, the significance of feelings of hopelessness, and the existence of a sense of absurdity among Iranian patients.

AB Predictors of suicide attempts in Iran, to distinguish any similarities and differences of these predictors between suicide attempts in Iran and other developed and developing countries and to investigate the relation between general psychiatric symptoms and repetition of suicidal attempts were assessed. The validated Farsi version of the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) was used to assess multiple dimensions of quality of life of suicide attempters as depression, anxiety, social dysfunction, and somatic symptoms. Pivotal differences emerged in the clinical profiles of suicide attempters living in a developing country versus developed countries. In developing countries, those who attempt suicides are more likely to have no psychiatric disorder and are less likely to have used alcohol as part of the suicide attempt, but are more likely to have been assaulted physically or verbally. The results on the GHQ-28 indicate that the process through which individuals move from suicidal thought to action may decrease multiple dimensions of quality of life.

AB Background: The main objective of the present study was to determine the association between completed suicides and season of the year in Iran during 2006-2010.
   Methods: Data on completed suicides were collected by questionnaires field out by the family members of the victims in Legal Medicine Centers throughout the country over the period from 2006 to 2010. The maximum number of completed suicides (380) was observed in August, while the minimum number (231) was reported in February.
   Results: Season-wise, completed suicides were most prevalent in summer (1040), whereas least prevalent in winter (726). Mean (SD) age of individuals having committed suicide was 31.5 (14.6) years. This value did not change significantly in different seasons (P=0.051); nor, was a statistically significant difference observed in the educational level and the reason for suicide across different seasons of the year. Self-immolation and toxic poisoning were found to be significantly less common in autumn and winter (P<0.05), respectively. The number of completed suicides was higher in warm seasons
   Conclusion: Season of the year had significant relationships with gender as well the method of suicide, while no significant association was observed for age, level of education, and reason for suicide.

AB This article attempts to study the relationship between different dimensions of religiosity - ideological, emotional, ritual, knowledge, and consequential - and committing suicide. Based on theories of Clark, Stark and Meadow on religiosity, as well as theories of Durkheim, Porter Field, Gibbs and Martin on suicide, and by using survey method, descriptive statistics, T-test, and Pearson's correlation coefficient, the study tries to illustrate the relation between different aspects of religiosity and committing suicide in Darehshahr, Iran, 2009. Findings of the research indicate that different dimensions of religiosity among normal individuals (control group) are higher than that among the suicidal people. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective. To describe and evaluate the feasibility of integrating a suicide prevention program with Primary Health Care services and evaluate if such system can improve screening and identification of depressive disorder, reduce number of suicide attempters, and lower rate of suicide completion. Methodology. This was a quasi- experimental trial in which one community was exposed to the intervention versus the control community with no such exposure. The study sites were two counties in Western Iran. The intervention protocol called for primary care and suicide prevention collaboration at different levels of care. The outcome variables were the number of suicides committed, the number of documented suicide attempts, and the number of identified depressed cases. Results. We identified a higher prevalence of depressive disorders in the intervention site versus the control site (chi(2) = 14.8, P < 0.001). We also found a reduction in the rate of suicide completion in the intervention region compared to the control, but a higher prevalence of suicide attempts in both the intervention and the control sites. Conclusion. Integrating a suicide prevention program with the Primary Health Care network enhanced depression and suicide surveillance capacity and subsequently reduced the number of suicides, especially in rural areas.

AB Background: Suicide by aggressive physical methods such as firearms, hanging, and jumping is well known; however, different factors may influence a person while selecting a particular method. The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiological factors involved in the selection and use of different physical methods for suicide over a long-term period in Ilam province, Iran.
   Methods: The present study was conducted retrospectively between 1993 and 2013 using recorded data from a comprehensive system for registration of suicide attempts in Ilam University of Medical Sciences. The epidemiological characteristics included person, time and place variables, and the outcomes of the suicide attempts. The chi square, univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used for data analysis.
   Results: Totally, 1516 suicide attempts were evaluated (the annual incidence rate: 19/100,000 individuals). The most commonly used suicide method in females (88.4%) and males (38.9%) was self-immolation. Furthermore, the annual incidence rate among males and females was within the age group of 15-24 years (24.6 and 47.8/100,000 individuals). The risk of death by suicide in the age group of 55-64 years was 2.93 compared with the age group of 10-14 years (OR = 2.93; 95% CI = 0.64-13.54, P = 0.168).
   Conclusion: This study revealed that self-immolation was the most selected physical method of suicide and had the highest incidence rate, and inflicted the survivors with severe physical and mental complications. In order to reduce the use of physical methods, especially self-immolation, life skills training becomes more important than ever.

AB Background: suicide is a serious public health problem in many provinces in Iran such as Kermanshah province.
   Objective(s): to determine the incidence of suicide & its trend among kermanshah rural population and its risk factors.
   Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, all cases of attempted suicide over a period of 7 years (2000-2006) have been investigated. There were a total number of 239 suicides, and we recorded data on age and job groups, sex, season of attempt, applied methods for suicide and its consequences.
   Results: The findings showed that the incidence rate of suicide was 22 per 100.000. 68.8 % of cases were females. The most job group of female was housewife (98.2 %) and in males were those whose jobs were related to agriculture and animal husbandry (31.4 %). In both genders, the age group 20-29 accounted for most cases (45.2 %). The seasonal patterns of suicide were different for males and females, in women the most suicides were occurred in spring (33.5 %) and for men in autumn (33.3 %). The study indicates that the preferred suicide method for women was self-burning (65.8 %) and for men were poisoning and hanging (29.3 % for each of them). The Suicide consequences were as followed: 89.1 % were died, 8.8 % were recovered and 1.3 % were disabled. 87.8 percent of women and 92 percent of men, whom were inspected, had completed suicide.
   Conclusion: Studying of this process in rural areas of Kermanshah had shown a downward trend from years 2000 to 2006. It means that the mental health plans- and interventions were carried out by PHC system could reduce high Suicide rate in Kermanshah rural areas. The high Percentage of suicide in rural areas indicated that it should be a warning for health policy and for decision makers to pay more attention to suicide prevention programs. It also requires intervention of other Sectors. It calls for an innovative, comprehensive, multi-sectoral approach including, both health and non-health sectors (e.g. education, police, justice, religion, law, politics, the media, etc). We found a higher percentage of completed suicide in rural women, different seasonal pattern and preferred suicide methods in both sexes in rural areas of Kermanshah in comparison with national- and international patterns.

AB Background and objectives This cross-sectional study was conducted as a part of the Multisite Intervention Study on Suicidal Behaviors, a WHO multinational project, and aimed at determining demographic and clinical characteristics of suicide attempters seen at emergency care departments (EDs) in Karaj, Iran.
   Methods The population under study comprised all suicide attempters seen at EDs of hospitals in Karaj from 2002 to 2003. In total, 632 suicide attempters agreed to participate in the study. Information about demographic and clinical variables; the method, time and place of the suicide attempt; earlier attempts; the use of health services, etc was collected by examining hospital records and by interviewing patients. Data were analyzed with SPSS software.
   Results Most of the suicide attempters were women (62.5%), single (53.6%), and had a high-school education (52.8%). The mean age was 24.5 (+/- 9) years. Many of the male suicide attempters were unemployed (29.8%) and the majority of female attempters were housewives (67.5%). A positive history of suicide among relatives was observed in 15.4% of the attempters. A total of 28% of the participants had previously attempted suicide. A total of 23.7% reported poor physical health in the 3 months before the attempt.
   Conclusion The suicide attempters seen at the EDs typically were unemployed men, high-school students, women, and housewives.

AB IntroductionWe aimed to evaluate the relationship between suicide method, and gender, age, and level of education in a nationwide study in Iran over the period from 2006 to 2010.
   MethodsData on completed suicide cases referred to all forensic medicine centers throughout the country that were approved by an autopsy test were collected using data collection forms, which were filled out by the family members in interview sessions. Then, statistical analyses were performed using analysis of variance and chi-square tests, as well as logistic regression analysis.
   ResultsHanging is more popular among men (62.9% versus 27.7%), while self-burning is preferable for women (39% versus 7%) (P<0.0001). Younger individuals more frequently adopt a highly violent method, firearms (mean age of 27.1), while older persons more often use hanging and poisoning (mean ages of 32.4 and 32.1, respectively) (P<0.0001). Hanging and self-burning are more frequently used by persons with lower levels of education, whereas poisoning is more popular with more educated individuals (P<0.0001).
   DiscussionAll of the studied variables, that is, gender, age, education level, are critical risk factors of adopting different suicide methods in an Iranian population. Future work is necessary to explore the psychopathology adopting different suicide methods in the Iranian population.

AB Background: Suicide behaviors are complex and multifactorial problems that in the most of the societies are considered as the public health challenge. However, its underlying reasons and spatial pattern remain unclear in Hamadan Province, western Iran.
   Study design: Secondary analysis of existing data.
   Methods: We assessed the spatial pattern pre-city regarding some influencing factors by scan-statistics and logistic regression to detect clusters areas and its comparison with other areas for the period of 20162017. All of the registered cases of attempted suicide in a quality registry system of suicide in Sina (Farshchian) Hospital affiliated to Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran were enrolled.
   Results: Two significant clusters were detected in study areas, formed with relative risk at 5.28 (P=0.001) and 6.33 (P=0.017), and with the centrality of Asadabad and Razan, respectively. Clusters and nonclusters areas were differed in terms of location (OR=0.15, 95%, CI: 0.07, 0.31), self-harms methods (OR=0.28, 95%, CI: 0.9, 0.88) and education. Residents of rural areas, illiterate people and non-drug user cases have more likely to be in a cluster.
   Conclusion:Clusters were not formed equally among cities of Hamadan Province. Accordingly, we suggest the implementation of appropriate, long-term and evidence-based educations for high-risk and vulnerable groups through the intersectoral interventions in different parts of Hamadan Province (considering the cluster and non-clusters areas) to avert deaths and related injuries from attempted suicide.

AB Background: This study aim was to describe the epidemiology of intentional self-poisoning among students.
   Subjects and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on self-poisoned students admitted to Loghman-Hakim Hospital in Tehran, Iran. Variables studied included age, sex, substance abuse, personal history, familial history and the immediate precipitant for the suicide attempt.
   Results: A total of 248 students (200 F and 48 M) studied. The mean age was 16.3 +/- 1.42 years. Self poisoning with a pharmaceutical agent was the most common attempt modality (87.5%). The most common precipitant for the suicide attempt was family conflict (54.4%), followed by romantic disappointment (29.4%). The most common psychiatric disorders were adjustment disorder (84.3%). and depression (18.1%).
   Conclusion: The emphasis in student suicide prevention programs must be on early identification of students at risk, and appropriate treatment of episodes of psychopathology.

AB Addiction is identified as an important risk factor for suicidal behaviors. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of suicidal attempts among individuals seeking treatment for addiction. The sample consisted of 250 individuals (16 women and 234 men) substance users fulfilling DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for substance dependence disorders, who were attending a university clinic for addiction in Iran. The results revealed that 16.8% of subjects reported attempting suicide at least once (17.9% of male addicts, whereas none of 16 women reported suicidal attempts). Crack users, I. V drug abusers, younger and single patients had more suicide attempts. Using knife was the most prevalent type of attempt (52.33%). The findings confirmed other reports of higher rates of suicide attempts among addicts and may suggest a greater emphasis should be placed on the identifying suicide risk factors among addicts and using appropriate strategies for prevention and treatment.

AB Background: Nurses play a major role in providing end-of-life care, and euthanasia is considered to be one of the most important ethical challenges that care providers can face. Aim: To assess the nurses' attitude towards euthanasia in Iran. Methods: The cross-sectional study included nurses who worked in intensive and critical care, as well as dialysis units of a teaching hospital affiliated to Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, who were selected by the census sampling technique. Data were collected using a two-part questionnaire encompassing the demographic characteristics of nurses and the 20-item Euthanasia Attitude Scale. Results: The overall score of nurses' attitudes towards euthanasia, ranging from one to five, was 2.71 +/- 0.45, indicating a negative attitude and opposition towards euthanasia. Alongside this, the results demonstrated that there was no significant relationship between demographic characteristics and nurses' attitudes toward euthanasia. Conclusion: In general, nurses in Iran oppose euthanasia. This can be attributed to the context of religious beliefs and culture in Iran as an Islamic country.

AB Background: While suicide by burns is a relatively uncommon form of suicide in developed countries, it is one of the most common methods of suicide in the Middle East region including Iran. Aims: To describe epidemiologic characteristics of suicidal behaviors by burns in the province of Fars, Iran. Methods: A prospective population-based study of all suicidal behaviors by burns requiring hospitalization was conducted in the province of Fars, Iran, from March 21, 2005 to March 20, 2006. Data were obtained from patients, family members, and/or significant others through interviews during the course of hospitalization. Results: A total of 125 patients with suicidal behavior by burns requiring hospitalization were identified during the study period, representing an overall incidence rate of 4.3 per 100,000 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 3.6-5.1). Females (6.2 per 100,000) had a higher rate of suicidal behavior by burns than males (2.4 per 100,000; p < .001). The age-specific rate of suicidal behavior by burns peaked at age 20-29 years (10.1 per 100,000). The rate of suicidal behavior by burns was higher among single (7.2 per 100,000) vs. married persons (4.2 per 100,000; p = 0.03). Single males aged 20-39 years and young married women aged 15-29 years were at greatest risk of suicidal behavior by burns. The most common precipitating factor (74.4%) for suicidal behavior was a quarrel with a family member, a relative, and/or a friend. Conclusions: The high rate of suicidal behavior by burns among young/married women in Fars is of concern. Social, cultural, and economic factors may contribute to suicidal behavior and need to be addressed through education, support, and commitment.

AB Masjid-i-Sulaiman (MIS) is located in the southwest of Iran. Unfortunately, some parts of MIS are contaminated by subsurface leakage of natural gas containing H2S. In order to investigate the possible effect(s) of chronic exposure to sulfur compounds on suicidal behavior, the present study was done. In the 2-year period, 561 individuals attempted suicide (260 men and 301 women). Completed suicide comprised of 19 men and 32 women. The rate per 100,000 person-years was 19.9 for men and 34.8 for women aged over 15 years. Forty-two (13 men and 29 women) of 561 patients were self-immolators by fire with a male:female ratio 0.45. This represents 22.4 burns per 100,000 person-years and is equivalent to 7.4% of all suicide attempts. Thirty-three of 42 patients died (78.6%) who were 9 men and 24 women with male:female ratio 0.37. There is statistically significant differences between sex groups (P-(2)=0.009 1). The self-inflicted burn was the most frequent method for lethal suicide. Winter was the most common season for self-burning followed by spring. Statistical analysis showed significant difference between seasons for self-inflicted burn (P-(2)=0.00001). Analysis of correlation showed statistically positive correlation coefficient between mean values of all reactive sulfur compounds and seasonal frequency of suicide (r = 0.923, P-(1) = 0.038).

AB Suicide is one the most important public health problem which is rapidly growing concerns. The aim of this study was to subgroup suicide using LCA method. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Iran based on 66990 records registered in Ministry of Health in 2014. A case report questionnaire in the form of software was used for case registries. Latent class analysis was used to achieve the research objectives. Four latent classes were identified; (a) Non-lethal attempters without a history of psychiatric disorders, (b) Non-lethal attempters with a history of psychiatric disorders, (c) Lethal attempters without a history of psychiatric disorders, (d) Lethal at tempters with a history of psychiatric disorders. The probability of completed/an achieved suicide is high in lethal attempter classes. Being male increases the risk of inclusion in lethal attempters' classes (OR = 4.93). Also, being single (OR = 1.16), having an age lower than 25 years (OR = 1.14) and being a rural citizen (OR = 2.36) associate with lethal attempters classes. The males tend to use more violent methods and have more completed suicide. Majority of the individuals are non-lethal attempters who need to be addressed by implementing preventive interventions and mental support provision.

AB Background: Suicide is an important, preventable, public health problem worldwide, caused by the interaction of numerous environmental, biological and psychosocial factors.
   Aims: This study aimed to identify the factors associated with suicidal attempts in Isfahan, Iran, in 2015.
   Methods: In this case-control study, 175 cases who committed suicide and were admitted to emergency services were compared with 175 controls selected among outpatients from the same hospital without any history of suicide attempt. Demographic, psychosocial, personality traits, religiosity, coping skills, stressful life events, socioeconomic status and psychiatric distress were compared between groups. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors for suicide.
   Results: Marital status, education, socioeconomic status, psychological distress, perceived social support, stress coping strategies, personality, religious beliefs, stress life events and general health condition were significantly different between groups. The regression analysis revealed that perceived social support (odds ratio (OR) = 0.962, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.94-0.984), religious beliefs (OR = 0.923, 95% CI: 0.867-0.984) and stressful life event (OR = 1.524, 95% CI: 1.251-1.856) were significantly associated with suicide attempts.
   Conclusion: Our finding showed that religious beliefs, perceived social support and stressful life events are the main factors associated with suicide attempts. So, positive strategies such as improvements in life skills to control stressful life events, religiosity and perceived social support can be used to control suicide attempts.

ID MORTALITY; SUICIDE; BURNS
AB Deliberate self-inflicted burn is rare in high-income countries, but is reported more frequently in low- and middle-income countries, especially in Asia and Africa. Rates in Iran are among the highest in the world, with up to 71% of committed suicides conducted via self-immolation in some regions. The objective of this study was to identify the epidemiologic features and factors of self-immolation in Iran to aid in development of effective intervention programs. In a review study, two national databases were analyzed to identify demographic, geographic, cultural, economic, and health-related aspects of self-immolation that may vary across regions of Iran. Demographic information revealed that 27% of suicide cases in Iran were via self-immolation. Of those, 71% were female. The mean age was 29 years. Geographical features of self-immolation indicated that the self-immolation rate was higher in rural areas and in provinces that border the country. Provinces that were involved more intensively in postwar problems feature higher rates of self-immolation. People of Kurdish ethnicity were more likely to engage in self-immolation. Unemployment was a risk factor for self-immolation, while mental disorders and lack of access to health and treatment facilities did not play an important role for increasing the rate of self-immolation. Overall, this study demonstrates that self-immolation is a significant public health problem in some parts of Iran. This study clearly and consistently shows that self-immolation is a complex phenomenon with multiple causes. Various intervention options are discussed to increase coping skills on the individual and community levels.

AB Background: Our knowledge of the influence of place of birth and socioeconomic status on attempted suicide in a defined national population is limited.
   Methods: The study population at baseline in 1993 included approximately 4.5 million Swedish persons aged 25 to 64 years, of whom 5 70 000 had been born abroad. Each individual was tracked until attempted suicide, remigration, death, or the end of the study on December 31, 1998. The Cox regression was used in the analysis.
   Results: Labor migrants from Finland and other OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries and refugees from Poland and Iran had higher hazard ratios of attempted suicide than Swedish-born control subjects. Women born in Latin America, Asia, and Eastern Europe had significantly higher hazard ratios of attempted suicide than Swedish-born women. In contrast, men born in southern Europe and Asia had significantly lower hazard ratios of attempted suicide. The hazard ratios of attempted suicide among women from Iran, Asia, southern Europe, Latin America, and eastern Europe considerably exceeded those of men from the same country of origin. When socioeconomic status was included in the final model, the hazard ratios remained high for women, while the risk of attempted suicide among men declined sharply with increased income.
   Conclusions: Place of birth, socioeconomic status, and sex are associated with attempted suicide. Socioeconomic status explains only part of the association between place of birth and attempted suicide.

AB Suicide by burning is a rare condition in the developed countries (0.06-1% of all suicides) but is more frequent in the developing countries (accounting for as many as 40.3% of all suicides). In different parts of Iran, between 1.39% and 9.50% of patients that attempted suicide and 25.0% and 40.3% of patients who committed suicide were via deliberate self-burning. Self-burning (immolation) comprises between 0.37% and 40% of total burn center admissions around the world and, in Iran, it comprises between 4.1% and 36.6% of admissions in Iranian burn centers. Approximately 80% of hospitalized self-immolation patients die. The goal of this study was to identify the epidemiologic features, causes, and potential protective factors regarding suicide by burning in Kermanshah province, in the west of Iran, and to develop the effective intervention programs based on the Public Health Approach to Prevention. During the course of a year, from March 21, 2004, to March 20, 2005 (based on the Iranian calendar), the author examined all the suicidal patients who were admitted to the emergency department of hospitals in Kermanshah University of Medical Science. Examination included a retrospective cross-section study, via demographic questionnaires and suicidal checklists. During the period of study, 1820 patients who attempted suicide and 90 patients who successfully committed suicide were admitted. A total of 41% (37 cases) of patients who committed suicide were via self-immolation. Of these, 81% of self-immolation patients were female (P < .0005), and the female:male ratio was 4.3:1. A total of 86.5% of the patients were in the 11 to 30 years of age group. The mean age was 24.9 years (range, 14-50 years). Forty-nine percent of cases were single, 84% were illiterate or had a low level of education, 78.5% were housewives, and 14% were unemployed. Also, most of the patients (53%) were living in rural area, 97% did not have a previous history of suicide attempt, and 67.5% regretted their self-immolation act. The majority of the self-immolations (64.8%) occurred during daylight hours, and the most common self-immolation motivation factor was marital conflict (32.5%). Overall, this study demonstrates that self-immolation should be considered as a mental health problem in our society, and it is necessary to implement programs and strategies to prevent it. The public health approach provides a framework for a National Prevention Strategy to address this serious national problem. Local data on victims and victim stories from self-immolation provided the stimulus for community action.

   Suicide
AB Background: Suicide is a worldwide public health problem with over a million deaths each year. Overall, the suicide rates among Muslim countries is reported at as low, however, there is growing evidence that it is increasing. Suicide is one of the greatest sins in Islam and is strictly forbidden. Therefore, data on the national incidence and prevalence of suicide in Muslim countries may be under-reported.
   Objectives: The current study-aimed at describing the frequency and pattern of deaths due to suicide based on medicolegal autopsy records.
   Methods: In the current retrospective study, data were collected on all suicide deaths underwent a medicolegal forensic investigation from 01 January, 2013, to 31 December, 2015, in the Isfahan province, Iran.
   Results: During the study period 576 suicides were identified. Hanging was the most frequent method comprising 335 cases, followed by poisoning and burning with 98 and 87 cases, respectively. Males hanged themselves (68.79%), while females used burning (41.2%). Among the victims, 307 were married and 261 were unmarried. Death due to burning was 3.3 times more frequent among the married cases compared with that of the single ones (P < 0.0 01). Education status did not significantly contribute to explain differences in the methods of suicide (P value = 0.123).
   Discussion: The current study results showed that self-burning was a method mostly used by housewives. Due to the heavy influence of Islam on this region, there was a high probability that the true number of suicides is significantly underreported and more detailed investigations are required.

AB The present study is part of the WHO/SUPRE-MISS conducted in Iran. The aim of the study was to determine the lifetime prevalence of suicide behaviors in a community sample of Iranian adults. Five hundred and four families were selected randomly according to electricity bills in Karaj, 45 km from the capital city, represented the catchment area for this investigation. The SUPRE-MISS questionnaires used in this study compromised a variety of aspects of suicidal behaviors. Lifetime prevalence rates for suicidal ideation, planning and attempts were 14%, 6.6%, and 4.1% respectively. Tobacco users and long-term mental and physical disabilities were significantly higher among subjects with a history of suicidal attempts. Younger ages, tobacco abuse, and long-term mental or physical disabilities could be considered risk factors for attempting suicide.

AB Background: The current study aimed to test the hypothesis: Is suicide predictable? And try to classify the predictive factors in multiple suicide attempts.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was administered to 223 multiple attempters, women who came to a medical poison centre after a suicide attempt. The participants were young, poor, and single. A Logistic Regression Analiysis was used to classify the predictive factors of suicide.
   Results: Women who had multiple suicide attempts exhibited a significant tendency to attempt suicide again. They had a history for more than two years of multiple suicide attempts, from three to as many as 18 times, plus mental illnesses such as depression and substance abuse. They also had a positive history of mental illnesses.
   Conclusion: Results indicate that contributing factors for another suicide attempt include previous suicide attempts, mental illness (depression), or a positive history of mental illnesses in the family affecting them at a young age, and substance abuse.

AB Objective: To describe the effectiveness of a community-based program targeting prevention of self-immolation. Suicide by burning is rare in developed countries (0.1-1.8% of all suicides), but more frequent in developing countries (up to 41% of all suicides). Self-immolation constitutes from 0.4% to 40% of admissions to burn centers worldwide. During 2001, an average of 11 Iranians committed suicide daily, 4 of these being self-immolations (36%). Self-immolation caused from 4% to 28% of all admissions to Iranian burn centers. Approximately 80% of hospitalized self-immolation patients die. All descriptive self-immolation. studies in Iran emphasize the need for implementing prevention programs.
   Design: Quasi-experimental.
   Setting: The Iranian cities Gilangharb (intervention) and Sarpolzahab (reference).
   Participants: The populations of these communities.
   Methods: Hospital data collection on self-immolation patients and suicide attempts (all mechanisms) was made from 21 March 1999 to 20 March 2003. The first 12 months of the study provided baseline data, while the last 3 years comprised of a community-based intervention, using a mix of passive and active interventions. Videos showing victim stories were an important component in the prevention program. The interventions were particularly aimed at young women and socio-economically deprived groups, these being shown to be at high risk in earlier studies.
   Results: Compared to baseline, the mean self-immolation attempts rate decreased by 57% after the implementation of the intervention in Gilangharb (p = 0.04, Yates corrected p = 0.07). Correspondingly, the reference city rate decreased 27% (n.s.). Moreover, in Gilangharb a 19% decrease of suicide attempts (all mechanisms) was observed while the corresponding reference city rate increased by 24% (n.s.). While the suicide attempt rates were similar in the two populations during baseline, the mean rates observed during the intervention period differed significantly (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusions: A community prevention program targeting self-immolation can be effective. Local data and the showing of videos depicting victim stories from self-immolation attempts provided a stimulus for community action. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Nursing students experience anxiety and stress that may be related to suicidal thoughts. The main of this study was to determine the relationship between stress, depression, anxiety and suicide ideation in nursing students.
   METHODS: In this cross-sectional study 342 undergraduate nursing students of the Hamadan University of Medical Sciences of Iran were selected with censer sampling. The data collection tool was a Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Item (DASS-21) and Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS). The data were analyzed using Pearson's correlation and multiple regression analysis. Data were analyzed using the SPSS v. 18.
   RESULTS: Overall, 9.1% of the students were considered to present suicide ideation and 13.4% depression, 20.5% anxiety and 7% tress. Linear regression analysis confirmed that depression is significant predictors of suicidal ideation.
   CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that interventions to prevent suicidal ideation among nursing students should include strategies to assess mental health and to improve positive coping strategies in managing distress to reduce depression and suicidal ideation.

AB Self-immolation is one of the most painful methods of suicide which is widespread among women in Kurdish regions of Iran. The present study aimed to explore the causes and sociocultural groundwork of choosing self-immolation methods by women in Kurdish regions of Iran.
   This present study was conducted using a qualitative approach and conventional content analysis. The research population included women who self-immolated and were rescued in Kurdish regions of Iran. The data collection method was a deep interview as well as observation. The sampling method was based on objective and snowball sampling. The data collection continued to theoretical saturation, the number of participants reached 25 in the end, and Lincoln and Guba criteria were used to strengthen the research. From the analysis of the data obtained in this study, the 8 sub-themes related to cause of suicide attempt from the participants' viewpoints including unbridled coherence, lack of supportive social and environmental structures, economic pressure, aggravation of violence, humiliated ego, dominance of modern values over the local and indigenous ones, incoherent family, and giving up on changing conditions as well as 6 sub themes based on the cause of choosing the method of self-immolation including protesting, frightening the family, catching more attention, championing and showing courage, inducing more guilty feelings in the family and society, fashion or imitation, and easy access were revealed. Self-immolation is one of the most important problems in the Kurdish regions of Iran, which is rooted in various economic, social, psychological and cultural causes. To reduce this social harm, there is a need for comprehensive programs that cover all dimensions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB Aim: To investigate ( 1) general mental health, ( 2) quality of life and ( 3) suicide-related attitudes in Kurds living in Iranian Kurdistan.
   Methods: Cross-sectional investigation; cluster random sampling procedure; 1,000 Kurds were randomly selected from 1,000 of 68,000 households in Sannandaj City, Iran; General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12); Questionnaire on Attitudes Towards Suicide (ATTS).
   Results: About 27% of the subjects had to be regarded as probably suffering from a psychological disturbance. There was no gender difference regarding the number of 'cases'. These possible 'cases' were younger than 'non-cases'. The most 'cases' occurred among the unemployed. An increasing number of experiences related to suicide and the increasing emotional closeness of those experiences was found to be related to an increased probability that the individual would be classified as a 'case' according to the GHQ-12 total score. Unmarried individuals more often evaluated their overall quality of life as 'moderate' or 'bad' compared to married individuals. Unemployed people, self-employed people and housewives formed the groups who most often reported a 'very bad' or 'bad' quality of life.
   Conclusions: Kurdish people in Iran are in need of facilities and interventional programmes aiming to improve general mental health.

The average age was 27 years and 83% of them were female. Most of them were married, home makers and with high school education. Sixty-two percent had an impulsive suicidal intention. The major motive was marital conflict. Ninety-five percent had a psychiatric diagnosis-mostly adjustment disorder and 30% had a chronic physical illness. Mortality rate was 79%. High prevalence of self-burning in the young population, the pattern of demographic factors, their motivations and high prevalence of adjustment disorders highlights the need for making preventive measures, which should be focused on family structure, particularly in relation to marriage.

AB This study focuses on the relationship between the incidence of homicide, rage, suicide, and psychiatric hospitalization as violent behaviors with temperature, humidity, and air pressure as specific meteorological variables in the city of Mashhad, in the northeast of Iran. The data were obtained from Iran Meteorological Organization, official registry of Legal Medicine Organization and the local psychiatric hospital, March 2009 to Feb 2010 daily and were analyzed with SPSS-14 using Pearson correlation coefficient, ANOVA, and post hoc analysis tests. The rates of rage and psychiatric admission had a significant relationship with the daily mean air temperature, minimum relative humidity, maximum relative humidity, minimum daily pressure, and maximum daily air pressure (p<0.0001). There was no significant correlation between homicide and suicide rates with any meteorological variables (p>0.05). We concluded that, the possibility of nonfatal violence and psychiatric hospitalization would increase in hot and arid weather with low air pressure.

AB Self-inflicted burns have been considered a serious mental health problem throughout the world and especially in economically developing countries. The aim of this study was to identify the epidermologic features and current etiological factors of suicide by burning in Tehran, Iran, to develop effective prevention programs. Over a period of 2 years from March 1997 to March 1999, of the 1,236 patients aged 14 years and older who were admitted to Tohid Burn Center in Tehran, Iran, 110 (8.9%) had attempted suicide by self-immolation. The median age was 25 years (range: 14-68 years) and the median extent of the burns was 71% TBSA (range: 20-100%). Forty-eight patients had a previous psychiatric diagnosis (43.6%). Depression was the most common psychiatric diagnosis by history. The method most commonly used was a flame with the addition of a flammable liquid (frequently kerosene). Also, most of the patients (70%) were of a low socioeconomic class. Overall, self-inflicted burns should be considered an increasing mental health problem in our society. Therefore, it is necessary to implement prevention programs and strategies to reduce the incidence rate of this problem.

AB Background Attitudes towards suicide represent a key stage in the pathway leading to suicide. A deeper understanding of the social, psychological and treatment-related factors influencing the development of attitudes towards suicide could guide suicide prevention strategies especially in a neglected population like Kurds. Methods in a cross-sectional study in Iranian Kurdistan, 1,000 households participated in the investigation from April to May 2006 selected by a cluster random sampling process. A questionnaire on attitudes towards suicide (ATTS) was used to measure suicide related attitudes and thoughts. Results Suicide related experiences were more often reported from the wider social network (relative, friends, acquaintances) than from family members. There is a significant accumulation of suicide related experiences when a related event was reported in the close family. The level of suicide related attitudes is related to age, gender, marital status, level of education and employment status. Discussion Openness towards the topic of suicide as well as abilities to communicate about it should be improved by educating the public and additionally be promoted by changing conservative value systems.

AB Background: Suicide ranks among the top ten causes of death in all age groups all over the world. There are many methods for committing suicide including self-poisoning, firearm and hanging. The aim of the present study was to provide an overview of self-poisoning related suicidal deaths with special focus on forensic toxicology analysis results in Tehran, Iran from 2011 to 2015.
   Methods: All suspicious cases with the the history of self-poisoning were investigated to define the cause and manner of death under the supervision of forensic medicine practitioners. Postmortem samples were analysed in forensic toxicology laboratory to confirm the presence of drugs in cadaver of suicidal cases. Drugs and poisons were analysed using thin layer chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, headspace gas chromatography and gas chromatography equipped with nitrogen phosphorus detector. Demographic data were collected from autopsy reports of all cases with confirmed self-poisoning suicidal cause of death.
   Results: Results showed that 674 cases of self-poisoning deaths were investigated during a five-year study period, of which 68.55% were male. The most often used suicide method was self-poisoning in young population. Phosphine gas liberated from aluminum phosphide tablets was the most toxic substance detected in postmortem samples (619 cases) followed by opioids, methamphetamine, organophosphates, cyanide and strychnine.
   Conclusion: In conclusion self-poisoning suicidal death was predominant in young male population in Tehran, Iran. It seems that free access to suicide means such as drugs and poisons should be restricted by national and health authorities.

AB Background: Adolescent and young adults are at increased risk of psychiatric distress and serious disability. We estimated the prevalence and associated risk factors of psychiatric distress among the college students of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Iran.
   Methods: We performed this cross-sectional study, from Jan to May 2016 at Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran. Students filled out voluntarily an anonymous self-administered questionnaire, including demographic characteristics, personal information, behavioral risk factors, and a validated Persian version of the GHQ-28 questionnaire, including somatic symptoms (items 1-7), anxiety/insomnia (items 8-14), social dysfunctions (items 15-21), and severe depression (items 22-28).
   Results: Of 1259 participants, 518 (41.1%) had psychiatric distress, 166 (13.2%) had heterosexual intercourse, 100 (8.0%) had homosexual intercourse, 204 (16.2%) were smokers (31.6% in males and 6.3% in females), 124 (9.9%) reported a history of using opium/psychedelic substances, 204 (16.2%) reported suicide thought, and 103 (8.2%) had attempted suicide at least once in the past. After adjusting odds ratio (95% CI) for age and sex, psychiatric distress were significantly associated with emotional breakdown 2.67 (2.09, 3.40), heterosexual intercourse 2.56 (1.82, 3.62), homosexual intercourse 2.42 (1.57, 3.71), smoking 3.19 (2.29, 4.45), substance abuse 5.03 (3.26, 7.76), suicide thought 7.81 (5.42, 11.27), suicide attempt 5.64 (3.49, 9.12), uninterested in the discipline 2.29 (1.70, 3.07), and non-optimistic about future 2.16 (1.63, 2.86).
   Conclusion: A majority of college students had psychiatric distress and a substantial number of them reported one or more high-risk behaviors that if neglected, may severely impair the students' function and influence their subsequent development and productive lives.

AB OBJECTIVES To investigate the association between schizophrenia and Toxoplasma gondii, and to assess the association of infection with suicide attempts and age of onset of schizophrenia in these patients.
   METHODS Case-control study Fars Province, southern Iran. Cases were individuals with psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia as per Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria. Controls were healthy blood donors, frequency-matched with patients according to age and sex. For the detection of IgG antibodies, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used. Data about demographic information in all subjects and duration of illness and history of suicide attempts in patients with schizophrenia were collected using a brief questionnaire and hospital records. Chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression were used for statistical analyses.
   RESULTS Among 99 cases, 42 individuals (42%) were positive for T. gondii antibody, vs. 41 (27%) among 152 controls (OR = 2, 95% CI: 1.2-3.4, P = 0.012). We compared the suicide attempts in patients with schizophrenia based on their T. gondii serologic status. There was a lower rate of suicide attempts in seropositive male patients than seronegative ones (OR = 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1-0.97, P = 0.04). Age of onset of schizophrenia did not differ between T. gondii-infected and non-infected patients.
   CONCLUSIONS These findings may have implications for schizophrenia and suicide prevention programmes. However, clearly further studies are required to confirm them.

AB The researchers conducted this study as a phenomenological research to understand the individual and social factors related to attempted suicide phenomenon among women of Gilan-e Gharb. Participants of the study are comprised of 17 women survivors of attempted suicide selected by purposive sampling or snowball method. To gather the data, we conducted semi-structured interviews in face-to-face and audio-recorded methods from February to April 2017. Researchers transcribed verbatim and analyzed the content of the interviews thematically. The main issues in this study were three main themes including the "personal factors", "social factors", and "other issues related to attempted suicide" with seven sub-themes. We concluded that both personal and social factors contribute to the suicide attempts in female subjects. Also, we found that the majority of participants did not want to die by the attempted suicide.

AB Objective: In order to generate local evidence, a case-control study was designed to explore risk factors for suicide attempts (SA) in one of the larger cities in the southeast of Iran Kerman.
   Methods: From one of the main referral hospitals, 300 cases and 300 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited. On top of demographic variables, the following variables were compared in the two groups: personality traits, psychological condition, religiosity, coping skills, general health, and recent stressful events.
   Results: Having adjusted for recent stressful events as the most important factor (OR = 1.66, P-value <0.001), the main significant variables were: general health (1.04, P = 0.02), the support of friends (OR = 0.95, P-value = 0.04), being problem-focused mentality (OR = 0.88, P-value = 0.005), and intrinsic religiousness (OR = 0.86, P-value = 0.01).
   Conclusions: Although, recent stress increased the risk of SA considerably, other factors such as general health, friends' support, and being problem-focused may predispose subjects independently. Conversely, intrinsic religious beliefs and close social networks may have protective effects. Therefore, a multi-disciplinary approach is recommended to minimize the burden of SA in Iran.

AB Introduction: Cigarette smoking is the single largest preventable cause of death and disability in the industrialized world and it causes at least 85% of lung cancers, chronic bronchitis and emphysema. In addition smokers are at a higher risk from psychiatric co-morbid illness such as depression and completed suicide.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in which we targeted all patients with serious mental illness (SMI) who were admitted in Razi mental health Hospital in Tehran, Iran. We recruited 984 participants, who were receiving services from Razi mental health Hospital and hospitalized for at least two days between 21 July to 21 September, 2010. Nine hundred and fifty patients out of this figure were able to participate in our study.
   Results: The final study sample (n = 950) consisted of 73.2% males and 26.8% females. The mean age was 45.31 (SD=13.7). A majority of participants (70%) was smoker. A history of never smoking was present for 25.2% of the study sample; while 4.8% qualified as former smokers and 70.0% as occasional or current smokers. Two hundred and nineteen participants had attempted suicide amongst them 102 (46.6%) once, 37 (16.9%) twice, and 80 (36.5%) attempted more than two times in their life time. In regression model, gender, age, and cigarette consumption were associated with previous suicide attempts and entered the model in this order as significant predictors.
   Conclusion: There is an association of cigarette smoking and suicide attempt in psychiatric inpatients. Current smoking, a simple clinical assessment, should trigger greater attention by clinicians to potential suicidality and become part of a comprehensive assessment of suicide risk.

AB The aim of the present study was to explore the mediating role of patience on the relationship between mindfulness and suicide ideation. To do so, 110 patients with cardiovascular diseases were recruited from the outpatient Clinic of Imam Reza in the city of Shiraz in Iran. These patients completed The Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire, Patience Scale, and Suicide Ideation Questionnaire. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results indicated a significant positive relationship between mindfulness and patience (r = .32, p < .001). There was a significant negative relationship between patience and suicide ideation (r = -.36, p < .001). The results of mediating model showed that patience functioned as a mediator in the relationship between mindfulness and suicide ideation among patients with cardiovascular diseases (beta = -.33, p = .005). According to these findings, it can be claimed that mindfulness affects patients' suicidal thoughts negatively through patience.

AB Objective To determine whether brief intervention and contact is effective in reducing subsequent suicide mortality among suicide attempters in low and middle-income countries.
   Methods Suicide attempters (n = 1867) identified by medical staff in the emergency units of eight collaborating hospitals in five culturally different sites (Campinas, Brazil; Chennai, India; Colombo, Sri Lanka; Karaj, Islamic Republic of Iran; and Yuncheng, China) participated, from January 2002 to October 2005, in a randomized controlled trial to receive either treatment as usual, or treatment as usual plus brief intervention and contact (BIC), which included patient education and follow-up. Overall, 91 % completed the study. The primary study outcome measurement was death from suicide at 18-month follow-up.
   Findings Significantly fewer deaths from suicide occurred in the BIC than in the treatment-as-usual group (0.2% versus 2.2%, respectively; chi(2) = 13.83, P<0.001).
   Conclusion This low-cost brief intervention may be an important part of suicide prevention programmes for underresourced low-and middle-income countries.

AB The role of 5-HTFLPR and 5-HT2C Cys23Ser polymorphisms in the psychopathology of mood disorders and suicide behavior is controversial. The aim of present study was to investigate the association between 5-HTFLPR and 5-HT2C Cys23Ser variants and susceptibility to bipolar I disorder (BID). The 5-HT2C genotypes were studied in 152 patients with BID and 173 gender- and age-matched healthy individuals with Kurds ethnic background from Western Iran using PCR and PCR-RFLP methods. In recessive model (SS vs. LL+LS) the SS genotype was associated with 1.79-fold increased risk of BID (p = 0.018). Also, the presence of S allele increased the risk of adult-onset BID by 1.76-fold (p = 0.027). No association was detected between 5-HTTLPR genotypes and alleles with suicide attempt. The frequency of 5-HT2C Ser allele in patients and controls were 12.3 and 12.5%, respectively. Mutant allele of HT2C Ser had higher frequency in female (14.7%) than male (10.5%, p = 0.27) patients. The frequency of HT2C Ser allele in patients with a family history of BID tended to be higher (15.7%) than those without a family history of the disease (11.8%). The frequency of HT2C Ser allele in suicide attempter women was higher (16.7%) than those without a suicide attempt (14.3%). Our findings demonstrate 5-HTTLPR polymorphism might be a risk factor for BID and adult-onset BID in Kurds population. However, we found the lack of an association between 5-HT2C Cys/Ser variants and the risk of BID. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide by burning is an extreme act that is uncommon in the United States and throughout the Western world. The characteristics of people who complete such acts are not well understood. To address this issue, we examined the death records of the King County Medical Examiner's Office in Washington State over the 13 years from 1996 to 2009. Twenty-five cases of suicide by burning were identified and used to characterize decedent demographics, circumstances of death, and motivating factors. Compared to other methods of suicide, burning demonstrated a significant overrepresentation of decedents who were women, 40-59 years of age, and Asian/Pacific Islander. They also tended to have previous psychiatric illness and/or substance abuse issues. Self-burning predominantly occurred at the decedent's residence with the intent of suicide given. There was no unifying theme in motivating factors. Together, these data represent the characteristics of people whose death is because of suicide by burning in King County, Washington.

AB Background: Examining the premature death rate represents the first step in estimating the overall burden of disease. reflecting a full picture of how different causes affect population health and providing a way of monitoring and evaluating population health. Aims: This study was conducted to assess the burden of premature mortality from suicides in West Azerbaijan Province, northwest of Iran from 2014 to 2016. Method: To calculate years of potential life lost (YPLL), we categorized all methods of suicide, then we subtracted actual age at death by suicide from the relevant age-based life table produced by the World Health Organization in 2015, after which we added the results for each type of suicide in a particular year. Results: We analyzed 638 suicides. Overall, during the 3-year study period for both sexes. the greatest sources of premature death among all methods of suicide were: hanging, strangulation, and suffocation (X70); smoke, fire, and flames (X76); and poisoning by narcotics and psychodysleptics (X62). Limitations: Limitations of the study include a lack of accurate, systematic recording and reporting of all cases of suicide, which might lead to measurement bias. Conclusion: This study identified and highlighted the most common methods of suicide in West Azerbaijan.

AB Background: The aim of this Study was to determine the frequency of each poisoning and its related death in our center as a sample of Tehran in six consecutive years (2006 to 2011).
   Methods:All poisoned children and adults referring to Loghman-Hakim hospital poison center and hospitalized in the study period Were enrolled and evaluated.
   Results: In 108,265 patients, the most common causes of poisoning were anti-epileptics and sedative-hypnotics (22.3%). The most common causes of death were pesticides (24.84%) and narcotics (24.75%) In-drugs of abuse, opium was more prevalent in the early period of the study but Was replaced by methadone-later.
   Conclusion: It seems that national policies for drug control and prevention of suicide have not been efficient enough. We expect to see Iran in the first 50 countries with regard to suicide and to maintain the first place in narcotic abuse if enough attention is not provided.

AB Background: Suicide, a social phenomenon, is a major health problem in most countries. Yet data relating to the role social factors play in the development of this condition are lacking, with some factors shrouded in greater ambiguity than others. As such, this review aimed to determine the prevalence of social-related factors resulting in suicide and to present these findings through meta-analyses, allowing for causes of heterogeneity to be examined.
   Methods: Scientific databases including PubMed and Science direct were searched using sensitive keywords. Two researchers reviewed the eligibility of studies and extracted data. Meta-regression with the Mantel-Haenszel method was conducted using a random effect model, in addition to subgroup analysis and Egger's test.
   Results: A total of 2,526 articles were retrieved through the initial search strategy, producing 20 studies from 16 provinces for analysis. The most frequent cause of attempted suicide among the 20 analyzed articles was family conflict with 32% (95% CI: 26-38). Other related factors included marital problems (26%; 95% CI: 20-33), economic constrains (12%; 95% CI: 8-15) and educational failures (5%; 95% CI: 3-8). Results of meta-regression analysis found that sample size significantly affects heterogeneity for the factor 'family conflict'.
   Conclusions: Social factors such as family conflicts and marital problems have a noticeable role in Iranian suicidology.

AB Background: Self-immolation (SI) is considered one of the most painful, dramatic, and at the same time most inexplicable methods of suicide, with a high social impact. Prevalence rates are particularly high in Iran, and in north-western Iran specifically. Here, we report sociodemographic, psychological, and psychiatric characteristics of patients attempting self-immolation (PSIs), compared to patients with accident burns (PABs). Method: Patients referred to the Burns Emergency Unit of the Besat Hospital (Hamadan, Iran) were enrolled in the present study between winter 2015 and summer 2016. After burn-related treatments and surgery, a thorough interview was undertaken covering sociodemographic characteristics, burn-related information, and psychiatric background. Results: A total of 79 patients were enrolled. Among these, 19 (31.7%) had attempted suicide via SI. Compared to the PABs, the PS's were predominantly females; they reported family and marital problems as the main triggers for SI. The psychiatric interviews indi- cated that PSIS often suffered from major depressive disorders, adjustment disorders, and bipolar disorders. The prevailing feelings reported were guilt and shame. A binary logistic regression showed that feelings of guilt and marital and family problems predicted SI. Conclusions: The prevalence of SI was surprisingly high. Marital and family conflicts as a proxy for highly distressing social interactions, along with female gender and feelings of guilt and shame were strongly associated with SI. Family and couple counseling specifically tailored to difficulties experienced by women might reduce the risk of SI. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Background
   Suicidal attempt is an important phenomenon among pregnant women in Iran. This study was designed to determine the epidemiological status and risk factors of suicidal attempts by poisoning in pregnant women.
   Materials and Methods
   All pregnant women who were referred to the poisoning department of Imam Reza Hospital (Mashhad, Iran) from November 2016 to November 2017, were evaluated in terms of suicidal attempts. Cases of poisoning with a suicidal intent were included in the study after obtaining informed consent. A checklist, including the baseline characteristics, risk factors, and underlying causes of suicide, was completed for every participant anonymously. After regaining consciousness, the participants were interviewed by a psychiatrist in the consultation room for 20 minutes, and the underlying psychiatric disorders, mood disorders, stressors, and suicidal thoughts were evaluated. Finally, the collected data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 16.0).
   Results
   Among 40 pregnant women evaluated in this study, 87.5% did not have a stable job or income, 55% had difficult living conditions, 45% suffered from sleep disorders, 45% had suicidal thoughts, and 42.5% reported addiction in husband. In addition, 32.5% of women had a history of depression, 32.5% had previous suicidal attempts, 32.5% had abortion thoughts, 20% had a family history of suicide attempt, 17.5% were addicts, and 17.5% had a history of self-injury.
   Conclusion
   This study indicated that the most important factors associated with suicidal attempts by poisoning in pregnant women include lack of job and income, difficult living conditions, and history of psychiatric problems and addiction.

AB Burn injuries still produce a significant morbidity and mortality in Iran. This study was carried out to analyze the epidemiology, mortality, and current etiological factors of 1089 burn patients in the province of Kurdistan in the west of Iran during the 6 years from 21 March 1994 to 20 March 2000. There were two burn centers in Kurdistan, serving 1.4 million people in an area of 28,000km(2). The incidence rate of burn hospitalization was 13.5 per 100,000 person-years. The median age was 18 years with 58% of the patients under 20 years. The median Body Surface Area (BSA) burned was 40%. Incidence rate of burns for females was 18 per 100,000 person-years and 9.1 per 100,000 person-years for males (P-(2) < 0.000001). Also there was a statistically significant association between mortality rate and age groups/gender/BBS (P-(2) < 0.000001). Flame was the most common type of burn (694/1089, 63.7%). There was also a significant correlation between the age groups and types of burn (P-(2) < 0.00000 1). Ninety-one percent (991/1089) of the burns were unintentional (12.3 per 100,000 person-years), while suicide attempts by burning for the population aged 13 and older accounted for 12.7% (98/771) (2 per 100,000 person-years). The mortality rate was 4.5 per 100,000 person-years. The study results provide a valuable baseline by which to assess future efforts directed toward the prevention of burn injuries in Kurdistan.

AB Self-immolation is the third leading cause of years of life lost (YLL) among women in Iran. The aim of this study is to investigate self-immolation-related risk and protective factors in the western region of Iran, a province with the highest prevalent of self-immolation in the country. Using a case-control design, we compared 151 cases of self-immolation attempters who were admitted to a burn center in Kermanshah with 302-matched control group from the same community/locality between March 21st, 2009, and March 20th, 2012. We conducted descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to examine the associations of self-immolation with demographic and familial risk factors, adverse life events, mental disorders, as well as potential protective factors. According to our findings, the highest percentage of self-immolation was in the 16-25 year-old age group (60%) and in females (76%). Of the potential risk factors in the study, major depression, adjustment disorders, individual history of suicide attempts and opium dependence, were statistically significant predictors of self-immolation. Suggestions for translating the local picture of self-immolation portrayed by our findings, into meaningful prevention strategies that have a good fit with the social and interpersonal context within which self-immolation takes place are discussed.

AB Objective: To assess the main predictors for repetition of suicidal behaviour among women.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at Loghman Hakim Hospital, Tehran, Iran, in 2014, and comprised women patients. The patients were divided into two groups, i.e. women repeating suicide and women without repeating suicide. Data was collected through a checklist and then analysed with SPSS 20.
   Results: Of the 300 women, 121(40.3%) repeated suicide and 179(59.7%) did not. The overall mean age was 26.9 +/- 9.1 years (range: 14-80 years). High prevalence of psychological drug usage, alcohol use, history of self-mutilation (self-harm), psychotic disturbances, sexual relationships, as well as smoking and opium addition was revealed as major factors in repeated suicidal behaviour in women when compared with other women. The result of multivariate logistic regression model showed two factors of self-mutilation (odds ratio = 2.692, p=0.002) and underlying psychotic disorders (odds ratio = 2.780, p<0.001) as main predictors of suicide in women. In this regard, demographic characteristics could not predict repeating suicidal attempts (p>0.05).
   Conclusion: The presence of underlying psychotic disorders and self-mutilation were main predictors for repetition of suicidal behaviour.

AB Background: Suicide is a critical public health problem. In developing countries, the highest suicide rate is found in young adults with remarkable increasing rate. In this study, we have evaluated the epidemiology and characteristics of 8-16-year-old individuals who attempted suicide and were hospitalized in Loghman-Hakim Hospital, Tehran, Iran from 1997 to 2007.
   Methods: A total of 6414 hospitalized patients, ages 8-16, who attempted suicide and were residents of Loghman-Hakim Hospital were investigated. We performed a retrospective chart review to study the characteristics of cases in a 10-year period by review of psychiatric and medical records.
   Results: Out of 6414 patients 22.6% were male, 5978 patients were 12-16 years old and the rest were aged 8-12 years. During the 10-year period, suicides showed a rising trend among adults, while in children no significant increase was detected. Communicative disorders were the most common underlying risk factors, particularly in females. One patient out of five cases had psychiatric disorders, of which adjustment disorders were the most predominant. A remarkable peak in suicides was observed in May and July, while winter had the highest suicide rate among seasons.
   Conclusions: Suicide due to drug overdose is higher in females than males in young population. This increasing trend is a psychiatric concern and should be resolved by improving mental and public health.

TI The most common method of suicide in Tehran 2000-2004 - Implications for

SO CRISIS-THE JOURNAL OF CRISIS INTERVENTION AND SUICIDE PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
DE suicide; hanging; Tehran
ID TRENDS
AB The likelihood of completing suicide depends to some extent on knowledge of effective means and also on the availability and/or acceptability of such methods. Since studying suicide methods may have an implication for prevention, the focus of this study was on the most favored method of suicide in Tehran, Iran. The study uses confirmed suicide data provided by the Beheshet Zahra Organization (BZO), which gathers all mortality data within Tehran and enters them into a computerized database, from which the relevant information for all the recorded suicide cases during the year 2000 to 2004 were obtained and analyzed. There were 703 cases of suicide (632 males and 71 females) in the BZO database, with a sex ratio of 8.9. The mean (standard deviation) of age at suicide for those who chose hanging and for those who have chosen other methods of suicide were 33.93 (14.2) and 34.60 (13.4) years, respectively. Hanging was the method favored by 572 (85.9%) of cases. Use of hanging was higher in females (61, 85.9%) than in males (511, 80.9%), and higher among the married (304, 53.6%) than among singles (268, 46.4%). The high proportion of persons using hanging as a method of suicide in Tehran may reflect the fact that this method is more acceptable and/or easily available and/or less likely to be misclassified as accidental or undetermined death. The prevention of such suicides is extremely difficult in the general population. Therefore, it is suggested that, to prevent suicide by hangings, the authorities should focus on the causal factors of suicide rather than on the acceptability and/or the availability of this method.

AB Cyanide has been used as a poison for thousands of years. Symptoms of cyanide poisoning begin quickly and death occurs within minutes. In this study, we review 52 cyanide poisoning cases in Tehran, Iran, over a four-year interval, from 30 December 2009 to 1 January 2014. Toxicological analysis and post-mortem findings are discussed. Colour test (Prussian Blue) was used for screening for cyanide with confirmation using the voltammetry method. The youngest decedent was a 2-month old girl. Men constituted 76.9% (40) of the total 52 victims. Peak age prevalence of cases was seen in age groups 21-40years (32 cases, i.e. 61.5%). Methadone and opioid alkaloids were the most common drugs detected in biological samples in this study. A suicide attempt was the main cause of poisoning in 33 cases. The results showed that cyanide-poisoning-related deaths are among the most public health problems in Iran. Restricted access to cyanide and stricter buying and selling controls may reduce intentional self-poisoning with this dangerous substance.

AB This cross-cultural study investigates whether religiosity assessed in three dimensions has a protective effect against attempted suicide. Community controls (n = 5484) were more likely than suicide attempters (n = 2819) to report religious denomination in Estonia (OR = 0.5) and subjective religiosity in four countries: Brazil (OR = 0.2), Estonia (OR = 0.5), Islamic Republic of Iran (OR = 0.6), and Sri Lanka (OR = 0.4). In South Africa, the effect was exceptional both for religious denomination (OR = 5.9) and subjective religiosity (OR = 2.7). No effects were found in India and Vietnam. Organizational religiosity gave controversial results. In particular, subjective religiosity (considering him/herself as religious person) may serve as a protective factor against non-fatal suicidal behavior in some cultures.

AB Background: Unpleasant health outcomes are common in deprived communities and have been shown a direct connection between socioeconomic status and wellbeing but, the effect of the socioeconomic status on suicide is currently controversial. This study explored the relationship of the socioeconomic status and addiction and mental disorders in suicide attempts and decomposed inequalities into its determinants to calculating share of contribution to the inequality.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study recognized 546 suicide deaths and 6818 attempted suicides from 1 Jan 2010 to 31 Dec 2014 in Ilam Province, West of Iran. Inequality measured by concentration index (CI) and decomposing contribution in inequality. All analysis was performed by standard statistical software, Stata (Ver. 11.2).
   Results: The pooled rate of death in people with suicide attempts was 8.0% and that of having a history of suicide was 5.2%. The overall CI for addiction was -0.233 (95% CI= -0.383 to -0.084), and the CI for mental disorders was 0.0006 (95% CI = -0.009 to 0.010). The more amount of contribution to socioeconomic inequality in suicide attempts because of age group of < 25 yr (26%), socioeconomic level (23%), and marital status (22%).
   Conclusion: Addiction and mental disorders were distributed among suicide attempters unequally and gap between advantaged and disadvantaged attempted suicide confirmed by our results. Addiction prevention-related policies and programmers' should be focus on disadvantaged groups.

AB Background: There are five different kinds of death; natural death due to any disease, accidental death, suicidal death, homicidal death, and undetermined death.
   Objectives: This study aimed to determine the major causes of death based on the autopsied reports to aid the development of preventive strategies.
   Methods: This study was a retrospective cross-sectional study consisting of autopsy reports of all suicidal, homicidal and occupational deaths recorded in all forensic medicine dissection halls in thirty-two provinces of Iran from March 2011 to March 2015. A questionnaire was designed containing all the information required for our studies such as gender, age, cause of death, and the autopsy reports.
   Results: There were 19288 suicides, 11655 homicides, and 8558 occupational deaths during five years. Among suicidal deaths, there were seventy percent male and thirty percent female. Most victims (about 22%) were between 18 to 24 years old (Mean age +/- SD: 33.1 +/- 13.1 years). The highest cases of suicide were 52% hanging, and 25% poisoning, respectively. Among homicidal victims, there were 18% males and 20% females. Most victims were between 25 to 29 years old (24%) (Mean age +/- SD: 32.4 +/- 15.6 years). The most common methods were 46% firearms, and 29% stab wounds, respectively. Among occupational deaths happened in 99% of males and 1% of females. The most common victims' age-group was 30 - 39 years old (25%) (Mean age +/- SD: 35.8 +/- 10.3 years). Seventy-four percent of cases were caused by blunt trauma as a result of falling from a height. The second common cause of death was Electrocution (21% of the cases).
   Conclusions: The analysis of the causes of suicidal, homicidal, occupational deaths, can aid the development of preventive strategies to decrease the occurrence of these kinds of preventable deaths in Iran.

AB Background: Attempted suicide is a strong risk factor for subsequent suicidal behaviors. Innovative strategies to deal with people who have attempted suicide are needed, particularly in resource-poor settings. Aims: To evaluate a brief educational intervention and periodic follow-up contacts (BIC) for suicide attempters in five culturally different sites (Campinas, Brazil; Chennai, India; Colombo, Sri Lanka; Karaj, Islamic Republic of Iran; and Yuncheng, People's Republic of China) as part of the WHO Multisite Intervention Study on Suicidal Behaviors (SUPRE-MISS). Methods: Among the 1,867 suicide attempters enrolled in the emergency departments of the participating sites, 922 (49.4%) were randomly assigned to a brief intervention and contact (BIC) group and 945 (50.6%) to a treatment as usual (TAU) group. Repeated suicide attempts over the 18 months following the index attempt - the secondary outcome measure presented in this paper - were identified by follow-up calls or visits. Subsequent completed suicide - the primary outcome measure has been reported in a previous paper. Results: Overall, the proportion of subjects with repeated suicide attempts was similar in the BIC and TAU groups (7.6% vs. 7.5%, chi(2) = 0.013; p = .909), but there were differences in rates across the five sites. Conclusions: This study from five low-and middle-income countries does not confirm the effectiveness of brief educational intervention and follow-up contacts for suicide attempters in reducing subsequent repetition of suicide attempts up to 18 months after discharge from emergency departments.

AB Context: Smoking in adolescence is a worldwide health problem. Understanding the prevalence of smoking and its clinical correlates in adolescent inpatients is useful for mental health staff to plan effective programs to reduce its detrimental consequences. In this study, we investigated the prevalence and correlates of cigarette smoking and its sociodemographic and clinical correlates. We performed a narrative review of cigarette smoking prevalence among adolescents as well as a descriptive study in inpatient adolescents in Iran.
   Evidence Acquisition: This was a multicentric, cross-sectional, and hospital-based survey. In total, 82 patients (male/female: 66.9% vs. 33.1%) were consecutively recruited from 5 child and adolescent inpatient psychiatric wards of Iran. The study data were collected from patients, their family members and patients' medical records. The descriptive statistics, Pearson's chi-squared test, and univariate logistic regression analyses were employed to analyze the obtained data. Additionally, we added a narrative review to understand the prevalence rate of smoking and its clinical correlates in adolescent inpatients.
   Results: The prevalence rate of smoking was 30% in our study sample (24.5% in boys and 39.5 % in girls). There was a significant association between smoking with family size, history of suicide attempt, physical illness, drug misuse in patients, and alcohol or drug misuse in family members. The prevalence of mood disorders in the nonsmokers and smokers were 37.5% and 62.5%, respectively. Overall, 26.6% of the subjects had a history of suicide attempt of whom, 52.9% were smokers.
   Conclusions: Results of this study about the association between smoking with family size, history of suicide attempt, physical illness, drug misuse, and other related factors, call for both careful screening of smoking and specially designed integrated psychiatric/smoking treatments in these patients.

AB Background: Spinal trauma is a devastating event which could disturb a person's life.
   Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence and risk factors of spinal trauma in Rajaee trauma center, Shiraz, Iran.
   Methods: Data for this cross-sectional study were gathered from October 2009 to August 2015. The study was conducted through data extraction from the classified data of trauma patients admitted to Rajaei hospital. After performing some inclusion and exclusion criteria, 4630 cases were analyzed. The variables analyzed as the risk factors of spinal trauma included sex, age, cord injury, mechanism of injury, and injury severity score.
   Results: The prevalence of spinal trauma among traumatic patients was 7%; also, 3.7% of those with spinal trauma suffered cord injury. The mean age of the spinal traumatic patients was 38.2 +/- 17.8, and male-to-female ratio was 2.394. Car accident, motorbike accident, and fall were the main causes of spinal trauma in this study. The lumbar region was the most common injured site in our study. Old age, cord injury, suicide, and car accident were the main risk factors of mortality among spinal traumatic patients. Risk factors of spinal trauma among traumatic patients were female gender, old age, and fall. The risk factors of cord injury in spinal traumatic patients were male gender, old age, and suicide.
   Conclusions: It was found that spinal trauma, spinal cord injury (SCI), and mortality among spinal traumatic patients in Iran depended on some risk factors, which should be reduced through eliminating such risk factors. Fall was the most prominent factor of the occurrence of spinal trauma. The most important factors of mortality in spinal traumatic patients were suicide and cord injury. Finally, suicide played the most important role in occurrence of SCI.

AB This study aimed to assess using tree-based models the impact of different dimensions of religion and other risk factors on suicide attempts in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Three hundred patients who attempted suicide and 300 age- and sex-matched patient attendants with other types of disease who referred to Kerman Afzalipour Hospital were recruited for this study following a convenience sampling. Religiosity was assessed by the Duke University Religion Index. A tree-based model was constructed using the Gini Index as the homogeneity criterion. A complementary discrimination analysis was also applied. Variables contributing to the construction of the tree were stressful life events, mental disorder, family support, and religious belief. Strong religious belief was a protective factor for those with a low number of stressful life events and those with a high mental disorder score; 72 % of those who formed these two groups had not attempted suicide. Moreover, 63 % of those with a high number of stressful life events, strong family support, strong problem-solving skills, and a low mental disorder score were less likely to attempt suicide. The significance of four other variables, GHQ, problem-coping skills, friend support, and neuroticism, was revealed in the discrimination analysis. Religious beliefs seem to be an independent factor that can predict risk for suicidal behavior. Based on the decision tree, religious beliefs among people with a high number of stressful life events might not be a dissuading factor. Such subjects need more family support and problem-solving skills.

AB Objective: Repetition of suicide-related behavior (SRB) is a risk factor for further suicidal behavior and death. The purpose of this study was to compare characteristics of patients with and without repeated episodes of SRB to determine whether characteristics of suicide attempt, psychopathology, and psychiatric comorbidity differ between groups, and if specific aspects of core suicidality may help guide screening of individuals at risk of further suicidal behaviors. Methods: Thirty-five patient with repeated episodes of SRB and 49 with a single episode who came to the emergency room of two Qazvin referral hospitals after an episode of SRB were compared on demographic and background characteristics, the circumstances of the suicide attempts, levels of suicidality (i.e., ideation), and psychological characteristics. Results: Patients with repeated episodes were more depressed, hopeless, and impulsive, had higher scores on factors associated with expected outcome and planning activities of the Suicide Intent Scale. They displayed greater suicidality, psychiatric comorbidity, and reported more negative life events, dissatisfaction with life, and poorer perceive social support. Conclusions: Some of the characteristics of patients with repeated suicide-related behavior propose major clinical challenges that should be addressed in an endeavor to reduce suicide risk. (Int'l.

TI Mortality from aluminum phosphide poisoning in Kermanshah Province,
   Iran: characteristics and predictive factors
SO EPIDEMIOLOGY AND HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Aluminum phosphide; Rice tablets; Poisoning; Pesticide; Mortality; Iran
AB OBJECTIVES: Aluminum phosphide (ALP), also known in Iran as rice tablets, is one of the most effective rodenticides used to protect stored grain. However, ALP poisoning regularly causes mortality in humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate the characteristics and predictive factors of mortality from ALP poisoning.
   METHODS: This study evaluated all patients with ALP poisoning referred to Imam Khomeini Hospital in Kermanshah Province, Iran from 2014 to 2015. For each patient, the following information was recorded: age, sex, the number of tablets consumed, the number of suicide attempts, the time elapsed from consumption to treatment, blood pressure, blood pH, HCO3 levels, and PCO2. Differences between the survivors and non-survivors of ALP poisoning were analyzed using univariate logistic regression and multivariate analysis.
   RESULTS: In this study, 48 patients were male and 29 patients were female (total: 77 patients). The average age of the survivors and non-survivors was 28.7 and 31.3 years, respectively. All cases (100%) of ALP poisoning were intentional, with the goal of committing suicide. The main predictive variables of mortality from ALP poisoning were blood pressure, blood pH, and time elapsed from consumption to treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of mortality in patients with ALP poisoning can be predicted using blood pressure, blood pH, and time elapsed from consumption to treatment. These findings may help healthcare providers take more effective measures to treat patients with ALP poisoning.

AB This study investigated the prevalence of suicidal behavior and psychological distress in university students across 12 nations. A total of 5,572 university students from 12 countries were surveyed about suicide ideation, suicide attempts, and psychological distress by means of a self-administered questionnaire. Almost 29% of the samples reported having contemplated suicide and 7% reported attempting suicide. Of the total sample, 51.1% scored above the General Health Questionnaire-123 cut-off points, 41.6% above the GHQ-124 cut-off points, and 33.8% scored above the GHQ-125 cut-off points. While odds of suicide ideation were elevated in Austria and the UK, reduced ORs were detected for China, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Turkey. Similarly, while odds of suicide attempt were high in Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, and to some extent in Turkey, reduced ORs were observed for Austria, China, Italy, Japan and the United States. Elevated ORs for psychological distress were seen in Japan, Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Turkey but reduced ORs were noted in Austria, China, Iran, Italy, and the United States. Psychological distress was strongly associated with reports of suicide ideation and attempts. Suicide ideation, suicide attempt, and psychological distress are common in university students but their rates vary depending on the sociocultural context. Due attention should be devoted to the mental health needs of young adults enrolled in higher educational institutions and more cross-cultural research is warranted to better understand the etiology of the observed intersocietal variations in suicidal behavior and psychological distress.

AB Background: One of the most frequent causes of death is poisoning worldwide. Investigating the causes of mortality due to poisoning profoundly affects making decisions and improving standards for preventing adverse events. Therefore, to better understand this problem and evaluate the causes, this study aimed to determine the risk of suicide using the SAD PERSONS Scale (SPS) criteria and its relationship with the birth monthin poisoned patients.
   Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive-analytic study was conducted on poisoned patients admitted to Khorshid Hospital in Isfahan City, Iran, in 2018. First, the patients' age, gender, and birth month were recorded. Then, their suicide risk was assessed by SPS.
   Results: From 2735 referred patients with poisoning, 1839 (67.2%) attempted suicide, and 896(32.8%) cases were poisoned. The Mean +/- SD SPS score in patients with suicidal attempts was 4.89 +/- 1.94, and in the poisoned patients was equal to 2.74 +/- 1.46 (P<0.001). There was no significant relationship between suicide and birth month; however, gender (male), age, depression, previous suicidal attempts, ethanol abuse, rational thinking loss, social support lacking, and being unmarried significantly increased the risk of suicide (P<0.01). In addition, the SPS scores >= 5 with a sensitivity of 43.77%, and specificity of 98.44% had an acceptable diagnostic value in identifying the risk of suicide (P<0.0001).
   Conclusion: As SPS criteria have an appropriate diagnostic value for suicide prediction, it is recommended that these criteria be assessed among individuals with susceptible suicide characteristics (e.g. males, elders, depression, the lack of social support, etc.), to prevent future suicide attempts and appropriate medical-psychological measures.

AB Introduction: Investigation in each community can contribute to understanding the key factors involved in suicide death and its prevention. The present study aimed to investigate suicide death risk factors based on psychological autopsy method. Methods: The present case-control study was conducted from April to September 2017, in Tehran, Iran, to compare two groups of people; those who died by suicide and controls (over the age of 18 years). Data were collected by one interviewer via Structured Clinical Interviews (SCID-I), questionnaires used in the SUPREMISS study, and the Dickman impulsivity scale. Results: Each group consisted of 40 individuals. There was no significant difference between the case and control groups in terms of all demographic variables except for the level of education (p = 0.06) and occupational status (p = 0.009). The frequency of previous history of suicide attempt (p = 0.001), family history of suicide (p = 0.003), DSM IV Axis I disorders (p = 0.006), and substance and alcohol consumption (p = 0.01) were significantly higher in the case group. The most commonly diagnosed disorders included MDD (45%) and substance use disorders (30%), respectively. The most common methods used in suicide included hanging (32.5%), and Aluminum phosphide poisoning (32.5%) known as rice tablet. The strongest predictor of suicide death was the deceased person's Previous history of suicide attempt (OR= 9.3; p = 0.04), smoking (OR= 6.4; p = 0.006), unemployment (OR= 5; p = 0.02), and DSM IV axis I disorders (OR= 3.8; p = 0.04). Conclusion: Previous suicide attempt, smoking, unemployment, and suffering from at least one mental disorder were the significant predictors of suicide death. Among mental disorders, major depressive disorder and substance use disorder were the most prevalent mental health problems.

AB Introduction: Interpersonal conflicts, such as marital conflicts are among the most commonly reported reasons for self-harm and suicide. This study aimed to investigating suicidal ideation, marital discord, and decrease effective relations among women from Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted with participation of 923 married women aged 18 to 59 years from Gilan-e Gharb County, the west part of Iran in 2017. Data gathering tool was a four-part questionnaire included questions about participant's demographic variables, Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, questionnaire of Decrease Effective Relations in spouses, and questions about marital discord. Data were analyzed with SPSS 19 software, using Independent T-test, and Chi square at a 95% confidence level. Results: The subjects' mean age was 37.28 +/- 9.58 years. Out of 923 participants, 345 women (37.4%) had some degree of suicidal ideation. The mean score of suicidal ideation in all of participants was 5.84 +/- 7.55 while in 345 suicide ideators was 15.1 +/- 3.4. Women with suicidal ideation had higher mean score of Decrease Effective Relations compared to women without suicidal ideation. Also three items of marital discord including conflict with spouse, physical conflict with the spouse and official application for divorce were higher in suicidal ideators significantly. Conclusion: The present study concluded that suicidal ideation and decrease effective relations were high and notable among understudied women. In addition, this study showed that decrease effective relations and marital discord in suicidal ideators are higher than the women without suicidal ideation. Therefore, the further studies are recommended to focus on designing and delivering suicide prevention programs tailored to resolve marital conflict.

AB Background. The objectives were to assess thoughts about suicide, plans to commit suicide and suicide attempts in the community, to investigate the use of health services following a suicide attempt, and to describe basic socio-cultural indices of the community.
   Method. The community survey was one component of the larger WHO multisite intervention study on suicidal behaviours (SUPRE-MISS). In each site, it aimed at randomly selecting and interviewing at least 500 subjects of the general population living in the catchment area of the emergency department where the intervention component of the study was conducted. Communities of eight SUPRE-MISS sites (in Brazil, China, Estonia, India, Iran, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam) participated plus two additional sites from Australia and Sweden conducting similar surveys.
   Results. Suicide attempts (0(.)4-4(.)2%), plans (1(.)1-15(.)6%), and ideation (2(.)6-25(.)4%) varied by a factor of 10-14 across sites, but remained mostly within the ranges of previously published data. Depending on the site, the ratios between attempts, plans, and thoughts Of Suicide differed substantially. Medical attention following a suicide attempt varied between 22% and 88% of the attempts.
   Conclusions. The idea of the suicidal process as a continuous and smooth evolution from thoughts to plans and attempts of suicide needs to be further investigated as it seems to be dependent on the cultural setting. There are indications, that the burden of undetected attempted suicide is high in different cultures; an improved response from the health sector on how to identify and support these individuals is needed.

AB Background: There is an extreme need for planning to prevent suicide in developing countries. It is necessary to detect the risk factors of this problem and plan to control them. The aim of this study was to determine a predictive model for Suicide attempt based on its risk factors in order to give information for planning therapeutic, preventive, and educational interventions in Karaj City.
   Methods: The setting was Karaj City, Tehran Province, Iran and the study design was cross-sectional. In this study, data were collected by using the World Health Organization (WHO) questionnaire of SUPRE-MISS study. The questionnaire included questions about demographic characteristics, personal and family history of suicide behaviors, use of psychotropic drugs, physical and mental disorders, and community stress. All parts of the questionnaire were filled out by interview. A total of 2300 individuals participated in this study having considered the 1.2% prevalence of suicide attempt in the pilot study, and with type one error rate of 5%, the sample size was calculated as 2300.
   Results: About 65% of the participants were females. Most of the participants had high-school education (48%) and 57.2% of them were married. Housewives included most of the occupation categories (46%). The mean age of the suicide attempters and nonattempters was 26 (+/- 9) and 32 (+/- 13) years, respectively. This difference was statistically significant. Younger age, female sex, history of mental disorders, lifelong use of tobacco and alcohol, and unemployment were the independent predictors of suicide attempt.
   Conclusion: Prevention of suicide is possible by understanding its risk factors and planning to control them.

AB To determine the incidence and cost of non-fatal burns in Iran; this cross-sectional household survey of a nationally representative sample of 15-64 years old was conducted. Through face-to-face interviews and telephone calls, the data on the demographics, history and cost of burns were collected. The annual incidence rate of burns was estimated 129.85 per 1000 population. Burns occurred higher in younger age, female gender and urban residency. The most common burn description was as follows: unpaid work (activity during burn), home (place of burn), heat and hot substances (mechanism of burn) and upper limb (site of burn). The average total cost of burn includes victims seeking medical care was US$124 per case. The main findings of this study suggest that burns are a major public health concern in Iran. To stop this important health issue, a national program for burn prevention and education must be developed.

AB Background. Suicidal ideation is considered a major health problem associated with HIV/AIDS. Suicide rates among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) are more than three times higher in the general population and that is a significant difference. This study aimed at investigating the related factors of suicidal ideations among HIV-positive patients in Southwest Iran. Study Design. A cross-sectional study. Methods. 351 adult volunteer 111V-infected patients that referred to the Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) center in the south of Iran were evaluated based on convenience sampling. Data was collected utilizing a structured questionnaire from March to August 2015. Results. Over the six months prior to the study, 15.4% of the entire sample had been diagnosed with suicidal ideation. There was a significant correlation between the quality of life, spiritual beliefs, perceived stigma, and age with suicidal ideation. Suicidal ideation is significantly different in terms of gender and marital status. Perceived stigma and spiritual beliefs showed the highest effect on suicidal ideat ions, respectively. Conclusions. Having religious beliefs due to accelerating psychological adaptation can motivate HIV patients to survive and have also been considered effective in preventing women from suicide. Perceived stigma and quality of life are other factors that should be taken into consideration as key elements in suicide preventive programs.

AB Background: In new strategies towards of suicide prevention the best approach currently is based on specific method had specific risk factors. Therefore in this study we aimed to find out the association between socio-demographic factors and methods in completed suicide, 2011-2016, Ilam province.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study, 2011-2016, was conducted. A total of 540 completed suicides were recruited to the study. Data were collected by systematic registration suicide data (SRSD) and Legal Medicine Organization (LMO). After performs of descriptive statistics, to analysis of effects of each independent variable to the methods Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) was used, also adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was used to reporting of associations.
   Results: According to the result (55.8%) of deaths were occurred by hanging and self-immolation also a majority of suicides were occurred in females (60%). The important methods in males and females were hanging (70.6%) and self-immolation (72.8%), respectively. The self-immolation vs. others was significantly higher in cases that have mental disorders (AOR) = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.11, 3.78); also in cases with financial problem (AOR)= 2.70, 95% CI: 1.28, 5.71).
   Conclusion: According to the finding age groups, gender, marital status, residence, and mental disorders are the important risk factors that effects on choosing of methods. Therefore consideration of this excess risk by this mentioned factors in prevention programs can be reducing the risk of death from suicide in society.

AB There is a scarcity of research on suicidal phenomena in the Muslim world. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating the self-reported prevalence of suicidal thoughts, attempts and motives in 12 Muslim countries. A total of 8417 (54.4% women) university students were surveyed by means of a self-report questionnaire. Overall, 22% of the participants reported suicidal ideation and 8.6% reported attempting suicide. The odds of suicidal thoughts were elevated in Azerbaijan, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, while reduced ORs were recorded in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Malaysia. While odds of suicide attempts were high in Azerbaijan, Palestine and Saudi Arabia reduced odds ratios (OR) were detected in Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Malaysia and Tunisia. Taking drugs and using a sharp instrument were the two most frequently used methods to attempt suicide. Only 32.7% of attempts required medical attention. Escape motives were endorsed more than social motives by participants who attempted suicide. Suicidal behaviors were more frequent in women than in men. Compered to men, fewer attempts by women required medical attention. Moreover, our results show that making suicide illegal does not reduce the frequency of suicidal behavior. Results from this comparative study show that suicidal thoughts and attempts are frequent events in young adults in countries where religious scripture explicitly prohibit suicide and the frequencies of nonfatal suicidal behavior show large variation in nations adhering to the same religion.

AB Purpose of study: This study was conducted to evaluate the levels, patterns, and causes of mortality among women of reproductive age in Northwestern Iran.
   Methods: Deaths were determined for females resident in West Azerbaijan Province of Iran and who died between March 2013 to February 2014 using reproductive age mortality survey (RAMOS). Causes of death were ascertained by verbal autopsy (VA) and classified based on the International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10). Overall and cause-specific mortality rates (MRs) per 100,000 women with 95% confidence intervals were calculated.
   Results: A total of 510 deaths were detected, and VA interviews were conducted with the relatives of the deceased Cases; overall MR was 56.59 per 100,000 women (95% CI: 56.49-56.69). The highest MR was observed in suicide cases (MR = 10.21 per 100,000 women, 95% CI: 10.15-10.27), accounting for 18% of all deaths. The most common method of suicide was self-inflicted burns (45.6%), followed by deaths due to breast cancer (MR = 4.22 per 100,000 women, 95% CI: 4.18-4.26), which accounted for the most cancer-related mortality. All-cause mortality was associated with age, area of residence, marital status, level of education, and ethnic (religious) status relationship (P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Suicide, especially self-immolation, was the main cause of death among women of reproductive age, and both suicides and breast cancer are major public health problems for this group of women. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of our study was to investigate the etiological and demographical characteristics of acute adult poisoning cases admitted to a university hospital in Tabriz, Iran. This retrospective study was performed on 1342 poisoning admissions to a university hospital from 2003 to 2005, by data collection from the medical records of patients. Poisonings were 5.40% of the total admissions. There was a predominance of female patients (55.7%) compared to male patients (44.3%) with a female-to-male ratio of 1.2:1. Most poisonings occurred in the age range of 11-20 years (38.9%). Drugs were the most common cause of poisonings (60.8%). Among the drug poisonings, benzodiazepines (40.31%) were the most frequent agents, followed by antidepressants (31.98%). The seasonal distribution in poisoning patients suggested a peak in spring (28%) and summer (27.5%). In 9.8% of cases accidental and in 90.2% intentional poisonings were evident. Most suicide attempts were made by women (58.51%) and unmarried people (51.4%). The mean duration of hospitalization was 3.02 +/- 2.8 days. There were 28 (2.3%) deaths; the majority (13 cases) was due to pesticides. This was a university hospital-based study, so these results may not be representative of the general population. Despite this drawback, these data still provide important information on the characteristics of the poisoning in this part of Iran. To prevent such poisonings, the community education about the danger of central nervous system-acting drugs and reducing the exposure period of people to pesticides are recommended.

AB The thrust of this study was to examine some of the psycho-social risk factors for the recurrence of non-fatal suicide attempt in a sample of 1121 inmates admitted between April 2012 to June 2013 at the toxicology emergency ward, Noor Medical Centre, Isfahan, Iran. Out of the total participants, 240 of them reported history of suicide attempt and assumed the status of case group. The remaining 881 patients were admitted first their attempt and constituted the control group. Cases were compared to the controls with respect to select demographic features (i.e. age, sex, education, occupation, marital status, type of residence, and locale), current suicide attempt method, family history of suicide and drug abuse, history of psychiatric disorder, physical ailment and physical disability, substance abuse and alcohol use, psychiatric diagnosis, and recent life hassles (i.e. interpersonal, occupational, financial, medical, and home affairs). We used a structured interview schedule to interview the participants. Psychiatric diagnosis was based on the DSM-IV criteria. Data were computer analyzed using SPSS.21 and administering statistical analysis including Chi Square, t-student, and logistic regression. Demographic risk factors for recurrence of suicide attempts at the univariate level included occupational status [Crud odds Ratio (COR) = 0.53] and type of residence (COR = 1.40). Medical and psychiatric risk factors at the univariate level included substance abuse (COR = 1.97), physical ailment (COR = 1.76), alcohol use (COR = 1.84), psychiatric disorder (COR = 3.69), and history of suicide in the family of origin (COR = 1.86). Recent life hassles risk factors at the univariate level included financial constraints (COR = 1.46) and medical emergencies (COR = 3.48). A multivariate logistic regression model identified five variables (i.e. substance abuse, alcohol use, psychiatric illness, suicide in family, and medical emergencies) that were statistically associated with an increased risk for recurrence of nonfatal suicide attempt. The model predicted chances of repeating suicide attempt correctly 79 % of the time. These observations indicate that people who report to the toxicology emergency ward for nonfatal suicide not only need immediate relief but also careful psychiatric and social assessments which subsequently may lead to psychiatric admission and comprehensive community interventions.

AB Background: We aimed to assess the high-risk group for suicide using different classification methods includinglogistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM).
   Methods: We used the dataset of a study conducted to predict risk factors of completed suicide in Hamadan Province, the west of Iran, in 2010. To evaluate the high-risk groups for suicide, LR, SVM, DT and ANNwere performed. The applied methods were compared using sensitivity, specificity, positive predicted value, negative predicted value, accuracy and the area under curve. Cochran-Q test was implied to check differences in proportion among methods. To assess the association between the observed and predicted values, O coefficient, contingency coefficient, and Kendall tau-b were calculated.
   Results: Gender, age, and job were the most important risk factors for fatal suicide attempts in common for four methods. SVM method showed the highest accuracy 0.68 and 0.67 for training and testing sample, respectively. However, this method resulted in the highest specificity (0.67 for training and 0.68 for testing sample) and the highest sensitivity for training sample (0.85), but the lowest sensitivity for the testing sample (0.53). Cochran-Q test resulted in differences between proportions in different methods (P<0.001). The association of SVM predictions and observed values, O coefficient, contingency coefficient, and Kendall tau-b were 0.239, 0.232 and 0.239, respectively.
   Conclusion: SVM had the best performance to classify fatal suicide attempts comparing to DT, LR and ANN.

AB Introduction: In Tunisia, few data are available about self-immolation epidemiology especially in the absence of official statistics on suicides. The aim of our study was to analyze the trends of suicide by self-immolation over a period of ten years (2005-2014).
   Methods: We conducted a descriptive, retrospective study including all the cases of self immolation suicides that occurred over a period of 10 years (2005-2014) and autopsied in the Department of Legal Medicine of the Charles Nicolle Hospital of Tunis, including self immolation occurring in Northern Tunisia as well as those committed in remaining governorates and transferred before death to the central intensive care unit of burnt in Tunis receiving patients from all over Tunisia (about 80% of cases occurring in Tunisia).
   Results: 235 cases of self-immolation were collected. The average age at death was 34.1 +/- 12.43 years (range 14-83 years). Gender ratio was of 3.27. Psychiatric history was mentioned in 32.8% of cases, represented by schizophrenia in 17.9% and depression in 12.3% of cases. 12.3% had a history of suicide attempts, and 7.3% presented a history of suicidal threats. The number of casualties of suicide by self-immolation tripled after 2011 with a rising trend during the next three years and slight drop in 2014. The most reported reason in our study was decompensation of a psychiatric illness (24.7%). Self-immolation occurred most frequently in a private home (34.5%) or a public place (30.2).
   Conclusion: Our study showed that self-immolation affects essentially, young men, who are unemployed and mostly having mental diseases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

ID SEXUAL-ABUSE; ADOLESCENTS; PREVALENCE; BEHAVIOR; CHILDHOOD; ASSOCIATION
AB Background: Globally, the second leading cause of death among adolescents is suicide and in middle-income countries adolescents' suicidal ideation is a neglected public health area. The present study was conducted to determine the prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation among 15-17-year-old high school students in Iran.
   Methods: Self-administered, Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) questionnaires were distributed to a representative sample (N = 1517) of high-school students aged 15-17 in the city of Tabriz. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association between relevant independent variables (e.g. gender) and the dependent outcome variable (suicidal ideation in the past 12 months).
   Results: Overall, 62 (4.1%, 95% CI = 3.1, 5.2) of 1,517 students had thoughts of suicide. Three hundred and thirteen (20.6%, 95% CI = 18.6, 22.7) students reported being bullied in the previous 30 days. In addition, 134 (8.8%, 95% CI = 7.5, 10.3) students reported having been sexually abused. Being worried that they could not eat or did not feel hungry (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 4.15; 95% Cl [1.71, 10.07]; current cigarette smoking (AOR = 3.00; 95% CI [1.69, 5.30]; thinking about using alcohol or other drugs (AOR = 4.28; 95% CI [2.41, 7.59]; and being sexually abused (AOR = 2.63; 95% CI [1.32, 5.24]) were all factors positively associated with suicidal ideation.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of suicidal ideation was lower in our school students than in earlier studies. Interventions that address the issue of current cigarette smoking, worries, thinking about using alcohol or other drugs and sexual abuse should be given more priority by the public health authorities.

AB Background: Spouse-related abuse involves a wide range of behaviors by the partner and has many debilitating consequences for the victim, such as suicide attempt.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to predict the effect of resilience and stress coping styles on the likelihood of suicide attempt in females reporting spouse-related abuse.
   Methods: The present descriptive comparative study was conducted on 150 female victims of spouse-related abuse in the city of Ilam, Iran, during year 2016. They were matched in two groups with and without a history of suicide attempt over the pastu months. Data collection tools included the world health organization violence against women instrument, the connor-davidson resilience scale, and the coping inventory for stressful situations. Purposive and snowball methods were used. The obtained data was analyzed using the SPSS-21 software.
   Results: No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of the frequency and severity of exposure to different forms of violence. The mean scores of resilience (P < 0.001; -13.03 to -6.34) and problem-oriented coping style (P= 0.004, -7.65 to -1.46) were significantly higher in females without a history of suicide attempt compared to the other group. For every unit increase in the resilience score, the likelihood of not attempting suicide increased by 1.134, and for every unit increase in the avoidance style score, the likelihood of not attempting suicide decreased by 0.931. This effect remained significant with the addition of demographic variables.
   Conclusions: A high level of resilience and the use of problem-oriented coping have a major role in reducing the likelihood of suicide attempt in females subjected to violence. Introducing couples to coping strategies, problem solving, and anger management is an integral part of life skills education.

AB Objective: Self-immolation or self-inflicted burn is the most tragic and violent method of suicide. The higher prevalence of this dramatic phenomenon in Iran is a serious social and health problem. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to combine the results from available studies to examine the epidemiology and socio-demographic characteristics of individuals who attempted self-immolation in Iran.
   Method: Pertinent studies were identified by searching the electronic bibliographic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Iran Medex, Magiran, Medlib and Scientific Information Database (SID) (2000-October 2016). Meta-analysis was used to summarize the research results on socio-demographic risk factors of self-immolation in Iran. The STROBE checklist was used to assess quality of the study. The random effect model was employed in the meta-analysis to account for the observed heterogeneity among the selected studies.
   Results: Twenty-nine studies (sample size=5717) were included in the meta-analysis. The estimated average age of individuals who attempted self-immolation was 27.31 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 25.81-28.81) years. Women account for 70% (95% CI: 64-77) of all self-immolation attempts in Iran. Thirty-nine (95% CI: 34-43) per cent of all self-immolation were among singles. Nineteen (95% CI: 16-22) per cent of self-immolators had mental disorder. Meta-regression model showed that the average age of individuals who attempted self-immolation increased significantly over the period between 2000 to 2016 (P-value=0.006).
   Conclusions: Our study indicated that individuals who attempted self-immolation in Iran were mainly women, married and young adults. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB The Wish to be Dead Scale (WDS) is a new scale to measure precursors to suicidal ideation, and the aim of the present study was to examine the psychometric characteristics of a Farsi version of the WDS. The sample was a convenience sample of 145 Iranian female undergraduates and postgraduates selected from different faculties at Iran University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Using a principal component analysis and a varimax rotation with Kaiser normalization, three factors were identified and labeled: (a) lack of purpose and usefulness in life, (b) lack of interest in living, and (c) fantasizing about being dead. The WDS had good inter-item and test-retest reliability and significant positive correlations with scores on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale-10 and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and negative correlations with scores on the Adult Hope Scale, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, the Love of Life Scale, the Life Orientation Test, and the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. We conclude that the WDS may prove to be useful in clinical practice and research into suicide.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate preexisting psychiatric disorders in self-immolation patients. In a case-control study, 30 consecutive cases of deliberate self-inflicted burns, admitted to the regional burn center, were compared with 30 controls. Mental disorders were assessed via detailed clinical interview. Descriptive data revealed that 67% of self-immolation patients had adjustment disorder (all female), 10% drug and alcohol abuse/dependence (all male), 7% dysthymia, 3% major depression, 3% anorexia nervosa, 3% primary insomnia, 7% borderline personality disorder (50% male), 7% depressive personality disorder (100% female), and 3% antisocial personality disorder. In bivariate comparisons, adjustment disorders emerged as related to risk of self-immolation (odds ratio = 13.00). This study suggests that adjustment disorder is a risk factor for self-immolation. As a result, it has been suggested that increasing education about problem-solving approaches, and coping skills for females and at-risk groups are appropriate prevention programs and strategies in Iranian communities.

AB Background: The defeat-entrapment theory has been proposed to explain both depression and suicidal behavior.
   Methods: Measures of defeat, entrapment, hopelessness and depression were administered to Iranian and American students.
   Results: Scores on measures of hopelessness, defeat, entrapment and depression were strongly associated. In both nations, scores for defeat and entrapment were stronger predictors of past suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. Overall, the Iranian respondents had higher scores on the measures of defeat, entrapment, hopelessness and depression, but less often reported prior suicidal ideation.
   Conclusion: The defeat-entrapment theory of depression and suicidal behavior appears to have validity in both Iran and America.

AB Background: Studies report high rates of suicide attempts for female immigrants. This study assesses variations in the distribution of suicide attempts across gender in immigrant and non-immigrant groups in Europe. Method: Data on 64 native and immigrant groups, including 17 662 local and 3755 immigrant person-cases collected, between 1989 and 2003, in 24 million person-years were derived from the WHO/EURO Multicentre Study on Suicidal Behaviour. Female-to-male ratios of suicide attempt rates (SARs) were calculated for all groups. Results: The cases were combined into four major categories: hosts; European and other Western immigrants; non-European immigrants; and Russian immigrants. The non-European immigrants included higher female SARs than the Europeans, both hosts and immigrants. Unlike the other groups, the majority of suicide attempters among the Russian immigrants in Estonia and Estonian hosts were male. This was also true for immigrants from Curacao, Iran, Libya and Sri Lanka. When the single groups with a male majority were excluded, the correlation between female and male SARs was relatively high among the European immigrants (r = 0.74, P < 0.0005) and lower among the non-European immigrants (r = 0.55, P < 0.03). Generalized estimating equation analysis yielded a highly significant difference (P < 0.0005) in gender ratios of suicide attempts between hosts (ratio 1.52) and both non-European immigrants (ratio 2.32) and Russian immigrants (0.68), but not the European immigrants. Conclusions: The higher suicide attempt rates in non-European immigrant females compared with males may be indicative of difficulties in the acculturation processes in Europe. Further understanding of factors underlying suicidal behaviour in immigrant and minority groups is necessary for planning effective prevention strategies.

AB Aims and objectives To investigate the impact of domestic violence-related factors on suicide attempt in married women. Background Suicide is a global public health concern that poses significant burden on individuals, families and communities. There is limited research on factors predicting suicide attempt in women. Design A retrospective case-control design was adopted. Methods Using a convenience sampling method, 610 participants, admitted to a teaching referral hospital in Northwest of Iran, were recruited to the study and assigned to case or control groups based on whether or not they had attempted suicide. The participants in two groups were matched in the terms of important demographic characteristics. Domestic violence-related factors were considered as independent variables and suicide attempt as dependent variable. Descriptive statistics, and simple and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to analyse the data. Odds ratios (OR) of domestic violence-related factors were compared between the groups. We used STROBE checklist as an EQUATOR in this study. Results The mean age of participants in the case and control groups was 28.4 and 29.45 years, respectively. The infidelity was the strongest predictor of suicide attempt in women (OR 44.57, 95%CI 6.08-326. 63, p < 0.001), followed by being threatened to physical assault by husband (OR 37.01, 95%CI 11.54-118.67, p < 0.001), jealousy of husband (OR 23.46, 95%CI 11.63-47.30, p < 0.001), and previous attempts to divorce (OR 16.55, 95%CI 5.91-46.31, p < 0.001). Suicide attempt was significantly lower in women who reported a sense of peace in life or lived with their mother or father-in-law (p < 0.001). Conclusions To reduce the risk of suicide in women, violence against women should be condemned and appropriate prevention measures be taken by health professionals. Relevance to clinical practice Recognising risk, assessment and referral of victims of domestic violence should be an integral part of healthcare systems.

ID MULTICENTER; RATES
AB This study is part of broader research aimed to determine the lifetime prevalence and pattern of comorbidity on self-reported suicidal attempts in the general population of Iran. Overall, 25,180 subjects were interviewed, face-to-face, at home; the lifetime prevalence was 1.4% (0.9% males and 2% females). The majority of attempters were 26-55 years of age, married, more highly educated, female, retired, and lived in urban areas. Many of the attempters (45.3%) reported at least one psychiatric disorder during their lifetime; major depressive disorder (22%), panic disorder (6.3%), and obsessive compulsive disorder (6%) was die most common. Because less than half of suicidal attempters reported a psychiatric disorder, the existence of other pathways to suicide may be important foci for prevention. Many of the demographic correlates of suicidal behavior in Iran are very similar to those seen in Western cutlures; however, the sociodemographic factors such as few working women and very low levels of divorce is quite different to that of Western populations.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to examine epidemiologic characteristics of suicidal behavior by burns requiring hospitalization in the province of Ilam, Iran.
   Methods: A prospective population-based study of all suicidal behaviors by burns requiring hospitalization was conducted in the province of Ilam, Iran, from March 21, 2005 to March 20, 2006. Data were obtained from patients, family members, and/or significant others through interviews during the course of hospitalization.
   Results: A total of 51 patients with suicidal behavior by burns requiring hospitalization were identified during the study period, representing an overall incidence rate of 12.5 per 100,000 person-years (P-Y) (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.1-16.0 per 100,000 P-Y). Women had a higher rate of suicidal behavior by burns than men (18.0 vs. 7.2 per 100,000 P-Y) (P < 0.001). The age-specific rate of suicidal behavior by burns peaked at age group 20-29 years (19.3 per 100,000 P-Y). The rate of suicidal behavior by burns was slightly higher among married persons than single persons, although not statistically significant (13.5 vs. 9.8 per 100,000 P-Y) (P = 0.25). The rate of suicidal behavior by burns among the rural population was significantly higher than the urban population (17.9 vs. 9.3 per 100,000 P-Y) (P = 0.02). The most frequent precipitating factor for suicidal behavior was marital conflicts.
   Conclusions: The high rate of suicidal behavior by burns among young, married women in Ilam is an alarming social tragedy. Despite substantial efforts toward improving health and human rights, persistent conditions allow violence against women in Iran and these women continue to turn to the desperate remedy of self-burning. Findings of this study highlight the need for the implementation of a well-organized approach to reduce the incidence of suicide by burns. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Most studies on addiction in Iran have focused on the men and less attention has been given to women. This study was conducted to survey the epidemiology of substance use in women under opioid maintenance treatment (OMT) in addiction treatment centers. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the year 2015. Demographic characteristic such as age, marital status, addiction initiation age, duration of use, history of high-risk behaviors, and lifetime history of suicide attempt, injection drug use, incarceration, and unsafe sex were recorded by psychologists through interviews with patients. Results: The mean age of patients was 44.31 +/- 14.83 years. The most abused drugs among participants were opium and opium sap (shireh) with 1179 cases (92.70%), followed by heroin and crack with 75 cases (5.90%). Only 4.08% of the women under OMT had a history of injection drug use. Conclusion: It seems that the demographic characteristics and history of risky behaviors in women undergoing OMT in Iran are different from studies conducted in other countries.

AB Background: Hanging is a common method of suicide in many countries, and it has a higher success rate than other commonly employed modes of attempted suicide, such as self-poisoning. Study Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiology and characteristics of near-hanging patients admitted to the main referral hospital in Arak, Iran. Methods: All patients with the diagnosis of hanging admitted between January 2000 and 2009 were included in the study. Data regarding demographics, radiographic studies, injuries, Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) on arrival, and outcomes, were examined. Results: During the 9-year study period, 43 cases of near hanging were identified. All patients were male, with a mean age of 24.2 years (range: 12-38 years). The median GCS at presentation was 6 (range: 3-12), and 83.8% of patients had a GCS of 8 or less. Cervical spine fracture of C2 was observed in two cases (4%). The imaging studies revealed that 62.7% of patients had an abnormal brain computed tomography scan, with brain edema being the most common finding (n = 16, 37.2%), followed by subdural hematoma (n = 10, 23.3%). Ophthalmologic examination demonstrated retinal bleeding in 24 patients (55.8%). There were four inpatient deaths among the study group, and 39 patients survived to discharge, yielding a mortality rate of 9.3%. Findings on presentation associated with subsequent mortality included a systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg, GCS < 5, retinal bleeding, and pulmonary edema. Conclusion: Mortality among patients who present alive to the hospital after near hanging is low, including those with a low GCS on arrival. Ophthalmoscopic examination, as well as radiological examination of the brain and cervical spine, should be performed in cases of near hanging. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Metal phosphides such as aluminum phosphide are potent insecticides. This highly toxic substance is used for rice and other grains protection in Iran. Due to its high toxicity potential and easy availability, it is widely used as a suicide poison. This substance has no effective antidote and the incidence of deaths due to its poisoning is increasing day by day in Iran.The present study was conducted to show the increasing incidence of fatal aluminum phosphide poisoning and its toxicological and forensic aspects in an 8-year study, 2006 to 2013. Autopsy sheets were reviewed and cases with the history of aluminum phosphide poisoning were selected. Toxicological analysis results, demographic and necroscopic examination findings were studied. A total of 51.8% of studied cases were female. Most of the cases were between 10 and 40 years old. The manner of death was self-poisoning in 85% of cases. Morphine, ethanol, and amitriptyline were the most common additional drugs detected in toxicological analysis. The incidence of fatal aluminum phosphide poisoning cases referred for phosphine analysis was 5.22 and 37.02 per million of population of Tehran in 2006 and 2013, respectively. The results of this study showed that in spite of ban and restrictions, there was a dramatic increase in the incidence of fatal aluminum phosphide poisoning in Tehran from 2006 to 2013. Safety alert should be highlighted in training program for all population groups about the toxic effects of aluminum phosphide tablets.

AB Background: Suicidal behavior is seen in the context of a variety of mental disorders. While many believe that, in general, first-episode psychosis is a particularly high-risk period for suicide, no general agreement regarding higher prevalence of suicide in first-episode psychosis is achievable.
   Objective: In the present study, suicides and suicide attempts among psychiatric in-patients have been evaluated to assess the general profile of suicidal behavior among native psychiatric inpatients and any relationship between serum cholesterol level and suicidal behavior.
   Methods: Five acute academic wards, which have been specified for admission of first episode adult psychiatric patients, and five acute non-academic wards, which have been specified for admission of recurrent episode adult psychiatric patients, were selected for the current study. All inpatients with suicidal behavior (successful suicide and attempted suicide, in total), during the last five years (2013-2018), were included in the present investigation. Also, the assessment of serum lipids, including triglyceride, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein, was done, for comparing the suicidal subjects with non-suicidal ones.
   Results: Among 19160 psychiatric patients hospitalized in Razi psychiatric hospital during a sixty-months period, 63 suicidal behaviors, including one successful suicide and sixty-two suicide attempts, were recorded by the safety board of hospital. The most frequent mental illness was bipolar I disorder, which was significantly more prevalent in comparison with other mental disorders (p<0.04, p<0.02, p<0.007, and p<0.003 in comparison with schizophrenia, depression, personality disorders and substance abuse, respectively). Self-mutilation, self-poisoning and hanging were the preferred methods of suicide among 61.11%, 19.44% and 19.44% of cases, respectively. In addition, no significant difference was evident between the first admission and recurrent admission inpatients, totally and separately, particularly with respect to psychotic disorders. Besides, with respect to different components of serum lipids, no specific or significant pattern was evident.
   Conclusion: While in the present study, the suicidal behavior was significantly more evident in bipolar disorder in comparison with other psychotic or no-psychotic disorders, no significant difference was evident between the first admission and recurrent admission of psychiatric inpatients. Moreover, no significant relationship between suicidal behavior and serum lipids was found.

AB Background: The literature on Muslim women's suicidality has been growing. Comprehensive reviews are, however, unavailable, and theory needs development. Aims: This article reviews and integrates theories and findings about Muslim women's suicidality. Method: Two databases (PsycINFO and Web of Science) were searched for publications about Muslim women's suicidality. Results: There is significant variability in Muslim women's patterns of suicidality across Muslim-majority communities and countries. Muslim women represent half to nearly all cases of nonfatal suicidal behavior. According to the official records of Muslim-majority countries, women's suicide mortality is lower than that of men. Community studies, however, show that in some areas, Muslim women have significantly higher suicide rates than Muslim men. Both nonfatal and fatal suicidal behaviors are most common among uneducated and poor rural young women. Muslim women's typical suicide methods vary by locale, and include self-burning, hanging, and poisoning. With regard to contexts and meanings, a recurring female script is that of suicidality as protest against and desperate escape from the oppressive regulation as well as the abuse many women endure within their families and societies. Conclusion: Understanding and preventing Muslim women's suicidality, and the socially sanctioned oppression it is often a response to, require system-level - not just individual-level - analyses and interventions as well as a human rights perspective.

Data were obtained through interviews during the course of hospitalization. A total of 130 patients with suicidal behavior by burns were identified (incidence rate of 2.9 per 100,000). Females had a higher rate of suicidal behavior by burns than males (4.2 vs. 1.6 per 100,000, P < 0.001). The rate of suicidal behavior by burns was higher among single persons than married persons (4.3 vs. 3.5 per 100,000). The rate of suicidal behavior by burns among the rural population was slightly higher than the urban population (3.2 vs. 2.7 per 100,000). The high rate of suicidal behavior by burns among young, married women in Khorasan is a social tragedy.

AB Objective: To highlight the demographic profile, various methods of self inflicted burn, and to probe into the problem by knowing various precipitating factors that may lead to self inflicted burn in our part of the country.
   Patients and Methods: This is a study of 154 cases of self-inflicted burns treated at the Burn Emergency Unit of Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences Jamshoro Pakistan, during a period of 08 years. These self inflicted burns, were divided into two groups, those with suicidal intent called suicide attempter and those who mutilate themselves as self immolator. Except that these patients throughout the period of their hospital stay were under surveillance of a psychiatrist, they were managed according to the routine protocol of our unit. The patients were analyzed with respect to age, sex, method used for self inflicted burns, place of burn, psychiatric history; interpersonal problems, total body surface area (TBSA) burnt, depth of burn and outcome. The continuous variables were compared using t-test while for categorical data chi-square test was used. SPSS 15 was used as statistical software.
   Results: The prevalence of self inflicted burns was 9.80% with a consistent rise in number of self inflicted burns from 2001 through 2008. The self immolators were significantly younger then suicide attempters. Males dominated in self immolators, while in suicide attempters female outnumbered males. The mean TBSA affected was significantly higher in suicide attempters when compared to self immolators. The mean hospital stay did not differ significantly in both groups. The mortality for self immolators was 6.38%, in contrast to suicide attempter where it was 33.65%.
   Conclusion: The radical change in the socioeconomic condition of common people, traditional joint family system, political system and justice, has reflected as increased prevalence of self infliction both as self mutilators and suicide attempters (JPMA 60:338; 2010).

AB Aluminum phosphide (AlP) is a cheap solid fumigant and a highly toxic pesticide which is commonly used for grain preservation. In Iran it is known as the "rice tablet". AlP has currently aroused interest with increasing number of cases in the past four decades due to increased use in agricultural and non-agricultural purposesand also its easy availability in the markets has increased its misuse to commit suicide. Upon contact with moisture in the environment, AlP undergoes a chemical reaction yielding phosphine gas, which is the active pesticidal component. Phosphine inhibits cellular oxygen utilization and can induce lipid peroxidation. It was reported that AlP has a mortality rate more than 50% of intoxication cases. Poisoning with AlP has usually occurred in attempts to suicide. It is a more common case in adults rather than teen agers. In some eastern countries it is a very common agent with rapid action for suicide. Up to date, there is no effective antidote or treatment for its intoxication. Also, some experimental results suggest that magnesium sulfate, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), glutathione, vitamin C and E, beta-carotenes, coconut oil and melatonin may play an important role in reducing the oxidative outcomes of phosphine. This article reviews the experimental and clinical features of AlP intoxication and tries to suggest a way to encounter its poisoning.

AB Background: Few studies have examined suicidal ideation and behavior in hospitalized physically ill elderly patients, a group potentially at high risk. Our aim was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors for suicide ideation, and direct and indirect self-destructive behaviors among a sample of elderly inpatients.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2009; 650 inpatients aged 60 years and over were screened from various medical services in teaching hospitals affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in Iran. Suicidal ideation and behavior were measured with the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSSI) and the Harmful Behavior Scale (HBS). Depression was measured with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), medical burden with the geriatric version of the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS-G), life events with the Paykel Life Event Scale, and social support with the Perceived Social Support Scale.
   Result: Of the 650 patients screened with a mean age of 70.5 years (SD +/- 7.5), 570 met inclusion criteria and of these 123 (21.6%) reported suicidal ideation on the BSSI and 80 (14.4%) had at least one self-destructive behavior included in the HBS. There was a significant correlation between suicide ideation and harmful behaviors (r = 0.503, p = 0.001). In a regression analysis, depressive symptoms, increased burden of medical conditions, marital status, history of substance use, history of traumatic life events, lack of perceived social support, and poor education were associated with both suicide ideation and harmful behavior. From demographic variables, living without a spouse and unemployment were predictors of suicidal ideation and behavior.
   Conclusion: Hospitalized, physically ill elderly patients have high rates of suicidal ideation and self-destructive behavior and these vary according to psychosocial and clinical factors. The general hospital is therefore a potential site for the recognition of suicidal individuals and implementation of proximal suicide prevention strategies.

AB Psychological differences between those who attempt suicide and those who do not are not agreed upon by all specialists. The current study was carried out to compare psychological factors between patients with deliberate and nondeliberate self-poisoning in Kermanshah, Iran. It is a frequency matched case-control study. For the purpose of this study, among people who deliberately attempted suicide who were taken to Imam Khomeini Hospital of Kermanshah, 200 were selected as a sample. The controls were frequency matched with nondeliberate self-poisoning patients. For both deliberate and nondeliberate cases of self-poisoning, drug use was the most significant cause of poisoning. In comparison with nondeliberate self-poisoning, people with deliberate self-poisoning used more neurotic and immature defense mechanisms, and people with nondeliberate self-poisoning used more mature defense mechanisms. In general, both groups showed significant use of defense mechanisms; however, with regard to self-concept and general health, they showed no significant difference in any subcategories. When a person does not have the ability to adapt to stressful and difficult situations, he or she may turn to defense mechanisms that make the situation worse rather than better. Thus, enhancing defense and psychological mechanisms among vulnerable people should be considered.

ID SUICIDE RATES; UNITED-STATES; FIREARM; ACCESS
AB Introduction: Determination of suicide as the cause of death due to shotguns can be challenging because shotguns are usually designed for hunting, sport, and recreation. Therefore, the impact of their bullets on the human body may present several unclear signs. In this case, pellets were reported to spread in contact wounds. The manner of death seemed to be initially murder yet after the autopsy, it seemed suicidal.
   Case Presentation: The incident occurred during March 2015 in a house in the capital city of Iran, Tehran. The case was a 39-year-old man, who upon initial examination, was reported to have committed suicide using a shotgun. This was evident by the presence of distributed pellets in the chest and pelvis, which confirmed a contact shot.
   Conclusions: The following were hypothesized: 1- After the plastic cap of the bullet hit the sternum, it was fragmented, and pellets were scattered. 2- Regarding the existence of the pellets in the heart's ventricles, it seemed the pellets were distributed immediately through the aorta, to the chest, and through to the abdominal aorta, and the pelvis.

AB Objectives: Drowning must be recognized as a major global public health problem with significant opportunities for prevention.
   Methods: To examine the incidence and characteristics of drowning in recreational water settings, we analyzed 2002 to 2006 data from the Legal Medicine Organization of Mazandaran province, north of Iran, through a retrospective study.
   Results: During 2002 to 2006, a total of 1107 persons suffered fatal drowning in Mazandaran province. Mean age was 23.65 +/- 11.47 and M/F ratio was 8.4:1. The most common age groups of drowned victims were 20 to 24 and 15 to 19 years (17.0 and 16.1 per 100,000 population/yr, respectively). Children under the age of 15 years comprised 14.2% of all drowning deaths. Unprotected beaches of the Caspian Sea were the locations with the highest number of drowned victims. Most of drowned victims (65.9%) were travelers from other parts of Iran, especially from Tehran. The manner of death was found as following: 95.5% accidental, 3.6% suicidal, 0.3% homicidal, and 0.6% undetermined.
   Conclusions: Mazandaran province has a mean drowning rate 7.6 per 100,000 population-year that is not comparable to the drowning-related mortality in developed countries. Effective prevention of drowning requires programming and policies that address known risk factors.

ID OF-LIFE; GRIEF; BEREAVEMENT; SUICIDE
AB The experience of the spousal bereavement of widows who are single parents has been largely neglected in the literature. This qualitative study provides insight into how such women grieved over their spouse's death in Iran. In-depth interviews with 24 participants were held and field notes were written. The generated data were analyzed by using the constant comparative method. The results indicated four main categories: "intense grief", "becoming hopeless", "internalizing bereavement and continuing bonds", and "the contexts of experience of spousal death". The fourth category consisted of two subcategories: "the unexpected nature of death" and "full dependence". The findings suggested that hopelessness related to spousal death changed the lifestyles of the participants, which led to health risks in these women. We conclude that it is the duty of health-care professionals, especially nurses, to first identify widows at risk, with the help of the contexts of experience of spousal death and the symptoms presented in this study, and then to provide hope therapy, which can facilitate positive bereavement outcomes for healthier living after spousal death.

ID EPIDEMIOLOGY; INJURIES
AB Background: Burns are a major public health problem. They often require intensive care and long periods of hospitalization. In Tehran, about 5% of all hospitalized injuries are burns. There are no published long-term epidemiological studies regarding burn injuries of adults in Iran.
   Objective: To identify risk factors for burn injuries and provide a starting point for the establishment of an effective prevention plan.
   Methods: We analyzed the demographic, etiological, and clinical data of 1860 burn patients admitted to a major acute care hospital in Tehran between March 2010 and April 2011. Data were obtained from the registry recorded in Shahid Motahari Trauma Hospital and evaluated using a chi-square test.
   Results: Males were more than twice as likely to be burn patients than females (72.0% vs. 28.0%). Second and third-degree burns with a body surface area of 21%-30% constituted the highest injury reported (75.3%). The most common causes of the recorded burns were natural gas, gasoline (42%) and open fire (10.2%). Unintentional burns were reported in 85% of the cases, and 15% of the burn victims were suicide-related incidents; mainly among women. In 75% of suicide attempts, women set themselves on fire to commit suicide. The mean duration of hospitalization was 25 days and the mortality rate was 10.7%. Mean age of reported deaths was 38.6 years; with a mean of 30 years among women and 51.5 years among men.
   Conclusion: The group at highest risk was young men 21-30 years old. However, an astonishing finding was that 75% of suicidal-related incidents involved women setting themselves on fire. Those with the highest mortality rate were victims of burns with gas, gasoline, and kerosene; with a mean age of 30 years of death among women.

DE suicidal behavior; burn; adolescent; Kurdistan; Iran
AB The aim of this study was to identify the epidemiologic features and current etiological factors of suicidal behavior by burns among adolescents in Kurdistan, Iran. A prospective population-based study was carried out on patients with suicidal behaviors by burns requiring hospitalization among adolescents during 2000-2001 in Kurdistan, Iran. Sociodemographic and etiological factors were obtained through interviews with each patient or with family, relatives, or friends of the patient. Of 54 hospitalized burn patients aged 13-19 years, 40 (74.1%) patients were hospitalized because of suicidal behaviors by burns (6 males and 34 females). The incidence rate of these behaviors was 18.1 per 100,000 person-years (P-Y) and varied by gender (the incidence rates for females and males were 31.6 and 5.3 per 100,000 P-Y, respectively, P-(2) = .000004). Most of the patients (60%) were single, 70% were homemakers, and 60% were either illiterate or had a low level of education. The most common precipitating factors for suicidal behaviors by burns were a quarrel with a family member or relative (47.5%) and marital conflict (17.5%). Most of the patients who were able to communicate regretted their suicidal behaviors (85.7%). Adolescents in Kurdistan are at higher risk of suicidal behaviors by burns compared to adolescents in other areas of Iran. Factors likely to be associated with suicidal behaviors by burns include lower socioeconomic status and family problems. These factors should be investigated further to better elucidate the etiology of these events. It also is necessary to implement prevention programs and strategies known to be effective to reduce the incidence of suicide in this region.

AB Despite some scientific research on suicide as one of the most serious social and mental health problems in Iran, there is still lack of research on the effective structural and socio-familial factors contributing to the issue in Iran. The purpose of this study is to investigate some of the effective variables conditioning suicidality while also establishing a synthetic model. Three hundred-fifty university students (165 males, 185 females) were randomly chosen from Shahid Chamran University, Ahvaz, Iran. The participants were asked to complete a package of self-report questionnaires including subjective socioeconomic status (SES), feeling of anomie, perceived parental control, and suicidality. The results show that all correlations among variables are significant. For testing the theoretical model, results of standardized regression coefficients suggest that SES has direct effect on suicidality and indirect effect via anomie and parental control. In addition, parental control has direct effects on suicidality and indirect effect via anomie as well. The findings confirm the expected paths hypothesized among variables which are consistent with the theories of Durkheim, Merton, Kohn, and Agnew. It implies that the development of suicidality takes place within socioeconomic context through the influence of parental control and feeling of anomie.

AB This article reports cultural differences in the relationship between personality characteristics and euthanasia attitudes using samples from Iran and the United States. Survey data from university students were analyzed using multivariate regression. Results indicate that while attitudes toward euthanasia are significantly more positive among the U.S. sample, there is significantly greater variation among the Iranian sample. Honesty-Humility and Openness to Experience are predictive factors in both samples, where Agreeableness is only significant among the Iranian group. Additionally, Chow tests of structural features of the multivariate models show significant differences between the two samples. We conclude by discussing implications of these results for understanding cultural similarities and differences in attitudes toward euthanasia, including the practical implications of this work for patient care in an increasingly globalized world.

AB BACKGROUND: The Bipolar Disorder Patients Follow-up (BDPF) project is a longitudinal, prospective and naturalistic study. The purpose of the present report is to introduce the project, elaborate its methods, and present the reliability data of the utilized symptoms rating scales.
   METHODS: The sampling started in May 2008 and is still in progress. The probands are assessed at the beginning of the sampling and then 2 and 6 months later and then every 6 months using several instruments to identify psychiatric comorbidities, symptoms severity, quality of life, attempted suicide rate, treatment compliance, and some other factors.
   RESULTS: The results could lead to increase the clinicians' awareness about the clinical picture of this disorder in Iranian patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present project could decrease to some extent the current shortcomings in Iran's psychiatric data at least about one of the major psychiatric disorders known as the eighth result which cause medical disability over the world.

AB The lack of attention in academic discourse to representations of disability in films from the Middle East has led to an incomplete picture of representations of disability in global cinema. For instance, the diverse meanings of disability in Iranian cinema and the influence of disability on the emergence of Iranian New Wave cinema have been almost completely ignored by scholars. A number of award-winning films from Iran have featured disability as central to their narratives - such as The House is Black (1963), Taste of Cherry (1997), The Color of Paradise (1999), The Willow Tree (2005), and The Painting Pool (2013). Disability in these films serves alternatively as a symbol of spiritual possibility, a mark of marginalization, and a covert social critique. These films examine the emotional, physical, and social implications of disability, while celebrating the cultural power of film to challenge social, religious, and artistic barriers.

AB Introduction: Self-immolation is a common method of suicide among Iranian women. There are several contributing motives for attempting self-immolation, and exploration of the process of self-immolation incidents will help interventionists and clinicians develop prevention programs.
   Methods: A grounded theory study using face-to-face, recorded interviews was conducted with surviving self-immolated patients (n = 14), their close relatives (n = 5), and medical staff (n = 8) in Kermanshah, Iran. Data were analyzed using constant comparison in open, axial, and selective coding stages.
   Results: A conceptual model was developed to explain the relationships among the main categories extracted through the grounded theory study. Family conflicts emerged as the core category. Cultural context of self-immolated patients offered a contextual condition. Other important categories linked to the core category were mental health problem, distinct characteristics of the suicidal method, and self-immolation as a threat. The role of mental health problems as a causal condition was detected in different levels of the self-immolation process. Finally, adverse consequences of self-immolation emerged as having important impact.
   Conclusion: The conceptual model, derived through grounded theory study, can guide design of prevention programs. The pivotal role of family conflicts should be emphasized in mental health interventions. The impact of adverse consequences of self-immolation on further suicidal processes necessitates post-suicide prevention programs. Further research to design specific interventions is recommended.

AB The factors and demographic features of self-inflicted burns in Eastern and Western cultures differ from each other. In this retrospective study, the authors' aim is to identify the epidemiologic features of self-inflicted burn patients treated at their Tertiary Burn Centre. The Burn Centre provides health care to a large population from Istanbul, which is located at the crossroads between Asia and Europe. The demographic data and information of 32 patients who were admitted to the GATA HEH Burn Center in Istanbul for attempted suicide were retrospectively reviewed over a 7-year period (2001-2008). Twenty-eight of the 32 patients were men, whereas the remaining four patients were women. The average age was 25.9 years. Seventeen patients had a previous history of self-harming and 22 patients were unemployed. History of a psychiatric illness was found in 20 patients. Mean total body burn Surface area was 70%. The mortality rate was 43.4%. This Study demonstrates that suicide attempts by burning differ from Eastern and Western cultures by factors and demographic features. It has been concluded that the solution to preventing self-inflicted burns calls for the joint efforts of physicians, psychologists, and sociologists. Furthermore, it is necessary to reinstate prevention programs and revise strategies for prevention based on the country and its culture. (J Burn Care Res 2009;30:427-431)

AB NSAIDs are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, thus, they will provide analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet effects. Severe poisoning and death because of acute intoxication can occur by ingestions of more than 400 mg/kg. This cross-sectional retrospective study was carried out in on all patients referred to Loghman Hakim Hospital from 2011 to 2016. Grouping of our patients was based on the amount of NSAID ingestion, Type of NSAID, patient's conscious level according to Reed Scaling criteria, suicide attempt, and gender. Data were analyzed using the SPSS software. A P-value of 0.05 or less was considered to be statistically significant. The period prevalence of NSAID poisoning was 0.14% and the incidence was 3.816/100,000/ year. The uppermost number of poisoning were seen in 2012 (20.96%). Mean age was 23.75 +/- 9.76 years and most of the intoxications were seen in females (66.37%). Of the patients, 140 (61.13%) had ingested less than 200 mg/kg, and 9.17% committed suicide having a mortality rate of 0.43%. The most common NSAIDs that had been used were Ibuprofen (73.79%). Of patients, 83.4% underwent through common complications of NSAID poisoning. We find significant relationship between the type of NSAID and higher sodium, BUN, ALT, ALP, CPK levels in men, and higher LDH level in women. Besides, we found substantial correlation between using shortacting NSAIDs and female gender, suicide action, arrival to the hospital less than 12 h, amounts under 200 mg/kg, hospitalization longer than 12 h, and presentation of loss of consciousness.

AB Objectives: Comprehensive and up-to-date data on fatal injury trends are critical to identify challenges and plan priority setting. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of poisoning mortality trends across Iran.
   Study design: The data were gathered from various resources, including death registration systems, cemetery databases of Tehran and Esfahan, the Demographic and Health Survey of 2000, and three rounds of national population and housing censuses.
   Methods: After addressing incompleteness for child and adult death data separately and using a spatio-temporal model and Gaussian process regression, the level and trend of child and adult mortality were estimated. For estimating cause-specific mortality, the cause fraction was calculated and applied to the level and trend of death.
   Results: From 1990 to 2015, 40,586 deaths due to poisoning were estimated across the country. The poisoning-related age-standardized death rate per 100,000 was estimated to have changed from 3.08 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 2.32-4.11) in 1990 to 0.96 (95% UI: 0.73-1.25) in 2015, and the male/female ratio was 1.35 during 25 years of study with an annual percentage change of -5.4% and -4.0% for women and men, respectively. The annual mortality rate was higher among children younger than 5 years and the elderly population (>= 70 years) in the study period.
   Conclusions: This study showed that mortality from poisoning declined in Iran over the period from 1990 to 2015 and varied by province. Understanding the reasons for the differences of poisoning mortality by province will help in developing and implementing measures to reduce this burden in Iran.

AB Background: Over the past few years, methamphetamine-induced psychosis (MIP) has increased in Iran, accounting for a significant percentage of psychiatry hospital admissions. The present study was conducted with an aim to investigate clinical symptoms, and course and treatment methods of MIP inpatients in Shafa Psychiatry Hospital in northern Iran.
   Methods: Participants were 152 MIP inpatients. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) subscales of suspiciousness, unusual thought content; hallucinations and hostility were used to measure psychiatric symptoms. Data regarding suicide and homicide and violence were also obtained through interviews with the inpatients and their family. Based on their lengths of recovery time, the inpatients were categorized into 3 clinical groups. These inpatients received their usual treatments and were monitored for their psychiatric symptoms and clinical course of illness. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics.
   Results: The most frequent psychiatric symptoms were violence (75.6 %), intimate partner violence (61.2 %), delusions of persecution (85.5 %), delusions of reference (38.5 %), delusions of grandiosity (32.9 %), delusions of infidelity (30.2 %), auditory hallucinations (51.3 %), visual hallucinations (18.4 %), suicidal thoughts (14.5 %), homicidal thoughts (3.9 %), suicide attempts (10.5 %) and homicide attempts (0.7 %). Recovery from psychotic symptoms in 31.6 % of the inpatients took more than one month. 46.1% of the inpatients were treated with Risperidone and 37.5 % with Olanzapine. Persecutory delusion and auditory hallucination were the most frequent persistent psychotic symptoms. 20.8 % of the inpatients with duration of psychosis more than one month were treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) along with antipsychotics.
   Conclusion: All forms of violence are highly frequent in MIP inpatients. Our finding agrees with many other studies suggesting that recovery from MIP can take more than a month. Initial promising findings were found regarding the efficacy of Electroconvulsive therapy in MIP patients.

ID INJURY; PREVENTION; HEALTH; VIOLENCE
AB Background: The safe community initiative was developed by the world health organization following the increasing trend in the frequency of injuries. Similar to most countries, it was implemented in Iran to improve community safety. The aim of this study was to quantitatively analyze the Iranian designated safe communities.
   Methods: Using a descriptive design, this study analyzed the reports by Iranian designated safe communities (n, 33) in 2016. Data were extracted from the website of WHO collaborating centre on community safety promotion in Sweden, using an objective-based questionnaire. Microsoft Access 2010 was used for data management, and SPSS version 21 was utilized for data analysis.
   Results: The Iranian designated safe communities were all located in 3 out of 31 provinces of Iran, namely Tehran, Fars, and Khorasan Razavi. All the safe communities had covered traffic safety. In total, 69.7% of the safe communities reported the incorporation of occupational and sport safetyactivities, as well as violence and suicide prevention interventions. No significant difference was found among provinces in the frequency distribution of improved safety issues (P > 0.05). Moreover, 26 (78.8%) communities reported having an injury surveillance system.
   Conclusions: Iranian safe communities used a set of strategies to improve community safety. Accordingly, the neglected areas must be acknowledged by other interested communities. Moreover, rigorous scientific studies are required to assess the effectiveness of interventions.

   KURDISTAN
AB The aim of the study was to determine epidemiologic features and factors associated with suicidal behaviors by burns requiring hospitalization in the province of Isfahan, Iran. A prospective population-based study of all suicidal behaviors by burns requiring hospitalization was conducted in the province of Isfahan, Iran, from March 21, 2005 to March 20, 2006. Data were obtained from patients, family members, and/or friends through interviews during the course of hospitalization. A total of 89 patients ages 13 to 62 years with suicidal behaviors by burns were identified during the study period, representing an overall incidence rate of 2.9 per 100,000 persons-year (P-Y; 95% confidence interval 2.3-3.5 per 100,000 P-Y). Females (4.7 per 100,000 P-Y) had a higher rate of suicidal behavior by burns than males (1.2 per 100,000 P-Y; P < .001). The age-specific rate of suicidal behavior by burns peaked at age group 20 to 29 years (6.3 per 100,000 P-Y). Among the population aged 15 to 29 years, married women had a higher rate of suicidal behavior by burns (9.3 per 100,000 P-Y) than single women (6.6 per 100,000 P-Y). The highest rate of suicidal behavior by burns was found among the unemployed population (17.7 per 100,000 P-Y). The most frequent precipitating factor for suicidal behavior was a quarrel with a family member, relative, and/or friend (61.8%). Depression and anxiety disorders were the most frequent psychiatric comorbidities associated with suicidal behaviors. Mortality rate caused by suicidal behavior by burns was 1.4 per 100,000 P-Y. A high rate of suicidal behavior among young and mostly married women in the province of Isfahan is a tragedy and great concern. Social, cultural, and economical factors may contribute to suicidal behavior in Isfahan, and they need to be addressed through education, support, and commitment. Findings of this study can be used for implementation of a preventive program(s) to reduce the incidence of suicide among high risk groups.

AB Objective: Women are the primary victims of self-immolation in Iran; between 70-88% of self-immolation patients are women. The aim of this study is to investigate familial risk factors for self-immolation patients.
   Methods: In a case-control study, 30 consecutive cases of deliberate self-inflicted burns admitted to the regional Burn Centre (Imam Khomeini hospital in Kermanshah province, Iran) were compared with 30 controls selected from the community and matched by sex, age, and living area. All cases and controls were reviewed for familial variables, including history of suicide in the family, parental divorce, current conflict with parents, parental death, history of mental disorders in parents, history of addiction in parents, parents' marital conflict, marital conflict with spouse, conflict with other members of the family, addictive disorder in spouse, and socioeconomic level of family.
   Results: Using chi-square test of association, two variables were significantly associated with self-immolation. Marital conflict with spouse (OR 7.80, 95% CI 1.84-33.09) and conflict with other members of the family (OR 10.00, 95% CI 2.94-34.00) were associated with increased risk of self-immolation. The associations of other variables in both case and control groups were not statistically significant.
   Conclusions: Findings from this study suggest marital conflict with the spouse and conflict with other members of the family are risk factors for self-immolation. Screening, identification, and education of at-risk individuals on problem solving and other aspects of coping skills, as well as interpersonal relationships, could be appropriate preventive actions and strategies to reduce self-immolation in Iran.

TI WHO IS BEHIND THE NAME? A STORY OF VIOLENCE, LOSS, AND MELANCHOLIC
   SURVIVAL IN POST-REVOLUTIONARY IRAN
SO JOURNAL OF MIDDLE EAST WOMENS STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper journeys along the theoretical and historical trajectories of the early stage of post-revolutionary Iran, marked by an external war with Iraq and internal political suppression. Specifically, it grapples with the intricacies of loss, mourning, and survival in the meanders of the life of a woman, a former leftist political prisoner, named Mahtab. Striving to unravel the pathos and aporias of Mahtab's life, this paper ponders the limits of the laws of polity and of kinship, and the "limit of reflexivity" (a phrase introduced by Judith Butler) that may have led to her suicide. Based on Mahtab's story and my ethnographic work with some of the surviving former women inmates, this paper engages with Sigmund Freud's notions of survival, mourning, and melancholia in light of their intertwined relationship to the reformation of the subject. I argue for the centrality of mourning and its limits and illustrate how historically shaped political ideals and gendered subjectivities are implicated and influential in determining the impossibility of survival.

AB BackgroundTo assess the clinical course and outcome of patients with methamphetamine-induced psychosis in comparison with patients with primary psychotic disorders.
   MethodsThis prospective study was conducted on patients with methamphetamine-induced psychosis, and 2 groups of primary psychotic disorders: affective psychosis and non-affective psychosis admitted to 2 psychiatric hospitals in Tehran, Iran, with a first episode of a psychotic illness. A total of 165 subjects (55 in each group) were selected using convenience sampling. They were assessed at the time of admission, discharge and 6 and 12 months after discharge using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Young Mania Rating Scale and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale. The frequency of readmissions and suicide attempts were also assessed.
   ResultsSignificant differences were found in the trend of changes of symptoms and functioning among the 3 groups. At all-time points, the severity of negative psychotic symptoms and dysfunction in the non-affective psychosis group were greater than those in affective or methamphetamine-induced psychosis groups, with latter 2 having similar profiles. However, the course of positive symptoms in methamphetamine-induced psychosis was more similar to non-affective psychosis. Number of suicide attempts and readmissions were non-significantly higher in methamphetamine-induced psychosis than in the other groups.
   ConclusionMethamphetamine-induced psychosis does not have a satisfactory course and in some cases symptoms may remain even after many months of follow-up. Rate of certain outcomes such as re-hospitalization is also considerably high. It is a challenge for the health-care system that requires evidence-based interventions.

ID SUICIDE
AB Elders have long been recognised as among the most vulnerable people in disaster events. This paper reports a qualitative study of the self-perceived needs of older people in the aftermath of the Bam earthquake in Iran in 2003. A total of 56 people aged from 65 to 88 years were recruited to the study using purposive sampling, including 29 men and 27 women. Six focus group discussions and ten semi-structured individual interviews were conducted. Each focus group involved six to ten people from the cities of Bam and Baravat and their rural suburbs. Content analysis was used to analyse the transcribed data. The analysis identified four major themes among the informants' concerns inappropriate service delivery, affronts to dignity, feeling insecure and emotional distress. A disaster-prone country like Iran needs to be appropriately prepared with culturally sensitive plans to meet the needs of those who suffer from their effects, not least older people. Emergency relief managers should note that for many older people in a disaster zone, customary forms of relief are neither required nor appropriate, and that their distinctive immediate and long-term needs should be assessed and met. Relief agencies need to be trained to be age-sensitive and should mainstream older people's rights in the planning and implementation of both the response and recovery phases of assistance.

AB Background: Acute poisoning is a common chief complaint leading to emergency department visits and hospital admissions in developing countries such as Iran. Data describing the epidemiology of different poisonings, characteristics of the clinical presentations, and the predictors of outcome are lacking. Such data can help develop more efficient preventative and management strategies to decrease morbidity and mortality related to these poisonings. This manuscript describes the epidemiology of acute poisoning among patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Birjand, Iran.
   Methods: This retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted to characterize acute poisonings managed in the ICU during a 7-year period from March 2010 to March 2017 in a single center in Birjand, Iran. Patient characteristics, suspected exposure, the route of exposure, and outcome data were collected from hospital medical records.
   Results: During the study period, 267 (64% male and 36% female) patients met inclusion criteria. Pharmaceutical medication (36.6%), opioids (26.2%) followed by pesticides (13.9%) were the most common exposures 38.2% of these cases were identified as suicide attempts. There were different frequencies in terms of xenobiotic exposure in relation to gender (p = 0.04) and the survival (p = 0.001). There was a significant difference between various xenobiotics identified as the cause of poisoning (p = 0.001). Mortality rate in our study was 19.5%. The incidence of outcomes was significantly higher in patients poisoned with opioids, pesticides, benzodiazepines, and tricyclic antidepressants (p < 0. 05). The median length of hospital stay was higher in pesticide-poisoned patients (p = 0.04).
   Conclusion: Opioids and pesticides were the most common exposures. The mortality rate of the poisoned patients in the ICU was proportionately high. The mortality rate due to opioid poisoning is a major concern and the most significant cause death due to poisoning in the region. Further monitoring and characterization of acute poisoning in Birjand, Iran is needed. These data can help develop educational and preventative programs to reduce these exposures and improve management of exposures in the prehospital and hospital settings.

ID YOUTH SUICIDE; TRENDS; PROVINCE; RATES
AB Background: Hanging is a form of strangulation, in which the body is suspended through the neck and the weight of the body acts as a constricting force. This study assessed various factors on the outcome of hanging and identification of prognostic factors related to the outcomes.
   Methods: Ninety-nine hanging victims from 1995 to 2015 in Iran were evaluated; then, variables such as the cause of death, distribution of mortality, duration of hospitalization, substance abuse consumption, respiratory distress, and cerebral edema were studied in these people. Finally, the data were analyzed.
   Results: Major cases of suicide by hanging were men. In connection with prognosis, about 12% of the deaths occurred in men and about 21% were represented in women. More importantly, in the matter of suspension, the model was largely incomplete to complete. Also, the outcomes of pulmonary stress and cerebral edema were recognized in association with the type of hanging and mortality prognosis.
   Conclusion: Only two risk factors, including loss of consciousness at the time of entry into the medical center, as well as the complete suspension, would be predictive operations of death and unsuccessful revival.

AB Background: Acute aluminum phosphide (AIP) poisoning is one of the most common cause of acute pesticide poisoning in Iran. Spontaneous ignition is a rare finding in AIP poisoning. Objective: To present two cases of fatal ALP poisoning that involved spontaneous ignition. Case Report: Two patients presented with suicidal ingestion of AIP tablets. In the Emergency Department (ED), they received gastric lavage. During insertion of a nasogastric tube, both patients experienced spontaneous ignition, and flames were witnessed by the medical personnel. Unfortunately, both patients died due to systemic effects of ALP poisoning. Conclusion: Patients who present with acute aluminum phosphide poisoning may experience spontaneous ignition in the ED.

AB The Kohkiluye va Boyerahmad province is located in the south of Iran. The population of the province is about 615,000, living in 14,261 km(2). The total number of patients in the study was 235. There were admitted to the burn unit of Shahid Beheshti hospital (Yasuj) between 18 July 2002 and 17 July 2004. Of these patients, 149 (63.4%) were accidental and 86 (36.6%) were self-inflicted burns. The hospitalization rates for accidental and self-inflicted burns were 12.1 and 7.0 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. There is a significant difference in the sex ratio (males:females) between accidental (1.40) and suicidal (0.13) patient groups (P-(2) < 0.00001). The fatality rates for accidental and self-inflicted burns were 2.1 and 59.5%, respectively. The mortality rates for accidental and self-inflicted burns were 0.24 and 3.81 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The overall mean and median ages for accidental patients were 19.4 and 13 years, and those for self-inflicted burns were 24.9 and 23 years, respectively. In the accidental patients, the BSA of the burns ranged front 5 to 95%, with a median of 15%. In the self-inflicted patients, the median of BSA was 65%. The majority of accidental burns were caused by scalds (43.2%) and of self-inflicted burns by kerosene (87.5%). The median hospital stay was 8 days with a range of 1-43 days for accidental patients. The median hospital stay was 4 days with a range from < 1 to 36 days for fatal self-burning patients. In non-fatal self-burning cases, the median hospital stay was 20 days with a range of 4-53 days. There is significant difference between fatal and non-fatal self-burning cases for hospital stay (P-(2) < 0.0001). No definite correlation was found between the incidence of either accidental or self-inflicted burns and seasons (P-(2) > 0.05). Most of the burns occurred at home. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

AB Introduction: Due to the recent progress in medical and technological knowledge, the attitude towards death has changed. Euthanasia is another concept that has acquired attention in the recent decades.
   Aim: To compare the attitude toward euthanasia among dying patients, relatives of dying patients, depressed patients and non depressed patients, at a neurological clinic in Babol, Iran.
   Materials and Methods: The present pilot cross-sectional study was conducted in October 2014 at the neurological diseases clinic affiliated to Babol University of Medical Sciences, Mazandaran, Iran. Four groups of subjects participated in the study (16 in each group): dying patients, relatives of dying patients, patients with depressive disorders and non depressed patients. In order to assess the willingness of participants toward euthanasia, a researcher-made questionnaire was designed based on the objectives of the study. Due to the lack of reliable and valid questionnaires on euthanasia in Iran, the researchers tailored a questionnaire in accordance with Iranian culture and cognitive aspects of euthanasia and related literature. Questions were devised and given to three specialists for expert opinion. After minor revisions, validity and reliability of the questions were calculated. After data collection, statistical analysis was performed by SPSS version 16 and ANOVA test.
   Results: Of the total 64 participants, 34 were female and 30 were male (mean age=55 +/- 4.7 years). The mean euthanasia score for men was slightly higher (9.33 +/- 2.6) than women (9.03 +/- 2.8). There was no significant difference between gender and euthanasia score (p=0.66). Also, there was no significant difference between the mean euthanasia score of four study groups (p=0.28).
   Conclusion: According to the findings of our study, there was no significant difference between attitude towards euthanasia among depressed and dying patients versus other patients (relatives of dying patients, non depressed patients).

AB Objective: This study was carried out to detect the prevalence of child abuse in three domains of physical, psychological and neglect among elementary school aged children of Qazvin Province, Iran.
   Methods: In this descriptive-analytic and cross-sectional study, 1028 elementary school aged children of Qazvin Province selected through multistage cluster sampling were assessed for child abuse in all domains, except for sexual abuse through a researcher-made questionnaire. The questionnaire was standardized for validity and reliability. Gathered data was statistically analyzed and P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant.
   Findings: Out of 1028 studied children, including 540 (52.5%) boys and 488 (47.5%) girls 679 (66.05%) cases declared at least one type of child abuse. The number of positive cases for each domain of emotional, physical and neglect was 618 (60.1%), 360 (35%) and 394 (38.3%) respectively. No significance was seen regarding the gender and/or regions of living in any of the domains and total prevalence.
   Conclusion: Regarding the results of this study which showed a prevalence rate of 66% for child abuse; and since there are strong association between child maltreatment and its impacts in juvenile and adulthood periods in the forms of offending, mental health concerns such as suicide and homicide, substance abuse, school failure, employment difficulties, teenage pregnancy, adult attachment difficulties, family violence, intergenerational violence and so on, appropriate education to the parents, and the punishment laws for child abuse is recommended.

AB Objective: To investigate demographic risk factors for self-immolation patients.
   Methods: In a case-control study, 30 consecutive cases of deliberate self-inflicted burns admitted to the regional Burn centre (Imam Khomeini hospital in Kermanshah province, Iran) were compared with 30 controls who were selected from the community and matched by gender, age, and living area. All cases and controls were reviewed for demographic variables, including: age, gender, living area, family size, marital status, bearing and number of children, Body Mass Index (BMI), birth order, employment state, educational status, early school drop-out, and parent/guardian employment status.
   Results: Two variables emerged as related to risk of self-immolation. Being the first or last child in family birth order was associated with increased risk of self-immolation. Moreover, among the married participants, having children was associated with decreased risk of self-immolation. The comparisons of other variables were not statistically significant. in multivariate analyses, none of the variables predicted risk for self-immolation.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that being the first or last child of a family might be a risk factor for self-immolation. For married persons, having children might serve as a protective factor from self-immolation. Other variables such as family size, marital status, number of children, BMI, employment state, educational status, early school drop-out, and parent/guardian employment status did not play a role as individually protective or risk factors for self-immolation.

AB Background: Depression is a neuroprogressive disorder that is characterized by neurotransmitter derangement and decreased neurogenesis and neurotrophic factors including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).
   Objectives: To determine the lipid profiles and BDNF levels in university students at an institution in Iran and association of these factors with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores.
   Methods: We conducted an observational study of a cross-section of male students at the Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences in Iran. For each of the 100 participants, a BDI score was obtained and serum levels of BDNF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of serum lipids, including cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), were measured using a biochemical analyzer. Castelli's risk index type I (CRI-I), Castelli's risk index type II (CRI-II), CRI-I = TG/HDL-C and CRI-II = LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol, and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), AIP = log (triglycerides/HDL-cholesterol), were calculated.
   Results: Based on BDI scores, lower levels of BDNF, triglycerides, cholesterol, and HDL, but higher levels of LDL were found in participants with higher BDI scores. CRI-I was also increased in participants with depression.
   Conclusion: The levels of BDNF and lipid factors are associated with the severity of depression in Iranian male university students. Deranged levels of BDNF and lipids may predispose depressed students to cardiovascular diseases.

AB Compared with the treatment of drug-sensitive tuberculosis, the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is more difficult. This study was conducted at the national referral center of tuberculosis in Tehran, Iran, to evaluate adverse drug reactions of treatment of MDR-TB. From 2006 to 2009, all patients admitted into Masih Daneshvari Hospital in Tehran, Iran, for MDR-TB were considered for this study. The standard treatment for MDR-TB consisted of amikacin, prothionamide, ofloxacin, and cycloserine. Ethambutol and pyrazinamide were added to treatment if mycobacterium was sensitive to them. All adverse effects observed in patients were recorded in our registry. Eighty patients were considered in the study; of this cohort, 44 were male and 36 were female. The mean age of patients was 40.64 +/- 17.53 years (range, 14-81 years). All patients received standardized therapy for MDR-TB. The major adverse effects included neurologic side effects (depression, convulsions, consciousness, psychosis, suicide; 7.5%), hepatitis (5%), rash (1.3%), renal toxicity (3.8%), and auditory toxicity (14.5%). Those with neurologic side effects had less favorable outcome (P value = 0.038) and risk of death was increased among them (odds ratio, 13.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.2-86.77). Other adverse effects did not show statistical significance in our analysis. A major adverse effect such as neurologic side effects (depression, convulsions, consciousness, and psychosis) can result in an increased chance of death among patients with MDR-TB.

AB This article reports on the relationship of personality and euthanasia attitudes. Results from a survey of 165 Iranian students showed that religiosity, honesty-humility, agreeableness, and extraversion were related to negative attitudes toward euthanasia, whereas openness was related to acceptance of euthanasia, with the unconventionality facet driving this relationship. Moreover, openness explained additional variance when added to a multivariate model containing religiosity and HEXACO factors. This study illustrates the possibility of accounting for variation beyond the traditional group level predictors of attitudes toward euthanasia and promoting future cross-cultural studies into personality and end-of-life issues and informing end-of-life conversations at the bedside.

AB Some parts of Masjid-i-Sulaiman (MIS) (Khozestan provinces, southwest of Iran) are contaminated with subsurface leakage of natural sour gas containing H2S. It is reported that the incidence of suicide by self-burning in MIS is very high. High endogenous H2S levels have been found in the brain and it is involved in the brain functions. Because there is no report about the effect(s) of natural sour gas containing sulfur compounds on the function(s) of human brain, the present study was done. The study was performed on 128 individuals exposed or unexposed to natural sour gas. The exposed group consisted of 64 persons (39 males, 25 females). Unexposed subjects were matched by sex, age, and educational levels. Depression and hopelessness were determined using Beek's depression inventory (BDI) and Beck's hopelessness (BHS) questionnaires. Using multiple linear regression models, the averages of BDI (t = 2.637, P = 0.009) and BHS (t = 3.344, P = 0.001) were significantly higher among the exposed subjects than among the control group. In Lali 57.8% and 14.1% of subjects had no depressed mood and moderate to severe depressed mood, respectively, while in MIS 31.3% and 35.9% of subjects had no depressed mood and moderate to severe depressed mood, respectively; the difference was significant (chi(2) = 12.88, df = 3, P = 0.005). In Lali 35.9% and 12.5% of subjects had no hopelessness at all and moderate to severe hopelessness, respectively, while in MIS 17.2% and 32.8% of subjects had no hopelessness at all and moderate to severe hopelessness, respectively, the difference was significant (chi(2) = 11.49, df = 3, P = 0.009).

AB Objective: To depict the epidemiology of deaths due to carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning in Tehran, distinguishing those at greatest risk for acute poisoning resulting in death.
   Methods: A retrospective survey was carried out with regularly collected information set in Tehran's Legal Medicine Organization, with a population of 11.1 million. The data included 666 deaths due to CO poisoning from January 2002 through December 2006. The principal consequence measures were age and sex standardized incidence rates for unintentional, suicidal, and undetermined poisonings for legal authorities.
   Results: The overall rate of unintentional poisonings over the 5-year period was 7.5 per 100,000, with an annual rate of 1.5 per 100,000. The 5-year rates were highest in people aged 25 to 34 years: men, 16.4 per 100,000; women, 7.8 per 100,000. For suicides, the 5-year rate was 0.1 per 100,000; annual rate, 0.02 per 100,000. The suicidal 5-year rates were highest in men aged 35 to 44 years, that is, 0.9 per 100,000; there was no case for women. Unintentional poisonings displayed a powerfully seasonal variation with the highest rates being documented in the months October to March. Over the 5-year period, increasing rates of death from CO poisoning were found annually to be approximately 20%.
   Conclusions: In this study, middle-age people, young adults, and elderly people were at the greatest risk for unintentional CO poisoning, and rates were highest in the winter months. Death from suicidal CO poisoning was very rare in this study; on the other hand, unintentional CO poisoning deaths are increasing in Tehran. Health authorities require to consider all populations in any prevention plan.

TI Paracetamol poisoning among immigrants in a department of hepatology
SO DANISH MEDICAL BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
ID SUICIDE; METABOLISM; BORN
AB Introduction: An increased incidence of suicides and suicidal behaviour among immigrants has been described in other countries. In Denmark, misuse of paracetamol is suspected in some foreign-born minority groups, although no data have been produced to substantiate this suspicion.
   Methodology. A retrospective study of the incidence of paracetamol poisoning in patients admitted to a specialised department of hepatology from 1994 to 1999 was carried our.
   Results: Of a total of 580 patients, 56 (9.7%; 95%-conridrnce interval 7.2-12.1%)were immigrants, among whom a significant overrepresentation was found of immigrants from Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, and Lebanon (Observed/ Expected-ratios of 1.95, 4.14, 2.67, and 2.45 respectively: p <0.05). The immigrants differed from the Danish-born patients being younger(21 vs 35 years of age; p<0.05), having a lower level of alcohol consumption (3% vs 30% with regular alcohol abuse; p<less than>0.05), and in general being less severely intoxicated (3% vs 22% developing hepatic encephalopathy; p<0.05). Compared to the Danish-born patients, the immigrants more frequently stated socio-economic problems as the reason for their self-poisoning (29% vs 10%; p<less than>0.05).
   Conclusions: The study demonstrates an overrepresentation of immigrants among patients admitted with paracetamol poisoning in Denmark.

AB BACKGROUND: Self-immolation is one of the most violent methods of suicide in developing countries. The objective of the present study was to investigate the survival rate and factors affecting survival of self-immolation patients.
   METHODS: All people either died or hospitalized for intentional burns were assessed in Kermanshah province between 2010 and 2013. Required information was gathered from two sources, Kermanshah province legal medicine and burn center of Imam Khomeini Hospital. Survival function was assessed through Cox regression. The data were analyzed with Stata 12 software.
   RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2013 (three years), 446 people attempted self-immolation, of which 370 were females (83%). In general, 276 people (61.8%) died due to severity of the burns. The median of survival time was 47 +/- 5 days. The survival rate after one day, one week, and 21 days after accident was 86%, 52%, and 38%, respectively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that burn was the most powerful risk factor, sothe risk in those with over 70% burns is 17 times more than those with burns less than 30%.
   CONCLUSION: Burn percentage is the strongest risk factor, those with high burns percentage should be hospitalized quickly and without waste of time.

AB To explore whether the 'hikikomori' syndrome (social withdrawal) described in Japan exists in other countries, and if so, how patients with the syndrome are diagnosed and treated.
   Two hikikomori case vignettes were sent to psychiatrists in Australia, Bangladesh, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the USA. Participants rated the syndrome's prevalence in their country, etiology, diagnosis, suicide risk, and treatment.
   Out of 247 responses to the questionnaire (123 from Japan and 124 from other countries), 239 were enrolled in the analysis. Respondents' felt the hikikomori syndrome is seen in all countries examined and especially in urban areas. Biopsychosocial, cultural, and environmental factors were all listed as probable causes of hikikomori, and differences among countries were not significant. Japanese psychiatrists suggested treatment in outpatient wards and some did not think that psychiatric treatment is necessary. Psychiatrists in other countries opted for more active treatment such as hospitalization.
   Patients with the hikikomori syndrome are perceived as occurring across a variety of cultures by psychiatrists in multiple countries. Our results provide a rational basis for study of the existence and epidemiology of hikikomori in clinical or community populations in international settings.

AB Background: Hydrocarbon injection, which mostly occurs in the upper extremity, is commonly seen in domestic and industrial accidents, or attempted suicide. Surgical approach to chemical cellulites and other complications in these patients is controversial.
   Method: This survey has been carried out on 21 patients admitted to general surgery unit of Loqman Hakim hospital, Tehran, Iran with the complaint of hydrocarbon injection in 2001-2005.
   Results: The most common injected material was petroleum (in 8 patients). Anterior forearm was the most common injection site (in 16 patients). All of the patients had inflammation, swelling, and localized tenderness. Leukocytosis was present in 18 of 21 patients. Compartment syndrome happened in 13 patients; 5 with necrotizing fasciitis. All of the patients with compartment syndrome underwent fasciotomy and debridement. Split thickness skin graft was done for 10 patients after 2 weeks of admission. There was no mortality or limb loss during the study period.
   Conclusions: Prevention of the systemic complications, hospitalization, close monitoring and treatment of chemical cellulites are the main parts of the management of patients with hydrocarbon injection. Surgical intervention is recommended when compartment syndrome or other local complications occur. (C) 2009 Surgical Associates Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Because it remains one of the third leading causes of death among adolescents around the world, suicide is a major public health concern. This study was designed in response to this concern by examining the relationships among perceived stress, emotional intelligence, and suicidal ideation and to test the moderating role of emotional intelligence in the relationship between perceived stress and suicidal ideation. A sample of depressed adolescents (n = 202) was recruited from five hospitals in Tehran, Iran, and then asked to complete measures of patient health, suicidal ideation, perceived stress, and emotional intelligence. Structural Equation Modeling showed that depressed adolescent in-patients with high levels of perceived stress and low levels of emotional intelligence were more likely to report suicidal ideation. Multi-group analysis indicated that depressed in-patients high in both perceived stress and emotional intelligence had less suicidal ideation than others. The findings support the notion that perceived stress acts as a vulnerability factor that increase suicidal ideation among depressed inpatients. Suicidal history moderated the relationship between emotional intelligence and suicidal ideation. These findings also highlight the importance of emotional intelligence as a buffer in the relationship between perceived stress and suicidal ideation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is transmitted to humans by ticks or by direct contact with infected blood. It causes severe, often fatal, hemorrhagic diseases in humans but infection in animals is asymptomatic. CCHFV can spread from person to person and has caused many nosocomial outbreaks. Because the virus is very pathogenic for humans it must be manipulated in a biosafety level 4 (BSL4) laboratory, rendering the production of antigen for serological diagnosis difficult. To replace the native antigen, we produced a recombinant nucleoprotein expressed in mammalian cells via the recombinant Semliki Forest alphavirus replicon and developed an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) as well as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by immunocapture to detect IgM and IgG in human and animal serum. Using these methods, we analyzed clinical samples from human patients and sera from domestic animals collected in Iran and we show that this novel antigen provides a novel, sensitive and specific tool for CCHF diagnosis.

AB Background: The Iraq-Iran war was one of the longest conflicts in the twentieth century. The aim of our research was to review the incidence of mortality and injuries of the war.
   Methods: A search strategy was designed and run in Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, and Iranian databases including Scientific Information Database (SID), IranMedex, and Magiran. Also, searching grey literature, checking references, tracking citations, hand-searching of focused journals, and websites were utilized for retrieval of related studies. All of articles which studied epidemiology of mortality or injuries of the war were included. The excluding criteria were case reports, case series, laboratory researches, and nonoriginal studies.
   Results: Fourteen articles out of 1751 primary results were selected to be included in the study. During the war (1980 1988), 188,015 to 217,489 Iranians were killed (about 70 people per day). The mean age of mortality was 23 years. Six thousand four hundred twenty-seven (2.9 %) of those who died during the war were females. One thousand five chemical warfare victims died between 1983 and 1994. From 1985 through 1998, 82 veterans had successful suicides too. At the end of war, we had 398, 587 veterans who needed follow- up. Among them, there were 52,000 chemical warfare victims. Between 1988 and 2003, 1400 people died and 2313 injured due to landmines and unexploded ordnances in five border provinces.
   Conclusion: The war caused a lot of mortalities and morbidities in our country. Now, 24 years after the war, many physically, mentally, and chemically injured victims have remained. We suggest other studies about indirect impacts of the war on societies, families, friends, and affiliates of the victims.

AB Suicide is a substantial public health problem, and it remains a serious cause of death in the world. Therefore, this study was designed to examine the relationships between brooding, reflection, emotional intelligence (assessed by performance-based test), and suicidal ideation; the mediation role of emotional intelligence on the relationships between brooding and reflection with suicidal ideation; and the moderating role of suicidal history on the relationships between brooding, reflection, and emotional intelligence with suicidal ideation among Iranian depressed adolescents. The study consisted of a cross-sectional sample of 202 depressed adolescent inpatients from five public hospitals in Tehran, Iran completed measures of depression, rumination, emotional intelligence, and suicide attempt history as indices of suicidal ideation. Structural Equation Modelling estimated that depressed adolescent inpatients with high levels of brooding and reflective rumination, and low levels of emotional intelligence were more likely to report suicidal ideation. Moreover, emotional intelligence partially mediated the relationships between brooding and reflective rumination with suicidal ideation. Suicidal history moderated the relationships between brooding, reflection, and emotional intelligence with suicidal ideation. These findings reinforce the importance of emotional intelligence as an influencing factor against the deleterious effects of rumination styles and suicidal ideation. The results indicate that brooding and reflection have detrimental effects on suicidal ideation in depressed inpatients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The number of incarcerated mothers is increasing significantly. There are many risks and harmful consequences for the children of the incarcerated mothers. In Iran, there is not a systematic research and information on these children. Therefore, this study aims at utilizing a qualitative methodology, to investigate the living conditions of this group, based on their mothers' narratives. The grounded theory approach of Strauss and Corbin 1998 was used to analyze the consequences of the incarceration of mothers on the living conditions of children. The participants of the study include 16 incarcerated mothers who were on leave. The data were gathered via in-depth and open-ended interviews. During the coding process six categories were extracted which describe the living condition of the children: behavioral, mental, and physical challenges; escape; experience of poverty and destructive economy of family; dilemma of caring; mother-child visitation; difficulties suicide and mother's emotional challenges. Children of incarcerated mothers encountered challenges such as mental, behavioral and economic. Many of them escape from home and school. Mothers prefer informal caring of their children than formal. The mother-child visits include some difficulties such as long distance, transportation costs, and undesirable visiting atmosphere. Mothers pointed to their deep psychological problems and sometimes committing suicide due to the separation of their children.

AB BACKGROUND: The existing evidence about the clinical situations of the bipolar patients with opioid dependence is scarce. The present study was carried Out to compare the clinical features and course of the bipolar disorder type I regarding the two subgroups of opioid dependent and non-dependent.
   METHODS: There were 178 adult patients with bipolar disorder type I consecutively referred to the Iran Hospital of Psychiatry, Tehran, Iran, from January 2008 to January 2009 who enrolled in the study. The Persian Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV axis I disorders (SCID-I), HDRS-17, and Y-MRS were administered for all patients. Other clinical information was gathered through the face-to-face interviews with the probands and the hospital records. The T test, Chi square test and logistic regression were used to analyze the data.
   RESULTS: The mean age of probands were 33.6 +/- 11.1 years old and they were mostly male. Among the evaluated indices, the factors gender, anxiety disorders comorbidity, non-adherence, and positive family history were different significantly and independently from the other studied factors between opioid dependent and non-dependent bipolar patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite some differences, the opioid dependent and non-dependent bipolar patients did not have any significant difference regarding most of the examined clinical and course indices.

ID STRESS; PREVALENCE; CULTURE; HEALTH
AB University Student Depression Inventory (USDI) was developed to assess the symptoms of depression among the university students. Considering the debilitating nature of depression among university students globally, USDI was translated in Persian and validated using university students from Iran. A battery including the Persian version of USDI and scales measuring suicide, depression, and stress was administered to a normative sample of 359 undergraduate students, and an additional clinical sample of 150 students referred to the university's mental health centre. The results supported the factor structure and the psychometric properties of the translated version. Confirmatory factor analysis upheld the previously reported three-factor first-order and one-factor second-order structure. The internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and concurrent and discriminant validity of the Persian version were supported. Cut-off points using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were established to identify students at risk. Gender differences on the symptoms of depression were evident only in the normative sample, where male participants, compared with female students, had higher mean scores in lethargy, cognitive/emotion, and academic motivation subscales. The translated scale can be used with Persian-speaking students in Iran and the neighbouring countries as well as those settled in the West to identify symptoms of depression for further evaluation and management.

AB Background: Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) intoxication contributes a large number of drug toxicities with serious complications. There are a few studies about factors associated with TCA intoxication. This study therefore aimed to identify determinants of this type of intoxication. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out at Loghman-Hakim Poison Hospital during a 6-month period. All poisoned patients aged > 12 years presented to this hospital during the mentioned period were evaluated. Then, TCA-poisoned patients were compared with other drug intoxications as the control group to determine factors associated with TCA intoxications. Results: There were 9809 admissions, of which 1583 (16.1%) patients including 601 (38%) males were intoxicated with TCAs. Mean age of the subjects was 26.5 +/- 10 years. Most of the TCA intoxications (74.4%) were intentional (p = 0.01). Amitriptyline was the most frequent agent followed by Nortriptyline. There was no significant difference between TCA and non-TCA intoxications regarding the mortality (1.3% in TCA vs. 1.1% in others, p = 0.45). Logistic regression analysis revealed that sex, addiction status, and history of psychological problems have association with TCA intoxication. Conclusions: The results of this study are helpful in identifying individuals who are prone to TCA intoxication and may be useful in implementation of preventive strategies.

AB BACKGROUND: Drowning is a preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. We studied drowning deaths in Isfahan Province, focusing on the activity victims were involved in and the setting of the incident.
   METHODS: Retrospective analysis was done on all drowning deaths referred to Legal Medicine Organization of Isfahan province over a period of 5 years from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2006.
   RESULTS: During these 5 years, 355 persons suffered fatal drowning in Isfahan province. The annual incidence rate was 1.6 per 100000 population (2.6 & 0.4 for males and females, respectively). Mean age was 21.99 +/- 14.86 and M/F ratio was 6.5:1. Most victims were 15-24 and 5-14 years of age (172 and 62 decedents, 3.0 and 1.8 per 100000 population/year, respectively). Most incidents occurred in natural settings, of which rivers, canals, lakes and ponds were the most common sites, respectively. The most frequently connected activity was swimming and wading, followed by accidental fall into water. The manner of death was found as following: 85.1% accidental, 1.7% suicidal, 0.3% homicidal and 12.9% undetermined.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the drowning related mortality in Isfahan province is comparable to developed countries, effective prevention of drowning with better programming and policies might reduce its rate.

AB Introduction: The issue of child and adolescent injury and violence is often absent from discussions and is largely invisible in public health policies. The purpose of this study was to describe the frequency and pattern of unnatural deaths during childhood and adolescence in Isfahan province in Iran. Materials and Methods: This retrospective, descriptive study involved unnatural deaths among individuals under the age of 20 years who died from unnatural causes as determined by a forensic autopsy at the Legal Medicine Center of Isfahan. During the study period, 8,010 unnatural deaths occurred, 1,222 of which were individuals under 20 years old. Results: All 1,222 of these unnatural deaths were identified through autopsy. Among the 1,222 cases, 895 (73.2%) were male, and 327 were female (26.8%). Accidental deaths were found to be the most frequent manner of death comprising 1,029 (83.96%) cases, followed by suicide (120, 9.82%), undetermined cause of death (39, 3.19%), and homicide (9, 2.86%) cases. Road traffic accidents were the number 1 cause of death (597, 49%), followed by burns (122, 10%) and hanging (90, 7.4%). Discussion: Injuries and violence that occur during childhood and adolescence represent a global public health problem, especially in low-and middle-income regions, and require urgent action.

AB Burn injuries still produce a significant morbidity and mortality in Iran. This study was carried out to analyze the epidemioloy, mortality, and current etiological factors of 2043 burn patients who were admitted to the burn centers in the Fars province during 4 years (1994-1998). There were two burn centers in the Fars province serving 3 817 036 people over an area of 124 000 km(2). The overall incidence rates of hospitalization and death were 13.3 and 4.6 per 100 000 person-years. The mean age was 21.9 years, and 51% of patients were children under 19-years-old. The highest rates of hospitalization and death were observed in the elderly (80 years). Also young females (20-29 years) had a high rate of hospitalization. Thus, 55% of the patients had BBS less than 40%. Burn injuries were more frequent and larger with higher mortality in females than in males (P <0.0001). There was also statistically significant correlation between age groups, gender, and BBS with mortality rate (P < 0.0001). Flame was the most common etiology of burns. There was also significant correlation between age groups and type of burns (P < 0.0001). Suicide attempts for all the patients greater than or equal to 11 years were the cause of 41.3% (256/620) of the burns involving women and of 10.3% (40/388) of the burns involving men. The overall case fatality rate was 34.4%. The mortality rate was significantly higher for self-inflicted burns (78%) than for accidental burns (26.7%). Most of the lesions requiring hospital admission occurred during the winter months. Factors associated with an increase in mortality were suicidal burns, burn size, age, and flame burns. Most of the burn injuries were caused by domestic accidents and were, therefore, preventable. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study is to present a description, theming, and status comparison of sexual minorities, such as transgender persons and transsexuals in the Islamic society of Iran. Cultural as well as religious sensitivities have made the living conditions of sexual minorities, as an individual and a social being, extremely challenging. Using a hermeneutic interpretation (interpretative phenomenological analysis) a number of 18 semi-structured interviews were conducted with transgender individuals; from the interviews, three main themes: self-confidence, legal respect (in terms of the self) and social esteem were revealed. These individuals were categorized into three groups: transgender individuals (pre-sex reassignment surgery), transsexuals (under hormone therapy), and transsexuals (post-sex reassignment surgery). The findings indicate that social dignity in relation to transgender individuals is a critical issue. More than other social groups, transgender individuals are under a higher level of mental stress pertaining to role conflict, disappointment in romantic relationships, high risk of suicide, being discriminated against, based on sexual orientation, and physical, verbal and sexual abuse. The interviews also introduced exclusion and the inability to adapt/adjust in socially professional situations, as the leading context condition losing social dignity in all three groups. These difficulties have also been noticed in post-surgical transsexuals, especially from those that have undergone male to female sex reassignment surgeries. These findings support the rights of sexual minorities and more specifically transgender individuals in the Civil Rights Charter which has recently been submitted to the Iranian parliament. Moreover, the establishment of transgender health training centers is proposed in order to complete the medical process of sex reassignment and to facilitate appropriate behavioral adjustment to the reassigned sex, especially for male to female sex reassignment transgender individuals.

AB Self-inflicted burns (SIB) are responsible for 2-6% of admissions to Burn Units in Europe and North America, and for as many as 25% of admissions in developing nations. Recently, a promising new tool was proposed to stratify SIB patients in the following subgroups: "typical", "delirious", and "reactive". However, as far as the authors know, the clinical usefulness of this instrument has not yet been validated by others.
   We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 56 patients admitted to our Burn Unit with the diagnosis of SIB injury in the past 14 years. The following parameters were evaluated: demographic features; psychiatric illness; substance abuse; mechanism of injury; burn depth, total body surface area (TBSA) involved, Abbreviated Burn Severity Index (ABSI); length of hospital stay, and mortality. All patients were followed up by a psychologist and a psychiatrist, and were classified according to the SIB-Typology Tool, into three classes: "typical", "delirious" and "reactive".
   There was a slight predominance of the "typical" type (44.6%), followed by the "delirious" type (30.4%), and, finally the "reactive" type (25.0%). Mortality was significantly higher in the "typical" subgroup. In conclusion, the SIB-Typology Tool appears to be a valuable instrument in the clinical management of SIB patients.

DE Disability; healthcare system; global burden of diseases (GBD); Iran;

AB Background: Drawing on the results of the country-level Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 2010 Study, we attempted to investigate the drivers of change in the healthcare system in terms of mortality and morbidity due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors for the two decades from 1990 to 2010.
   Methods: We decomposed trends in mortality, cause of death, years of life lost due to disability, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), life expectancy, health-adjusted life expectancy, and risk factors into the contribution of total increase in population size, aging of the population, and changes in age-specific and sex-specific rates.
   Results: We observed a decrease in age-specific mortality rate for both sexes, with a higher rate for women. The ranking of causes of death and their corresponding number of years of life lost remained unchanged between 1990 and 2010. However, the percentages of change indicate patterns of reduction for most causes, such as ischennic and hemorrhagic stroke, hypertensive heart disease, stomach cancer, lower respiratory infections, and congenital anomalies. The number of years lost due to disability caused by diabetes and drug use disorders has significantly increased in the last two decades. Major causes of DALYs, such as injuries, interpersonal violence, and suicide, showed increasing trends, while rates of communicable diseases, neonatal disorders, and nutritional deficiencies have declined significantly. Life expectancy and health-adjusted life expectancy increased for both sexes by approximately 7 years, with the highest rate of increase pertaining to females over the age 30.
   Conclusions: Time trend information presented in this paper can be used to evaluate problems and policies specific to medical conditions or risk factors. Despite recent improvements, implementing policies to reduce the number of deaths and years of life lost due to road traffic injury remains the highest priority for Iranian policymakers. Immediate action by Iranian researchers is required to match Iran's decreasing mortality rate due to liver and stomach cancers to a rate comparable to the global level. Prevention and treatment plans for mental disorders, such as major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and particularly drug use disorders, should be considered in reforms of the health, education, and judiciary systems in Iran.

AB Self-inflicted burns are among the most devastating of all burn injuries with serious physical, psychological, and financial effects on the individual, the patient's family, and society. This study was carried out to analyze the epidemiology, mortality, and current etiological factors of burn patients who were admitted to a major burn center in the Fars province. In a longitudinal prospective design, from April 2003 to March 2005, all burn patients that were admitted to Ghotb-eddin Shirazi Hospital were evaluated. Data in regard to patients' social demographics, burn injury, and outcome measures were collected. Suicide attempts by burning accounted for 231 (24.8%) of all burn patients admitted to hospital. Suicidal burns occurred predominantly in the age group 15 to 24 years (49.1%). Most (71.4%) self-burning cases were female. Deliberate self-burn patients have significantly larger burned body surface area than accidental burn patients [70% (4-100) vs 28% (1-100); P < .0001]. The case fatality rate for self-inflicted burns (62.3%) was significantly higher than the 27.7% rate observed for accidental burns (P < .0001). Burned body surface area >40% and self-inflicted burns strongly and independently predicted mortality. Self-inflicted burns continue to be a major health problem in this region. Special burn preventive programs should be implemented in primary health care system. A National Committee for Injury and Burn Prevention and Control should be established urgently to coordinate all burn prevention programs and collaborate between different sectors of the society.

TI Respiratory failure in organophosphate insecticide poisoning
SO SAUDI MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT; INTOXICATION; PESTICIDES
AB Objectives: Organophosphate compounds (OP) are usual insecticides and may poison human beings in a suicide attempt or accidental exposure. They inhibit activity of cholinesterase. Poisoning may be enough sever for intensive care support. In this paper, we study the prevalence and management of sever cases as well.
   Methods: We studied patients with OP poisoning, from November 2002 to November 2005 in Sina Hospital, Tabriz, Iran, retrospectively and found patients who needed intensive care. During 4 years study, we documented 80 patients who were hospitalized due to OP poisoning and used drugs. Treatment with intravenous atropine and pralidoxime was started as soon as possible. We did not administer pralidoxim for 20 patients due to late admission (5 patients) and unavailability of the medicine (15 patients).
   Results: Forty-five male and 35 female patients were enrolled in our study. The majority of the patients used OP for suicide attempt and 4 patients had accidental exposure. The mortality rate was 18% in patients who were treated with pralidoxim and patients without pralidoxim had a mortality rate of 21%. Ten patients were mechanically ventilated and the mortality rate was 50%. In patients without MV the mortality rate was 11.7%. The duration of intensive care stay was 7.1 +/- 2 days.
   Conclusion: Organophosphate compounds poisoning is a serious and lethal condition and needs early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. In patients with respiratory failure the mortality is very high; therefore we recommended early diagnosis, careful monitoring and appropriate management of complications in reducing the mortality rate.

AB PURPOSE: The aim of the study is to obtain more insight into the possible association between consanguinity and the incidence of deliberate self-burning.
   METHODS: Data were obtained by analysis of medical records of patients hospitalized in two referral burn centers: Chormy Burn Center (Bushehr Province, south of Iran) from March 21, 1998, through March 20, 2004, and Shahid Sadoqi Center of Burns and Injuries (Yazd Province, center of Iran) from March 21, 2000, through March 20, 2004.
   RESULTS: The incidence of suicidal burns was 6.51 and 2.32/100,000 person-years for Bushehr and Yazd Provinces, respectively. The observed sex ratio of patients in both centers indicated there was a female predominance in patients with self-inflicted burns. Using patients' home addresses, patients were sorted into 16 cities. The incidence of suicide by self-burning ranged from 0.80 (for Tabas, located in Yazd Province) to 12.60/100,000 person-years (for Dilam, located in Bushehr Province). The coefficient of inbreeding defines the probability that an individual received both alleles of a pair from an identical ancestral source. There was a significant correlation between incidences of suicidal burns and mean coefficient of inbreeding (r = 0.782, df = 14, P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSION: In addition to other factors, consanguineous marriage may be a risk factor that influences the incidence of suicidal burns in a population.

ID DEPRESSION
AB Introduction: Buprenorphine is used to treat opioid use disorder and pain syndromes. This drug may be a suitable treatment choice for refractory depression, anxiety, self-injurious behaviors, and suicidal ideation. However, it has a significant abuse potential, which limits its use in suicidal patients with a history of substance abuse.
   Case Report: In this report, we present a case of chronic suicidal ideation due to substance-induced depressive disorder in a 25-year old man from Noorabad, Fars, Iran. The patient was successfully treated with an 8-mg single dose of sublingual buprenorphine with minimal probability of diversion or misuse. We observed that 8 mg of buprenorphine exerted a rapid effect on the reduction and cessation of suicidal thoughts and depression.
   Conclusions: We demonstrated the antisuicidal effectiveness of a single dose of buprenorphine, which can be administered with minimum risk of diversion or misuse for suicidal patients with a history of substance abuse.

The global severity index (GSI) was compared with the cutoff point of Iranian general population (0.4). About (32.9%, n = 96) had a positive history of previous psychiatric problems. Additional war-related injuries was observed in (89.4%, n = 261). The mean GSI (1.74 +/- 0.74) significantly was higher compared to standardized Iranian cutoff point (p<50.05). The highest means were observed for somatization (2.36 +/- 0.74), obsessive-compulsive (1.94 +/- 0.85), anxiety (1.87 +/- 0.94) and depression (1.8 +/- 0.88). Life satisfaction, hospitalization, previous psychiatric disorders and comorbidity were the most predictive variables for poor mental health (p<50.05).

AB Background: Despite the growing epidemic of problematic Internet use (PIU), little information is available on PIU and related factors in Iran.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 4261 university students among 13 universities throughout the country in 2017. The data collection tool included demographic characteristics, the status of using the Internet, social media, computer games, tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs, suicide ideation and attempt, and unprotected sex. PIU was measured using the 15-item PIU questionnaire. The status of general health was evaluated using the 28-item general health questionnaire (GHQ) questionnaire. The simple and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to measure the crude and adjusted associations between various factors and PIU.
   Results: Of 4261 university students, 55.9% were female, 13.5% were smokers, 4.9% were drug abusers, 7.9% were alcohol abusers, 7.8% had unprotected sex in the past year, 7.4% had suicidal ideation in the past month, 1.7% had attempted suicide in the past year, and 27.3% suffered from PIU. Only 61.1% had normal health. In contrast, 30.9%, 7.2%, and 0.8% had mild, moderate, and severe general health problems, respectively. There were significant relationships between PIU and age group 20-24 vs. < 20 years (odds ratio [OR] = 1.39; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.82), single vs, married (OR = 2.57; 95% CI: 1.85, 3.57), suicidal attempt (OR = 2.77; 95% CI: 1.47, 5.19), using online games (OR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.60), and poor general health (OR = 12.14; 95% CI: 4.53, 32.54).
   Conclusion: Nearly one-third of medical sciences students suffered from PIU. This unhealthy behavior was associated with poor general health and elevated risk of suicidal behaviors. This health-threatening behavior provides an early warning signal that deserves special attention, otherwise, it may threaten both college students' health and function.

AB Objective: Substance abuse is a serious and major public health problem in Iran and potentially increases the risk of suicidal behavior; therefore, it is essential to increase our knowledge concerning the etiology of suicide among individuals with substance use disorders. The present study sought to examine the associations among hardiness, spirituality, and suicidal ideation in Iranian individuals with substance abuse. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2012, and participants comprised 450 individuals seeking substance abuse treatment at 10 addiction treatment centers in Tehran, Iran. All data were collected via self-report questionnaires. Results: Sixty-seven percent of participants were male, 47% were married, and 59% were working. Structural equation modeling (SEM) suggested that, as expected, spirituality and hardiness were positively associated with each other. Findings also showed that spirituality and hardiness were negatively associated with suicidal ideation among this group of individuals with substance abuse, explaining 46% of the variance in suicidal ideation. That is, those with low levels of spirituality and low levels of hardiness were more likely to report suicidal ideation. There was a moderating effect of gender, such that greater hardiness predicted a lower likelihood of suicidal ideation for males but not for females. Conclusions: These findings reinforce the importance of spirituality and hardiness as protective factors against suicidal ideation in individuals with substance abuse, as well as the particular role of hardiness for men.

AB Introduction:The aim of this study was to answer the question as to how demographic characteristics and the history of high-risk behavior play a role for therapists to select the method of maintenance treatment or how other factors have been important in this selection.Methods:This cross-sectional study was conducted during the period 2015 to 2016 in maintenance treatment clinics in the North Khorasan province (North East of Iran). Besides demographic data, the studied variables include the type of drugs, duration of usage, age of first use, the type of maintenance therapy, and the presence or absence of lifetime risk behaviors (eg, injection, unsafe sex, prison history, and history of suicide attempt).Results:A total of 7342 patients from 79 centers were admitted to participate in this study. In all, 82.17% of the participants were male individuals, and 17.82% were female individuals. Opium and opium sap (88.53%) and heroin or crack (11.46%) were the most commonly used drugs among the studied subjects. The type of substance, demographic characteristics, and the history of high-risk behaviors (except for injection) showed significant differences in the treatment method with methadone, buprenorphine, and opium tincture.Conclusions:It seems that the selection made by Iranian therapists to enter the patients into maintenance treatments was based on the wrong criteria, and there was a financial relationship between the patients and the therapists in the centers being effective in selecting the type of treatment. This issue can greatly affect harm reduction policies in the maintenance treatment centers.

AB Background: The goal of this study was to determine hazard rate of death rate and the causes of death in Iranian patients with Traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI).
   Methods: Overall, 1024 patients with chronic traumatic spinal cord injury referred to Brain and Spinal Injury Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran from Jan 2013-2017 were enrolled. Epidemiological and neurological data, along with secondary complications were recorded for all participants. In the case of death, the cause, and the date of death were recorded. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis. A log-rank test was carried out to compare survival due to different risk factors. Risk factors and relative risk estimates associated with death were assessed by means of a Cox regression model.
   Results: Nineteen percent were lost to follow up. During the follow-up period, 22 out of 830 remaining cases (2.6%) died. Deaths were only observed in patients with cervical injuries (59% in C1-C4 level and 41% in C5-C7 level). Kaplan-Meier Log-rank test showed that probability of survival was significantly less in females, complete injury cases, patients with cervical spine injury, depression, and ADR (Autonomic dysreflexia). Controlling for age, sex and education level, Cox regression model showed that hazard rate of death was significantly affected by the categorical variables such as level of injury (HR=0.2, 95% CI=0.12-0.39), severe ADR.
   Conclusion: Probability of survival is lower in female individuals, cases with complete injuries, patients with cervical spine injury, individuals wi-th depression (BDI>10), and clients who experience ADR.

DE aluminum phosphide; fatal poisoning; methemoglobinemia; phosphine;
   suicide; poisoning
AB Introduction. Acute aluminum phosphide (AlP) poisoning is one of the most common causes of acute pesticide poisoning in Iran. Hydrogen phosphide or phosphine gas is produced following reaction of AlP with water even at ambient humidity. Methemoglobinemia is a rare finding following phosphine poisoning. In this paper, two cases of fatal AlP poisoning complicated by methemoglobinemia are reported. Case Report. Two patients presented following suicidal ingestion of AlP tablets. In the Emergency Department (ED), they received gastric lavage with sodium bicarbonate and potassium permanganate. Both of them received supportive care. In each case, hematuria and hemolysis were significant events. The patients also showed a decrease in O-2 saturation in spite of high FIO2. Methemoglobin levels of 40% and 30% were detected by co-oximetry. Neither patient responded to treatment (ascorbic acid in one case, methylene blue in the other). Both patients died due to systemic effects of phosphine poisoning. Discussion and conclusion. Hemolysis and methemoglobinemia may complicate the course of phosphine poisoning that seems resistant to methylene blue and ascorbic acid. Therefore, other treatments including hyperbaric oxygen therapy and exchange blood transfusion should be considered.

AB This study describes the epidemiology and patterns of moderate to severe burn injuries (%BSA >= 20-90) treated at the Italian Red Cross Hospital in Baghdad, Iraq, during the medical mission of the tenth Italian Red Cross Contingent, from 3 April to 19 May 2004. Burn injuries sustained by members of the civilian population admitted to the Burns Unit, irrespective of age and sex, are analysed (n = 48). Differences in risk distribution between different segments of the population are reported and typical injury patterns are identified. The six injury patterns identified are labelled "child scaldings", "domestic accidents", "unsafe working conditions", "suicide attempts", "injuries among children in role-play" and "war related injuries". The results show that burn injury incidence is particularly high for women and children. There is a pronounced difference between genders after adulthood (age 15 and up). The mortality rate is higher in females. Most of the burns occurred in the home: a public health education campaign might help reduce the incidence of these injuries. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

AB Introduction: Aluminum phosphide (ALP), as an effective pesticide and a substance used for protecting rice during storage, has become one of the commonest causes of poisoning and even suicide in developing countries including Iran and India. The authors aimed to study the efficacy of sweet almond oil as an antidote in ALP toxicity. Methods: The present experimental study was conducted over 35 rats. The animals were divided into four groups: one group as the control group and three other groups which received ALP alone or ALP and sweet almond oil with different time intervals. In addition to estimating the survival rate of the animals, plasma cholinesterase activity as a possible factor affected in ALP poisoning was evaluated. Results: Treatment by intragastric irrigation of sweet almond oil resulted in significant reduction of mortality. Moreover, mean plasma cholinesterase levels were inhibited in groups receiving ALP. Conclusion: Oral sweet almond oil, if especially used immediately after poisoning with ALP, improves the survival rate.

LA English
DT Article
DE Self-mutilation; Insurance fraud; Legal medicine; Fars; Iran
ID PATTERN
AB Self-mutilation means direct and deliberate destruction of one's own body tissue without intending suicide. Some of the forensic referrals are the fraudulent persons who wish to obtain insurance benefits by simulating self-induced harms as injuries due to accidents. In this article we report five cases of self-mutilation for the purpose of obtaining insurance payments. These cases were interesting because of the following reasons: (1) Fracture of the tibia bone for the purpose of obtaining insurance payments is extremely rare. To our knowledge, the specialised literature does not present a similar case study as we described here. (2) In the cases we describe here, nobody had prior history of social and psychiatric problems and violence. In addition, on examination, no sign of previous scars was found in the whole body skin. (3) Self-mutilation injuries are often painless, parallel and delicate lines which are most frequently in the upper limb opposite to the dominant hand and in the areas that can be easily reached. In one of our cases, self-mutilation of the leg shin and the dominant hand were on the same side of the body. (4) In our study, all of the cases had high school education and were from small counties. Four patients were within the age range of 20-30 years, living in a populous family (six-member family) and of middle socioeconomic status. These results are consistent with previously available data for self-mutilation in Iran. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide is a serious and growing public health problem and remains an unnecessary cause of death globally. In Iran, the highest prevalence of acute and chronic suicidal ideation is among young people aged 16-24. This study investigates the relationship between coping style, two types of perfectionism, and suicidal ideation among undergraduates, and examines coping style as a moderator of the relationship between perfectionism and suicidal ideation. Multi-stage cluster random sampling was employed to recruit 547 undergraduate students aged 19-24 years from the Islamic Azad University of Karaj. Structural Equation Modelling indicated that suicidal ideation was negatively associated with adaptive perfectionism and task-focused coping but positively associated with emotion-focused coping, avoidance coping, and maladaptive perfectionism. Coping style (including the three styles of task-focused, emotion-focused, and avoidance coping) was found to moderate the relationship between perfectionism and suicidal ideation. The study advances understanding of the importance of coping style in this context and explains how perfectionism affects suicidal ideation.

AB Background: Patient's safety is the foundation of health qualified to care, which in the inpatient psychiatric wards, is a different but important and challenging issue.
   Objectives: This study focused on nurses' opinions and experiences about patient safety in inpatient psychiatric wards.
   Methods: This was a qualitative study based on conventional content analysis and inductive method. Thus, 19 psychiatric nurses were selected from three hospitals using purposive sampling. Data were collected using in-depth semi-structured interviews.
   Results: Analysis of the data revealed the main theme "intelligent care and protection from risk creators" and two themes including 'vigilant care' and 'close observing' with eight related categories.
   Conclusions: This study adds a unique insight into patient safety in acute psychiatric wards. The findings suggest that the nurse should take vigilant care and be sensitive to any change in behavior and suspicious behaviors of patients. Continuous observation and objective observation, specific and appropriate intervention, and curious attention are essential. Safety access should be closely monitored.

AB Importance: No national information is available on the epidemiology of psychiatric disorders in Iran for the last decade.
   Objectives: To estimate the 12-month prevalence of the diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) psychiatric disorders in Iranian population, and to investigate the severity and correlates of psychiatric disorders.
   Design, setting and participants: The Iranian Mental Health Survey (IranMHS) was a nationally representative face-to-face household Survey with a multistage cluster Sampling design that was carried out in 2011. A total of 7886 community dwelling residents aged 15-64 were recruited.
   Main outcome measures: 12-month diagnoses of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders including mood, anxiety; and substance use disorders Were assessed using a validated Persian translation of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI; version 2.1). The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM/IV Axis I disorders (SCID-I) Was administered by a psychiatrist on subjects screened positive for the presence of a psychotic disorder. The severity of psychiatric disorders Was determined using criteria that included markers for disability, particular diagnoses and suicide attempts.
   Results: The response rate was 86.2%. The 12-month weighted prevalende,of any psychiatric disorder was 23.6%[95% confidence interval (Cl): 22.4-24.8] with 26.5% of women and 20.8% of men having one or more psychiatric disorders. The most common category Of psychiatric=disorders was any-anxiety disorder (15.6%) and the most prevalent particular disorder was major depressive disorder (12.7%), followed by generalized anxiety disorder (5.2%) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (5.1%). A 12-month psychotic disorder was observed in 0.5% of the population (95% 01: 0.33-0.66). Almost two-thirds (63.8%) of individuals with a mental disorder had moderate or serious illness. Unemployment, being widowed/divorced and urban living were associated with a greater likelihood of 12-month disorders; while, higher socioeconomic status and having a university degree were associated with a lower likelihood.
   Conclusion: the high prevalence of psychiatric disorders, particularly Major depression, merits further attention in the country's mental health policy and program-planning.

ID USERS; OVERDOSE; HEROIN
AB Background: The present study aimed to evaluate the epidemiology of mortality due to substance abuse to provide useful information for local, national, and international administrators.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in 12 months from March 2016 to February 2017. The study population was a random sample of people who died from substance abuse. Data were collected by checklists which were designed according to the study objectives. The obtained data were analyzed in Stata software.
   Results: Our findings show that the mortality rate for illicit opiate users was 40.90 per 1000000 population. Most deaths occurred among people aged 30 to 39 years (25%), single (46.75%) with low education levels. Kermanshah, Lorestan, and Alborz provinces had the highest mortality rate. History of overdose, suicide, hospitalization in psychiatric in hospital and incarceration was observed in some people who died from substance abuse.
   Conclusion: A large number of deaths from drug abuse occurred in unmarried, self-employed, young males 30 to 39 years old with low education levels. We suggest that training programs and harm reduction approaches be focused in these high risk groups.

TI The Martyrs' Revolutions: The Role of Martyrs in the Arab Spring
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID SUICIDE; MEDIA
AB This article examines popular representations of modern martyrs in the Arab world, comparing national models of martyrdom representations prior to the Arab Spring, namely those from Iran, Palestine and Hizbullah in Lebanon, to portrayals of martyrs during and after the Arab Spring. It argues that the Arab Spring brought forth a new model for the martyr in the Arab world, which (a) moves the production of martyrs' images from the state to the citizen; (b) personalises portrayals of martyrs through stories of their personal lives; and, (c) transitions from portrayals of victimisation to empowerment and agency. In the Arab Spring model, the martyr is both a symbol and narrative framework used to galvanise opposition to state regimes. Unlike the pre-Arab Spring models, which portrayed the martyr's death as an honourable sacrifice for the larger national or religious community, the Arab Spring martyr is portrayed as a needless victim in the fight for the universal values of dignity and human rights, as both a product and producer of meaning associated with agency. As the meaning of the 'martyr' continues to evolve in the post-Arab Spring era, it has come to represent the power of the people more broadly.

AB The aim of this study was to explore nurses' use of vigilance in the provision of inpatient psychiatric care. In this qualitative exploratory descriptive design study, 16 nurses working in inpatient psychiatric units were recruited through purposive sampling. Data were collected by semi-structured interviews and fieldwork observations and analysed using conventional content analysis. According to participants, nurses' vigilance is related to synthesising knowledge, experience, communication, and presence. This conclusion was derived from four main themes: understanding the context of the psychiatric ward; continuous monitoring; cognitive assessments; and involving others. The study highlights the significance of education for all mental health staff and provision of appropriate information to all patients and their companions about psychiatric disorders and the side effects of prescribed medications. Of importance is the skill of active listening to the concerns of patients and the demonstration of commitment by nurses to follow-up on reports from stakeholders. Imparting the skills and experiences of senior nurses to novice nurses and their presence alongside other nurses on work-shifts can be effective in promoting vigilance.

AB A 9-year prospective study of burns in pregnant women hospitalized at the Sina hospital burn center was conducted to determine the etiology and outcome of pregnant patients. Fifty-one patients (27.45% self-inflicted, 72.55% unintentional) were identified and stratified by age, burn size, presence or absence of inhalation injury, trimester of pregnancy, maternal and fetal mortality, and cause of burn. The mean patient age was 24.2 years. There were 20 maternal deaths and 23 fetal deaths. The majority of which (maternal: 13 and fetal: 13) were among self-inflicted burned pregnant women. The mean burn size was 37.7%, and was significantly larger for nonsurvivors of mother than survivors (68.8% versus 17.6%; p < 0.001). In the 51 pregnant women, as the total burned body surface area exceeds 40%, both maternal and fetal mortality reaches 100%. Inhalation injuries were strongly associated with large burns, and were presents in all suicide patients. Kerosene ignition (68.6% of all patients, 100% of self-inflicted patients) was the most common type of burn. Large burn size was the strongest predictor of mortality of mother and fetus followed by the presence of inhalation injury. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB Background and objectives: Sedentary behavior and physical inactivity are known risk factors for poor health and increased mortality in patients with severe mental illness. Identifying the barriers to participation in leisure-time physical activities among these patients can be helpful in planning effective interventions aimed at increasing activity level. Prior to the present study, the barriers experienced by female patients in Iran were unknown.
   Materials and methods: This was a qualitative study using conventional content analysis. Participants were 32 women with severe mental illness who were hospitalized at women's psychiatric wards of Farabi Teaching Hospital in Kermanshah, Iran, from September 2015 to March 2016. Data were collected through four focus group discussion sessions and were then analyzed.
   Results: Participants had a mean age of 42 (SD = 7.8) and an active diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder (n = 10), schizophrenia (n = 8), a chronic bipolar disorder (n = 8), or major depression disorder (n = 6). Two main barrier categories emerged: Personal experience of disease and Non-supportive context. Within the former, stigma of disease, signs and symptoms of disease, and medication side effects were the constituent subcategories. Non-supportive context subcategories consisted of family, cultural, environmental, and medical staff barriers that influenced non-participation in leisure-time physical activities.
   Conclusion: Iranian women with severe mental illness face a number of barriers to participation in leisure-time physical activities including the stigma, symptoms, and treatment of mental illness; and contextual barriers such as family expectations, societal perceptions, environmental factors, and lack of medical staff support.

AB Non-suicidal self-harm includes cutting, scratching, burning and minor overdosing. There have been few studies that have examined the rate and pattern of self-harm among different individuals of the society. We performed a population-based study to determine different aspects of non-suicidal self-harm in cases referred to legal medicine organization of Fars Province and south Iran. In a population-based longitudinal survey, we applied data from cases referred to legal medicine organization of Fars province. The survey included questions about the history, method, frequency, age of onset and help-seeking for non-suicidal self-harm. The data about non-suicidal self-harm were collected since 2007 to 2011 and analyzed using students' T-test for continuous data and chi(2) for binary or categorical data using SPSS ver. 21.0. Totally 2166 individuals were diagnosed who had ever harmed themselves. Self-injuries such as cutting, scratching and self-hitting were the most common forms of non-suicidal self-harm (83.2%). The mean age of onset was 25.7 +/- 2.6 years. Self-injury was more frequent in males and individuals with lower education levels mostly unemployed. The most frequent injury site was posterior side of the body for example shoulders (157; 9.8%) and the most type of the injury was bruise in 398(55.26%) cases. Hard objects (1197; 55.26%) were the most used devices for self-injury followed by cutting and sharp devices. Among those who reported non-suicidal self-harm, 56% had sought help while self-injury. We found a high prevalence of non-suicidal self-harm in different individuals of the society in Fars province since 2007 to 2011. Many mental-health symptoms as well as legal and financial gains should be evaluated for any association with this behavior. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

AB Every year a substantial proportion of deaths in India occur due to burn injuries. Prolonged morbidity as well as temporary and permanent disability due to burns results in a heavy economic loss. The etiological factors of burn injuries vary considerably in different communities and regions and hence the need for detailed epidemiological studies to understand the problem status in different regions. This study was aimed to study the sociodemographic profile of burn patients and to evaluate the causes, manner, and place of occurrence of burns injuries along with its outcome. A registry-based retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in coastal South India, and the medical records of all the patients admitted to the burns centre during the year 2009 were reviewed. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 11.5. A total of 101 burn patients were admitted during the study period. The burn patients were aged between 4 months and 80 years with a mean age of 32.11 (+/- 3.46) years. The overall male to female ratio was 0.83:1. Majority of the patients were Hindus and were married. Flame burns were the most common etiology for sustaining burns (82.2%). Most of the burn injuries were sustained at home (n = 81, 80.2%), and the manner was designated as accidental in 79.2% of the cases. The TBSA involvement in burns ranged from 5 to 100% and the mean TBSA was found to be 45.8 +/- 24.7%. A higher TBSA involvement is associated with an increased risk of mortality and this association between TBSA and mortality was found to be statistically significant (P < .05). Mortality rate in our study was 40.9%. Septicemia (n = 24, 63.2%) was the most common cause of death followed by shock (n = 12, 31.6%). Higher mortality is found to be associated with female sex, suicides, and flame burns. This study identifies the epidemiological and clinical features associated with burn injuries in coastal South India. Majority of the burn victims in our study were married females of younger age group. Although the manner of sustaining burns was mostly accidental, females were proportionately more commonly the victims of suicides and homicides than males. Injuries and deaths due to burns are preventable, provided a community-specific preventive program is implemented with a strong educational component. (J Burn Care Res 2012;33:660-667)

ID INTOXICATION; OVERDOSE
AB Background: Rate of tramadol poisoning and seizure and its complications is high in Iran. We investigated the occurrence and recurrence of tramadol-induced seizures and related factors in patients with tramadol poisoning.
   Methods: This was a descriptive longitudinal study conducted in a poisoning referral hospital in Tehran, Iran. During April to June 2017, adult patients (>= 16 years) with tramadol ingestion and poisoning admitted to hospital were selected by convenience sampling method. We studied the rate of seizure occurrence and recurrence among them. Also, the association between seizure occurrence and recurrence and patients' demographic characteristics and poisoning-related factors were investigated. Data were analyzed by SPSS 16 and significant level was set at <0.05.
   Results: In total, 250 patients participated in the study. Their mean age was 26.39 years and 214 (85.6%) of them were male. Of all, 159 (63.6%) were single, 106 (42.4%) were unemployed and 24 (9.6%) were students. Main reason of tramadol consumption was suicide. Co-administration of drugs was reported in 83 (33.2%) cases. Incidence of seizure occurrence and recurrence were 31% and 38.5%, respectively. There was no statistically significant relationship between the occurrence and recurrence of seizures and patients' age, gender, marital status, occupation, reason for tramadol consumption, co-administration of drugs and naloxone administration. Probability of seizure occurrence and recurrence raised with increased tramadol dose (P<0.001 and P<0.01, respectively). Seizure recurrence led to longer hospital stay (P<0.001).
   Conclusion: Rate of the occurrence and recurrence of tramadol-induced seizure seems clinically significant, but the prognosis is generally good in cases with seizure. Greater ingested dose and late hospital admission were associated with higher probability of seizure occurrence and recurrence. Further studies are required to investigate the risk factors of tramadol-induced seizure.

DT Article
DE Marjane Satrapi; Poulet aux prunes; cartoon; graphic novel;
   psychoanalytic reading; space; return to the womb
AB In Poulet aux prunes, space contributes considerably to the semantization of Nasser Ali's character. This character is tragic, in vain searching for maternal love. The universe of Nasser Ali includes 3 spaces: the here, the elsewhere, and the hereafter. The here, represented by the maternal body and Iran's homeland, designates the maternal figure. Yet, this land is occupied by another, it is an inaccessible land for our hero. Driven by the here, the protagonist hopes to find a substitute mother figure in the elsewhere, represented by the world of women and the world of music. But he is disappointed because elsewhere gives him only illusory substitute mothers. The tragedy of Nasser Ali is that of space: he finds nowhere his mother; in his quest, everywhere, here as elsewhere, he is perpetually frustrated. In such a situation, there remains only one space: the hereafter, represented by his room, where he locks himself after deciding not to live, and the grave being his last home. For this tragic character, only suicide and death allow him to relive the intrauterine existence and thus to join the maternal body, a space from which he was excluded as long as he lived.

AB Background: Intentional self-inflicted burn injuries are a rare occurrence in the United States, but they represent a considerable portion of all burn injuries in the developing world. Compared to nonintentional burns, patients with intentional self-inflicted burns have increased rates of higher total body surface area involvement and associated complications, including overall mortality. Methods: We present 2 representative cases and review the available literature on the topic of self-inflicted burns. We review epidemiologic, social, and cultural factors of importance, and also provide an overview of most common psychiatric pathologies encountered in patients with self-inflicted burns. Results: The patient demographics and motivation for intentional self-inflicted burn injuries differ considerably across the world. Although self-immolation is commonly associated with women experiencing domestic stress in the developing world, most cases of self-immolation in higher-income countries are males. Psychiatric pathologies, including primary mood and thought disorders and substance use, play a significant component in latter cases, while most patients in the developing world lack any pre morbid psychiatric diagnosis, or carry diagnosis of adjustment disorder. Conclusions: Nonlethal self-burns present a distinct subset of intentional self-burn injuries, often occurring in the context of significant personality pathology, or with potential secondary gain.

AB Introduction: The survey of drug and psychedelic abuse-related deaths in elderly people provides information on the most severe social and psychological consequences of drug abuse and its impact on community health. In contrast, with regard to the ageing population of Iran, along with all age groups who might misuse drugs, elderly people cannot be ignored. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the number of deceased elders whose deaths were caused by complications related to narcotic or psychedelic drug abuse as described by the legal medicine organization of Tehran, Iran, 2013 to 2014. Methods: In this descriptive study, the forensic files of all elderly people (age, 60 y or older) who died because of narcotic or psychedelic drug abuse and were referred to the legal medicine center of Tehran in 2013 and 2014 were investigated. Elders who died because of reasons other than narcotic or psychedelic drug abuse or because of underlying illness were excluded from the study. Data were recorded in a questionnaire containing questions related to demographic status, family status, social status, examinations, autopsy, and laboratory data, of elders. The data were analyzed using SPSS 16 software. Findings: According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, 227 (n=203, 89.4% male) deaths of elderly people because of narcotic or psychedelic drug abuse were investigated. The incidence of drug-related deaths among elderly people was 2.2012 and 1.912 per 100,000 people, during 2013 and 2014, respectively. The incidence of drug-related deaths among elderly women during the years 2013 and 2014 was .3598 and .5179 1.22, respectively. In addition, the incidence of drug-related deaths among elderly men during the years 2013 and 2014 was 4.5096 and 3.3517, respectively. The most common drug used by the elders (126, 55.5%) was opium. The mean age of the elders was 66.9 +/- 7.3 years (60 to 90 y old) and the mean age of onset (first intake) was 40.3 +/- 12.9 years (14 to 85 y old). Most of the deceased elders were from the Tehran (38%), Khorasan Razavi (11%), and Hamedan (9%) provinces of Iran. Half of the deceased elders had their own home (52.9%), and most were married (55%). Few (n=15, 6.6%) of the deceased elders had a history of hospitalization because of mental illness. The highest rate of death was observed in free-occupation (26.9%), retired (14.5%), and unemployed (11%) elders, respectively. Many deceased elders had an education level below the diploma (78, 34.4%) or were illiterate (63, 27.7%). Few (5, 2.2%) of the deceased elders had a history of suicide attempts. More than half (61.7%) of the elderly deceased were autopsied. In 113 (49.8%), poison sampling and in 54 (23.8%), pathology test was performed. Conclusions: It can be argued that factors such as low level of education, male gender, habitation in a big city, free occupation, retirement or unemployment can contribute to an individual's inclination to become addicted to narcotic or psychedelic drug abuse in aging (in the elderly), and these factors may be used to identify the elderly people at risk of drug addiction. Low prices and the fast availability of opium in Iran and some misconceptions about opium among Iranian people, may lead to its prevalent consumption among the elders. Increasing awareness in the elderly about the adverse effects of narcotic or psychedelic drug abuse can reduce their willingness to consuming drugs. Family support and psychological services, as well as medical and rehabilitation services for the elderly, can also be helpful in this regard.

TI Burn Injuries During Pregnancy in Iran
SO OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB The mortality rate is high for pregnant burn victims and their fetuses. This retrospective study assessed the maternal and fetal outcome of burn injuries in pregnant women treated at a burn center in Iran between 2001 and 2007. The investigators stratified the patients by maternal age, level of education, marital status, percentage of the total body surface area (TBSA) burned, presence or absence of inhalation injury, cause of burn, trimester of pregnancy in which the burn occurred, and whether the burn was intentional (suicidal).
   Of the 4090 women treated during the study period, 53 (1.3%) were pregnant at the time of admission. The mean age of the pregnant women was 22.9 +/- 5.3 years; over 90% were younger than 30 years. Among the 40 pregnant women with inhalation injuries, there were 27 maternal deaths (67.5%) and 28 fetal deaths (70%), which was significantly higher than among those without inhalation injury (7.7% maternal deaths and 15.4% fetal deaths, P = 0.001 for both). The mean percentages of TBSA burned were significantly higher in women and fetuses who died than in survivors (P < 0.001 for both). The burn was intentional in 18 (34%) of the 53 pregnant women. No significant difference was found in the rate of inhalation injury between women with and without intentional burns. When the burn injury was the result of suicidal intent, the mean percentage of TBSA burned was significantly higher (66.5% +/- 23.8% in suicidal patients versus 45.3% +/- 26.3% in nonsuicidal patients) (P = 0.006), and the maternal and fetal mortality rates were higher (83.3% vs. 37.1%, P = 0.001 and 83.3% vs. 42.9% P = 0.005, respectively). There was no correlation between suicide attempts and pregnancy trimester.
   The data show that maternal and fetal mortality rates are higher for burned women who are pregnant compared to nonpregnant women. The investigators conclude from these findings that inhalation injury, a higher percentage of TBSA burned, and suicidal intent are poor prognostic factors for pregnant women with burn injuries.

AB Objectives: To determine the degree to which the Safe Community (SC) model is effective in reducing injuries. Although positive results have been reported for some communities in developed countries, there is no consistent relationship between being an international designated SC and subsequent changes in observed rate of injury, and no controlled studies have examined the effectiveness of the SC model in developing countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the injuries in the SC programme of Kashmar (population 149,358) with injuries in counties in Iran that have not applied the SC model.
   Study design: Retrospective study using available data from 20 March 2005 to 19 March 2008.
   Methods: Data were obtained from the Injury Prevention and Safety Promotion Department of the Disaster and Emergency Management Centre of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran. These data are collected upon presentation of injured patients to the emergency room. Different types of injuries are evaluated, including motor vehicle injuries (including pedestrians, passengers, drivers and motorcyclists), falls, blows by an object or a person, violence, burns, scorpion and snake bites, electrocution, animal attack, toxicity, suicide and other causes. A control group was selected from all counties in Iran with a population between 100,000 and 200,000. The mean injury rate of these counties was calculated, and counties which had an injury rate within one standard deviation (SD) of the mean rate for all 3 years of the study were included in the control group (n = 44 counties).
   Results: The mean population of the 44 control counties was 142,123 in 2006. The numbers of injuries per 100,000 population in Kashmar were 4654.6 [95% confidence interval (CI) 4584.3-4762.6], 4570.9 (95% CI 4465.5-4678.0) and 4949.2 (95% CI 4839.7-5060.4) in 2005-2006, 2006-2007 and 2007-2008, respectively. At the same time, the mean numbers of injuries per 100,000 population in the 44 control counties were 822.7 (95% CI 815.6-829.8), 1130.0 (95% CI 1121.7-1138.3) and 1245.5 (95% CI 1236.8-1254.2). The injury-related fatality rate in the emergency room was 57.6, 52.9 and 44.2 per 100,000 population in Kashmar and 12.2, 13.0 and 11.9 per 100,000 population in the control counties in the three study years. Although a comparison of the fatality rate between the first and third years of the study shows a decrease of 13.4 per 100,000 population in Kashmar, this was not significant (P = 0.1056). In the 44 control counties, the injury-related fatality rate decreased by 0.3 per 100,000 population between the first and third years of the study. The difference between the decrease in injury-related fatality rate in Kashmar (13.4 per 100,000 population) and the 44 control counties (0.3 per 100,000 population) was significant (P < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: The controlled evaluation of injury in the international SC of Kashmar showed an increase in the number and rate of injuries in Kashmar and in the 44 control counties over 3 years, but the injury-related fatality rate decreased over the same time period. A greater decrease was seen in Kashmar than in the control counties. Long-term evaluation is necessary to confirm these results. (C) 2010 The Royal Society for Public Health.

AB In a prospective hospital-based cohort study, we addressed the question of severity and outcome of antidepressant poisonings in patients who attended the Loghman-Hakim Hospital Poison Center, the only national center in Tehran dedicated for detoxification. The aim of the study was to find out if tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) intoxications require more therapeutic efforts than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) intoxications. The study was applied over a 7-week period (28 March-20 May 2006). From 3578 intoxications, 334 patients with antidepressant or lithium self-poisoning were identified (9.3% of all poisoning cases; 233 females, 101 males; median age 24 years, min 13, max 70). Compared to SSRI single-substance intoxications (n = 17), TCA single-substance intoxications (n = 73) were associated with: (1) a significantly lower level of consciousness (P = 0.005); (2) a significantly higher admission frequency (80.8 vs. 35.3%; P < 0.001); and (3) a higher intubation frequency (13.7 vs. 0%; P = ns). SSRI multiple-substance intoxications were associated with a significantly lower level of consciousness than SSRI single-substance intoxications (P = 0.042), while there was no significant difference between TCA multiple-and single-substance intoxications. This study suggests that an overdose with SSRIs results in a more favourable clinical outcome than an overdose with TCAs.

AB Enhancing therapeutic relationships between patients and staff is of central importance to improve the quality and safety of care in psychiatric inpatient units. However, there is limited evidence as to how therapeutic relationships may be enabled in this specific context. This paper presents findings of a study that explored the link between therapeutic relationships and safety in Iranian psychiatric inpatient units. In this exploratory, descriptive study, seven patients at the point of discharge and 19 staff in psychiatric inpatient units in Iran were interviewed regarding their experiences of care. The quality of staff-patient relationship in providing a safe environment was categorized into two groups of "facilitators" and "inhibitors". Facilitators of a safe environment included "supportive relationship with patients" and "improving patient capacity for self-efficacy/self-control". Inhibitors, on the other hand, included "detachment from patients" and "domination over patients", which ultimately limited safety on the ward. Findings indicate interrelated environmental, patient and staff factors mediating the potential for therapeutic relationships and quality and safety of care. Findings suggest the need for more effective preparation and support for staff working within psychiatric inpatient settings. In addition, environments more conducive to collaborative recovery-oriented practice are required to enhance therapeutic relationships and improve quality and safety of care. Both individual staff responsibility and effective leadership are required to realize change.

AB Self-immolation is a self-destructive conduct described since antiquity. Its frequency is variable from one country to another and it is a real public health problem in parts of the world. In Tunisia, after the 2011 revolution the problem of self-immolation protest has been highly publicized giving the impression of an increase in this phenomenon. This is a retrospective analysis of all fatal self-immolation cases, collected over a 20-year period (1996-2015) at the Forensic Medicine Department of the Farhat Hached University Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia. A total of 41 cases were collected, of which 23 were men (56%). The mean age was 36.1 years. Prior to 2011, 78.9% of the victims of self-immolation were women and after 2011, 86.4% were men. The rural origin of the victims was found in 56.25% of the cases. History of psychiatric illness was found in four individuals. The self-immolation took place in the victims' homes in 19 cases (46.3%). It came after a conjugal or family conflict in 14 cases (34.1%) and it is of protest character in 8 cases (19.5%). This study confirmed the increasing frequency of self-immolation in Tunisia after the 2011 revolution and noted a change in the victims' profiles.

AB Background: In developing countries with high mortality rates, poisoning is one of the most common causes of admission to emergency rooms. To minimize future deaths related to poisoning, the epidemiological profile of deceased individuals is essential.
   Methods: The medical records of all dead patients due to poisoning during 2011-2014 in Baharloo Hospital, Tehran, were evaluated. Exclusion criteria include: incomplete records, unknown causes of death, and persons less than 6 years of age. Data analysis was done by means of SPSS at the significance level of P < 0.05.
   Results: The study included 184 males and 65 females. The mean age range was 37.65 +/- 16.78 years. The highest mortality rate was seen in the age range of 21-30 years (30.5%). The most common cause of poisoning was aluminum phosphide (101 cases). The average time of hospitalization was 3.61 days. Most deaths occurred during the first 10 days of admission with intentional poisoning being the most common type (81.5%).
   Conclusion: The outcome of this study indicates that the main cause of death among young people is intentional poisoning with AIP. This study proves that a greater focus when diagnosing mental health patients, as well as an increase in restrictions when accessing lethal drugs and toxins, is crucial.

AB Background: Recently, more evidence has been presented regarding the role of behavioral activation/inhibition systems as predictors of substance use disorders. In fact, these systems are regarded as potentially important factors in the development of this complex psychiatric problem.
   Objectives: This study aimed to determine how behavioral activation/inhibition systems, namely behavioral activation, behavioral inhibition, and fight-flight freezing systems, affect substance abuse in bipolar patients.
   Methods: A total of 79 patients with bipolar disorder were selected among hospitalized patients in the psychiatric ward of Kamkar-Arabnia Hospital in Qom, Iran. The participants completed the Gray-Wilson personality questionnaire, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Mood Disorder Questionnaire, and a sociodemographic questionnaire.
   Results: Behavioral activation and behavioral inhibition systems emerged as significant predictors of substance abuse in bipolar patients (chi(2) = 52.511; df = 3; P < 0.0005). Gender and type of bipolar disorder (I or II) showed no significant association with the scores of behavioral activation, behavioral inhibition, or fight-flight freezing systems. Also, the behavioral inhibition system scores could predict manic mood (chi(2) = 7.067; df = 3; P < 0.070).
   Conclusions: The findings of the current study provide further evidence regarding the role of behavioral activation and inhibition systems as predictors of substance abuse in bipolar patients.

AB This instrumental study examined gender differences of school anger components and its prediction for suicidal behavior. The subjects of this study were 1418 high school students selected by stratified random sampling in Shiraz. The self reported Multidimensional School Anger Inventory was used to measure anger within a school context. The subjects reported their suicidal behavior including wish to die, consideration of suicide, suicidal attempt and self injury behavior in the previous six months. Girls experienced anger more than boys and, for the contrary, hostility was higher in boys. However, there was no difference between both genders regarding positive coping expression of anger or destructive coping expression. Hostile Outlook score and destructive expression of anger score were positively related to all types of suicidal behavior. Positive coping strategy for anger was not a predictor of suicidal behavior. The cognitive component of anger does not relate to more healthy expression of anger. The adolescents without suicidal attempt have not reported higher positive coping strategies as a means of managing or expressing angry feelings than suicidal attempters. Negative cognitions, and more hostility towards school are related to lower levels of adjustment. Teaching positive coping strategies for management of anger might not be sufficient for prevention of suicidal behavior.

AB The aim of this study was to analyse intoxications concerning sedative-hypnotic medication patients admitted to the Department of Emergency Medicine in Dokuz Eylul University Hospital (EMDEU) between 1993 and 2005. Demographics of the patients, characteristics of sedative-hypnotic exposures, performed treatment attempts and outcome of the poisoned patients were recorded on standard data forms that were later entered into a computerized database programme. Related to the sedative-hypnotic exposures, 686 poisoning cases were admitted to the EMDEU. Mean age was 10.8 +/- 6.5 years among the paediatric age group (< 17 years old, 169, 24.6%) and 30.3 +/- 12.8 years among the adult group (> 17 years old, 509, 74.2%). The most common sedative-hypnotic agents were benzodiazepines (286, 35.8%), alprazolam accounted for 41.6% of them (119). Most of the patients admitted to EMDEU were asymptomatic (61.7%). Observation alone was recommended in 53.9% of EMDEU cases. Although prescription of benzodiazepines is restricted, benzodiazepine was the most common cause of sedative-hypnotic medication exposures. As only a minority of patients (3%) had clinically serious signs and symptoms, most of the overdoses might be under toxic levels or the decontamination methods might be efficient. In this study, the clinical outcome of the patients is relatively better than previous results described in literature.

AB ObjectivesCurrent regional conflicts are creating a surge in forced migration, and heightened visa restrictions are increasingly being applied. The current study aimed to examine the relationship between visa insecurity and psychological outcomes within a large clinical sample of refugees and people seeking asylum in Australia.MethodsThe sample comprised 781 clients (53.9% male, 16-93years) attending a clinic for trauma survivors. Country of birth was most frequently identified as Afghanistan (18.1%), Iraq (15.3%) and Iran (15.1%). The Hopkins Symptom Checklist was administered at admission.ResultsLatent class analyses identified four groups varying in severity of symptoms, namely very high (16.1%), high (38.1%), moderate (31.5%), and low (14.3%). People with insecure visa status were at least five times more likely to report high (OR=5.86, p<0.001) or very high (OR=5.27, p<0.01) depression and anxiety symptoms than those with permanent residency. Women were almost twice as likely to report high (OR=1.96 p<0.01) or very high (OR=1.96, p<0.05) symptoms.ConclusionsThe findings suggest that temporary visas play a significant role in psychological distress and that timely immigration processing has important implications for health outcomes.

   CHILDREN; UNIT; IRAN; POPULATION; IMMOLATION; SUICIDE
AB Background: Burn injuries remain one of the leading causes of injury morbidity and mortality in the World Health Organization's East Mediterranean Region. To provide an overview on the epidemiology of burn injuries in this region, a systematic review was undertaken.
   Methods: Medline, Embase and CINAHL were searched for publications on burns in this region published between 01/01/1997 and 16/4/2007. Data were extracted to a standard spreadsheet and synthesised using a narrative synthesis. No attempt has been made to quantitatively synthesise the data due to the large degree of clinical heterogeneity between study populations.
   Results: Seventy one studies were included in the review, from 12 countries. Burn injuries were found to be one of the leading causes of injury morbidity and mortality. The reported incidence of burns ranged from 112 to 518 per 100,000 per year. Burn victims were more frequently young and approximately one third of the victims were children aged 0-5 years. Hospital mortality ranged from 5 to 37%, but was commonly above 20%. Intentional selfharm burns particularly involving women were common in some countries of the region and were associated with a very high mortality of up to 79%.
   Conclusion: Burn injuries remain an important public health issue in the East Mediterranean Region therefore further research is required to investigate the problem and assess the effectiveness of intervention programmes.

AB In order to investigate the association between effects of genetic polymorphisms of GSTT1 and GSTM1 and depression score of individuals chronically exposed to natural sour gas containing sulfur compounds, the present cross-sectional study was done. The study was performed on 124 healthy females living in the polluted area of Masjid-i-Sulaiman (MIS; Khozestan province, southwest of Iran). The GSTT1 and GSTM1 genotypes were determined using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method. Depression and hopelessness scores were determined by means of Beck's depression inventory (BDI) and Beck's hopelessness scale (BHS), respectively. The BHS score was positively correlated to the depression score (beta = 0.687, t = 10.474, p < 0.001). The GSTT1 active genotype decreased the BDI score (P = -0.161, t= -2.451, p = 0.016). Polymorphism of GSTM1 may not be a good predictive factor for BDI (beta = -0.056, t= -0.857, p = 0.393). There is no evidence for additive effect of GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms on BDI score. It is supposed that chronic exposure to natural sour gas may positively associated with DNA strand breaks and apoptosis in brain, especially in GSTT1 null genotype persons; finally living in the contaminated areas of MIS is associated with high BDI score.

AB It was aimed to study the prevalence of major depressive disorder, separation anxiety disorder and suicidal behaviour in the children and adolescents with haemophilia. A total of 83 children and adolescents with haemophilia A or B aged 5-19 years old were randomly selected using systematic random sampling method. They were interviewed using the Farsi (Persian) version of Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia by face-to-face interview with the subjects and their primary caregivers, according to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. Major depressive disorder, separation anxiety disorder and suicidal behaviour were surveyed. The rate of major depressive disorder was 6.0%. Approximately 2.4% of the patients were suffering from at least five symptoms of major depression, and 4.8% were suffering from more than five symptoms of major depressive disorder. One-third of the children and adolescents were suffering from irritability. Approximately 36% of the subjects wished to die at least once during the last 6 months. Also, 6% of the subjects had thought about suicidal attempt. Approximately 4.8% of them met the criteria of separation anxiety disorder. The incidences of major depressive disorder and separation anxiety disorder were comparable to that prevalent in the thalassaemic patients. The proportion of patients with death wish was very high. The proportion of patients with suicidal thought and attempt was much lower than that in the children and adolescents with thalassaemia. Therefore, psychiatric consultation needs to be included in the management of these children.

AB Despite considerable advances in medical science, cancer remains to be as one of the most important diseases. Psychological problems of cancer patients affect on the quality of life, suicide rate, long confinement and even their life lengths. As well as the goal of this study was assess the relation between hope and religious beliefs in the cancer patients who refer to chemotherapy center. This study is a descriptive and analytic study in which 220 cancer patients who referred to the chemotherapy and radiotherapy center, through accessible random sampling method were tested. For gathering the data we use demographic particulars questionnaire, Allport religious beliefs questionnaire and the Hope Herth questionnaire. Findings showed that, 78 patients (35.5%) of the total 220 studied patients were in an age group of 51-60 and 14 (6.4%) were 41-50. As for the goal of the research, i.e., determining the relation of religious beliefs and patients' hope, the results of Man-Whitney U test indicated a significant relation, p<0.002. Considering the results of this study as well as other conducted studies, it seems that addressing the effective factors can result in improvement of the relevant nursing cares and will allow the families and nurses to concentrate on important and significant aspects such as religious beliefs.

DT Article
DE Acute poisoning; intentional substance abuse; disability weights;
   medical toxicology; disability-adjusted life year
ID PATTERN; IRAN; MORTALITY; SUICIDE; QALYS
AB Background: Disability weights (DWs) are used in disease burden studies, with the calculation of the weight of the disability as years lived with disability versus years of lost life accounting for mortalities. Currently, there is a single DW score available for poisoning, which is considered to be a single health state. This makes it difficult to evaluate the differing burdens of poisonings involving various substances/conditions in comparison with other health states in countries with different patterns of substance abuse. The aim of this study is therefore to estimate the DWs of 18 common poisonings based on the expert elicitation method.
   Methods: A panel of 10 medical clinicians who were familiar with the clinical aspects of different poisonings estimated the DWs of 50 health states by interpolating them on a calibrated Visual Analogue Scale. The DWs of some poisonings, such as alcohol, cannabis and heroin, had been estimated in previous studies and so were used to determine the external consistency of our panel. As a matter of routine, the DWs could vary on a scale between 0 (best health state) and 1 (worst health state).
   Results: Statistical analysis showed that both the internal (Cronbach's = 0.912) and external consistency of the panel were acceptable. The DWs for the different poisonings were estimated along a range from 0.830 for severe aluminium phosphide to 0.022 for mild benzodiazepine.
   Conclusions: Different poisonings should be weighted differently since they vary widely. Unfortunately, they are currently all weighted the same.

AB BACKGROUND
   Our aim was to evaluate the effective factors on mortality in flame and scald burns in the Diyarbakir region.
   METHODS
   The data of 816 patients who applied to the Dicle University Emergency Department between January 2001 and May 2005 with flame and scald burns were investigated retrospectively. The patients were separated into two groups as alive or deceased. Gender, age, burns shapes, burn degrees and rates, burn regions, admission periods, hospitalization times, complications, and the treatments were analyzed.
   RESULTS
   43.5% of the patients were female and 57.5% were male. Six hundred fifty-eight patients were under 6 years old. 70.5% of burns occurred as a result of negligence; 76.5% occurred due to scald and 23.5% due to flame. In cases of death, 39 patients were under 10 years old. The mean age was 9.32 years. The average hospitalization period was 10.37 days. The most common complication was wound infection. The mortality rate was 6.1%.
   CONCLUSION
   The mortality rate was higher among patients who were hospitalized longer than 15 days (p=0.030); whose burns were due to suicide attempt (p=0.002); who used shoe paint on the burn wounds instead of treatment (p=0.000); who had more than 40% second-degree burns (p=0.000) or more than 20% third-degree burns (p=0.000); and among those with acute respiratory failure, compartment syndrome, hypoalbuminemia, and sepsis (p=0.000).

AB Although many plans for peace in the Middle East have been proposed over the years, none have seriously considered the psychological needs that promote conflict and violence, and thus, far none have been successful. This chapter uses Terror Management Theory, which is a general theory of the role of culture and self-esteem in providing psychological security, to shed light on forces that motivate and perpetuate the ongoing cycle of violence in this region. From this perspective, threats to one's cultural worldviews and self-esteem promote violence because they undermine the ability of these psychological entities to provide the protection from anxiety that is needed for psychological well-being and effective functioning. Consequently, people disparage and lash out at those who threaten their worldviews and self-esteem. Research exploring the role of worldviews and self-esteem in providing security and the impact of threats to this security in promoting violence is reviewed, with special emphasis on the operation of these processes in promoting support for violence against perceived enemies in Israel, Iran, and the United States. This analysis also suggests factors that reduce support for violence; research demonstrating the impact of activating compassionate religious values, a sense of shared humanity, close interpersonal attachments, and removing the association between lofty values and violence is discussed.

AB Opium is a substance extracted from Papaver somniferum L that is chronically abused specially in the traditional production regions. Reports on opium poisoning has largely disappeared from the occidental literature on drug problems but recent scientific articles show cases of death related to opium in industrialized countries. This fact led us to consider the interest of knowing the state of the art of acute opium intoxication in modern times. This work shows a compilation of these uncommon cases occurred in different settings and circumstances. Data were obtained by a computer assisted search of the literature using the key words "opium poisoning", "poppy", "poppy seeds", and "papaver somniferum" in PubMed, accompanied by a hand search of the reference lists of all articles for any relevant studies not included in the database. In addition, Google Scholar, government reports, and cases adequately documented on websites were reviewed.
   Type 1 cases, Accidental opium intoxications when it is used as a recreational drug: Reported cases came mainly from industrialized countries. They were mostly male with a range age of 17-64 years. Many had antecedents of alcoholism or drug abuse and opium tea was used as a substitute of heroin. Rachacha has caused poisonings in France and has been detected in a stash in Spain. Toxicological analysis was documented in forensic cases. The danger of this renewed interest in opium is exemplified in that many of the poisoning cases resulted in fatalities. Type 2 cases, Accidental opium intoxications in children or adults when it used as folk remedy: Pediatric intoxication after the use of opium as folk remedy are mainly published in traditional opium-producing areas with a long history of use or ethnic communities in England or USA. Addiction to opium was common among relatives. Type 3 cases, Opium intoxications with poppy seeds consumed as food: Due to excessive consumption of opium seeds as food, sporadic cases of mild toxicity had been reported and morphine contents were documented. Type 4 cases: Accidental opium intoxications when using the abdominal or pelvic cavity for concealing the drug: Accidental opium body packer intoxications are seen in patients who traveled from illegal opium areas of production. Type 5 cases: Suicides by opium: Opium was a prevalent agent among cases of suicides in Iran but data are scarce. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY
AB Purpose: Paraquat is a contact herbicide which is highly toxic to human. Deliberate self-poisoning with paraquat continues to be a major public health concern in many developing countries. This study aimed to evaluate the data on cases of acute paraquat poisoning and to compare different variables between survivors and nonsurvivors. Methods: In this cross sectional study, medical records of all paraquat intoxicated patients were reviewed at Taleghani hospital of Urmia, Iran, from 2007 to 2013, retrospectively. Demographics, clinical features and laboratory findings were evaluated. The variables compared between survivors and non-survivors were the amount of paraquat ingested, occurrence of vomiting after ingestion, time and place of hospital admission, length of hospital stay, leukocytosis, serum creatinine level and the outcomes. Results: A total of 41 patients were evaluated. The mean +/- standard deviation of patients' age were 31.6 +/- 16.9 years. The Length of hospital stay was 5.75 +/- 4.6 days. Most poisonings occurred in spring and summer. The in-hospital fatality rate was 46.3%. Statistically significant associations were found between the outcome of patients and the amount ingested (P=0.001), vomiting (P=0.004), early need to intensive cares (P=0.009), leukocytosis (P=0.001), serum creatinine levels (P=0.001), manifestations of acute hepatic (P<0.001) and respiratory failure (P=0.007). Conclusion: Ingestion of more than 30 ml, prompt vomiting, early need to intensive cares, leukocytosis, and multi-organ failures are major determinants for fatal outcome of paraquat poisoning. It may be useful to educate health professionals and the general population about the serious consequences of exposure to paraquat.

AB Background: Euthanasia is among the most common and controversial end-of-life care issues. Examining the attitudes of nursing students to this issue is important because they may well encounter these issues during the course of their clinical placements. Research aims: This study aims to examine the attitudes of a sample of Iranian nursing students towards euthanasia. Research design: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study. Participants and research context: Using convenience sampling, 382 Muslim nursing students were enrolled in this study. Methods: Data were collected using a demographic variables checklist and a self-administered questionnaire that included a definition of euthanasia and 11 closed questions that sought to record participants' level of agreement with euthanasia based on a Likert scale. Ethical consideration: Consent for participation was implicit, indicated by the participants having returned the completed questionnaires. Participants were assured that their data would remain anonymous, be kept confidential and be stored safely. Findings: Of the 382 participants, 61.5% were female, and the remainder were male. The mean age was 62.6 +/- 14.1 years (range: 32-91 years). In total, 34.2%, 41.6% and 24% of students reported a negative, neutral and positive attitude to euthanasia, respectively. Most students with clinical experience, and 38.5% of students with no clinical experience, indicated their agreement with active euthanasia. Discussion: There are a number of misconceptions among Iranian Muslim nursing students regarding the definition of euthanasia. Nonetheless, most students exhibit positive attitudes to euthanasia consistent with their clinical experiences. Conclusion: It is recommended to explore the factors that induced nursing students' tendency to euthanasia.

AB Aim: Japanese psychiatrists have increasingly reported patients with depression that does not seem to fit the criteria of the ICD-10 and the DSM-IV, and which has recently been called modern type depression (MTD). We explored whether MTD is frequently seen in Japan and also in other countries, and if so, how patients with MTD are diagnosed and treated.
   Methods: The questionnaires, with two case vignettes (traditional type depression (TTD) and MTD), were sent to psychiatrists in Australia, Bangladesh, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the USA. Participants rated their opinions about each case's prevalence in their country, etiology, diagnosis, suicide risk, and treatment using Likert scales.
   Results: Out of 247 responses (123 from Japan and 124 from other countries), two hundred thirty-nine valid responses were received. MTD was recognized in all participating countries, and especially in urban areas. Generally, the factor of personality was regarded as the most probable cause of MTD. Whereas about 90% of Japanese psychiatrists applied the ICD/DSM criteria to TTD, only about 60% applied the criteria to MID.
   Conclusion: Our results indicate that Japan's MID seems to be occurring in many other countries, and that the present ICD/DSM criteria may not be sufficient to diagnose MID. Therefore, it could be an important candidate for a new international diagnostic criterion as a subtype of depression. A clear diagnostic framework and consensus on the interventions to treat MID would be valuable. Further clinical, psychopathological and international epidemiological studies are needed to confirm our preliminary findings of MID. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Happiness is one of the most important factors affecting women's mental health. Several factors contribute to happiness in different societies.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the level of happiness in married women and its related factors.
   Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with stratified sampling proportional to different age groups of married women in selected health centers (based on socioeconomic status). Subjects were 379 married women. The Oxford Happiness Inventory (scale: 0-87) was used to measure happiness. The Enrich Marital Satisfaction Inventory including 47 questions (scale: 47-235) and demographic information questionnaires were also used. Descriptive statistics, correlation, T-test, One-way ANOVA and Regression were used to analyze data.
   Results: The mean of happiness was 45.11 +/- 14.40. Marital satisfaction was 164.68 +/- 28.33 and 64% of the participants had a relative marital satisfaction. Univariate analysis of happiness showed significant effects of husband and wife education, husband job, economic status, stress in past six months, marital satisfaction and having social activates, but was not statistically significant for other factors (P < 0.05). Adjusting for the confounding effect of other variables, multiple linear regressions showed significant association of happiness with marital satisfaction, economic status and social activity.
   Conclusions: Regarding lower level of happiness of married women in Shahroud comparing to some other studies in Iran and abroad, leisure time programs, training life skills especially stress management skills, increasing marital satisfaction and improving economic status should be considered.

AB Study objective-This study hypothesises that the presumed increased risk of self reported longstanding psychiatric illness and intake of psychotropic drugs among Iranian, Chilean, Turkish, and Kurdish adults, when these groups are compared with Polish adults, can be explained by living alone, poor acculturation, unemployment, and low sense of coherence.
   Design-Data from a national sample of immigrants/refugees, who were between the ages of 20-44 years old, upon their arrival in Sweden between 1980 and 1989. Unconditional logistic regression was used in the statistical modelling.
   Setting-Sweden.
   Participants-1059 female and 921 male migrants from Iran, Chile, Turkey, Kurdistan and Poland and a random sample of 3001 Swedes, all between the ages of 27-60 years, were interviewed in 1996 by Statistics Sweden.
   Main results-Compared with Swedes, all immigrants had an increased risk of self reported longstanding psychiatric illness and for intake of psychotropic drugs, with results for the Kurds being nonsignificant. Compared with Poles, Iranian and Chilean migrants had an increased risk of psychiatric illness, when seen in relation to a model in which adjustment was made for sex and age. The difference became non-significant for Chileans when marital status was taken into account. After including civil status and knowledge of the Swedish language, the increased risks for intake of psychotropic drugs for Chileans and Iranians disappeared. Living alone, poor knowledge of the Swedish language, non-employment, and low sense of coherence were strong risk factors for self reported longstanding psychiatric illness and for intake of psychotropic drugs. Iranian, Chilean, Turkish and Kurdish immigrants more frequently reported living in segregated neighbourhoods and having a greater desire to leave Sweden than their Polish counterparts.
   Conclusion-Evidence substantiates a strong association between ethnicity and self reported longstanding psychiatric illness, as well as intake of psychotropic drugs. This association is weakened by marital status, acculturation status, employment status, and sense of coherence.

DE Aluminium phosphide; Cardiac; Electrocardiogram; Mortality; Poisoning
AB Aluminium phosphide (AlP) poisoning has a high mortality due to cardiovascular involvement. In this study, we evaluated the frequency of cardiac manifestations and electrocardiographic (ECG) findings in 20 patients with acute AlP poisoning, who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Tehran, Iran, over a period of 6 months (between October 2008 and April 2009). The sex, age, cause and manner of ingestion, number of ingested AlP tablets, cardiac and ECG manifestations, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), CPK-myocardial band (CPK-mb) and troponin-T (TnT) were extracted from the patients' files. All data were analysed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software.
   The majority (60%) of patients were male. The mean age was 27 +/- 8.7 years. The mortality rate was 40%. In all of the patients, the cause of poisoning was intentional suicide and ingestion was the route of exposure. The mean number of ingested AlP tablets per patient was 2.2 +/- 1.1. The average time interval between admission and cardiovascular manifestations or ECG findings was 168.8 +/- 116.2 min. The range of systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure was 60-130 mmHg and 40-70 mmHg, respectively. Dysrhythmia was observed in nine (45%) cases. Elevation of the ST segment was seen in nine cases (45%). Seven patients (35%) had prolonged QTc intervals. Bundle branch block (BBB) was observed in four (20%) patients. In nine (45%) patients, the serum cardiac TnT qualitative assay was positive. There were no significant differences between normal and abnormal ECG groups according to sex, age, number and manner of ingested AlP tablets and SBP. There was a significant correlation between cardiac manifestations and ECG findings and TnT-positive results with mortality in acute AlP poisoning.

SO JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH

DT Article
DE Outcome studies; schizophrenia; Iran

AB Background: An extensive literature addresses factors that influence outcome in patients with schizophrenia. However, the effect of these factors under national crisis remains unclear.
   Aims: The study explores the outcome of schizophrenia in a 15-year follow up in Iraq.
   Methods: A total of 298 patients with first-onset schizophrenia from 1985-1987 were recruited from all subjects who had consecutively visited the psychiatric service in Merjan Hospital in Al-Hilla city, Babylon Governorate, Iraq. Of these, 84 were excluded and did not have the research assessment.
   Results: The 150 males and 64 females had an average age at onset of the disorder of 24.8 years. Forty three subjects were untraceable, and 12 subjects committed suicide, I I subjects had alcohol dependence, 8 subjects had clear learning disability, 7 subjects had organic brain diseases, and 3 subjects had epilepsy. All of them were excluded in the analysis. The entire sample was of the same ethnic Iraqi origin, mostly unemployed 151 (70.6%) and all subjects were living with their families. More than 47% of subjects at final assessment had good or partial symptomatic and psychosocial outcomes and nearly 53% had a poor outcome. Thirty patients (20%) of the male group showed good prognosis versus 31.3% of the female group. Furthermore, 54.7% of the males were in the poor prognosis group versus 48.7% of the females.
   Conclusions: Despite Iraq being under siege and exposed to economic sanctions, with very limited resources including the deprivation of atypical antipsychotic medications, its schizophrenia outcome is similar to that in developing countries. The existence of large, supportive families and a strict, committed regimen for active follow-up treatment may be important contributory factors to better outcomes.

TI Al-Qaeda as an adversary - Do we understand our enemy?
SO WORLD POLITICS
LA English
DT Review
AB Several recent books on al-Qaeda depict the organization as capable, committed, and bloodthirsty. The authors contend that further attacks, perhaps exceeding the scale of September 11, are likely and may even be inevitable. Indeed, they portray the United States as caught in an enduring struggle with Islamic extremism. Although the effort to arrest, kill, or disrupt al-Qaeda's leadership may be going extremely well, radical Islam appears to be thriving.
   The bleak outlook, however, ignores several. positive signs. Infighting among Islamists remains rampant, a perennial problem that al-Qaeda has managed to reduce but not eliminate. Islamist regimes such as the Taliban's Afghanistan have been overthrown, while revolutionary regimes in Sudan and Iran are now far less fervent. Nor have violent movements gained mass support in the Muslim world, as their bloody tactics alienate more Muslims than they attract.
   This portrait of al-Qaeda as an adversary suggests several policies. First, many of the bromides regarding counterterrorism in general-often drawn from struggles against small, left-wing European groups with at best limited popular appeal-do not apply to al-Qaeda. Its size, dedication, and popular appeal make it unusually, perhaps uniquely, formidable. Second, one must be wary of confusing al-Qaeda with its many affiliates and of confusing these violent radical groups with the broader political Islamist movement. Third, the United States must re-engage its allies, ensuring that its counterterrorism strategy is robust enough to maintain their support. Fourth, public diplomacy, always an American weakness, must go from an episodic and underfunded foreign policy instrument to a major tool of national power. Fifth, al-Qaeda's unusually innovative nature requires the United States to try to defend not only against obvious methods such as truck bombs but also against new means like surface-to-air missiles and sustained suicide bombing campaigns. Sixth and finally, political leaders must engage the public to increase the ability of the United States to stand fast in the event of another major attack.

AB Some parts of Masjid-i-Sulaiman (MIS; southwest of Iran) are polluted by natural sour gas. Previously it has been shown that among MIS citizens the incidence of suicide attempts and self-burning and the frequency of depression and hopelessness are remarkably high. In order to investigate the association of the XRCC1 genetic polymorphisms (at codons 194 and 399) with depression and hopelessness levels of participants exposed to sour gas, the present cross-sectional study was carried out on 206 healthy persons living in the contaminated areas of MIS. The genotypes of XRCC1 were determined using PCR based method. Depression and hopelessness scores were determined using Beck's depression inventory and Beck's hopelessness scale, respectively. The "Arg/Trp+Trp/Trp" genotypes of Arg194Trp polymorphism were positively correlated with hopelessness and depression levels. However there was no statistical association between the genotypes of Arg399Gln polymorphism and the hopelessness and depression levels. Our data indicated that the Trp194-Arg399 haplotype was significantly associated with the higher hopelessness (OR = 3.95, 95% CI = 1.34-11.5, P = 0.012) and depression levels (OR = 2.55, 95% CI = 1.15-5.66, P = 0.021). The Trp194 vs Arg194 allele (OR = 4.49, 95% CI = 1.33-15.1, P = 0.008) and the Trp194-Arg399 vs Arg194-Arg399 haplotype ((OR = 4.66, 95% CI = 1.35-16.1, P = 0.015) significantly increased in "hopeless and depressed persons" compared with the "without hopelessness and depression" group. The impact of polymorphisms on the function of XRCC1 deserve more attention and also further studies are required to conclude clinical diagnosis of depressive disorders in polluted areas of MIS and study the adverse effects of H2S on brain function.

AB Previous studies based on either single hospital data or sampling of specific groups of hospitalized burns victims in Taiwan have provided only minimal epidemiological information. The study is designed to provide additional data on the epidemiology of hospitalized burns patients in Taiwan. Data were obtained from the Burn Injury Information System (BIIS), which brings together information supplied by 34 contracted hospitals. The study time course spanned a 2-year period from July 1997 to June 1999. Patient characteristics (age, sex, education level, etc.), causes and severity of injuries, and medical care measures were explored. A total of 4741 patients were registered with BIIS over the study period. The majority of hospitalized patients (67%) were male. The age distribution of burns patients showed peaks occurring at the age groups of 0-5 and 35-44 years. Over the time course of a day, burn injuries occurred more frequently from 10:00 to 12:00 h and 16:00 to 18:00 h. Injuries suspected as the result of suicide, homicide or child abuse accounted for 4.8% of hospitalized cases. More than 48% of the burns occurred in the home. The leading type of burn injury was scalding, followed by naked flame, explosion, electrical burns, and chemical burns due to caustic or corrosive substances. The mean percent total body surface area (%TBSA) for adults was 19%, and for young children was 12%. The average length of hospital stay was 18 days. In conclusion, children under 5 years and adults between 35 and 44 years of age are two high-risk groups for burn injuries. Corresponding to meal preparation time, hot substances such as boiling water, hot soup, etc. are the most common agents responsible for scalds. Prevention programs for reducing the risk of burn injuries during cooking and eating are required, especially for parents with young children. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd and ISBI.

ID ACID-INDUCED TOXICITY; L-CARNITINE; SODIUM VALPROATE; OVERDOSE
AB Background: Valproic acid (VPA) is an effective antiepileptic drug widely used worldwide. Despite several studies indicating the usefulness of intravenous L-carnitine in the treatment of VPA poisoning, this drug is not readily available in Iran. The aim of this study was to determine whether supportive care without antidote would result in acceptable outcomes in VPA poisoned patients. Materials and Methods: In an observational, retrospective, single-center case series, all patients > 12-year-old with VPA overdose who had referred to a tertiary center between 2009 and 2013 were consecutively enrolled. Patients demographic and presenting features, physical examinations, clinical management, laboratory data, and outcomes were recorded. Results: A total of 316 patients were enrolled with pure VPA toxicity. The most common presenting signs/symptoms were drowsiness, nausea and vomiting, vertigo, and headache. In the course of the disease, 14 patients (4.4%) were intubated and three (0.9%) required hemodialysis with mean dialysis sessions of two. Fourteen patients were admitted to Intensive Care Unit, and seizures occurred in five. The initial level of consciousness was lower in patients with poor outcome. The median ingested dose of VPA in patients who required dialysis was significantly higher (20 vs. 6 g; P = 0.006). Multivariate analyses revealed that coma on presentation was associated with a worse outcome (P = 0.001; odds ratio = 61.5, 95% CI = 5.8-646.7). Conclusion: Prognosis of VPA poisoned patients appears to be good even with supportive care. According to our study, older age, ingestion of higher amounts of VPA and lower PCO 2 , HCO 3 , base excess, and CPK levels prone the patients to more severe toxicities in univariate analysis, but the main poor prognostic factor is coma on presentation in multivariate analysis.

   Objectives: Our previous study's findings in patients poisoned with organophosphate led us to the goal of this study: obtaining the initial tympanic temperature in patients poisoned by a variety of toxins.
   Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study reviewed the records of poisoned patients who were admitted to the toxicological intensive care unit (TICU) at Loghman Hakim hospital poison center (LHHPC) from February 2014 to February 2015. The data collected included gender, age, type of poisoning, the season during which poisoning occurred, vital signs, initial tympanic temperature (first four hours), presence of seizures, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), length of stay and patient outcome. We determined the mean (SD) for normally distributed continuous variables, the median and interquartile range for non-normally distributed continuous variables, and the absolute and relative frequency (%) for categorical variables. All were determined using SPSS version 16.
   Results: Data were collected from 310 eligible patients. The mean patient age was 32.65 (with a standard deviation of 14.40). Of the patients in the study,183 (59%) were male. Intentional poisoning in an attempted suicide was documented in 253 (81.6%) patients. The most prevalent poisoning agent was aluminum phosphate (18.70%), followed by methadone (10%) and opium (10%). Seventy percent of the patients (n =217) were diagnosed and classified with fever or hyperthermia. A temperature >= 40 degrees C was detected in just three cases. The highest mean temperature was found in patients poisoned with amphetamine, organophosphate and tramadol. Patients with alcohol and phenobarbital poisoning were included in the sample, but these patients were not diagnosed with hypothermia. WBC >= 10,000 cells/mL and CPK >= 975 IU/L were recorded in 57.7% and 13.2% of subjects, respectively.
   Conclusions: Body temperature changes in human poisonings are a matter in need of special attention. A literature review did not reveal any controversy over hypothermia, but poisoning cases exhibit a variety of patterns of fever and hyperthermia. If there are no limits to the diagnosis of fever and hyperthermia, all cases with a poor prognosis which fail to respond to treatment could be categorized as drug-induced hyperthermia. Therefore, a different approach is needed for poisoning cases.

AB Background: Tracheal stenosis is one of the worst complications of endotracheal intubation, but timely diagnosis can change its natural history. Management of these patients places a great burdenon the health care system and the well-being of the patients and their families. Therefore, discharged intensive-care-unit (ICU) patients who underwent more than 24 hours of intubation should be actively followed-up 3 months after extubation and screened for post-intubation tracheal stenosis. The present study was aimed at assessing the impact of post-discharge follow-up call interviews on increasing successful screening for post-intubation tracheal stenosis.
   Objectives: To determine the effect of post-discharge call interviews on improving screening of post-intubation tracheal stenosis.
   Methods: This experimental study was conducted in Iran in September 2014. Using the simple randomization method, 140 patients who had undergone than 24 hours of endotracheal intubation and had received oral and written educational materials upon discharge from the ICU were equally assigned to an intervention and a control groups (received a call interview before or after the follow-up due date, respectively). The needed sample size was calculated to be 70 participants in each group (considering alpha = 5%, the statistical power of 90%, and effect size = 0.4).
   Results: There was a significant difference in follow-up rates at the due date between the intervention group (50.7%, 34of 67 participants) and the control group (17.5%, 11 of 63 participants) (OR = 4.871, 95% CI = 2.172 to 10.924, P < 0.0001). In the control group, the call interviews significantly increased the follow-up rate from 17.5% to 66.7 % (42 of 63 participants) (P < 0.0001), although followup occurred after the due date. The results of the logistic regression model showed that the patients who had attempted suicide completed follow-up more than those who had not (P = 0.017), that interviews with patients and their parents were more effect than interviews with others (P < 0.05), and that phone call interviews after the follow-up due date were more effective than those before the follow-up due date (OR = 2.653, 95% CI = 1.079 to 6.526, P = 0.034).
   Conclusions: We highly recommend making call interviews, along with distributing the oral and written educational materials, to increase the follow-up rate among discharged ICU patients.

AB Background: Burns are a major public health problem, with long hospitalization stay in both intensive care units and general wards. In Israel about 5% of all hospitalized injuries are burn injuries. There are no long-term epidemiological studies on burn injuries in adults in Israel.
   Objectives: To identify risk factors for burn injuries and provide a starting point for the establishment of an effective prevention plan.
   Methods: We analyzed the demographic, etiologic and clinical data of 5000 burn patients admitted to the five major hospitals with burn units in Israel during a 7 year period (1997-2003). Data were obtained from the records of the Israeli National Trauma Registry. The differences between various groups were evaluated using the chi-square test.
   Results: Male gender was twice as frequent as female gender in burn patients (68.0% vs. 31.9%), and non-Jewish ethnicity was more common when considering their proportion in the total population (62.3% vs. 36.8%). Second and third-degree burns with body surface areas less than 10% constituted the largest group (around 50%). The largest age group was 0-1 years, constituting 22.2% of the cases. Inhalation injury was uncommon (1.9%). The most common etiologies were hot liquids (45.8%) and open fire (27.5%). Children less than 10 years old were burnt mainly by hot liquids while the main cause of burns for adults > 20 years old was an open flame. The majority of burns occurred at home (58%); around 15% were work related. The mean duration of hospitalization was 13.7 days (SD 17.7); 15.5% were in an intensive care unit with a mean duration of 12.1 days (SID 17.1). Surgical procedures became more common during the period of the study (from 13.4% in 1998 to 26.59% in 2002, average 19.8%). The mortality rate was 4.4%. We found a strong correlation between burn degree and total body surface area and mortality (0.25% mortality for 2nd to 3rd-degree burns with less than 10% TBSA, 5.4% for 2nd to 3rd-degree burns with 20-39% TBSA, and 96.6% for burns > 90% TBSA). The worst prognosis was for those over the age of 70 (mortality rate 35.3%) and the best prognosis was for the 0-1 year group (survival rate 99.6%).
   Conclusions: The groups at highest risk were children 0-1 years old, males and non-Jews (the incidence rate among non-Jews was 1.5 times higher than their share in the general population). Those with the highest mortality rate were victims of burns > 90% TBSA and patients older than 70. Most burns occurred at home.

SO TAKEN HOSTAGE: THE IRAN HOSTAGE CRISIS AND AMERICAS FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH
   RADICAL ISLAM
LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
AB On November 4, 1979, Robert Ode was on special short-term assignment at the U. S. embassy in Iran. He'd only been there for a couple of months. He was part of the skeleton crew operating the much-reduced U. S. Mission Tehran while the Iranian revolution sorted itself out. Sixty-five years old, he had retired from the foreign service in 1976. He'd put in thirty years all over the world. A steady, sure hand, he looked a decade younger than his age.
   Ode's work at the embassy was routine. Mostly, he processed visa applications. Because of the chaos and anti-American hysteria, the U. S. government had stopped issuing visas for several months. Now there was a big backlog and visas to the United States were a hot commodity, especially for persecuted Iranian Jews and Ba'hai's, as well as for anybody associated in any way with the Shah's overthrown regime (and, revolution or no revolution, for the many young Iranians who still wished to study in American universities). The paperwork had overwhelmed the reduced regular staff.(1)
   Ode's previous special assignment for the State Department had been well out of the ordinary. At the tail end of 1978, State had sent him to Guyana to help handle the fallout of the Jonestown horrors. The Reverend Jim Jones, leader of the 3,000-member People's Temple in San Francisco, had taken around 1,100 of his followers down to Guyana, on the northeast coast of South America, to build a socialist-religious utopian enclave. Jones had for all practical purposes gone insane-or further insane-and Jonestown had become an armed camp in which extreme loyalty to "Father" was paramount. In November 1978, an American delegation led by Congressman Leo Ryan arrived in Guyana to investigate charges that Jones was holding people against their will. Jones had the congressman and three staffers killed. In an apocalyptic paranoid fury, he then ordered his followers to drink cyanide-laced Kool-Aid, a task for which they had been rehearsing for some time. Most complied. Those that didn't were shot down by Jones loyalists. On November 18, 1978, while the Shah's regime crumbled, 913 Americans, including 276 children, died in Jonestown. Ode's job was to assist the 167 survivors and look after the repatriation of the corpses. In the late 1970s, "cults" (Hare Krishnas, "Moonies," the Children of God) and "cult" deprogramming were just part of the backdrop to the more general pandemonium and, in retrospect, it's amazing how calmly Americans treated the mass suicide and murders at Jonestown. Ode himself was a calm man and he had done his best to bracket the madness and do the job he had been assigned.(2)
   After the horrors of Jonestown, Tehran had seemed like relatively light duty for Ode. Nightly gunfire, constant anti-American street protests, and shouts of "Marg bar Amrika" (Death to America) were unpleasant but seemed like manageable threats.
   They were not. Robert Ode would become the oldest captive taken by the Iranian student revolutionaries. To the best of his ability, this veteran foreign service officer gave his youthful captors a very hard time for 444 days.
