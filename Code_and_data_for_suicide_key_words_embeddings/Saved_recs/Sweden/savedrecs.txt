AB Previous publications have reported two conflicting patterns describing the relationship between income and suicide in Sweden; positive and negative. Methodologically the studies have differed, and the analysis has been limited to a few areas. To better understand the relationship, a nationwide, cross-sectional, ecological study of the 290 municipalities in Sweden was planned. OLS regression analyses showed the overall and female suicide rates were negatively related to income, while the effect on male suicide rates was not statistically significant. The results confirm earlier findings of a negative relationship between income and suicide.

AB Suicide is a global health problem and committing suicide with a firearm is a common method. As recent studies discuss the importance of removing a firearm from a patient trying to commit suicide in the US, it is believed that Sweden and the Swedish model can be highly useful for American policymakers. Sweden has a low rate of firearm-related suicide which is believed to be a direct reflection of the highly restrictive gun laws of the country. On the contrary, the US, with a less restrictive gun laws, has a high level of firearm-related suicides. The US is thus in acute need of reforms in its gun laws, otherwise, any suicide preventive efforts may risk being in vain.

TI "We are like lemmings'': making sense of the cultural meaning(s) of
   suicide among the indigenous Sami in Sweden
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIRCUMPOLAR HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Sami; suicide; indigenous; identity; Sweden; qualitative study
AB Background. Suicide is a widespread problem among indigenous people residing in the circumpolar Arctic. Though the situation among the indigenous Sami in northern Scandinavia is better than among some other indigenous people, suicide is still regarded as a major public health issue. To adapt prevention strategies that are culturally attuned one must understand how suicide is understood within context. That is, the cultural meaning(s) of suicide.
   Objective. To explore and make sense of the cultural meaning(s) of suicide among Sami in Sweden.
   Design. Open-ended focus group discussions (FGDs) on the topic "suicide among Sami'' were carried out in 5 Sami communities in Sweden, with in total 22 strategically selected Sami participants. FGDs were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed through employing content analysis.
   Results. From the FGDs 4 themes emerged including "The Sami are fighting for their culture and the herders are in the middle of the fight,'' "Suicide as a consequence of Sami losing (or having lost) their identity,'' "A wildfire in the Sami world'' and "Difficult to get help as a Sami.''
   Conclusions. Findings indicate that Sami in Sweden make sense of suicide in relation to power and identity within a threatened Sami cultural context. Suicide is then understood as an act that takes place and makes sense to others when a Sami no longer has the power to maintain a Sami identity, resulting in being disconnected from the Sami world and placed in an existential void where suicide is a solution. The findings are useful in development of culturally attuned suicide prevention among Sami in Sweden.

AB Background and aim: The Nordic countries provide a suitable setting for comparing trends in suicide mortality. The aim of this report is to compare suicide trends by age, gender, region and methods in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden 1980-2009. Methods: Suicide statistics 1980-2009 were analyzed for men and women aged 15 years and above and the age group 15-24 years. Regional suicide rates in 2009 were presented in maps. Results: The suicide rates across the Nordic countries declined from 25-50 per 100,000 in 1980 to 20-36 in 2009 for men and from 9-26 in 1980 to 8-11 in 2009 for women. The rates in Finland were consistently higher than those of the other countries. A significant increase of suicides in young women in Finland and Norway and a lack of a decline among young women in Sweden were noted. The male-female ratio of suicide converged to approximately 3:1 across the region during the study period. Rural areas in Finland, Norway and Sweden saw the highest suicide rates, whereas the rates in the capital regions of Denmark, Norway and Sweden were lower than the respective national rates. Conclusions: We hold that the overall decline of suicide rates in the Nordic countries reflects the socio-economic development and stability of the region, including the well-functioning healthcare. The increasing rates in Finland and Norway and the unchanged rate in Sweden of suicide in young women are an alarming trend break that calls for continued monitoring.

AB To test the hypothesis that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants may have a suicide emergent effect, particularly in children and adolescents.
   Detections of different antidepressants in the forensic toxicological screening of 14 857 suicides were compared with those in 26 422 cases of deaths by accident or natural causes in Sweden 1992-2000.
   There were 3411 detections of antidepressants in the suicides and 1538 in the controls. SSRIs had lower odds ratios than the other antidepressants. In the 52 suicides under 15 years, no SSRIs were detected. In 15-19-year age group, SSRIs had lower relative risk in suicides compared with non-SSRIs.
   The hypothesis that treatment of depressed individuals with SSRIs leads to an increased risk of suicide was not supported by this analysis of the total suicidal outcome of the nationwide use of SSRIs in Sweden over a period of 9 years, either in adults or in children or adolescents.

AB Suicides by drowning have received limited attention by researchers. A recent finding that almost one-third of all drowning deaths in Sweden were classified as suicide instigated this study. We identified 129 cases of suicide by drowning in Northern Sweden and analyzed the circumstances and the psychiatric history prior to the suicide. Information was obtained from autopsy, police and medical records, as well as from the National Inpatient Register. One-third of the suicide victims had previously attempted suicide and half of the victims had been hospitalized due to mental health problems. One-third of these had left the hospital less than one week before the suicide. Alcohol and psychoactive drugs were present in 16% and 62% of the cases, respectively.
   A history of mental disorder and previous suicide attempt (s), especially by drowning, is an ominous combination necessitating efficient clinical identification, treatment and follow-up if a complete suicide is to be prevented.

AB Background/Purpose: Few studies have compared methods of suicide used by women in different countries. This study compared methods used by women in South Korea, Taiwan, Sweden and the United States.
   Methods: Age- and method-specific suicide rates for women in the four countries in 2002 were calculated and compared. Hanging, firearms and jumping from a height were classified as violent suicide methods. Poisoning suicides were further classified according to use of drugs, gases, pesticides and other agents.
   Results: Half of Taiwanese and American women used violent methods, while only one third of women in South Korea and Sweden used such methods. Poisoning was the most often used suicide method by women in all four countries. About 90% of American and Swedish women used drugs. In contrast, almost half of women from Korea and Taiwan used pesticides.
   Conclusion: Different countries contrast greatly in the agents used in suicide by poisoning but not in patterns of violent methods used. [J Formos Med Assoc 2009;108(6):452-459]

ID MAJOR PUBLIC HOLIDAYS; EUROPE
AB Background: Previous studies have investigated the impact of the Christmas and New Year holiday on suicide rates. However, no such data has yet been published on Swedish suicides.Aims: To examine the occurrence of suicides on these dates in Sweden between 2006 and 2015.Methods: The suicide count for each date between December 15th and January 15th was obtained from the Swedish cause of death registry. The observations were transformed to Z-scores to enable calculation of p-values.Results: A small but non-significant decrease in suicides was observed on Christmas and New Year's Eve. A significant spike was found on New Year's Day (NYD) (Z=3.40; p<.001), and these excess suicide occurred mainly among men aged 15-24 and 45-64. However, the number of suicides were somewhat lower than expected on the 31st of December (Z=-1.58; p=.115).Discussion: The noted increase in suicide on NYD is in line with previous research from other countries. However, the decrease in suicides on the day before NYD suggests a delay rather than a spontaneous increase of suicides. Possible mechanisms to explain this phenomenon are discussed, such as the broken promise effect, increased alcohol consumption, or lower help-seeking and accessibility to care.

AB Research on homicides followed by suicides has largely relied on very localized samples and relatively short time spans of data. As a result, little is known about the extent to which patterns within cases of homicide-suicides are geographically specific. The current study seeks to help fill this gap by comparing twenty years of homicide- suicide data for Sweden and a large U.S. county. Although some of the underlying patterns in the two countries are similar (e.g., decreasing rates), a number of important differences emerge, particularly with respect to incidence, weapons used, perpetrator age, and relationship of the perpetrator to the victim.

DE Population; Season; Suicide rate; Thermal stress; Time
ID BROWN ADIPOSE-TISSUE; TRENDS
AB Suicide mortality varies in both the short and long term. Our study examines suicide mortality in Finland and Sweden from the 1750s until today. The aim of our study is to detect any seasonal peaks in suicide rates and examine their temporal evolution to suggest a mechanism that may explain such peaks.
   We acquired the study material from the Finnish and Swedish cause of death statistics (257,341 deaths by suicide) and the relevant population gender structure data. We then separately calculated the annual male and female suicide rates per 100,000 inhabitants. We analysed the suicide peaks, calculating factors of proportionality for the available data by dividing the suicide rates in the peak months (May and October) by the annual suicide rates.
   Suicide rates in Finland and Sweden peak twice a year. Both men and women in both countries most often commit suicide in May. There is another peak in October, with the exception of Finnish men. These suicide peaks coincide with a temperature increase in May and the biggest annual drop in temperature in October. We also observed a monotonic long-term change in the Swedish statistics, but not in the Finnish data. Our hypothesis is that seasonal variation in suicide rates may be caused by abrupt temperature changes twice a year that trigger the activity in brown adipose tissue and deepen depression.
   While the overall suicide mortality rates varied considerably, the monthly proportions in May did not. This finding suggests a routine factor underlying the spring peak in suicide mortality.

AB Minority sexual orientation is a predictor of suicide ideation and attempts, though its association with suicide mortality is less clear. We capitalize on Sweden's extensively linked databases, to investigate whether, among married individuals, same-sex marriage is associated with suicide. Using a population-based register design, we analyzed suicide risk among same-sex married women and men (n = 6456), as compared to different-sex married women and men (n = 1181723) in Sweden. We selected all newly partnered or married individuals in the intervening time between 1/1/1996 and 12/31/2009 and followed them with regard to suicide until 12/31/2011. Multivariate Poisson regression was used to calculate adjusted incidence risk ratios (IRR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). The risk of suicide was higher among same-sex married individuals as compared to different-sex married individuals (IRR 2.7, 95 % CI 1.5-4.8), after adjustment for time at risk and socioeconomic confounding. Sex-stratified analyses showed a tentatively elevated risk for same-sex married women (IRR 2.5, 95 % CI 0.8-7.7) as compared to different-sex married women. Among same-sex married men the suicide risk was nearly three-fold greater as compared to different-sex married (IRR 2.895 % CI 1.5-5.5). This holds true also after adjustment for HIV status. Even in a country with a comparatively tolerant climate regarding homosexuality such as Sweden, same-sex married individuals evidence a higher risk for suicide than other married individuals.

AB Studies on the suicide risk among patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in countries without legalized euthanasia or assisted suicide are important additions to data on the wish to die of these patients. We conducted a population-based cohort study in Sweden between 1965 and 2004, which comprised of 6642 patients with incident ALS identified from the Swedish Inpatient Register. We calculated the standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) of suicide among the patients using the suicide rates of the general Swedish population as a reference. In total, 21 patients committed suicide during follow-up, compared to the predicted 3.6 suicides. Thus, we noted an almost 6-fold increased risk for suicide among ALS patients [SMR 5.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6-8.8]. Patients who committed suicide were, on average, around 7 years younger at the time of their first period of hospitalization than patients who did not commit suicide. The highest relative risk for suicide was observed within the first year after the patients first period of hospitalization (SMR 11.2, 95% CI 5.8-19.6). After that, the relative risks decreased with time after hospitalization (P-value for trend = 0.006), but remained elevated 3 years later. The relative risks of suicide among ALS patients did not show a clear trend over time in contrast to the decreasing trend of relative risks for suicide among patients with cancer during the same period. Patients with ALS are at excess risk of suicide in Sweden and the relative risk is higher during the earlier stage of the disease.

AB Background: Several studies have concluded that some deaths classified as undetermined intent are in fact suicides, and it is common in suicide research in Europe to include these deaths. Our aim was to investigate if information on background variables would be helpful in assessing if deaths classified as undetermined intent should be included in the analyses of suicides.
   Methods: We performed a register study of 31,883 deaths classified as suicides and 9,196 deaths classified as undetermined intent in Sweden from 1987 to 2011. We compared suicide deaths with deaths classified as undetermined intent with regard to different background variables such as sex, age, country of birth, marital status, prior inpatient care for self-inflicted harm, alcohol and drug abuse, psychiatric inpatient care, and use of psychotropics. We also performed a multivariate analysis with logistic regression.
   Results: Our results showed differences in most studied background factors. Higher education was more common in suicides; hospitalization for self-inflicted harm was more common among female suicides as was prior psychiatric inpatient care. Deaths in foreign-born men were classified as undetermined intent in a higher degree and hospitalization for substance abuse was more common in undetermined intents of both sexes. Roughly 50% of both suicide and deaths classified as undetermined intent had a filled prescription of psychotropics during their last six months. Our multivariate analysis showed male deaths to more likely be classified as suicide than female: OR: 1.13 (1.07-1.18). The probability of a death being classified as suicide was also increased for individuals aged 15-24, being born in Sweden, individuals who were married, and for deaths after 1987-1992.
   Conclusion: By analyzing Sweden's unique high-validity population-based register data, we found several differences in background variables between deaths classified as suicide and deaths classified as undetermined intent. However, we were not able to clearly distinguish these two death manners. For future research we suggest, separate analyses of the two different manners of death.

AB Objectives: To investigate associations between economic stress in childhood and suicide thoughts and attempts.
   Study design: The 2012 public health survey in Scania, Sweden, is a cross-sectional postal questionnaire study including 28,029 participants, aged 18-80 years.
   Methods: Associations were analyzed in logistic regressions.
   Results: A 12.1% prevalence of men and 15.5% of women had ever experienced suicide thoughts, while 3.2% of men and 5.3% of women had experienced suicide attempt. Roughly 24% had experienced less severe and 8% severe economic problems in childhood. Significant associations between economic stress in childhood and suicide thoughts and attempts remained throughout the age-adjusted and multiple adjusted analyses.
   Conclusions: Economic stress in childhood is associated with self-reported suicide thoughts and suicide attempts in an adult general population. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Royal Society for Public Health.

AB Objective: Ecological studies have demonstrated a substantial decrease in suicide in parallel with an increasing use of antidepressants. To investigate on the individual level the hypothesis that antidepressant medication was a causal factor.
   Method: Data on the toxicological detection of antidepressants in 18 922 suicides in Sweden 1992-2003 were linked to registers of psychiatric hospitalization as well as registers with sociodemographic data.
   Results: The probability for the toxicological detection of an antidepressant was lowest in the non-suicide controls, higher in suicides, and even higher in suicides that had been psychiatric inpatients but excluding those who had been in-patients for the treatment of depression.
   Conclusion: The finding that in-patient care for depression did not increase the probability of the detection of antidepressants in suicides is difficult to explain other than by the assumption that a substantial number of depressed individuals were saved from suicide by postdischarge treatment with antidepressant medication.

ID COMPLETED SUICIDE; PREVENTION; DEPRESSION; DISORDERS; RISK
AB Objective To explore a possible temporal association between changes in antidepressant sales and suicide rates in different age groups.
   Methods A time series analysis using a two-slope model to compare suicide rates in Sweden before and after introduction of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs.
   Results Antidepressant sales increased between 1977-1979 and 1995-1997 in men from 4.2 defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants and day (DDD/t.i.d) to 21.8 and in women from 8.8 to 42.4. Antidepressant sales were twice as high in the elderly as in the 25-44-year-olds and eight times that in the 15-24-year-olds. During the same time period suicide rates decreased in men from 48.2 to 33.3 per 10(5) inhabitants/year and in women from 20.3 to 13.4. There was significant change in the slope in suicide rates after the introduction of the SSRI, for both men and women, which corresponds to approximately 348 fewer suicides during 1990-1997. Half of these 'saved lives' occurred among young adults.
   Conclusion We demonstrate a statistically significant chance in slope in suicide rates in men and women that coincided with the introduction of the SSRI antidepressants in Sweden. This change preceded the exponential increase in antidepressant sales. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB This is a community-based sequential case series of 50 individuals who committed suicide by jumping from bridges in two regions of Sweden.
   Of the 50 subjects, 32 were men and 18 women, with a median age of 35 years. At least 40 had psychiatric problems. The frequency of suicide was highest during the summer months and during the weekends. A total of 27 bridges were used, with a total length of just under 9 km. Three bridges accounted for almost half of all suicides.
   Limiting the availability of one method of committing suicide is reported to reduce the overall suicide rate; why suicide and injury suicide preventive measures might be considered. Since this study demonstrates that few bridges attract suicide candidates, this injury mechanism needs to be acknowledged by the road system owners and included in the safety work.

AB Objective: Ecological studies have demonstrated a substantial decrease in suicide in parallel with an increase in the use of antidepressants. Causality cannot, however, be inferred from such studies. The aim of this study was to test on the individual level the hypothesis that treatment with antidepressant medication has been a substantially contributing cause of the decrease in suicide.
   Method: Time trends in the detection of antidepressants and five 'control medications' in the forensic toxicological screening of 16 937 suicides and 33 426 controls in Sweden 1995-2005.
   Results: The expected number of antidepressant-positive suicides in 2005 was 409 if the hypothesis was true and 603 if it was false. The observed number in 2005 was 420. The control medications were detected to the extent that was expected if not preventing suicide.
   Conclusion: The observed trend in the number of suicides with antidepressants was well predicted by the hypothesis that the increased use of antidepressants has been a substantially contributing cause of the decrease in suicide.

AB BackgroundThe extent of post-mortem detection of specific psychoactive drugs may differ between countries, and may greatly influence the national death register's classification of manner and cause of death. The main objective of the present study was to analyse the magnitude and pattern of post-mortem detection of various psychoactive substances by the manner of death (suicide, accidental, undetermined and natural death with a psychiatric diagnosis) in Norway and Sweden.MethodsThe Cause of Death Registers in Norway and Sweden provided data on 600 deaths in 2008 from each country, of which 200 were registered as suicides, 200 as accidents or undetermined manner of death and 200 as natural deaths in individuals with a diagnosis of mental disorder as the underlying cause of death. We examined death certificates and forensic reports including toxicological analyses.ResultsThe detection of psychoactive substances was commonly reported in suicides (66 and 74% in Norway and Sweden respectively), accidents (85 and 66%), undetermined manner of deaths (80% in the Swedish dataset) and in natural deaths with a psychiatric diagnosis (50 and 53%). Ethanol was the most commonly reported substance in the three manners of death, except from opioids being more common in accidental deaths in the Norwegian dataset. In cases of suicide by poisoning, benzodiazepines and z-drugs were the most common substances in both countries. Heroin or morphine was the most commonly reported substance in cases of accidental death by poisoning in the Norwegian dataset, while other opioids dominated the Swedish dataset. Anti-depressants were found in 22% of the suicide cases in the Norwegian dataset and in 29% of suicide cases in the Swedish dataset.ConclusionsPsychoactive substances were detected in 66 and 74% of suicides and in 85 and 66% of accidental deaths in the Norwegian and Swedish datasets, respectively. Apart from a higher detection rate of heroin in deaths by accident in Norway than in Sweden, the pattern of detected psychoactive substances was similar in the two countries. Assessment of a suicidal motive may be hampered by the common use of psychoactive substances in suicide victims.

AB This paper investigates the potential temporal and spatial variations of suicides in subway stations in Stockholm, Sweden. The study also assesses whether the variation in suicide rates is related to the station environments by controlling for each station's location and a number of contextual factors using regression models and geographical information systems (GIS). Data on accidents are used as references for the analysis of suicides. Findings show that suicides tend to occur during the day and in the spring. They are concentrated in the main transportation hubs but, interestingly, during off-peak hours. However, the highest rates of suicides per passenger are found in Stockholm's subway stations located in the Southern outskirts. More than half of the variation in suicide rates is associated with stations that have walls between the two sides of the platform but still allow some visibility from passers-by. The surrounding environment and socioeconomic context show little effect on suicide rates, but stations embedded in areas with high drug-related crime rates tend to show higher suicide rates.

AB Background: Little is known as to whether suicide seasonality is related to psychiatric disorders affecting suicide risk/incidence. The present study aims to assess suicide seasonality patterns with regard to the history of psychiatric morbidity among suicide victims.
   Methods: The history of psychiatric inpatient diagnoses in the five years prior to suicide was identified among all suicides in Sweden from 1992 to 2003. Suicide seasonality was estimated as the relative risk of suicide during the month of highest to that in the month of lowest suicide incidence. Analyses were performed with respect to sex, suicide method and history of inpatient treatment of psychiatric disorder.
   Results: Among both male (n = 9,902) and female (n = 4,128) suicide victims, there were peaks in suicide incidence in the spring/early summer. This seasonal variation was more evident in suicide victims with a psychiatric inpatient diagnosis than in those without such a diagnosis. A seasonal variation was found in most diagnostic groups, with significant peaks in males with a history of depression and in females with a history of a neurotic, stress-related, or somatoform disorder. Overall, suicide seasonality was more evident in violent than in non-violent suicide methods.
   Limitation: Only psychiatric disorders severe enough to require hospital admission were studied.
   Conclusion: A history of inpatient-treated psychiatric disorder appears to be associated with an increase in suicide seasonality, especially in violent suicide methods. This increase is found in several psychiatric disorders. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To investigate age and sex-specific changes in rates, methods used and characteristics of suicide attempters receiving medical care, over a 15-year period in two European WHO catchment areas (Stockholm, Sweden; and Wurzburg, Germany).
   The data for this study were obtained from the WHO/EURO Multicentre Study on Suicidal Behaviour for the period 1989-2003. Sex-specific, person-based suicide attempt rates were calculated for each year separately for the age groups 15-24 and 25 or above. The Chi-square test for trend was applied to estimate changes in proportions of socio-demographic and socio-economic variables.
   Significantly, increasing trends in suicide attempt rates occurred in young females, and in males and females aged 25 or above in Wurzburg. On the contrary, men 25 years and above showed a significant decrease in suicide attempt rates in Stockholm. Young females in Wurzburg tended to use less violent methods for their attempts whereas in Stockholm young females were increasingly inclined to attempt suicide using violent methods. In Stockholm, young female suicide attempters tended to be more often economically inactive, particularly due to an increasing proportion of students. Young females in Wurzburg were often less well educated, as were their young male counterparts. This contrasted with trends in the education of men and women of 25 or above in Stockholm.
   The results of this study suggest temporal changes in trends, methods used and in the social profile of suicide attempters.

AB Background: There may be various reasons for differences in suicide rates between countries and over time within a country. One reason can be different registration practices. Aims: The purpose of this study was to describe and compare the present procedures for mortality and suicide registration in the three Scandinavian countries and to illustrate potential sources of error in the registration of suicide. Method: Information about registration practices and classification procedures was obtained from the cause of death registers in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. In addition, we received information from experts in the field in each country. Results: Sweden uses event of undetermined intent more frequently than Denmark does, and Denmark more frequently than Norway. There seems to be somewhat more uncertainty among deaths classified as ill-defined and unknown cause of mortality in Norway, compared with the other two countries. Sweden performs more forensic autopsies than Norway, and Norway more than Denmark. In Denmark, in cases of a suspected unnatural manner of death, a thorough external examination of the deceased is performed. Conclusion: Differences in the classification of causes of death and in postmortem examinations exist in Scandinavian countries. These differences might influence the suicide statistics in Scandinavia.

AB The aim is to investigate associations between sexual orientation and experience of suicide thoughts and suicide attempts. The 2012 public health survey in Scania, southern Sweden, is a cross-sectional population-based study including 28,029 participants aged 18-80 with 51.7% participation. The associations between sexual orientation and experience of suicide thoughts and attempts were investigated in multiple logistic regressions. A 8.2% proportion of men and 11.3% of women reported suicide thoughts more than a year ago, and 4.0% of men 4.1% of women had experienced such thoughts during the past year. A 2.6% proportion of men and 4.6% of women reported suicide attempt more than a year ago, and 0.6% of men and 0.7% of women during the past year. In the age- and multiple adjusted models, bisexual and homosexual men and bisexual women had significantly higher odds ratios of suicide thoughts than heterosexual men and women. Bisexual and homosexual men and bisexual women had significantly higher odds ratios of suicide attempt than heterosexual men and women. After multiple adjustments these patterns largely remained. The results indicate that bisexual men and women and homosexual men have an increased risk of experience of suicide thoughts and suicide attempt.

This study aimed to explore the involvement of firearm use in firearm fatalities and to evaluate physician reporting concerning cases of firearm deaths. Methods: Fatal firearm suicides and homicides in Sweden were studied for the years 2012-2013, accidental deaths and undetermined manner of deaths for the period 1987-2013. Police reports and autopsy protocols were collected from the National Board of Forensic Medicine, health care data in 1 year before the fatality from the National Board of Health, and information about physician reports and firearm licences from the Swedish Police. Results: A total of 291 firearm deaths (213 suicides, 52 accidental deaths, 23 solved homicides and 3 cases with undetermined manner of death) were identified. Firearm suicides were positively correlated with the number of licensed firearm owners. Legal firearm use predominated in firearm suicides and accidental deaths, illegal in homicides. No suicide victim or shooter in an accidental death was previously reported by a physician to the police according to the firearm law. The majority of the shooters in accidental deaths and suicides had no registered health care visits. Less than half (42%) of all suicide victims had a previous health care contact due to mental health problems. Conclusions: Not one single suicide victim nor any shooter in accidental deaths in the present study had been reported according to the firearm law, bringing the evidence of a suboptimal framework.

AB Objective: Released prisoners have high suicide rates compared with the general population, but little is known about risk factors and possible causal pathways. We conducted a population-based cohort study to investigate rates and risk factors for suicide in people previously imprisoned.
   Method: We identified individuals released from prison in Sweden between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2009, through linkage of national population-based registers. Released prisoners were followed from the day of release until death, emigration, new incarceration, or December 31, 2009. Survival analyses were conducted to compare incidence rates and psychiatric morbidity with nonconvicted population controls matched on gender and year of birth.
   Results: We identified 38,995 releases among 26,985 prisoners (7.6% female) during 2005-2009. Overall, 127 suicides occurred, accounting for 14% of all deaths after release (n = 920). The mean suicide rate was 204 per 100,000 person-years, yielding an incidence rate ratio of 18.2 (95% CI, 13.9-23.8) compared with general population controls. Previous substance use disorder (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.4-3.2), suicide attempt (HR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.7-3.7), and being born in Sweden versus abroad (HR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.6) were independent risk factors for suicide after release.
   Conclusions: Released prisoners are at high suicide risk and have a slightly different pattern of psychiatric risk factors for suicide compared with the general population. Results suggest appropriate allocation of resources to facilitate transition to life outside prison and increased attention to prisoners with both a previous suicide attempt and substance use disorder.

AB A number of reports have linked consumption of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with suicide by violent methods. We aimed to determine whether suicides with postmortem evidence of SSRI consumption are more likely to have used violent methods compared with suicides with no detectable antidepressants. Blood samples from all suicides in Sweden during 1992-2004 were examined. Suicides were classified into those who died by violence and nonviolent (self-poisoning) methods using information from police records and autopsy. In addition, we investigated proportions of violent suicide in individuals who died with detectable levels of tricyclic and other antidepressants. The sample consisted of 14,691 suicides. Of the 1958 suicides with detectable levels of SSRIs, 1247 were by violent means (63.7%) compared with 7835 of 11,045 suicides (70.9%) in antidepressant-free group (chi(2)(1) = 7.6; P < 0.01). We found no significant differences in the proportion of violent suicides, in the SSRI group compared with the antidepressant-free group by sex or age band (15-24, 25-39, and over 40 years). When subdivided by gender and age-bands, we found specific groups with significantly lower proportions of violent suicides compared with the antidepressants-free group, including men aged 15-24 years.

AB Studies of the association between parental separation in childhood and suicide thoughts and attempts are scarce. The aim of this study is to investigate associations between parental separation/divorce during childhood, and ever having had suicide thoughts and ever having made suicide attempt, adjusting for social capital and other covariates. In 2012 a cross-sectional public health survey was conducted in Scania, southern Sweden, with a postal questionnaire with 28,029 participants aged 18-80. Associations between parental separation/divorce during childhood and ever having considered suicide or having made suicide attempt were analysed by logistic regression. Overall, 12.1% of the men and 15.5% of the women had experienced suicide thoughts, and 3.2% of the men and 53% of the women had ever tried committing suicide. Among men, 20.4% had experienced parental separation during childhood until age 18, and among women 22.3%. Parental separation/divorce in childhood was with few exceptions significantly associated with ever having had suicide thoughts with the highest odds ratios for those who had experienced parental separation during ages 0-4 years. Parental separation/divorce in childhood was significantly associated with suicide attempts among men who had experienced parental separation/divorce at ages 0-4 and 15-18, and among women at any age 0-18.

AB Background The effect of recent increases in antidepressant prescribing on population suicide rates is uncertain.
   Aims To investigate the relationship between antidepressant sales and trends in suicide rates.
   Method Graphical and quantitative assessment of trends in suicide and antidepressant sales in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland.
   Results Suicide rates declined in all four countries during the 1990s, whereas antidepressant sales increased by 3- to 4-fold. Decreasing suicide rates in Sweden and Denmark preceded the rise in anti depressant sales by over 10 years, although the reductions accelerated between 1988 and 1990. In Norway, a modest but short-lived decline in suicide rates began around the time of the increase in antidepressant sales. In Finland, decreases in male suicide rates and to a lesser extent in female suicide rates began around the time of increased antidepressant sales. In all four countries decreases in suicide rates appeared to precede the widespread use of SSRIs.
   Conclusions We found mixed evidence that increases in antidepressant sales have coincided with a reduction in the number of suicides in Nordic countries.

In the present study we compared suicide risk among persons with foreign background with that of the majority population to determine whether certain minority groups are at a particular risk for suicide, as well as to illuminate gender differences herein. Suicide risk was generally higher among persons with foreign background compared with the majority population and the risk was highest among Nordic-born persons. Overall, suicide risk was significantly lower among Asian-born persons; however, there were gender differences in correlations between ethnicity and suicide risk.

AB PurposeThe aim of this study was to analyse prescription refill, re-hospitalisation, total mortality, mortality because of suicide and attempted suicide among patients who were taking various types of antipsychotics.
   MethodsA population-based cohort study analysed all patients (n=26046) in Sweden who had been treated for schizophrenia from 2006 to 2009 with regard to re-hospitalisation and prescription refill for various types of antipsychotic treatment. A case-control study nested within the cohort analysed all-cause mortality, mortality because of suicide and attempted suicide in relation to antipsychotic use. The study adjusted for history of hospitalisation for psychiatric and medical care, attempted suicide and use of antidepressants.
   ResultsAripiprazole users were the only ones who showed significantly lower all-cause risks of death, but so few events occurred among users of this relatively new drug that the results should be interpreted with caution. Clozapine users showed lower odds of death by suicide (odds ratio [OR]=0.45 [95%CI 0.20-0.98]) and of attempted suicide (OR=0.44 [0.28-0.70]) than haloperidol users after adjustment for age, sex and year of discharge. Olanzapine users showed approximately the same favourable pattern. Patients who used clozapine were most likely to refill prescriptions and had lower rates of re-hospitalisation. Only one death and 23 cases of agranulocytosis were reported compared with 223 suicides and 831 suicide attempts. An etiologic fraction calculation suggests that the use of clozapine rather than traditional drugs could have prevented 95 suicide attempts during the period.
   ConclusionClozapine and olanzapine reduce the risk of suicide, attempted suicide and re-hospitalisation. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Background: The risk of suicide is increased among cancer patients including men with prostate cancer (PCa). However, whether this increased risk applies to men diagnosed subsequent to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing is not known.
   Objective: To assess the risk of suicide among men diagnosed with PCa subsequent to PSA testing.
   Design, setting, and participants: The Prostate Cancer Base Sweden (PCBaSe Sweden) database, the Swedish Cause of Death Register, and the Swedish census database were used. The PCBaSe Sweden is a merged database that includes data from the Swedish National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) for cases diagnosed between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2006. The number of suicides registered for cases in the PCBaSe cohort was compared with the expected number of suicides in an age-matched general male Swedish population.
   Measurements: Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for different categories of cases.
   Results and limitations: There were 128 suicides among the 77 439 PCa cases in the NPCR compared with an expected number of 85 (SMR: 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.8). The risk of suicide was not increased for the 22 405 men with PSA-detected T1c tumours (SMR: 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6-1.5), whereas the 22 929 men with locally advanced nonmetastatic tumours (SMR: 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6-2.9) and the 8350 men with distant metastases (SMR: 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.6) had statistically significant increased SMRs for suicide. Potential effects of comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions could not be investigated.
   Conclusions: No increased risk of committing suicide was observed among men with PCa diagnosed subsequent to PSA testing, whereas the risk was twice as high among men with locally advanced or metastatic disease, compared with an age-matched male population.

AB The objective of the study was to examine the change in child homicides in Sweden between the 1990s and the 2000s based on a study of all cases registered during the periods 1990-1996 and 2002-2008. The results show a significant annual 4% decrease in the number of child homicides, with the main decline being due to a decrease in cases of filicide-suicide among both fathers and mothers. One possible explanation for the decrease may be the increases in the general prescription of antidepressant medication. However, other factors may also have played a significant role in the decline as well.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the nature of homicide-suicides and determine the ways in which they differ from suicides without the perpetration of homicide in terms of their demographic characteristics, suicide, medical and psychiatric history, their psychological state leading up to the suicide, and their motives for their suicidal behavior. Cases of homicide-suicide from a 20-year period were extracted from the Coroner's inquest files and were matched to suicide-only cases on the basis of age and sex. The characteristics that predominantly distinguished the homicide-suicides were based on psychological state leading up to the act and motive for the act. It is proposed that homicide-suicides may be better understood within an expressive homicide framework. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background Previous research suggests that first-generation immigrants have a lower suicide risk than those both born in Sweden and with both parents born in Sweden (natives), while the suicide risk in the second generation seems higher. The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent suicide risk in first-generation and second-generation (both parents born abroad) and intermediate-generation (only one parent born abroad) immigrants compared with natives is associated with sociodemographic factors, labour market marginalisation and morbidity.
   Methods A prospective population-based cohort study of 4 034 728 individuals aged 16-50 years was followed from 2005 to 2010. HRs for suicide were calculated for first-generation, intermediate-generation and second-generation immigrants compared with natives. Analyses were controlled for sociodemographic factors, morbidity and labour market marginalisation.
   Results The HR of suicide was significantly lower in first-generation immigrants (HR 0.83 CI 0.76 to 0.91), and higher in second-generation (HR 1.32, CI 1.15 to 1.52) and intermediate-generation immigrants (HR 1.20, CI 1.08 to 1.33) in comparison to natives. The excess risk was explained by differences in sociodemographics, morbidity and labour market marginalisation. In the fully adjusted models, a higher HR remained only for the Nordic second generation (HR 1.29, CI 1.09 to 1.52). There were no sex differences in HRs.
   Conclusions The risk of suicide was shown to be lower in the first generation and higher in the second generation compared with natives. The higher HR in the Nordic second generation was not explained by differences in sociodemographics, labour market marginalisation and morbidity. Further research is warranted to investigate factors underlying this excess risk.

AB This paper has a double purpose: to see how well Durkheim's [1897, Le Suicide (Paris: 1 degrees edition)] findings apply a century later, and to see if the beneficial effects of social capital on suicide prevention are parallel to those already found for subjective well-being (Helliwell 2003, Economic Modelling 20(2), pp. 331-360). The results show that more social capital and higher levels of trust are associated with lower national suicide rates, just as they are associated with higher levels of subjective well-being. Furthermore, there is a strong negative correlation between national average suicide rates and measures of life satisfaction. Thus social capital does appear to improve well-being, whether measured by higher average values of life satisfaction or by lower average suicide rates. There is a slight asymmetry, since the very high Scandinavian measures of subjective well-being are not matched by equally low suicide rates. To take the Swedish case as an example, this asymmetry is explained by Sweden having particularly high values of variables that have more weight in explaining life satisfaction than suicide (especially quality of government), and less beneficial values of variables that have more influence in explaining suicide rates (Swedes have low belief in God and high divorce rates), because with the latest data and models the Swedish data fit the well-being and suicide equations with only tiny errors. If the international suicide data pose a puzzle, it is more because suicide rates, and their estimated equations, differ greatly by gender, while life satisfaction and its explanations are similar for men and women.

AB Objective: To consider and evaluate a continuing medical education programme for general practitioners (GPs) on depression in Jamtland county, Sweden, inspired by the Gotland study.
   Method: Interactive seminars were conducted between 1995 and 2002 in Jamtland county. For evaluation, suicide rates and annual sales statistics of antidepressants were compared with national averages. Questionnaires were used for information about attitudes and prescribing habits.
   Results: The suicide rate in Jamtland decreased to the same level as the national average. The use of antidepressants increased from 25% below the Swedish average to the same level. The selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were preferred because of their tolerability. Suicide issues were considered to be most important in the management of depressed patients.
   Conclusion: A trend towards a greater prescription of antidepressants and fewer suicides after an educational programme on depression for GPs replicated the findings from the Gotland study. The educational programme will be conducted annually and could be a model for other regions.

AB Our aim, was to build a model delineating the relationship between attitudes toward suicide and suicidal behavior and to assess equivalence by applying the model on data from different countries. Representative samples from the general population were approached in Sweden, Norway, and Russia with the Attitudes Toward Suicide (ATTS) questionnaire. Data on experience of suicidal behavior among significant others and self-reported suicidal expressions were also collected. Structural equation modeling resulted in gender and country specific models where experience of suicidal behavior among significant others and self-reported suicidal expressions earlier in life predicted attitudes, and attitudes predicted current suicidal expressions. The models included the attitude factors acceptance of suicide, condemnation, and preventability; age and level of education were also incorporated. The different models reveal possible ways to better understand gender and culture-specific paths between attitudes and suicidal behaviors, and their relevance in a suicide prevention context is considered.

AB Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between a series of empirically known risk and protective factors and suicidality among trans people in Sweden.
   Methods: Participants were self-selected anonymously to a web-based survey conducted in 2014. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess associations between contributing factors and suicide ideation in the past 12 months and lifetime suicide attempts.
   Results: The analysis included 796 trans individuals, between 15 and 94 years of age, who live in Sweden. A total of 37% of respondents reported that they have seriously considered suicide during the past 12 months and 32% had ever attempted a suicide. Offensive treatment during the past three months and lifetime exposure to trans-related violence were significantly associated with suicidality. Less satisfaction with contacts with friends and acquaintances and with one's own psychological wellbeing were associated with suicide ideation in the past 12 months. Lack of practical support was associated with lifetime suicide attempts.
   Conclusions: Our findings show that suicidality is directly correlated with trans-related victimization. Preventing targeted victimization is, therefore, a key preventive intervention against this elevated suicidality.

TI Suicide risk and suicide method in patients with personality disorders
SO JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH

DT Article

ID MENTAL-DISORDERS; SELF-HARM; MORTALITY; INTENT
AB Objective: The influence of psychopathology on suicide method has revealed different distributions among different psychiatric disorders. However, evidence is still scarce. We hypothesized that having a diagnosis of personality disorder (PD) affect the suicide method, and that different PD clusters would influence the suicide method in different ways. In addition, we hypothesized that the presence of psychiatric and somatic co-morbidity also affects the suicide method.
   Method: We examined 25,217 individuals aged 15-64 who had been hospitalized in Sweden with a main diagnosis of PD the years 1987-2013 (N = 25,217). The patients were followed from the date of first discharge until death or until the end of the follow-up period, i.e. December 31, 2013, for a total of 323,508.8 person-years, with a mean follow up time of 11.7 years. The SMR, i.e. the ratio between the observed number of suicides and the expected number of suicides, was used as a measure of risk.
   Results: Overall PD, different PD-clusters, and comorbidity influenced the suicide method. Hanging evidenced highest SMR in female PD patients (SMR 34.2 (95% CI: 29.3-39.8)), as compared to non-PD patients and jumping among male PD patients (SMR 24.8 (95% CI: 18.3-33.6)), as compared to non PD-patients. Furthermore, the elevated suicide risk was related to both psychiatric and somatic comorbidity.
   Conclusion: The increased suicide risk was unevenly distributed with respect to suicide method and type of PD. However, these differences were only moderate and greatly overshadowed by the overall excess suicide risk in having PD. Any attempt from society to decrease the suicide rate in persons with PD must take these characteristics into account. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Suicides during pregnancy and 1 year postpartum in Sweden, 1980-2007

   PERINATAL-PERIOD; COMPLICATIONS; PREVALENCE; DEATHS; WOMEN; RISK
AB Background
   Although the incidence of suicide among women who have given birth during the past 12 months is lower than that of women who have not given birth, suicide remains one of the most common causes of death during the year following delivery in high-income countries, such as Sweden.
   Aims
   To characterise women who died by suicide during pregnancy and postpartum from a maternal care perspective.
   Method
   We traced deaths (n = 103) through linkage of the Swedish Cause of Death Register with the Medical Birth and National Patient Registers. We analysed register data and obstetric medical records.
   Results
   The maternal suicide ratio was 3.7 per 100 000 live births for the period 1980-2007, with small magnitude variation over time. The suicide ratio was higher in women born in low-income countries (odds ratio 3.1 (95% CI 1.3-7.7)). Violent suicide methods were common, especially during the first 6 months postpartum. In all, 77 women had received psychiatric care at some point, but 26 women had no documented psychiatric care. Antenatal documentation of psychiatric history was inconsistent. At postpartum discharge, only 20 women had a plan for psychiatric follow-up.
   Conclusions
   Suicide prevention calls for increased clinical awareness and cross-disciplinary maternal care approaches to identify and support women at risk.

AB The aim of this study was to estimate suicide risk during hospitalization and in the year following discharge for patients with mental disorders.
   All suicide cases in Sweden 18 years and older, between 1991 and 2003 (N = 20,675; 70% male), were individually matched to 10 controls from the general Swedish population. Discharge diagnoses in the year before suicide of any mental disorder, mood disorder, schizophrenia spectrum disorder, and alcohol use disorder were identified from the Swedish Patient Register.
   Highest suicide risk during hospitalization and in the year following discharge was found for mood disorder [odds ratio (OR) 55 (95% CI, 47-65) for men and 86 (95% CI, 70-107) for women!, with the risk peaking in the first week following discharge [OR 177 (95% CI, 78-401) for men and OR 268 (95% Cl, 85-846) for women]. Compared to that for mood disorder, the suicide risk for schizophrenia spectrum disorder and alcohol use disorder was about half and more constant over time. The majority of suicide victims with a psychiatric diagnosis had been discharged from psychiatric treatment more than a month before the suicide. Over time, a constant proportion of 25% of the suicide victims had been hospitalized with a mental disorder in the year before suicide (23% of males and 31% of females), despite a significant decrease in psychiatric hospitalizations in the population.
   In conclusion, suicide risk was found to vary by type of mental disorder, time since discharge, and sex. This should be taken into account when planning suicide preventive efforts. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Maternal suicide - Register based study of all suicides occurring after
   delivery in Sweden 1974-2009
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPLETED SUICIDE; MENTAL-DISORDERS; RISK; DEATH; PREGNANCY
AB Background
   Recent research suggests that having a newborn child is associated with substantially reduced risk for maternal suicide. We studied postpartum suicides in a national cohort of mothers and the role of mental disorder, self-harm and delivery related factors.
   Methods
   We used a nested case-control design with data from Swedish registries. The cohort consisted of all women given birth in Sweden 1974-2009. Mothers who died by suicide during follow-up were considered cases (n = 1,786) and risk of suicide was estimated with proximity to delivery as the explanatory variable. In a second step, association between suicide during the first year following delivery (n = 145) and mental disorder, self-harm and delivery related variables risk factors were analyzed.
   Results
   The first postpartum year was associated with a lower risk of suicide, compared to later (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 +/- 0.96), which was unaltered after adjustment for socio-economic status and history of self-harm (aRR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68 +/- 0.99). Compared to living mothers, suicide victims of the postpartum year more often had affective disorders (aRR 133.94, 95% CI 45.93 +/- 390.61), psychotic disorders (aRR 83.69, 95% CI 36.99 +/- 189.31) and history of selfharm (aRR 47.56, 95% CI 18.24 +/- 124.02). The aRR of stillbirth was 2.66 (95% CI 0.63 +/- 11.30).
   Conclusions
   We found only a weak negative association between childbirth during the preceding year and suicide, when using mothers as controls. A severe mental disorder after delivery and a history of self-harm was strongly associated with increased risk of suicide in the postpartum year and may inform the clinical assessment postpartum.

AB Background: Research on future labour market marginalization following suicide attempt at young age is scarce. We investigated the effects of suicide attempts on three labour market outcomes: unemployment, sickness absence and disability pension.
   Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study based on register linkage of 1 613 816 individuals who in 1994 were 16-30 years old and lived in Sweden. Suicide attempters treated in inpatient care during the 3 years preceding study entry, i.e. 1992-94 (N = 5649) were compared with the general population of the same age without suicide attempt between 1973 and 2010 (n = 1 608 167). Hazard ratios (HRs) for long-term unemployment (>180 days), sickness absence (>90 days) and disability pension in 1995-2010 were calculated by Cox regression models, adjusted for a number of parental and individual risk markers, and stratified for previous psychiatric inpatient care not due to suicide attempt.
   Results: The risks for unemployment [HR 1.58; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52-1.64], sickness absence (HR 2.16; 2.08-2.24) and disability pension (HR 4.57; 4.34-4.81) were considerably increased among suicide attempters. There was a dose-response relationship between number of suicide attempts and the risk of disability pension, for individuals both with or without previous psychiatric hospitalizations not due to suicide attempts. No such relationship was present with regard to unemployment.
   Conclusions: This study highlights the strong association of suicide attempts with future marginalization from the labour market, particularly for outcomes that are based on a medical assessment. Studies that focus only on unemployment may largely underestimate the true detrimental impact of suicide attempt on labour market marginalization.

AB Recent studies in Sweden and Scotland have found early life conditions to be associated with increased risk of attempted and completed suicide in adolescence and young adulthood. It is not known, however, whether early life conditions affect suicide risk throughout the life course, from adulthood into old age. We examined the effects of early life conditions, including markers of fetal growth, and social and economic characteristics in adulthood, on risk of suicide by violent and non-violent methods in women and men aged 31-87 years using Cox regression. 11,650 women and men born at the Uppsala University Hospital in Sweden between 1915 and 1929 were followed from 1960 until 2002 using linked records from obstetric archives, Census, population and mortality registries. During 435,039 person-years of follow-up 161 completed suicides (104 in males, 57 in females) were observed. An inverse association was found between lower birthweight-for-gestational age and risk of violent suicide in females, although the association did not reach the conventional level of statistical significance (minimally adjusted HR 2.02, 95% CI (0.88-4.63); Table 4). Being male, unmarried, and in the "other or unknown" social class category in adulthood were independently associated with increased rates of suicide. There was a weak association between higher maternal parity and suicide rates. Our findings suggest differences in effects of fetal growth patterns and perinatal circumstances on suicide risk later in life, and suggest that suicide in adults and in the elderly may be influenced by a different combination of factors than those that influence suicide in adolescence and young adulthood.

TI Deficiencies in healthcare prior to suicide and actions to deal with
   them: a retrospective study of investigations after suicide in Swedish
   healthcare

   EDUCATION; PROGRAM; EVENTS; SYSTEM; RISK
AB Objectives The overall aim of this study was to aggregate the conclusions of all investigations conducted after suicides reported to the supervisory authority in Sweden in 2015, and to identify deficiencies in healthcare found in these investigations; the actions proposed to deal with the deficiencies; the level of the organisational hierarchy (micro-meso-macro) in which the deficiencies and actions were situated; and outcomes of the supervisory authority's decisions.
   Design and setting This is a retrospective study of all reports from Swedish primary and secondary healthcare after suicide to the regulatory authority in Sweden in 2015.
   Results In 55% (n=240) of cases, healthcare providers reported healthcare deficiencies that contributed to suicide; these deficiencies were primarily in 'suicide risk assessment' and 'treatment'. Actions aimed at preventing new suicides were proposed in 80% of cases (n=347). By far, the most frequent actions were 'education and competence', present in 52% of cases (n=227) and did not much correspond with identified deficiencies. Sixty-five per cent of the deficiencies and actions were at microlevel, while the remainders were at mesolevel. In 65% (n=284) of cases, the supervisory authority approved the investigation without further requirements.
   Conclusions The most common identified deficiencies were related to care in the immediate interface between patient and staff. Actions proposed to prevent new suicides were centred on single educational interventions without distinctive sustainable effects in the organisations and usually did not correspond with the identified deficiencies. Future research should examine if application of a framework based on knowledge of the suicide process, suicide prevention strategies and patient safety would enable more sophisticated investigations that could facilitate progress on suicide prevention.

AB Objective To investigate the influence of adherence to psychotropic medications upon the risk of completed suicide by comparing person-level prescriptions and postmortem toxicological findings among complete-suicide cases and non-suicide controls in Sweden 2006-2013. Methods Using national registries with full coverage on dispensed prescriptions, results of medico-legal autopsies, causes of death, and diagnoses from inpatient care, estimated continuous drug use for 30 commonly prescribed psychotropic medications was compared with forensic-toxicological findings. Subjects who had died by suicide (cases) were matched (1:2) with subjects who had died of other causes (controls) for age, sex, and year of death. Odds ratios were calculated using logistic regression to estimate the risk of completed suicide conferred by partial adherence and non-adherence to pharmacotherapy. Adjustments were made for previous inpatient care and the ratio of initiated and discontinued dispensed prescriptions, a measure of the continued need of treatment preceding death. Results In 5294 suicide cases and 9879 non-suicide controls, after adjusting for the dispensation ratio and other covariates, partial adherence and non-adherence to antipsychotics were associated with 6.7-fold and 12.4-fold risks of completed suicide, respectively, whereas corresponding risk estimates for antidepressant treatment were not statistically significant and corresponding risk increases for incomplete adherence to antidepressant treatment were lower (1.6-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively) and lacked statistical significance. Conclusion After adjustment for the need of treatment, biochemically verified incomplete adherence to antipsychotic pharmacotherapy was associated with markedly increased risks of completed suicide.

SO LANCET

ID MENTAL-HEALTH; INTERNATIONAL ADOPTEES; LOWER THRESHOLD; FOLLOW-UP;
   ADOLESCENTS; CHILDREN; ATTACHMENT; ADJUSTMENT; ADOPTION; PARENTS
AB Background Many intercountry adoptees are reaching adolescence in western Europe and the USA, and the mental health and social adjustment of these individuals as adolescents and young adults has now become an important issue. We aimed to assess mental health disorders and social maladjustment in adolescence and young adulthood in intercountry adoptees in Sweden.
   Method Our data was obtained from the Swedish national registers for the cohort born in 1970-79. We used multivariate Cox's regression models of person-years to compare indicators of suicide death (1986-95), court sentences (1986-93), and discharges for psychiatric illness, suicide attempts, and substance abuse (1987-94) in 11320 intercountry adoptees with 2343 Swedish-born siblings, 4006 immigrant children, and a general population of 853 419 Swedish-born residents.
   Findings After adjustment for major sociodemographic confounders, intercountry adoptees were more likely than other Swedish-born children to die from suicide (odds ratio 3.6, 95% Cl 2.1-5.9); attempt suicide (3.6, 3.1-4.2); be admitted for a psychiatric disorder (3.2, 2.9-3.6), drug abuse (5.2, 2.9-9.3) or alcohol abuse (2.6, 2.0-3.3); or to commit a crime (1.6, 1.5-1.7). Siblings in adoptive homes had lower odds ratios for most outcomes than did adoptees, whereas adoptees and immigrant children had much the same odds ratios.
   Interpretation Adoptees in Sweden have a high risk for severe mental health problems and social maladjustment in adolescence and young adulthood. We advise professionals to give appropriate consideration to the high risk of suicide in patients who are intercountry adoptees.

TI Do macroeconomic contractions induce or 'harvest' suicides? A test of

SO JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH

DT Article
ID TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS; MENTAL-HEALTH; GREAT RECESSION; YOUNG MEN;
   UNEMPLOYMENT; MORTALITY; GENDER; COHORT; IMPACT; RISK
AB Background Researchers often invoke a mortality displacement or 'harvesting' mechanism to explain mortality patterns, such that those with underlying health vulnerabilities die sooner than expected in response to environmental phenomena, such as heat waves, cold spells and air pollution. It is unclear if this displacement mechanism might also explain observed increases in suicide following economic contraction, or if suicides are induced in persons otherwise unlikely to engage in self-destructive behaviour. Here, we test two competing hypotheses explaining an observed increase in suicides following unemployment-induction or displacement.
   Methods We apply time series methods to monthly suicide and unemployment data from Sweden for the years 2000-2011. Tests are conducted separately for working age (20-64 years old) men and women as well as older (aged 65 years and older) men and women.
   Results Displacement appeared among older men and women; an unexpected rise in unemployment predicted an increase in suicides 6 months later, followed by a significant decrease 8 months later. Induction appeared among working age men, but not among working age women; an unexpected rise in unemployment predicted an increase in suicides 4-6 months later.
   Conclusions Displacement and induction both appear to have operated following unexpected labour market contractions in Sweden, though with different population segments.

SO DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE alcohol; Canada; suicide; time-series analyses
ID UNITED-STATES; CONSUMPTION; MORTALITY; RATES
AB Studies suggest that the population level link between alcohol and suicide differs across countries and between men and women. The aim of this paper was to estimate the relationship between alcohol consumption and suicide in Canada and to put the results in a comparative perspective. The relationship was elucidated for whole Canada, different provinces and also separately for men and women. The total suicide rate in Canada increased signicantly by around 4% as alcohol consumption increased by one litre per capita, suggesting that approximately 25 - 30% of Canadian suicides were related to alcohol. The relationship was stronger for women than for men. A signicant effect was found in all provinces except from Quebec, but the overall regional variation was not statistically signicant. In an international perspective, the relationship for women was somewhat weaker than in Sweden and Norway, but larger than in Finland, the United States and Southern European countries. For men, the association was similar to what is found in the United States and Finland, weaker than in Sweden, Norway and Russia but stronger than in Southern European countries. The results only partly support the idea that intoxication frequency explains national differences in this relationship. Possible explanations for the stronger association among women are also discussed.

Data were collected through face-to-face interview. Hindus differed from Muslims regarding suicidal attempts among family (chi (2) = 12.356, p < .002) and community members (chi (2) = 20.425, p < .000). Our study also showed that suicidal behaviours were comparatively low among Muslim participants than Hindus. Further, Muslims hold more negative attitudes towards suicide than Hindus. An enhanced understanding of attitudes towards suicide among general population may be crucial to plan educational, intervention and prevention programs.

ID MORTALITY; PSYCHOSIS; VICTIMS
AB Objective To investigate suicide ideation and behavior as risk factors for suicide in schizophrenia during varying time periods. Method Cases were 84 patients who died by suicide within 5 years from diagnosis in a source population of patients discharged for the first time from psychiatric hospitals in Stockholm County, Sweden, with a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis. One control was individually matched with each suicide case. Data were retrieved from clinical records in a blind fashion. Thoughts of death, thoughts of suicide, suicide plan, and suicide attempt during varying time periods were investigated as risk factors for subsequent completed suicide. Results In adjusted analyses, thoughts of suicide, suicide plan, and suicide attempt were significantly associated with subsequent completed suicide in the following year. The highest suicide risk was found within a year following suicide attempt (adjusted OR 9.9, 95% confidence interval 2.5-39.0). The association between suicide ideation and behavior and subsequent suicide declined over time. Conclusions Several types of suicide ideation and behavior were associated with suicide, and the association was stronger for suicidal behavior. The clinical significance of suicidal communication appears highest during the following month or/and year. Many suicides occurred without recorded short-term suicidal communication.

AB Nonfatal heroin overdoses and suicide attempts are both common among heroin addicts, but there is limited knowledge about the association between them. The sample in the present study consisted of 149 regular heroin users in Malmo, Sweden. Out of these 98 had taken an unintentional heroin overdose at some time and 51 had made at least one attempt to commit suicide (but not using heroin). Suicide attempts were significantly more common among those who had taken unintentional overdoses as compared with those who had never taken any overdose (p < 0.01). The more overdoses, the greater the risk of suicide attempt.

AB In the light of the more than 1.5 million annual suicide deaths worldwide projected for 2020, suicide prevention is clearly a high priority. Moreover, the goal of suicide prevention is achievable (Wasserman, 2004). This chapter describes theoretical aspects such as the familiar primary, secondary, and tertiary model of suicide prevention, and compares it with the US Institute of Medicine model which adopts universal, selective, and indicated approaches. Suicide preventive efforts of inter-governmental bodies, such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and European Union (EU), and area-specific programmes in Sweden, Uganda, Hong Kong, and Japan are also discussed as examples. Systematic inter-governmental collaboration, between policy planners, relevant decision-makers, clinicians, professional organizations, as well as researchers is a prerequisite in the successful prevention of suicides.

AB PurposePrior research has documented an association between unemployment and elevated suicide risk. Yet, few Swedish studies have explicitly considered how such risk may vary by different migration background characteristics among persons of foreign-origin, who often experience diverse forms of labor market marginalization. This study examines the extent to which unemployment status may differentially influence suicide risk among the foreign-origin by generational status, region of origin, age at arrival, and duration of residence.MethodsPopulation-based registers were used to conduct a longitudinal, open cohort study of native-origin and foreign-origin Swedish residents of working age (25-64years) from 1993 to 2008. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for suicide mortality were estimated using gender-stratified Cox proportional hazards models.ResultsElevated suicide risk observed among foreign-origin unemployed groups was generally of a similar or lower magnitude than that found in unemployed native-origin, although unemployed second-generation Swedish men demonstrated significantly greater (p<0.05) excess risk of suicide than that observed among their native-origin counterparts. Unemployed foreign-born men with a younger age at arrival and longer duration of residence demonstrated an increased risk of suicide, while those who arrived as adults, and a shorter duration of residence did not show any increased risk. Among foreign-born women, excess suicide risk persisted regardless of age at arrival and duration of residence in the long-term unemployed.ConclusionsMultiple migration background characteristics should be considered when examining relationships between employment status and suicide among the foreign-origin.

ID SELF-HARM; EPILEPSY
AB In their article Poststroke suicide attempts and completed suicides: A socioeconomic and nationwide perspective,(1) Dr. Eriksson and colleagues focused on suicide after a serious brain injury (stroke). The authors work at Umea University in Sweden and the study was supported by the Swedish Council for Health and the Swedish Research Council. The study followed more than 220,000 people for 12 years after their stroke. Within this group, the authors counted the number of people who were admitted to a hospital for a suicide attempt and the number of people who died due to suicide. They found that younger less-educated men who had a more severe stroke had the highest risk of suicide following stroke. This is an important finding because by identifying groups at risk, steps can be taken to prevent this serious stroke-related problem.

AB Objective: To determine how psychological premorbidity affects the risk of depression in parents who lost a child through suicide.
   Design: Population-based survey.
   Setting: Sweden, between 2009 and 2010.
   Participants: All parents who lost a child, age 15-30, through suicide between 2004 and 2007 according to National population registries. Non-bereaved parents matched for age, sex, living area, marital status, number of children. Exclusion criteria: born outside a Nordic country, not Swedish speaking, contact details missing. Participants: 666 of 915 (73%) suicide-bereaved and 377 of 508 (74%) non-bereaved parents.
   Main outcome measures: Depression measured by the nine-item depression scale of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and study-specific questions to assess psychological premorbidity and experience of the child's presuicidal morbidity.
   Results: In all, 94 (14%) suicide-bereaved and 51 (14%) non-bereaved parents (relative risk 1.0; 95% CI 0.8 to 1.4) had received their first treatment for psychological problems or had been given a psychiatric diagnosis more than 10 years earlier. The prevalence of moderate-to-severe depression was 115 (18%) in suicide-bereaved versus 28 (7%) in non-bereaved parents (RR 2.3; 95% CI 1.6 to 3.5). For those without psychological premorbidity, the relative risk was 2.3 (95% CI 1.4 to 3.6). 339 (51%) suicide-bereaved parents expressed worry over the child's psychological health during the month preceding the suicide and 259 (39%) had anticipated the suicide.
   Conclusions: In parents who lost a child through suicide in Sweden we did not find a higher prevalence of long-term psychological premorbidity than among parents who had not lost a child; the more than twofold risk of depression among the bereaved can probably be explained by the suicide and the stressful time preceding the suicide.

AB Background: Studies based on large data sets investigating a wide range of risk indicators on suicidal behavior in patients with depressive disorders are sparse. This study aimed to examine the association of sick-leave measured in different ways on one hand and socio-demographics, medication, and health care on the other hand with suicide attempt and suicide among patients with depressive disorders.
   Methods: This is a population-based prospective cohort study using nationwide register data. All individuals who lived in Sweden 31.12.2004, then aged 16-64 years, and had psychiatric in- or outpatient care due to depressive disorders in 2005 were included (N=21,096). Univariate and multivariate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (Cl) with regard to suicide attempt and suicide during 2006-2010 were estimated by Cox regression.
   Results: Those with new sick-leave spells, full-time spells, spells due to mental diagnoses and exceeding one year and those having > 1 sick-leave spells had a higher risk of suicide attempt. Female sex, young age, lower education, living alone, prescription of antidepressants and anxiolytics, inpatient health care, and suicide attempts resulted in higher HRs of suicide attempt in the multivariate analyses (range of HRs 1.17-3.28). Male sex, combined antidepressant and anxiolytic prescription, mental inpatient health care, and suicide attempts predicted subsequent suicide (range of HRs 1.84-3.33). Limitations: Focus on specialized health care limited generalization.
   Conclusions: Sickness absence, social-demographics, and medical determinants were associated with suicidal behavior. These risk indicators should be considered when monitoring individuals with depressive disorders and assessing suicide risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier By. All rights reserved,

AB Objectives The death of a sibling can trigger grief and depression. Sibling deaths from external causes may be particularly detrimental, since they are often sudden. We aimed to examine the association between the death of an adult sibling from external causes and the risk of suicide among surviving siblings up to 18years after bereavement. We adjusted for intrafamily correlation in death risks, which might occur because of shared genetics and shared early-life experiences of siblings in the same family.
   Design A follow-up study between 1981 and 2002 based on the total population.
   Setting Sweden.
   Participants Swedes aged 25-64years (n=1748069).
   Primary and secondary outcome measures Suicide from the Swedish cause of death register.
   Results An increased risk of mortality from suicide was found among persons who had experienced the death of a sibling. In women, the suicide risk was 1.55 times that of non-bereaved persons (95% CI 0.99 to 2.44), and in men it was 1.28 times higher (95% CI 0.93 to 1.77). If one sibling committed suicide, the risk of the remaining sibling also committing suicide was 3.19 (95% CI 1.23 to 8.25) among women and 2.44 (95% CI 1.34 to 4.45) among men. Associations with other main causes of deathsuch as external other than suicide, cardiovascular diseases or cancerwere generally much smaller and statistically not significant in either sex. We found no clear support for a specific time pattern according to time since a sibling's death.
   Conclusions Our study provided evidence for suicide risk associated with the death of a sibling at adult age, revealing that bereaved persons' risk of suicide is higher when siblings die from suicide, even when adjusting for intrafamily correlation in death risks.

AB Background. The aim of the present study was to investigate trajectories of suicide attempt risks before and after granting of disability pension in young people.
   Method. The analytic sample consisted of all persons 16-30 years old and living in Sweden who were granted a disability pension in the years 1995-1997; 2000-2002 as well as 2005-2006 (n=26624). Crude risks and adjusted odds ratios for suicide attempt were computed for the 9-year window around the year of disability pension receipt by repeated-measures logistic regressions.
   Results. The risk of suicide attempt was found to increase continuously up to the year preceding the granting of disability pension in young people, after which the risk declined. These trajectories were similar for women and men and for disability pension due to mental and somatic diagnoses. Still, the multivariate odds ratios for suicide attempts for women and for disability pension due to mental disorders were 2.5- and 3.8-fold increased compared with the odds ratios for men and disability pension due to somatic disorders, respectively. Trajectories of suicide attempts differed for young individuals granted a disability pension during 2005-2006 compared with those granted during 1995-1997 and 2000-2002.
   Conclusions. We found an increasing risk of suicide attempt up until the granting of a disability pension in young individuals, after which the risk decreased. It is of clinical importance to monitor suicide attempt risk among young people waiting for the granting of a disability pension.

AB The objective of this study is to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of suicides in commuting railway environments. Data on suicides in Stockholm commuting railway from 2006 to 2013 was analysed. The study sets out to identify significant clusters in suicides then evaluate whether commuting railway environments affect variations in suicide rates. Fieldwork inspection, spatial cluster techniques (NNHC and Getis-Ord statistics) and regression models underlie the methodology of study. Findings show no seasonality was observed in suicide cases, but winter months concentrate a larger share of events. Suicides do not occur evenly throughout the day but tend to take place more often in weekdays. Modelling findings shows that suicide rates increase with speed trains and decrease where barriers along tracks are installed. Although high speed trains are still a motive of concern for suicide prevention, findings call for a whole railway-approach to safety - one that extends maintenance beyond the platforms and stations' vicinities.

AB Acts of suicide on railways represent a serious public health and railway safety problem. Suicides constitute about 75% of all deaths in person-train collisions in Sweden. The aim of the study is to evaluate existing police and rail administration reports on railway suicide incidents from a preventive perspective, and to identify and categorize additional preventive-oriented information. Twenty-two cases of railway suicide have been reviewed, based on regular police and rail administration reports plus observations from complementary site visits. Findings: Neither police nor rail administration reports include sufficient information to guide future safety work. Findings from site visits show that structured preventive-oriented investigation routines may add important complementary details. Relevant data on behavioural, technical and environmental circumstances facilitating railway suicide need to be collected and analyzed by those responsible on a regular basis as an integral part of their safety work.

AB Objective: The author hypothesized, based on research until 1991, that a five-fold increase in the use of antidepressants might reduce Swedish suicide rates by 25%. A subsequent 3.5-fold increase in the use of antidepressants provided a 'natural experimental situation' for prospectively testing this hypothesis.
   Method: Swedish statistics on suicide, use of antidepressants, unemployment and alcohol consumption were obtained for 1978-96. Time-series of the latter variables were compared with suicide rates. Demographic subgroups regarding age, gender and county were analysed. Suicide rates were also compared with the use of antidepressants in Denmark, Norway and Finland.
   Results: Suicide rates decreased in accordance with the a priori hypothesis. Alcohol consumption and unemployment rates did not correlate well with suicide rates.
   Conclusion: This naturalistic study is not conclusive. The increased use of antidepressants appears, however, to be one of the contributing factors to the decrease in the suicide rate. It is of great scientific and clinical importance that this be evaluated by further studies.

TI Management of suicide attempts in Italy and Sweden - A comparison of

SO GENERAL HOSPITAL PSYCHIATRY

DT Article
ID CARE
AB The aim of the study was to compare the management of suicide attempts by patients in Sweden and Italy with a view to providing a perspective on differences in treatment. Two consecutive samples of suicide attempters from Huddinge (n=97) and Padua (n=100) were studied in trans of sociodemographic characteristics previous care, referral, medical and psychiatric care, hospitalization, aftercare and short-term compliance. In Italian somatic management of acute suicidal crises, there are more physicians specializing in anesthesia or internal medicine working in ambulances and emergency wards, and there is a heavier emphasis on somatic care. Swedish management procedures seem to entail more medical examinations and biohumoral tests. Moreover, the procedures at the Swedish hospital give priority to early psychiatric intervention, and admission to psychiatric inpatient care is more frequent. However, it is not normal practice in emergency psychiatric care at either of the centers for specialists to serve in the immediate liaison consultation. There are differences in assessment and treatment between the two countries that may provide a perspective on their procedures, implying that current procedures for managing patients belonging to groups identified as "high-risk" in terms of suicide may be modified.

AB Background: Suicide rates among physicians are higher than in the general population, and rates among female physicians are particularly high. More female than male physicians report suicidal thoughts, with suicidal ideation being a well-recognized precursor of suicide. The urgent need to find the reasons for suicide risk in female physicians is underscored by society's increasing dependence on this group of health care providers.
   Objective: The aim of this paper was to identify potential risk and protective factors associated with recent suicidal ideation in female physicians.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey analysis of work-related health, organizational culture, career paths, and working conditions was performed among permanently employed female physicians from the HOUPE (Health and Organisation among University Physicians ill four European countries) study: 385 in Sweden and 126 in Italy. The main outcome measure was recent (within the prior 12 months) suicidal thoughts.
   Results: Overall, 13.7% and 14.3% of the participants from Sweden and Italy, respectively, reported suicidal thoughts within the prior 12 months. Among the physicians from Sweden, the most powerful multivariate model for such thoughts included 2 independent variables related to work: degrading experiences/harassment at work (odds ratio [OR], 3.03; 95% CI, 1.48-6.23), and work meetings to discuss stressful Situations (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.19-0.69). The model included self-diagnosis and self-treatment as a significant factor. Work meetings to discuss stressful situations were also in the multivariate model for the Italian physicians (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05-0.86), together with being given work assignments without adequate resources (OR, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.32-18.8). Significant non-work-related factors in the Italian model were younger age and seeking professional help for depression or burnout.
   Conclusions: In both Sweden and Italy, work stressors have been identified that may increase the risk for suicide for female physicians. A potential protective factor was meetings to discuss stressful work experiences. These findings suggest that such meetings should be more broadly implemented.

AB Aim This study aims to investigate suicide risk factors after attempted suicide and whether and how these risk factors differ between the sexes. Method A total of 1052 suicide attempters admitted to the Medical Emergency Inpatient Unit, Lund University Hospital, Sweden were followed up concerning suicide and death from other causes after a median period of 6 years and 5 months. in all, 50 persons committed suicide during follow-up. At the index suicide attempt, socio-demographic data and information about clinical characteristics were gathered in a standardised manner. Risk factors were identified among these data using survival analyses for the whole sample and for each sex separately. Result Men had a higher frequency of suicide and a greater overall mortality than women. Cox regressions showed that suicide attempt(s) prior to the index attempt and the use of a violent method for the index attempt were risk factors for men only, whereas older age and a high suicidal intent (Beck SIS score) were female ones. Major depression was a risk factor for both sexes. Conclusion More attention probably needs to be paid to the importance of gender in assessment of suicide risk and treatment of suicide attempters.

AB Backgrounds: Stricter regulations including time limits for sick leave have been introduced in Sweden in 2008, which might have resulted in higher morbidity in those on longer sick-leave spells after the introduction. This study aimed to examine (i) the association between all-cause and diagnosis-specific sickness absence and sick-leave duration with subsequent morbidity and suicide mortality and (ii) differences in socio-demographics and morbidity in individuals on sickness absence regarding changes of social insurance regulations. Methods: A population-based prospective study was conducted of two cohorts of individuals who lived in Sweden, aged between 20 and 64 years at 31 December 2005 (n = 4 477 678) and at 31 December 2008 (n = 4 500 400), respectively. Each of the cohorts was followed regarding inpatient healthcare and suicide. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated by Cox regression models. Results: In the multivariate analyses, all-cause and diagnosis-specific sickness absence and sick-leave duration showed higher HRs for inpatient care and suicide in both cohorts (range of HR: 1.10-2.59). HRs of inpatient care and suicide among individuals with mental sickness absence 2009 were reduced more after controlling for morbidity-related covariates, than such sickness absence in 2006. Individuals with mental and somatic sickness absence and sickness absence > 180 days in 2009 had higher HRs of somatic inpatient care than those on sickness absence in 2006. Conclusions: Diagnosis-specific sickness absence and long-term sickness absence in 2009 might be associated with more severe morbidity or work incapacity than in 2006 due to the stricter regulations.

ID ECONOMY
AB In a seminal Swedish study, Gemmill and colleagues pursued whether suicides after economic contractions might reflect an "induction" process whereby economic change induces suicide in those otherwise unlikely to engage in self-destructive behavior, or a "displacement" process whereby economic contractions effectively bring forward suicides that would have occurred eventually, and found support for both hypotheses. We therefore undertook a replication study examining the hypotheses in the Australian state of New South Wales, analyzing suicide data for the same period as examined in Sweden (i.e., 2000-2011) and also over an extended period of 1978 to 2015. Our analyses failed to replicate findings from the Swedish study in that we found greater support for the induction hypothesis. Significant associations varied across sex and age groups. Our findings support the longstanding Durkheim hypothesis that suicide rates increase during times of low social integration and as a consequence of the economic changes acting as a precipitant stressor.

AB Objective
   To assess trends in the use of antidepressants among young suicides after the warning that these drugs might increase the risk of suicide.
   Method
   Individual data of all 845 suicides in the 10- to 19-year age group in Sweden in the time period 1992-2003 (baseline), and in 2004-2010 (after the warning). Outcome data are prescriptions of antidepressants prior to death and detections of antidepressants in post-mortem toxicology.
   Results
   After the warning, suicide in this age group increased for five consecutive years (60.5%). The increase occurred among individuals not treated with antidepressants.
   Conclusion
   This study provides further support for the hypothesis that the warning, contrary to its intention, may have increased young suicides by leaving a number of suicidal young persons without treatment with antidepressants.

AB Temporal aspects of suicide risk after homicide using survival analytic method are not fully known and the risk estimates are almost exclusively based on studies of less than 10 years of follow-up. We investigated a population based cohort of 167 Swedish homicide offenders from 1970 to 1980 for which causes of death during the following minimum of 22 years were investigated using survival analysis. Twenty nine suicides (17.4%) occurred during the follow-up representing 30% of the total mortality. A high proportion of suicides (72%) occurred early, within 2 years after the homicide. The suicides continued to accumulate during the following decades after the homicide and the cumulative suicide risk was 18.6%. A very high proportion of violent suicide method (86%) was found.
   Suicide mortality was heavily skewed towards the first years after the homicide. Homicide offenders have very high short term suicide risk and the suicide risk persists over the entire adult lifespan. Homicide is a strong predictor of future suicide and similar biological mechanisms may be involved in violent criminality and suicidal behavior.

AB Objective: To assess excess mortality among suicide attempters compared to the general population.
   Method: Remaining life expectancy was calculated for a nationwide cohort of all 187 894 persons 18 years or older hospitalised for the first time attempted suicide in Sweden in 1971-2010.
   Results: Life expectancy was shortened throughout the lifespan for both men and women debuting with suicide attempt. The reduction in life expectancy for men debuting with a suicide attempt at 20 years of age was 18 years while the reduction for men debuting at 50 years of age was 10 years. For women attempting suicide, the life expectancy was shortened by 11 and 8 years respectively. The gender difference in life expectancy attenuated in patients making their first suicide attempt at age 70 years or older. Suicide deaths explained about 20% of the total mortality within 10 years of the suicide attempt and 5% in those with duration of four decades since the first suicide attempt.
   Conclusion: The life expectancy is dramatically reduced in patients attempting suicide. With most excess deaths being due to physical health conditions, public efforts should be directed both towards improving physical health and to prevent suicide.

AB To determine whether the effect of antidepressant exposure on suicide rate is modified by age and gender in Hungary, annual anti depressant prescription rates and suicide rates of about 10 million inhabitants between 1999-2005 were analyzed by age and gender groups. The suicide rate was inversely related to the increased use of antidepressants in both genders. The strongest association was found in the oldest age groups, where the increase in antidepressant use was highest, while there was no association in the under 20 or 50-69 age groups in either gender. Antidepressant prescription rate was related to suicide rate after controlling for divorce rate or unemployment rate, but not after controlling for alcohol consumption rate.

AB We conducted a psychological autopsy study to further understand youth suicide in Utah. While traditional psychological autopsy studies primarily focus on the administration of psychometric measures to identify any underlying diagnosis of mental illness for the suicide decedent, we focused our interviews to identify which contacts in the decedent's life recognized risk factors for suicidal behavior, symptoms of mental illness, as well as barriers to mental health treatment for the decedent. Parents and friends recognized most symptoms universally, although friends better recognized symptoms of substance abuse than any other contact. The study results suggest that parents and friends are the most appropriate individuals for gatekeeper training and, in conjunction with other innovative screening programs, may be an effective strategy in reducing adolescent suicide.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was, on the basis of data from healthcare registers, to describe the adequacy or psychopharmacological treatment in suicides.
   Method: Data on consecutive suicides in a Danish County (Funen) in the period of 1 April 1991-31 December 1995 were identified in the Danish Psychiatric Central Register, the National Patient Register, the National Health Insurance and Odense University Pharmacoepidemiological Database.
   Results: Twenty-five per cent of the suicides previously hospitalized due to affective disorders and 3% of the suicides without psychiatric hospitalizations at all, received an apparently adequate treatment with antidepressants the month before suicide.
   Conclusion: The most striking finding was the insufficiency of treatment with antidepressants in the group of suicides without psychiatric hospitalization, in particular in light of the fact that depression is assumed to be present in at least 50% of all suicides.

AB Suicide is a major public health concern all over the world. Five percent of all suicides in Sweden occur on railways, and from a railway safety perspective suicide constitutes a majority (about 75%) of all railway-related fatalities. The aim of this study is to explore preferences for preventative strategies against railway suicide among relevant professional groups. A focus group approach was chosen. Based on a pre-designed model, themes raised for discussion included reducing attractiveness, physical barriers, psychological deterrents, technical surveillance and train design properties, each of them resulting in some concrete measures proposed by the participants. We found a general acceptance and understanding among practitioners of our earlier theoretically derived strategies to prevent railway suicide, although individual participants expressed some scepticism regarding how far one can go in hindering determined individuals. Several concrete proposals were met with optimistic expectation and support.

AB Objective: To determine whether death ideation in late life is associated with markers of elevated risk for suicide, or reflects normal psychological processes in later life. Design/Setting: Population-based cross-sectional study in Gothenburg, Sweden. Participants: The sample consists of 345 men and women of age 85 years (born 1901-1902) and living in Gothenburg, Sweden. Main Outcome Measures: The Paykel Scale measured the most severe level of suicidality over an individual's lifetime. Other key measures were severity of depression and anxiety and frequency of death/suicidal ideation over the previous month. Results: Latent class analysis revealed distinct groups of older adults who reported recent death ideation. Recent death ideation did not occur apart from other risk factors for suicide; instead individuals reporting recent death ideation also reported either 1) recent high levels of depression and anxiety, or 2) more distant histories of serious suicidal ideation (indicative of worst point severity of suicidal ideation)-both of which elevate risk for eventual suicide. Conclusions: Our results indicate a heterogeneous presentation of older adults who report death ideation, with some presenting with acute distress and suicidal thoughts, and others presenting with low distress but histories of serious suicidal ideation. The presence of death ideation is associated with markers of increased risk for suicide, including "worst point" active suicidal ideation.

AB Results from previous studies of suicide risk among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are inconsistent. This may be explained partly by differences in methodology and study populations. The purpose of our study was to investigate suicide risk among hospital patients with MS in Sweden. During the period 1969-1996,12,834 cases were recorded in the Swedish Hospital Inpatient Register, with 77,377 hospital admissions, in which MS was a primary or secondary diagnosis at discharge. The mean follow-up time for the whole cohort was 9.9 (SD 7.3) years. When the data for these MS patients were linked to the Swedish Causes of Death Register for the same period, 5,052 (39.4%) were found to have died. Among the 5,052 deaths, suicide was an underlying cause of death in 90 cases (11.8%). The mean period between the initial admission date with an MS diagnosis at discharge and the date of death for the 90 MS suicide cases was 5.8 (SD 5.1) years. This was significantly shorter (p = 0.002) than the mean of 7.9 (SD 6.4) years for MS cases who died due to other causes. Suicide risk, calculated as the standardized mortality ratio (SMR), was significantly elevated (SMR = 2.3) among both male and female MS cases compared with the general population. Suicide risk was particularly high in the first year after initial admission with an MS diagnosis, and among younger male MS cases. The mean age at the time of suicide was 44.5 (SD 12.4) years, and 58% of the suicides were committed within 5 years after the first admission with an MS diagnosis. The crude suicide rate among MS patients during the study period was 71 per 100,000 person-years. The rate was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in males (114) than in females (47), with an odds ratio of 2.4 (95% Cl: 1.6-3.8). These findings have implications for suicide preventive measures in neurological practice. Copyright (C) 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.

ID PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSY
AB The number of practising psychiatrists in Sweden has increased by nearly 30% between the years 1995-2009; however, the profession has suffered serious recruitment difficulties. The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare estimated that about 5-10% of the population is in need of psychiatric treatment, but only 3-4% seek psychiatric care. Among patients who receive psychiatric care, approximately 47% are treated with psychopharmacology, 13% are treated with psychotherapy and 40% receive both treatments. There are still challenges facing Swedish psychiatry: reduction in waiting times for psychiatric care, broader accessibility of evidence-based treatment methods for all groups of psychiatric patients both in rural and urban areas, and targeting the needs of immigrants and refugees. The allocation of resources to psychiatric research, and development of novel treatment methods are crucially needed. The Swedish government is strongly committed to decreasing the number of suicides, as there are approximately 1,400 individuals lost to suicide every year in a country with a population of around 10 million. Given that nearly 20% of all suicides are amongst psychiatric inpatients, a regulation has been passed regarding the analysis of all completed suicides in the healthcare system. Results from these analyses can be used for increasing quality of treatment.

AB The purpose of the present study was to investigate the distribution of suicide during the months of the year and the days of the week in severe depression. A total of 1206 in-patients rated at discharge from the Department of Psychiatry, Lund, Sweden, on a multiaxial diagnostic schedule received the diagnosis severe depression/melancholia between 1956 to 1969. When followed up to 1998, a total of 114 depressed patients had taken their own life. Out of these, 98 patients appeared to have a primary depression. The monthly distribution of suicides showed a significant peak in October/November for men (41 % of all male suicides). No correlation with the onset of depression could be detected. Furthermore, there was a preponderance of suicide on Sundays for both sexes (31 % of all suicides).

AB Background Studies of suicide in first-generation immigrants have consistently shown higher rates compared to their country of origin. Little is known about the risk of suicide in second-generation immigrants and intercountry adoptees. The aim of this study was to investigate rates of suicide death in second-generation immigrants and intercountry adoptees in comparison with their parental generation and the majority population. Method The study was based on multivariate analyses of register data on suicide death during 1990-98 in a Swedish national cohort of 2.7 million residents (10-68 years). Results Second-generation immigrants tended to have higher odds than the first-generation immigrants compared to the majority population in all six minority groups studied. The Finnish minority had the highest and the Middle Easterners the lowest odds for suicide death in both generations of immigrants. The intercountry adoptees had very high odds for suicide death (adjusted OR: 5.0; 95% CI 3.5-7.0). Conclusions Second-generation immigrants are at greater risk for suicide death than their parental generation. Intercountry adoptees should be of particular concern in suicide prevention.

AB Background: Individuals involved in out-of-home care are at higher risk of death by suicide. We aimed to determine whether parents with two generations of involvement in out-of-home care (themselves as children, and their own children) are at increased risk of death by suicide than parents with no involvement or parents with one generation of involvement in out-of-home care.
   Method: This population-based cohort study included all individuals born in Sweden between 1973 and 1980 who had at least one child between 1990 and 2012 (n=487,948). Women (n=259,275) and men (n=228,673) were examined separately.
   Results: When compared with mothers with no involvement in out-of-home care, mothers with two generations of involvement were at more than five times greater risk of death by suicide (aHR=5.52; 95% CI 2.91-10.46); mothers with one generation of involvement were also at significantly higher risk of death by suicide (mothers were in care as children: aHR=2.35; 95% CI 1.27-4.35; child was placed in care: aHR=3.23; 95% CI 1.79-5.83). Involvement in out-of-home care (in either generation) did not affect risk of death by suicide for fathers.
   Limitations: Reason for placement in out-of-home care is not known; these reasons could also be associated with risk of death by suicide
   Conclusion: Mothers with involvement in out- of-home care, either as children or when their child was placed in care, are at significantly higher risk of death by suicide. Mental health services should be provided to individuals involved in out-of-home care.

AB A study of mortality for all patients with a first hospital diagnosis of schizophrenia in Stockholm County, Sweden, during 1973 to 1995 was performed, by linking the in-patient register with the national cause-of-death register. Overall and cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated by 5-year age classes and 5-year calendar time periods. The number of excess deaths was calculated by reducing the observed number of deaths by those expected. Our results confirmed a marked increase in mortality in schizophrenia both in males and females. Natural (somatic) causes of death was the main cause of excess deaths, with more than half of the excess deaths in females, and almost half of the excess deaths in males. Suicide was the specific cause of the largest number of excess deaths in males, while in females it was cardiovascular disease. SMRs were increased in both natural and unnatural causes of death, with 2.8 for males and 2.4 for females for all deaths, but were highest in suicide with 15.7 for males and 19.7 for females, and in unspecified violence with 11.7 for males and 9.9 for females. SMRs in suicide were especially high in young patients in the first year after the first diagnosis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB By studying the number and method of homicidal poisoning in Miami-Dade County, Florida; New York City, NY; Oakland County, Michigan; and Sweden, we have confirmed that this is an infrequently established crime.
   Several difficulties come with the detection of homicidal poisonings. Presenting symptoms and signs are often misdiagnosed as natural disease, especially if the crime is committed in a hospital environment, suggesting that an unknown number of homicides go undetected.
   In the reported cases analyzed, the lethal agent of choice has changed over the years. In earlier years, traditional poisons such as arsenic, cyanide, and parathion were frequently used. Such poisonings are nowadays rare, and instead, narcotics are more commonly detected in victims of this crime.

AB Depression has been identified as occurring in the majority of people who commit suicide. Effective antidepressant medications have been available for over half a century. It seems logical to conclude that treatment of depression with antidepressants would have a suicide preventive effect. This has been difficult to demonstrate due to the infrequency of suicide and methodological problems in prospectively testing the hypothesis. Pooled data from controlled clinical trials of antidepressants have not demonstrated a suicide preventive effect, but patient selection and the brief time of most trials limits the power of the data. Some reports from either long-term or very large databases have provided evidence that antidepressants prevent suicide. All but one study using aggregated data from naturalistic settings have shown inverse relationships between use of antidepressants and suicide rates in various populations. Definite conclusions cannot be drawn from naturalistic studies since unknown confounders cannot be excluded. The number of geographically widespread studies reporting positive results with varying methods leads us to conclude, however, that antidepressants do exert a suicide preventive effect.

AB Trends in adolescent suicide rates (15-19 years) from 1979 to 1996 were compared with suicide trends in individuals of 20 years and over in 30 countries and with trends in rates of deaths due to undetermined causes in adolescents in 17 countries of the WHO European Region. In 21 of the 30 studied countries, male adolescent suicide rates increased during the study period (highest increases in Belarus, Kazakstan and Ireland) accompanied by far less increases or decreases in suicide rates of males of 20 years and over. Part of the observed increases in Sweden, Ireland and Greece can be attributed to improved suicide statistics, while increases in Finland, Belgium, Bulgaria and the United Kingdom can be even higher due to the rising classification of deaths as "undetermined". In Portugal, decreasing suicide trends seem to be misinterpreted by ignoring the vast increases in rates of undetermined deaths. Female adolescent suicide rates rose less markedly than in males in 18 countries, with the exception of strong increases in Norway, Ireland. Increases in female adolescent suicide rates were marginally affected by changes in classification practices and were accompanied primarily by declining suicide rates in females of 20 years and over.

AB Objective: This study presents data relating to prospectively monitored treatment and post-mortem toxicology of individuals who committed suicide.
   Method: a case-control study of prospectively monitored pharmacological treatment in suicides and controls. Psychiatric records and post-mortem toxicology were also studied.
   Results: Fifty-nine subjects who committed suicide purchased twice the number of prescriptions as the 118 controls. Sixteen cases received psychiatric in-patient care compared to four of the controls. In the last 3 months prior to suicide, 38 cases (64%) were dispensed drugs: anxiolytics-hypnotics in 17 cases (29%), antipsychotics in six cases (10%) and antidepressants in seven cases (12%). More psychiatrists than GPs prescribed antidepressants. About one-third of psychotropic drugs were retrieved in post-mortem toxicology.
   Conclusion: There is a frequent use of psychotropics and psychiatric care among suicides; however, few used antidepressants and complied. Many suicides are still misdiagnosed and are not adequately treated.

AB 'Undetermined' (UnD) and accidental deaths (AccD) are explored as possible sources of 'under-reported-suicides' (URS) in 20 Western countries.
   WHO mortality rates per million of AccD, UnD and suicides analysed. UnD:suicides ratios of < 1:5 calculated as likely URS versus ratios > 1:10 unlikely URS and all correlated by sex and age.
   Male URS likely in 7 countries and in 11 for females. URS in AccD likely in 5 countries for both sexes only UnD and suicide rates the elderly (75+) significantly correlated.
   Strong indication of URS in the UK, Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany with likely URS in AccD in Greece, Portugal, Switzerland and USA. These findings have important implications, indicating that, with the exception of France and Japan, official reported suicide rates contain a degree of under-reporting, and especially for women yet it is essential to have accurate suicide data to ensure adequate service provision.

AB Objective: Multifaceted evidence (family, twin, adoption, molecular genetic, geographic and surname studies of suicide) suggests genetic risk factors for suicide. Migrant studies are also informative in this context, but underused. In particular, a meta-analysis of the associations of immigrant (IMM) and country-of-birth (COB) suicide rates is unavailable.
   Method: Thirty-three studies, reporting IMM suicide rates for nearly 50 nationalities in seven host countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, England, the Netherlands, Sweden and the USA), were retrieved.
   Results: Total-population IMM and COB suicide rates were strongly positively associated (combined rank-order correlation across 20 eligible studies: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.56-0.73, P < 10(-9)). The effect generalized across both sexes, host countries and study periods.
   Conclusion: Following the logic of the migrant study design of genetic epidemiology, the correspondence of IMM and COB suicide rates is consistent with the assumption of population differences in the prevalence of genetic risk factors for suicide.

TI The relationship between sales of SSRI, TCA and suicide rates in the

SO BMC PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID ANTIDEPRESSANTS; ASSOCIATION; PREVENTION
AB Background: In the period 1990-2006, strong and almost equivalent increases in sales figures of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were observed in all Nordic countries. The sales figures of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) dropped in Norway and Sweden in the nineties. After 2000, sales figures of TCAs have been almost constant in all Nordic countries. The potentially toxic effect of TCAs in overdose was an important reason for replacing TCAs with SSRIs when treating depression. We studied whether the rapid increase in sales of SSRIs and the corresponding decline in TCAs in the period 1990-98 were associated with a decline in suicide rates.
   Methods: Aggregated suicide rates for the period 1975-2006 in four Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) were obtained from the national causes-of-death registries. The sales figures of antidepressants were provided from the wholesale registers in each of the Nordic countries. Data were analysed using Fisher's exact test and Pearson's correlation coefficient.
   Results: There was no statistical association (P = 1.0) between the increase of sales figures of SSRIs and the decline in suicide rates. There was no statistical association (P = 1.0) between the decrease in the sale figures of TCAs and change in suicide rates either.
   Conclusions: We found no evidence for the rapid increase in use of SSRIs and the corresponding decline in sales of TCAs being associated with a decline in the suicide rates in the Nordic countries in the period 1990-98. We did not find any inverse relationship between the increase in sales of SSRIs and declining suicide rates in four Nordic

AB Objective: To investigate the possible impact of the increased use of antidepressants on suicide rates in the Italian region of Friuli Venezia Giulia (FVG).
   Method: Individual-based data on antidepressants in FVG from 1997 to 2006 were obtained from the regional prescription database, and linked to data on suicide for the same period obtained from the regional health information system. Age and sex were considered.
   Results: The number of users of antidepressants increased almost fivefold during the study period. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors accounted for 71% of the individual users in 2006. The number of defined daily doses (DDD) per patient increased almost sevenfold. In parallel, the suicide rate decreased by one-third in men as well as in women, and in subjects under and over the age of 60 years.
   Conclusion: Suicide rates in FVG have declined in agreement with the hypothesis that the use of antidepressants may prevent suicide.

AB Background: Suicide attempts have been shown to be less common in older age groups, with repeated attempts generally being more common in younger age groups and severe attempts in older age groups. Consistently, most studies have shown an increased suicide risk after attempts in older age. However, little is known about the predictive value of age on repeated and severe suicide attempts for accomplished suicide. The aim of the present study was to investigate the reduced incidence for initial, repeated, or severe suicide attempts with age in suicide victims and controls by gender.
   Methods: The records of 100 suicide victims and matched controls with severe depression admitted to the Department of Psychiatry, Lund University Hospital, Sweden between 1956 and 1969, were evaluated and the subjects were monitored up to 2006. The occurrence of suicide attempts (first, repeated, or severe, by age group) was analysed for suicide victims and controls, with gender taken into consideration.
   Results: There was a reduced risk for an initial suicide attempt by older age in females (suicide victims and controls) and male controls (but not suicide victims). The risk for repeated suicide attempts appeared to be reduced in the older age groups in female controls as compared to female suicide victims. The risk for severe suicide attempts seemed reduced in the older age groups in female suicide victims. This risk was also reduced in male controls and in male controls compared to male suicide victims.
   Conclusion: In the older age groups repeated attempts appeared to be predictive for suicide in women and severe attempts predictive in men.

AB Objective The authors present an analysis of findings for the 65 years and over age group from the WHO/EURO Multicentre Study of Suicidal Behaviour (1989-93).
   Methods Multinational data on non-fatal suicidal behaviour is derived from 1518 subjects in 16 European centres. Local district data on suicide were available from IO of the collaborating centres.
   Results Stockholm (Sweden), Pontoise (France) and Oxford (UK) had the highest suicide attempts rates. In most centres, the majority of elderly who attempted suicide were widow(er)s, often living alone, who used predominantly voluntary drug ingestion. Non-fatal suicidal behaviour decreased with increasing age, whereas suicide rates rose. The ratio between fatal and non-fatal behaviours was 1:2, that for males/females almost 1:1. In the years considered, substantial stability in suicide and attempted suicide rates was observed. As their age increased, suicidal subjects displayed only a limited tendency to repeat self-destructive acts. Moreover, there was little correlation between attempted suicide and suicide rates, which carries different clinical implications for non-fatal suicidal behaviour in the elderly compared with younger subjects in the same WHO/EURO study.

AB Solid tumors are associated with an increased risk of suicide, however, there is limited detailed information on the risk of suicide in patients with hematological malignancies. Therefore, we conducted a population-based study including 47,220 patients with hematological malignancies (diagnosed 1992-2006) and their 235,868 matched controls to define the incidence and risk factors for suicide and suicide attempt. Information on suicides, suicide attempts, and preexisting psychiatric disorders was obtained from Swedish registers and individual medical records. There was a twofold increased (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.5-2.3, P < 0.0001) risk of suicide/suicide attempt during the first 3 years after diagnosis in patients with hematological malignancies compared to matched controls. Of all hematological malignancies, multiple myeloma was associated with the highest risk (HR = 3.4; 2.3-5.0, P < 0.0001). Patients with a preexisting psychiatric disorder were at a very high risk of suicide and suicide attempt (HR = 23.3; 16.6-32.6, P < 0.0001), regardless of type of hematological malignancy. Among patients who committed suicide, 19% were in a palliative phase and 44% were in remission with no active treatment. In conclusion, the risk of suicide and suicide attempt is elevated in patients with hematological malignancies. Certain high-risk patients may benefit from early detection and preventive measures.

AB Objective: To survey unnatural deaths among teenagers in northern Sweden and to suggest preventive measures.
   Setting: The four northernmost counties (908,000 inhabitants, 1991), forming 55% of the area of Sweden.
   Material and methods: All unnatural teenager deaths from 1981 through 2000 were identified in the databases of the Department of Forensic Medicine in Umea, National Board of Forensic Medicine. Police reports and autopsy findings were always studied, social and hospital records if present.
   Results: Three hundred and fifty-five deaths were found, of which 267 (75%) were males and 88 (25%) females. Ninety out of 327 (28%) tested positive for alcohol. Two hundred and forty-eight (70%) were unintentional and 102 (30%) were intentional deaths, and five (1%) were categorized as undetermined manner of death. Unintentional deaths decreased while the incidence of intentional deaths remained unaffected by time.
   Conclusions: Injury-reducing measures have been effective concerning unintentional deaths and the fall in young licensed drivers due to the economical recess have probably also contributed to the decrease. However, there were no signs of decreasing numbers of suicides during the study period, which calls for resources to be allocated to suicide prevention. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB ObjectiveMethodBipolar disorder carries a high risk of suicide. Identification of risk factors is important. The aim of this study was to study risk factors for suicide in a large cohort of men and women with bipolar disorder.
   A prospective cohort study using clinical data from the Swedish National Quality Register for Bipolar Affective Disorder (BipolaR). The outcome variable was suicide captured in the Cause of Death Register between 2004 and 2014. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models.
   ResultsConclusionsOf 12 850 persons (4844 men and 8006 women) with bipolar disorder, 90 (55 men and 35 women) died by suicide during the follow-up period (between 1 and 10 years). Male sex (HR 2.56), living alone (HR 2.45), previous suicide attempts (HR 4.10), comorbid psychiatric disorder (HR 2.64), recent affective episodes (HR 2.39), criminal conviction (HR 4.43), psychiatric inpatient care (HR 2.79), and involuntary commitment (HR 3.50) were significant risk factors for suicide. Several of the statistically significant risk factors for suicide in bipolar disorder differed between men and women.
   Risk factors for suicide in bipolar disorder include factors associated with suicide in general, but also diagnosis-specific factors.

TI Risk Factors for Suicidal Behaviour in Individuals on Disability Pension

   IDEATION
AB Background: Common mental disorders (CMD) have become one of the leading causes for disability pension (DP). Studies on predictors of adverse health outcome following DP are sparse. This study aimed to examine the association of different socio-demographic factors and health care consumption with subsequent suicidal behaviour among individuals on DP due to CMD.
   Method: This is a population-based prospective cohort study based on register data. All individuals aged 18-64 years, living in Sweden on 31-Dec-2004 who in 2005 were on DP due to CMD (N = 46 745) were followed regarding suicide attempt and suicide (2006-10). Univariate and multivariate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for suicidal behaviour were estimated by Cox regression.
   Results: During the five-year follow-up, 1 046 (2.2%) and 210 (0.4%) individuals attempted and committed suicide, respectively. Multivariate analyses showed that young age (18-24 years) and low education predicted suicide attempt, while living alone was associated with both higher suicide attempt and suicide (range of HRs 1.23 to 1.68). Combined prescription of antidepressants with anxiolytics during 2005 and inpatient care due to mental diagnoses or suicide attempt (2001-05) were strongly associated with suicide attempt and suicide (range of HRs 1.3 to 4.9), while inpatient care due to somatic diagnoses and specialized outpatient care due to mental diagnoses during 2001-05 only predicted suicide attempt (HR 1.45; 95% CI: 1.3-1.7; HR 1.30; 95% CI: 1.1-1.7).
   Conclusions: Along with socio-demographic factors, it is very important to consider type of previous healthcare use and medication history when designing further research or intervention aiming at individuals on DP due to CMD. Further research is warranted to investigate both characteristics of disability pension due to CMD, like duration, diagnoses and grade as well as mechanisms to subsequent suicidal behavior, taking potential gender differences into consideration.

AB Background. Possible age-related differences in risk of completed suicide following non-fatal self-harm remain unexplored. We examined associations between self-harm and completed suicide across age groups of self-harming patients, and whether these associations varied by violent index method, presence of mental disorder, and repeated self-harm.
   Method. The design was a cohort study with linked national registers in Sweden. The study population comprised individuals aged 510 years hospitalized during 1990-1999 due to non-fatal self-harm (n = 53 843; 58% females) who were followed for 9-19 years. We computed hazard ratios (HRs) across age groups (age at index self-harm episode), with time to completed suicide as outcome.
   Results. The 1-year HR for suicide among younger males (10-19 years) was 14.6 [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.1-51.9] for violent method and 8.4 (95% CI 1.8-40.0) for mental disorder. By contrast, none of the three potential risk factors increased the 1-year risks in the youngest females. Among patients aged 520 years, the 1-year HR for violent method was 4.6 (95% CI 3.8-5.4) for males and 10.4 (95% CI 8.3-13.0) for females. HRs for repeated self-harm during years 2-9 of follow-up were higher in 10- to 19-year-olds (males: HR 4.0, 95% CI 2.0-7.8; females: HR 3.7, 95% CI 2.1-6.5). The 520 years age groups had higher HRs than the youngest, particularly for females and especially within 1 year.
   Conclusions. Violent method and mental disorder increase the 1-year suicide risk in young male self-harm patients. Further, violent method increases suicide risk within 1 year in all age and gender groups except the youngest females. Repeated self-harm may increase the long-term risk more in young patients. These aspects should be accounted for in clinical suicide risk assessment.

AB Suicide is a leading cause of mortality. It is, in principle, preventable - given the fact that we possess effective treatments for depressive illness, the major contributor to such mortality. Nonetheless, complex logistic problems have prevented the institution of Successful suicide prevention programs. The present review summarizes the author's work on the island of Gotland in Sweden, where the small size of the population permitted the institution of an educational and treatment program aimed at the general medical practitioners. The program was successful in reducing suicide rates by 60%. This was accompanied by reduction of different indices measuring depressive morbidity. Prevention was successful for as long as the program was instituted. The author provides his reflections on the public health implications of his data - particularly for Eastern Europe which is experiencing widespread stress in the workplace and in economic situations. More hypothetically, he presents his views on a serotonin-mediated 'male suicide syndrome'. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

ID STATISTICS
AB This paper explores the usage of suicide statistics and the emergence of suicidology in nineteenth-century Scandinavia and Finland. Drawing upon texts from Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark-with a focus on Swedish language sources-it illustrates the significance that suicide statistics gained during this period, and pays attention to the question of how the Scandinavian discussion on suicide was linked to ideas from outside the geographic area. Taking the cross-references between the selected texts as a starting point, this short foray into early suicidology commences in Finland and works its way westwards.
   The discussed works provide a multi-faceted perspective on the issue of suicide statistics in nineteenth century Scandinavia. The paper confirms the influence of central European personalities and ideas on the discussion in the Nordic countries, but at the same time shows that Scandinavian scholars presented unique and novel works, and thus were actively participating and contributing to the emerging pan-European debate on suicide.

AB Objective: To examine age, period and cohort effects on Australian suicide rates.
   Method: Male suicide rates for successive 5-year periods between 1919 and 1998, and for 1999 were displayed graphically to examine interactions between age, period and cohort effects.
   Results: There has been a pronounced period effect on male suicide rates in all age groups over the last few decades, with lower rates in wartime and peak rates for most cohorts in the 1960s. Peak rates of all adult female 5-year age cohorts occurred in the 1960s or early 1970s.
   Conclusion: Most so-called cohort effects appear to be associated with environmental changes that may not be a function of the cohort itself. While much attention has focused on the rising suicide rates in young males in Australia, local media and health authorities have given little emphasis to the high rates found in elderly males.

AB Objectives Recent studies have found an increased risk of suicide in people on sickness absence, but less is known about to what extent diagnosis-specific sickness absence is a risk indicator for suicidal behaviour. This study aimed to examine all-cause and diagnosis-specific sickness absence and sick-leave duration as risk indicators for suicide attempt and suicide.
   Methods This is a population-based prospective cohort study. All non-retired adults (n=4923404) who lived in Sweden as on 31 December 2004 were followed-up for 6years regarding suicide attempt and suicide (2005-2010). HRs and 95% CIs for suicidal behaviour were calculated, using people with no sick-leave spells in 2005 as reference.
   Results In analyses adjusted for sociodemographic factors and previous mental healthcare, suicide attempt and current antidepressants prescription, sickness absence predicted suicide attempt (HR 2.37; 95% CI 2.25 to 2.50 for women; HR 2.69; 95% CI 2.53 to 2.86 for men) and suicide (HR 1.91; 95% CI 1.60 to 2.29 for women; HR 1.92; 95% CI 1.71 to 2.14 for men), particularly mental sickness absence (range of HR: 2.74-3.64). The risks were also increased for somatic sickness absence, for example, musculoskeletal and digestive diseases and injury/poisoning (range of HR: 1.57-3.77). Moreover, the risks increased with sick-leave duration.
   Conclusions Sickness absence was a clear risk indicator for suicidal behaviour, irrespective of sick-leave diagnoses, among women and men. Awareness of such risks is recommended when monitoring sickness certification. Further studies are warranted in order to gain more detailed knowledge on these associations.

AB Objective: Intimate partner homicides (IPHs) continue to be widespread and constant over time when compared with other types of homicide. Yet research addressing IPH particularly within the European context, is limited. The question of whether perpetrators of partner-related violence differ from offenders of general violence has been raised in research. In light of inconsistent findings and ongoing debate, the aim was to identify sociodemographic and criminological characteristics in perpetrators and victims of IPH, and to determine whether they differ from other types of homicides in Sweden. Method: This retrospective study was based on national data of all male-perpetrated homicides (N = 211) in Sweden committed between 2007 and 2009. Characteristics of IPH (n = 46) and non-IPH (n = 165) were compared and analyzed by conducting bivariate and multiple logistic regressions. Results: Perpetrators of IPH were older, more likely to be employed, less likely to have been convicted, and had less persistent criminal histories. Perpetrators of IPH were also less likely to be intoxicated at the time of the offense; nonetheless, intoxication was a common feature among victims and perpetrators in both groups. Further, perpetrators of partner-related homicides are substantially more likely to commit suicide. Conclusion: The present study illustrates critical differences between IPH and non-IPH perpetrators. As hypothesized, IPH perpetrators were less socially disadvantaged, less likely to have past criminal offenses, and more likely to commit suicide following the homicidal act. This study demonstrates that perpetrators of IPH constitute a separate subtype and, conceptually, ought to be treated separately.

AB Objective: To investigate alcohol involvement in all types of unnatural deaths in Sweden. Method: All cases of unnatural death that underwent medico-legal autopsies (1992-1996) in Sweden were analyzed (N = 15,630; i.e., 68% of all unnatural deaths). Alcohol was regarded as contributing to the death if: (1) there was any indication that the deceased was a "known alcoholic"; (2) the underlying or contributing causes of death were alcohol-related; (3) the deceased had alcohol-related inpatient diagnosis during a period of 3 years prior to death; or (4) the case tested positive for blood alcohol. Results: Thirty-nine percent of the blood-tested cases (n = 13,099) were positive for alcohol. Almost 40% of the unnatural deaths were associated with alcohol. Alcohol involvement was most common in the intoxication group (84%), followed by the "undetermined" (65%), homicide (55%), fall (48%), fire (44%), asphyxia (41%), suicide (35%) and traffic (22%) groups. More than half (52%) of the deaths in the age group 30-60 years, 35% of those aged 0-29 years and 25% of those aged 60 and over were associated with alcohol. Conclusions: In Sweden, two of five unnatural deaths are associated with alcohol; this is a conservative estimate. Alcohol-associated mortality varies considerably between different groups of external causes of death, between men and women, and with age.

AB Objective: Physician suicide is an important public health problem as the rate of suicide is higher among physicians than the general population. Unfortunately, few studies have evaluated information about mental health comorbidities and psychosocial stressors which may contribute to physician suicide. We sought to evaluate these factors among physicians versus non-physician suicide victims.
   Methods: We used data from the United States National Violent Death Reporting System to evaluate demographics, mental health variables, recent stressors and suicide methods among physician versus non-physician suicide victims in 17 states.
   Results: The data set included 31,636 suicide victims of whom 203 were identified as physicians. Multivariable logistic regression found that having a known mental health disorder or a job problem which contributed to the suicide significantly predicted being a physician. Physicians were significantly more likely than non-physicians to have antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and barbiturates present on toxicology testing but not antidepressants.
   Conclusions: Mental illness is an important comorbidity for physicians who complete a suicide but postmortem toxicology data shows low rates of medication treatment. Inadequate treatment and increased problems related to job stress may be potentially modifiable risk factors to reduce suicidal death among physicians. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Although suicide rates among prisoners are high and vary between countries, it is uncertain whether this reflects the importation of risk from the general population or is associated with incarceration rates.
   We collected data on suicides and undetermined deaths in 12 countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England and Wales, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, and Sweden) directly from their prison administrations for 2003-2007. These were compared with rates of suicides in the general population separately by gender using Pearson's correlations. In addition, they were compared with rates of incarceration. Linear regression was used to examine any association after adjustment for rates of incarceration.
   Data were collected on 861 suicides in prison, of which 810 were in men. In the men, crude relative rates of suicide were at least three times higher than the general population. Western European countries had similar rates of prisoner suicide which were mostly higher than those in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. There was no association between rates of suicide in prisoners and general population rates or rates of incarceration. In the women, inmate suicide rates varied widely and were mostly raised compared with rates in the general population. In addition, these rates did not appear to be associated with general population rates of suicide.
   Rates of prison suicide do not reflect general population suicide rates, suggesting that variations in prison suicide rates reflect differences in criminal justice systems including, possibly, the provision of psychiatric care in prison.

SO MEDICINE SCIENCE AND THE LAW
LA English
DT Article
ID RATES; SWEDEN; ENGLAND; WALES
AB Suicide rates in the elderly have declined in many countries in recent years. This decline has been reported to be associated with increased prescribing of antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), antipsychotics and antimanic drugs and reduced prescribing of barbiturates, hypnotics and sedatives. This study examined the relationship between prescribing patterns of individual psychotropic drugs and suicide rates by specific methods of elderly suicides.
   There was a negative correlation between the prescription of tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, antimanic drugs and non-opiate analgesics and a decline in elderly suicide rates due to poisoning by solid and liquid substances, hanging, strangulation and suffocation, drowning, firearms and explosives, and jumping from high places. There was a positive correlation between the prescription of barbiturates, hypnotics and sedatives and elderly suicide rates due to poisoning by solid and liquid substances, hanging, strangulation and suffocation, drowning, firearms and explosives, and jumping from high places.
   This study demonstrated that changes in prescribing patterns of individual psychotropic drugs do influence elderly suicide rates of the commonly used methods of suicide and suggest that this may be due to more accurate diagnostic-specific prescribing of psychotropic drugs.

   RISK; DEPRESSION; PLACEBO; ADULTS
AB Objective: Seasonality of completed suicides with a peak in spring and early summer is a well-documented finding. The circannual serotonergic functioning is hypothesized to be central in this phenomenon. Antidepressant medications exert their pharmacological action mainly by regulating serotonin. Our aim is to study the amplitude of the seasonal effect among suicide victims positive for different classes of antidepressants or without any antidepressants at the time of death. Method: By using Swedish Registers, 12 448 suicides with forensic data for antidepressive medication and information on in-patient-treated mental disorder were identified during 19922003. Seasonality was estimated with a Poisson regression variant of the circular normal distribution of completed suicides. Results: Higher suicide seasonality was found for individuals treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) compared to those with other antidepressant treatment or without any antidepressant treatment. The finding is more evident for men and violent suicide methods and those without history of in-patient treatment. Conclusion: Our results provide preliminary support for the serotonergic hypothesis of suicide seasonality and raise the question of a possible accentuation of the natural suicide seasonality in patients treated with SSRIs, a hypothesis that warrants further investigation.

AB Background: High suicide intent, childhood trauma, and violent behavior are risk factors for suicide in suicide attempters. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the combined assessment of suicide intent and interpersonal violence would provide a better prediction of suicide risk than an assessment of only suicide intent or interpersonal violence.
   Methods: This is a cohort study involving 81 suicide attempters included in the study between 1993 and 1998. Patients were assessed with both the Suicide Intent Scale (SIS) and the Karolinska Interpersonal Violence Scale (KIVS). Through the unique personal identification number in Sweden, patients were linked to the Cause of Death Register maintained by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. Suicides were ascertained from the death certificates.
   Results: Seven of 14 patients who had died before April 2013 had committed suicide. The positive predictive value for the Suicide Intent Scale alone was 16.7 %, with a specificity of 52 % and an area under the curve of 0.74. A combined assessment with the KIVS gave higher specificity (63 %) and a positive predictive value of 18.8 % with an AUC of 0.83. Combined use of SIS and KIVS expressed interpersonal violence as an adult subscale gave a sensitivity of 83.3 %, a specificity of 80.3 %, and a positive predictive value of 26 % with an AUC of 0.85. The correlation between KIVS and SIS scores was not significant.
   Conclusions: Using both the the SIS and the KIVS combined may be better for predicting completed suicide than using them separately. The nonsignificant correlation between the scales indicates that they measure different components of suicide risk.

   COUNTRY; SWEDEN; HEALTH; WALES; RATES
AB Background: Concerns about increased suicide risk among immigrants to European countries have been raised. We review the scientific literature on differences in suicide among immigrants compared with the majority populations in Europe's major immigration countries. Methods: We searched the databases PubMed and PsycINFO for peer-reviewed epidemiological studies published in 1990-2011, which compared suicide risks of adult immigrant groups with the risks of the majority population in European countries. Hits were screened by two researchers. Results: We included 24 studies in the review. No generalizable pattern of suicide among immigrants was found. Immigrants from countries in which suicide risks are particularly high, i.e. countries in Northern and Eastern Europe, experienced higher suicide rates relative to groups without migration background. Gender and age differences were observed. Young female immigrants from Turkey, East Africa and South Asia are a risk group. Conclusion: Immigrants 'bring along' their suicide risk, at least for the initial period they spend in the immigration country. Health-care planners and providers need to be aware of this 'imported risks'. However, most immigrant groups do not have an increased suicide risk relative to the local-born population; some may even experience substantially lower risks.

AB Objectives: Mental symptoms and impaired quality of life commonly occur in patients treated for hyperthyroidism. Our aim wits to determine whether a history of hyperthyroidism implies an increased risk of suicide.
   Design: Historic cohort study of 43 633 patients treated with radioiodine or surgery for hyperthyroidism between 1950 and 2005. The majority of the radioiodine-treated patients came from Stockholm. Two comparison cohorts consisted of 44 92 1 patients registered with an operation for atoxic nodular goitre between 1965 and 2005, and 354 861 patients with a cholecystectomy between 1965 and 2001.
   Methods: Subjects were followed from the date of diagnosis until death, emigration or end of follow-up. Information on outcome was obtained from population and health registers.
   Results: The number of observed suicide deaths was 134 in the study cohort. A naive comparison with the age-. sex- and calendar period-matched general Swedish population yielded it moderately increased standardized mortality ratio (SMR), but stratifications revealed that the excess was mainly driven by women from Stockholm. whose baseline suicide risk was higher than for women in the rest of Sweden. Using the population rates from Stockholm, the SMR among Stockholm women with Graves' disease was 1.14 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.66-1.86) and toxic goitre 0.99 (95% Cl 0.51-1.72). A direct comparison between the study cohort and the combined comparison cohorts, with multiple adjustments (including adjustment for residence in Stockholm), yielded a relative risk of suicide of 0.93 (0.68-1.26).
   Conclusions: This study did not confirm an increased risk of suicide among patients treated for hyperthyroidism.

AB Background: Selected groups of patients with bipolar and unipolar disorder have an increased mortality rate from suicide and natural causes of death. However, there has been no population-based study of mortality of patients followed up from the onset of the illness.
   Methods: All patients with a hospital diagnosis of bipolar (n = 15386) or unipolar (n = 39182) disorder in Sweden from 1973 to 1995 were identified from the inpatient register and linked with the national cause-of-death register to determine the date and cause of death. Overall and cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and numbers of excess deaths were calculated by 5-year age classes and 5-year calendar periods.
   Results: The SMRs for suicide were 15.0 for males and 22.4 for females with bipolar disorder, and 20.9 and 27.0, respectively, for unipolar disorder. For all natural causes of death, SMRs were 1.9 for males and 2.1 for females with bipolar disorder, and 1.5 and 1.6, respectively, for unipolar disorder. For bipolar disorder, most excess deaths were from natural causes, whereas for unipolar disorder, most excess deaths were from unnatural causes. The SMR for suicide was especially high for younger patients during the first years after the first diagnosis. Increasing SMR for suicide during the period of study was found for female patients with unipolar disorder.
   Conclusions: This population-based study of patients treated in the hospital documented increased SMRs for suicide in patients with bipolar and unipolar disorder. The SMR for all natural causes of death was also increased, causing about half the excess deaths.

AB Previous reports regarqding risk factors for suicide in schizophrenia have been inconclusive. We performed a matched case-control study of in-patient-treated schizophrenia patients in order to assess the suicide risk associated with socioeconomic, demographic, and psychiatric factors. The cases were 84 patients who died by suicide within five years after diagnosis in a cohort of all patients discharged for the first time from psychiatric hospitals in Stockholm County, Sweden, with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder or schizoaffective disorder between the years 1984 and 2000, One control was individually and randomly matched with each case from the same cohort by date (1 year) and age (5 years) at index diagnosis. Data were retrieved from clinical records of the case-control pairs in a blind fashion. Of the suicides, 54% were men and 46% were women. In multivariate analyses, higher educational attainment (odds ratio [OR] 3.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-8.0). age 30 years at onset of symptoms (OR 4.8, CI 1.1-21.2), and a history of a suicide attempt requiring non-psychiatric medical treatment (OR 5.0, CI 1.6-15.4) were found to be significantly associated with an increased suicide risk. Gender did not significantly affect the suicide risk, nor did a history of self-discharge, compulsory in-patient treatment, substance-use disorder or a family history of mental disorders or suicide.
   In schizophrenia, certain suicide risk factors may differ from those in the general population. Clinical suicide risk assessment for schizophrenia patients should be performed taking this into account. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All dghts reserved.

AB Background Rate of suicide is probably an indicator of the quality of mental health services within an area. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of suicide in a large community-based cohort of persons with long-term mental disorder. Methods A survey was conducted in Stockholm County, Sweden, in 1997 to identify adults with long-term disabling mental disorder (mental retardation and dementia excluded). The survey included an inventory of unmet needs as perceived by the service providers. The 12,247 cases were linked to the national in-patient register and the cause-of-death register. Predictors of suicide in 1997-2000 were determined by bivariate analysis and multiple logistic regression. Results Predictors of suicide included a history of in-patient psychiatric care, previous suicide attempt, substance abuse and unmet need of a contact person. Personality disorder, especially borderline personality disorder, was the strongest diagnostic predictor of suicide among those with a history of in-patient psychiatric care. Conclusion Unmet needs may signal increased suicide risk in persons with severe mental disorder. Methods to improve suicide prevention in persons with personality disorder should be further developed. Interventions to reduce suicide in persons with a long-term mental disorder will require collaboration between psychiatric and social services.

AB Background: Substance use disorders have repeatedly been found to lead to premature death, i.e. drug-related death by disease, fatal intoxications, or trauma (accidents, suicide, undetermined suicide, and homicide). The present study examined the relationship between multi-drug substance use and natural and unnatural death.
   Methods: All consecutive, autopsied patients who had been in contact with the Addiction Centre in Malmo University Hospital from 1993 to 1997 inclusive were investigated. Drug abuse was investigated blindly in the case records and related to the cause of death in 387 subjects.
   Results: Every substance apart from alcohol used previously in life added to the risk of unnatural death in a linear way. There were independent increased risks of fatal heroin overdoses or undetermined suicide. Death by suicide and violent death were unrelated to additional abuse.
   Conclusion: The number of drugs used was related to an increased risk of unnatural death by undetermined suicide (mainly fatal intoxications) and heroin overdose.

AB Objectives: To investigate the risk of suicide, unnatural death and all-cause death in university students compared with non-students, taking previous educational attainment into account.
   Design: Open cohort study of all residents aged 18-39 and living in Sweden at any time between 1 January 1993 and 31 December 2011.
   Setting: We linked data from national registers and calculated person-years during university studies for three time periods (1993-1999, 2000-2005 and 2006-2011). Time as non-student was calculated and categorised according to attained educational level. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% CIs were calculated with Poisson regression models, controlling for age and period.
   Participants: The cohort consisted of 5 039 419 individuals, 51% men and 49% women.
   Main outcome measures: Incidence of suicide (International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9: E950-E959, ICD-10: X60-X84) or death with undetermined intent (ICD-9: E980-E989, ICD-10: Y10-Y34), unnatural death (ICD-9: E800-E999 and ICD-10: V01-Y99) and all-cause death.
   Results: A total of 7316 deaths due to suicide were identified, of which 541 were registered among university students. The risk of suicide was twofold during ongoing university studies compared with when having attained university education, IRR 2.37 (95% CI 2.07 to 2.72) in men and IRR 2.15 (95% CI 1.77 to 2.61) in women.
   Conclusions: Having ongoing university studies was associated with a higher risk of suicide compared with having attained university-level education. This finding highlights the importance of achieving a deeper understanding of suicidal behaviour during years at university. Further studies should assess risk factors for suicide and suicidal behaviour in university students.

AB Suicides are generally the consequence of overchallenged coping strategies of individual for psychological, social or internal and external biological strain factors. Timing of the suicide, too, may be influenced by external factors. Studies so far have yielded in part inconsistent results concerning the association of suicides with particular days or periods of the year. Even less is known regarding a potential effect of the time of birth on suicide risk.
   The Tyrol Suicide Register (TSR) provides data on suicides occurring in the Austrian State of Tyrol including birthday of the suicide victim and day of the suicide. In the present study the frequency of suicides was analyzed with regard to birthday, day of the week, major holidays and season over a period of 17 years. Further, a potential association with month of birth and zodiac signs was studied.
   We found a significant variation in suicide frequency concerning day of the week with a peak on Mondays and Tuesdays and seasonality with increased numbers in spring and summer months.
   The increase of suicide numbers at the beginning of the week may be explained by the "broken-promise effect" which has been described as the consequence of frustrated expectations concerning the weekend. Possible explanations for the suicide peaks in spring and summer may be biological, specifically serotonergic alterations as well as the experience of depressed patients perceiving the social and emotional contrast to people who are able to enjoy these periods of pleasure and outdoor activities.

AB Objective: These analyses were conducted to describe the course of illness among patients with major affective disorders who commit suicide.
   Method: Twenty-nine patients who entered a long-term, high-intensity follow-up study of major affective disorders and who later committed suicide within I year of their last follow-up interview were individually matched to other patients by age, sex, the presence or absence of lifetime drug or alcohol abuse. time to last interview and polarity. Those who suicided were compared with their controls by depressive and substance abuse morbidity during follow-up. treatment resistance. treatment compliance, suicidal behavior and psychosocial adjustment.
   Results: Among the various measures used to characterize the course of illness during a mean follow-up of 4.3 years, only those pertaining to suicidal behavior robustly separated the suicide group from their controls. Suicidal behavior in the remote past seemed as predictively important as suicidal behavior during follow-up.
   Conclusion: Of the various features monitored over time in patients with major affective disorder, suicidal behavior itself was the clearest correlate of risk for completed suicide.

AB Background It is unclear whether benzodiazepines increase the risk of suicide. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that benzodiazepines are associated with an increased risk of suicide, by comparing psychopharmacological interventions between psychiatric patients who committed suicide and a group of matched controls. Methods The case group comprised 154 psychiatric patients (101 men, 53 women; age range: 13-96 years) who had committed suicide in orebro County, Sweden. Control psychiatric patients matched by age, sex, and main psychiatric diagnosis were selected for each case. Binary logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios in unadjusted and adjusted models. Results Benzodiazepine prescriptions were more common among cases than controls (65/154 [42.2%] versus 43/154 [27.9%], p = 0.009, odds ratio: 1.89 [95% CI: 1.17-3.03]). This association remained significant in a model adjusted for previous suicide attempts and somatic hospitalizations (odds ratio: 1.83 [95% CI: 1.06-3.14]). No statistically significant differences were seen between the groups in the use of any other subtype of psychopharmaceutical agent. Conclusions These data indicate that benzodiazepine use may increase the risk of suicide. However, this study is limited by the potential for indication bias.

AB As in many developed countries, the use of antidepressants in Denmark has been substantially increasing during recent years, coinciding with a decreasing suicide rate. We aimed to investigate the relationship between treatment with antidepressants and suicide on individualized data from a nationwide study comprising an observational cohort study with linkage of registers of all prescribed antidepressants and recorded suicides in Denmark during the period 1995-99. A total of 438 625 patients who purchased at least one prescription of antidepressants and 1073862 individuals from the general population were included in the study. Patients who continued treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (i.e. who purchased SSRIs twice or more) had a decreased rate of suicide compared with patients who purchased SSRIs once only [rate ratio (RR)=0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.56-0.71]. Furthermore, the rate of suicide decreased consistently with the number of prescriptions. Similarly, among patients treated with newer antidepressants other than SSRIs, the rate of suicide was decreased compared with the rate for patients who purchased other newer antidepressants once only (RR=0.70; 95% CI=052-0.94). Continued antidepressant treatment with SSRIs or other newer antidepressants is found to be associated with a reduced risk of suicide.

   DATABASE; PEOPLE
AB Background: Psychopathology is the main risk factor for adolescent suicide but several studies have shown that only a small proportion of suicide victims receive mental health care during the months preceding their suicide. The goal of this study is to describe the utilization of medical services by Quebec adolescent suicide victims during the year preceding their suicide.
   Methods: All suicides of persons aged 19 or less that occurred during a five-year period were retrieved from the Quebec Coroner's database. Corresponding medical services utilization data were retrieved from the Quebec physician payment database (RAMQ) and the Quebec hospitalization database (MED-ECHO). Data were analyzed in terms of types and intensity of medical services (physical or psychiatric), types of providers (general practitioners, psychiatrists, and other medical specialists), and timing of interventions relative to the date of suicide.
   Results: 78% of all Quebec adolescent suicide victims utilized medical services during the year before their suicide. However, only 12% of all victims received medical attention for psychiatric problems, and only 9.9% met with a psychiatrist during that same period of time. General practitioners and non-psychiatric medical specialists provided medical attention for psychiatric problems to only 5.6% and 0.7% of those future suicide victims with whom they met in outpatient settings, and the intensity of their interventions was low.
   Interpretation: These results suggest that the level of recognition and treatment of psychopathology in Quebec adolescents who later commit suicide is low, despite the fact that a large proportion of them meet with physicians during the year preceding their suicide. This suggests that information and training programs pertaining to adolescent suicide and psychopathology should be implemented for GPs and non-psychiatric medical specialists as well.

AB ObjectivesThis study investigated mortality differentials between self-employed persons in Sweden, considering industrial sector, enterprise characteristics and socio-demographic factors.
   MethodsData on 321,274 self-employed persons were obtained from population registers in Sweden. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare all-cause and cause-specific mortality rate ratios by industrial sector and enterprise legal form, adjusted for confounders.
   ResultsAll-cause mortality was 10-32% higher in self-employed persons in Manufacturing and Mining, Trade and Communication, and Not Specified and Other sectors than in Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing. Mortality from cardiovascular disease was 23% higher in Trade and Communication, and from neoplasms 17-51% higher in Manufacturing and Mining, Not Specified, and Other. Mortality from suicide was 45-60% lower in Personal and Cultural Services, and in Not Specified. Mortality was 8-16% higher in sole proprietorship than limited partnership.

TI The role of benzodiazepines in elderly suicides
SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE benzodiazepine; drug poisoning; elderly; suicide
ID DRUGS
AB Aims: In Sweden, suicides by drug poisoning have decreased in the population at large during the past two decades. However, drug poisoning suicides increased among the elderly during this period. Suicides by benzodiazepine poisoning increased in this age group despite a reduction in prescription sales of these drugs. This study aims therefore to determine the role of benzodiazepines in suicide late in life. Methods: Information concerning all definite suicides and deaths due to "undetermined" causes recorded among Swedish citizens aged 65 and above during 1992-96 was obtained from the Cause-of-Death Register. Death certificates were scrutinized to determine the type of drug employed in drug-related suicides. Results of the post mortem screening for drugs and alcohol were then examined. Results: A benzodiazepine was implicated in 216/548 (39%) of the drug poisoning suicides recorded among the elderly. Death certificates revealed that a benzodiazepine was the sole agent in 72% of these cases. Flunitrazepam or nitrazepam were implicated in 90% of the single benzodiazepine suicides. In addition to the suicides classified as drug poisonings, 82 cases were found in which a drug may have contributed to the cause of death. Benzodiazepines predominated. The terminal cause of death was drowning, often in the victim's own bathtub, in three-quarters of these cases. The annual fatality ratios for the newer benzodiazepine-like hypnotics zopiclone and zolpidem appear to be on the rise. Conclusion: Benzodiazepines, especially the hypnotics flunitrazepam and nitrazepam, are common in drug poisoning suicides in the elderly and should be prescribed with caution for this age group.

AB Background: Relatively little is known about suicide in diagnostic subtypes of first episode psychosis (FEP). Our aim was to assess suicide rates and potential risk factors for suicide in FEP.
   Methods: This is a national register-based cohort study of patients born in 1973-1978 in Sweden and who were hospitalized with a FEP between ages 15 and 30 years (n = 2819). The patients were followed from date of discharge until death, emigration, or 31st of December 2008. The suicide rates for six diagnostic subtypes of FEP were calculated. Suicide incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated to evaluate the association between suicide and psychiatric, familial, social, and demographic factors.
   Results: In total 121 patients died by suicide. The overall suicide rate was 4.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.5-5.0) per 1000 person-years. The highest suicide rates were found in depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms and in delusional disorder. In an adjustedmodel, the strongest risk factors for suicide were self-harm (IRR 2.7, CI 1.7-4.4) or a conviction for violent crime (IRR 2.0, CI 1.3-3.2). Also having a first-degree relative with a schizophrenia/bipolar diagnosis (IRR 2.1, CI 1.2-3.6) or substance use disorder (IRR 2.0, CI 1.2-3.2) were significant risk factors for suicide.
   Conclusions: Impulsive behavior such as self-harm as well as having a family history of severe mental disorder or substance use are important risk factors for suicide in FEP. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Seniors aged 75 and above have the highest suicide rates of all age groups in most industrialized countries. However, research concerning risk factors for suicide in the old elderly is sparse. Objective: The purpose was to determine predictors for suicide among the old elderly (75+). Data concerning the young elderly (6574 years) are shown for comparison. Methods: 85 consecutive cases of suicide that occurred in western Sweden and 153 control persons with the same sex, birth year, and zip code as the suicide cases were randomly selected from the tax register. The old elderly group included 38 cases and 71 controls; the young elderly group included 47 cases and 82 controls. Data concerning the suicide cases were collected through interviews with close informants; controls were interviewed in person. The interview included questions on past-year life events and mental and physical health. Medical records were reviewed for cases and controls. The Cumulative Illness Rating Scale - Geriatrics was used to rate illness burden. Results: Family conflict, serious physical illness, loneliness, and both major and minor depressions were associated with suicide in the 75+ group. Economic problems predicted suicide in the younger but not in the older elderly. Old elderly suicide victims with depression (major or minor) were less likely to have received depression treatment than their younger counterparts. Conclusions: Better recognition and treatment of both major and minor depression should constitute an important target for the prevention of suicide in the old elderly. Intervention studies with large numbers of senior participants are sorely needed.

AB The purpose of this explorative study is to bring together a variety of Swedish data sources with indicators of youth mental health and living conditions in order to illuminate trends during the last decades, elucidate possible determinants of mental ill health and develop hypotheses to explain the observed trend patterns. The analyses in the study reveal some surprising inconsistencies with respect to the mental health trends among young people during the 1990s, Most striking is the pattern of increasing youth unemployment coinciding with almost inverse trends in the rates of suicide. The secular trends in fatal suicides during this period do not show any increase but some actual decrease in subpopulations despite high sustained levels of unemployment. In contrast, survey data indicate that the general mental health of youth during this period appears to have deteriorated.

AB Overweight and obesity is associated with lower rates of suicide. However, little is known about the association with different suicide methods. We studied the association between groups of body mass index and suicide methods. We identified all medicolegal autopsy cases with a cause of death due to external causes in Sweden during 1999-2013 (N = 39,368) and included 11,715 suicides and 13,316 accidents or homicides as controls. We applied multinomial regression models adjusted for age, sex, year and season of death. Obesity was associated with suicidal intoxication, OR 1.15 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02, 1.30] and negatively associated with all other suicide methods studied. Underweight showed a negative association with suicidal drowning and there was an indication towards a negative association with hanging in men OR 0.81 (95% CI 0.65, 1.01). We conclude that body mass index (BMI) is associated with the choice of suicide method. This may be of importance in a public health perspective, e.g. potential for prevention of intoxications. In the practice of forensic medicine, the physician's level of suspicion may rise if the apparent suicidal method is less common for the individual characteristics of the deceased, such as BMI.

ID TRENDS; MORTALITY; ADULTS; ADHD
AB Objective: Increasing rates of disability pension (DP) have been observed among young adults. We studied specific psychiatric DP diagnoses and subsequent risk of suicidal behaviour in a series of three cohorts of young adult in Sweden.
   Method: In a nationwide register study, we included all young adults who in 1995, 2000, and 2005, respectively, were 19-23 years old and lived in Sweden (n approximate to 500,000 per cohort). Rates of DP and specific psychiatric DP diagnoses were recorded in each cohort. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for suicidal behaviour during the following five years, with the corresponding age group as reference, were calculated by Cox proportional hazard regression, adjusted for demographic variables and previous own and parental suicidal behaviour.
   Results: The overall proportion with DP in this age group increased from 0.92% in 1995 to 2.29% in 2005, with particularly large increases in psychiatric diagnoses such as hyperkinetic disorders, pervasive developmental disorders, and depression/anxiety. The overall proportion of young disability pensioners attempting suicide during the five-year follow-up increased from 2.21% in the 1995 cohort to 3.81% in the 2005 cohort. Within most psychiatric DP diagnoses, the risk of attempted suicide did not change significantly over time, whereas suicide attempts increased in the reference group. Accordingly, the HRs for suicide attempt decreased in some psychiatric DP diagnoses. The highest adjusted HRs were observed for depression/anxiety (16.41; CI: 9.06 to 29.74) and schizophrenia (9.37; 6.13 to 14.31) in the 1995 cohort. The rate of suicide among young disability pensioners during follow-up ranged from 0.19% in 1995 to 0.37% in 2005, mainly occurring in individuals with psychiatric diagnoses.
   Conclusion: Suicidal behaviour has become more prevalent among young disability pensioners, which co-occurred with an increased tendency to grant DP in psychiatric diagnoses with a known high risk of suicidal behaviour. Preventive measures are warranted.

AB OBJECTIVE: We examined whether the risk for psychiatric morbidity requiring inpatient care was higher for offspring who experienced parental suicide, compared with offspring of fatal accident decedents, and whether the association varied according to the deceased parent's gender.
   METHODS: Children and adolescents (0-17 years of age) who experienced maternal (N = 5600) or paternal (N = 17 847) suicide in 19732003 in Sweden were identified by using national, longitudinal, population-based registries. Cox regression modeling was used to compare psychiatric hospitalization risks among offspring of suicide decedents and propensity score-matched offspring of accident decedents.
   RESULTS: Offspring of maternal suicide decedents had increased risk of suicide-attempt hospitalization, after controlling for psychiatric hospitalization for decedents and surviving parents, compared with offspring of maternal accidental decedents. Offspring of paternal suicide decedents had similar risk of suicide-attempt hospitalization, compared with offspring of accident decedents, but had increased risk of hospitalization attributable to depressive and anxiety disorders. The magnitude of risks for offspring suicide-attempt hospitalization was greater for those who experienced maternal versus paternal suicide, compared with their respective control offspring (interaction P = .05; offspring of maternal decedents, adjusted hazard ratio: 1.80 [95% confidence interval: 1.19-2.74]; offspring of paternal decedents, adjusted hazard ratio: 1.14 [95% confidence interval: 0.96-1.35]).
   CONCLUSIONS: Maternal suicide is associated with increased risk of suicide-attempt hospitalization for offspring, beyond the risk associated with maternal accidental death. However, paternal suicide is not associated with suicide-attempt hospitalization. Future studies should examine factors that might differ between offspring who experience maternal versus paternal suicide, including genetic or early environmental determinants.

AB Objectives To explore associations between IQ measured in early adulthood and subsequent hospital admissions for attempted suicide and to explore the role of psychosis and examine associations of IQ with specific methods of attempted suicide.
   Design Cohort study.
   Setting Sweden.
   Participants 1 109 475 Swedish men with IQ measured in early adulthood followed up for an average 24 years.
   Main outcome measures Hospital admission for attempted suicide.
   Results 17 736 (1.6%) men had at least one hospital admission for attempted suicide by any means during follow-up. After adjustment for age and socioeconomic status, lower IQ scores were associated with an elevated risk of attempted suicide by any means (hazard ratio per standard deviation decrease in IQ=1.57, 95% confidence interval 1.54 to 1.60), with stepwise increases in risk across the full IQ range (P for trend<0.001). Similar associations were observed for all specific methods of attempted suicide. Separate analyses indicated that associations between IQ and attempted suicide were restricted to participants without psychosis and that IQ had no marked impact on risk of attempted suicide in those with psychosis.
   Conclusions Low IQ scores in early adulthood were associated with a subsequently increased risk of attempted suicide in men free from psychosis. A greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying these associations may provide opportunities and strategies for prevention.

AB Immigration and transnational adoption are both manifestations of the pervasive dislocations that characterize the contemporary era. Each illuminates as well the double movement of assimilation and internal exclusion through which racisms that are a heritage of colonialism are expanded and reactivated in the metropolitan centers of western Europe and North America. In this process, race is spatialized, different forms of migrant bodies are produced, and familiar logics of belonging that link person to place are transformed. The differential politics of adoption and immigration in late twentieth-century Sweden shed light on this process of racialization and the affective economies through which it is realized, as that nation pursues a multicultural project in which 'Swedishness' becomes 'the measure of everything.'

AB Background: This study aims to estimate suicide risk and its socio-demographic determinants among cancer patients in the country showing the highest suicide rates among developed countries. Methods: The study is based on a unique census-linked dataset based on the linkages between the records from death and cancer registers and the 2001 population census records. Standardized mortality ratios for suicide (SMRs) were calculated for patients diagnosed with cancer in Lithuania between April 6, 2001 and December 31, 2009, relative to suicide rates in the general population. Results: We found that the relative suicide risk was elevated for both males and females, with SMRs of 1.43 (95% CI 1.23-1.66) and 1.32 (95% CI 0.95-1.80), respectively. This relationship for females became statistically significant and stronger after excluding skin cancers. The highest suicide risks were observed at older ages and during the period shortly after the diagnosis. The groups showing an increased suicide risk include lower educated, non-married, and rural male patients. Conclusion: The results of our study point to inadequacies of the health care system in dealing with mental health problems of cancer patients. Interventions allowing early detection of depression or suicidal ideation may help to prevent suicide among cancer patients in Lithuania. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI From loss of life to loss of years: a different view on the burden of
   injury fatalities in Sweden 1972-2014
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID MORTALITY; TRENDS; DEATH
AB Background: Worldwide, about 5.8 million people die each year due to injuries. In Sweden, the corresponding number amounts to 3000. There are large differences among injury types regarding the age-profile of the fatalities and as most of them occur in older age groups, counting the absolute number of injury fatalities does not fully reflect the size of the burden of injury. Methods: Using age-and sex-specific life expectancy tables in combination with data on external causes of injury, the number of injury fatalities in Sweden for the time period 1972-2014 is converted to a sum of potential years of life lost (PYLL). We then fit cause and group-specific spline regression models to the data to estimate temporal trends in both fatality counts and PYLL. Results: There has been a steady reduction in the number of injury fatalities and in the sum of PYLL from the early 1970s to around the year 2000. Since then, there has been an increase in the number of injury fatalities and in the sum of PYLL. The upward trend is mainly explained by an increasing number of deaths due to poisonings and suicide, specifically among younger men. Conclusions: The increases in suicide and poisoning mortality offset the reductions in downward trending causes of injury mortality during the last decades. The share of PYLL is larger than the share of fatalities for both suicides and poisonings implying that an aging population does not cause the increase.

AB Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate if teenagers visiting an emergency room because of injury have an increased risk of premature death ahead and, if so, identify possible risk factors and suggest preventive measures.
   Methods: In January 2010, the personal identity numbers of 12,812 teenagers who had visited the emergency room at the University Hospital in Umea. Sweden, during 1993 through 2006 because of injury were checked against the National Cause of Death Register in Sweden. Standardised mortality ratio and confidence intervals were calculated. For the unnatural deaths that took place in Sweden, the police report, autopsy protocol, and hospital records, if present, were studied.
   Results: Thirty-eight fatalities were included giving a standardised mortality ratio of 1.44 (95% CI: 1.02-1.98). A majority of the decedents were males (n = 32, 84%) and the median age at the time of death was 21 years. Twenty-three deaths were caused by unintentional injuries and ten by intentional injuries (all suicides), while five deaths were categorised as undetermined whether intentional or not. Seventy-four percent tested positive for either alcohol or drugs or a combination at the post mortem examination. Nine males and one female committed suicide, five tested positive for alcohol (one also for drugs), while four tested negative at the post mortem examination. One died abroad and in this case we lack information on alcohol and drugs.
   Conclusion: Teenagers visiting an emergency room due to injury experience an increased risk of premature death by unnatural cause and those at risk are especially males. The use of alcohol and drugs often seems to contribute to their untimely deaths. Identifying those at risk when they visit the emergency room for an injury and to take preventive actions at this stage could be a way to reduce the number of fatalities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Most previous research has concentrated on the role of alcohol in one type of unnatural death in a selected population, but the present objective was to investigate the role of alcohol in all unnatural deaths (autopsied and not autopsied).
   Methods: All cases of unnatural death from 1992 through 1996 in Sweden were analyzed (n = 23,132). Death was attributed at least in part to alcohol if the deceased was a "known alcoholic"; if the underlying or contributing cause of death was alcohol-related; if the deceased had an alcohol-related inpatient diagnosis during the 3-year period prior to death; or if the deceased tested positive for blood alcohol.
   Results: Just over 28% of the unnatural deaths could be associated with alcohol; the association with alcohol was more than twice as common in deaths of males (35%) as in females (16%). When only autopsied cases or only blood-tested cases were taken as the denominators, 38% and 44%, respectively, of the deaths were associated with alcohol. Alcohol involvement also was twice as common in intentional deaths (36%) as in unintentional deaths (18%). The intoxication group (78%) had the highest fraction of deaths that could be associated with alcohol, followed by the undetermined group (62%), homicide (49%), fire (41%), suicide (35%), asphyxia (29%), traffic (18%) and fall (9%) groups. In the 20- to 59-year age group, alcohol involvement was found in 51% of the males and 35% of the females (47% for males and females combined).
   Conclusions: The present estimates are conservative; alcohol involvement in unnatural deaths probably is even higher, up to 44% of the total. The present estimation is an important step in policy-making to lower the number of alcohol-related deaths in Sweden.

AB Background There is evidence of parental risk factors for suicidal behaviour in offspring, but research on variations in their effects with offspring's age at first exposure is sparse.
   Aims To explore the effects of age at exposure to parental mortality and markers of morbidity on the risks of suicide and attempted suicide in offspring.
   Methods This was a case-control study effected through record linkage between Swedish registers. Individuals born 1973-83 who committed suicide (n=1407) or were hospitalised due to an attempted suicide (n=17 159) were matched to <= 10 controls by sex, month and county of birth. ORs were measured in time windows representing age at first exposure.
   Results A general pattern of increasing risks of suicide and attempted suicide in offspring with decreasing age at exposure to parental risk factors emerged. Adjusted suicide risk (OR (95% CI)) was most pronounced in the youngest exposure window for parental psychiatric disability pension (3.1 (1.6 to 5.8)), somatic disability pension (1.9 (1.0 to 3.4)), psychiatric inpatient care (2.5 (2.0 to 3.1)), parental attempted suicide (2.9 (2.0 to 4.1)) and suicide (2.9 (1.7 to 5.2)). For parental non-suicidal deaths, the general pattern was the opposite. Patterns in offspring attempted suicide were similar to completed suicide for parental disability pension, psychiatric inpatient care and non-suicidal death. Attempted suicide risk after parental suicide showed an increasing trend with increasing age at exposure.
   Conclusion Parental morbidity and parental suicidal behaviour show the most detrimental effects on completed suicide among offspring when they appear early in life. Early interventions in families at risk are necessary to prevent suicide in offspring.

ID ELDERLY SUICIDE; SWEDEN; TRENDS; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; PREVENTION; AGE;
   REDUCTION; PERIOD; IMPACT
AB Background: Several studies have reported an inverse correlation between general population and elderly suicide rates and antidepressant prescribing rates. Correlations between general population and elderly suicide rates and prescribing rates of other psychotropic drugs have also been reported. All studies of elderly suicide rates have used data over a decade old.
   Methods: The relationship between elderly suicide rates and prescription rates of psychotropic drugs by the broad British National Formulary (BNF) categories, for individual psychotropic drug groups within the BNF categories (e.g. SSRIs), and for individual psychotropic drugs was examined over a 12-year period (1995-2006) using Spearman's rank correlation. All data were ascertained from the archives of the National Statistics Office.
   Results: There was an absence of significant correlations between elderly suicides rates and rates of prescriptions of psychotropic drugs in the broad BNF categories, individual psychotropic drug groups and individual psychotropic drugs.
   Discussion: The findings may be due to methodological flaws. However, if they are genuine, then the following approaches require consideration to further reduce suicide rates: (1) development of strategies to ensure continued prescription of psychotropic drugs at the current level; (2) development of strategies to improve non-pharmacological measures, including improved mental health services provision for older people, improved assessment of suicide risk, increased availability of psychosocial interventions and restricting the availability of methods of suicide; and (3) development of strategies to implement improvement in distal risk (e.g. societal socio-economic status) and protective (e.g. societal educational attainment) factors for suicide at a societal level.

AB Background:The knowledge and attitude of nonpsychiatric physicians regarding suicide in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients is important to prevent the accident related to suicide. However, most existing studies have focused on perception of and attitudes among psychiatric physician and mental health care worker.The aim of this study is to investigate awareness and attitude regarding suicide among clinicians treating patients with spinal cord injury, and the necessity of education for suicide prevention.MethodsA total of 29 subjects (N = 29; surgical group n=17, nonsurgical group n=12) participated in the study, 6 fellows and 23 residents. They answered a newly revised questionnaire that incorporated 18 items regarding perception of and attitude toward suicide, awareness of suicide in treatment of spinal cord injury patients, and psychiatric consultation; 13 items regarding education and experience; and 4 subjective items regarding their department. A (2) test was performed to investigate differences in sociodemographic factors, awareness of and attitude toward suicide, and clinical experience with spinal cord injury patients. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify correlation between the questionnaire items.Results:There were significant differences between surgical and nonsurgical clinicians in 1 question (Q6) about awareness of and attitude toward suicide (P<.05) and in 2 questions (Q21, Q25) about psychiatric consultation and experience with suicide-related education (P<.01). The correlation analysis revealed significant differences in certain questions among awareness and attitude (P<.05) and age (P<.05) and specialty (P<.01). Two sets of questions (Q16/Q31, Q17/Q26) showed correlation between clinical experience with spinal cord injury patients and awareness of and attitude toward suicide (P<.05).Conclusion:Education regarding suicide prevention and suicide-related clinical experience with spinal cord injury patients is important for nonpsychiatric clinicians, such as those in the fields of orthopedics, neurosurgery, and rehabilitation medicine.

AB Background: Due to reports on season of birth variations in suicidal behaviour as well as in cerebrospinal fluid levels of monoamine metabolites, we investigated season of birth variations in suicide methods for completed suicides in relation to any history of psychiatric contacts. Relationships with the psychiatric diagnoses for those with psychiatric contacts were also studied. Methods: Sociodemographic variables and suicide methods were examined for all the 693 suicide victims during 1961-1980 in Vasterbotten, Sweden. Information on any history of psychiatric contacts was obtained from psychiatric in-patient and out-patient records. Results: Gender differences in the choice of suicide method were found in the group without any history of psychiatric contacts, but not in those with such a history. Only those without a history of psychiatric contacts showed season of birth variations for suicide methods - those born during February to April were significantly more likely, and those born during October to January, significantly less likely, to have preferred hanging rather than poisoning or petrol gases. These associations were stronger for the determined suicides, for males, and for urban residence. Suicide victims with a history of psychiatric contacts were significantly younger than those without. Limitations: No psychological autopsies for those without psychiatric contacts. No information on eventual contacts with general practitioners. No measures of monoamine neurotransmitters were available. Conclusions: Season of birth association for suicide methods is likely to be mediated by a suicidality trait independently of specific major psychiatric disorders. Monoamine neurotransmitters, particularly serotonin, are likely to underlie such a trait. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Are suicide deaths under-reported? Nationwide re-evaluations of 1800
   deaths in Scandinavia
SO BMJ OPEN
LA English
DT Article
ID STATISTICS; RATES; AUTOPSIES; IRELAND; MANNER; US
AB Objective: Valid mortality statistics are important for healthcare planning and research. Suicides and accidents often present a challenge in the classification of the manner of death. The aim of this study was to analyse the reliability of the national suicide statistics by comparing the classification of suicide in the Scandinavian cause of death registers with a reclassification by 8 persons with different medical expertise (psychiatry, forensic pathology and public health) from each of the 3 Scandinavian countries.
   Methods: The cause of death registers in Norway, Sweden and Denmark retrieved available information on a sample of 600 deaths in 2008 from each country. 200 were classified in the registers as suicides, 200 as accidents or undetermined and 200 as natural deaths. The reclassification comprised an assessment of the manner and cause of death as well as the level of certainty.
   Results: In total, 81%, 88% and 90% of deaths registered as suicide in the official mortality statistics were confirmed by experts using the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish data sets, respectively. About 3% of deaths classified as accidents or natural deaths in the cause of death registers were reclassified as suicides. However, after a second reclassification based on additional information, 9% of the natural deaths and accidents were reclassified as suicides in the Norwegian data set, and 21% of the undetermined deaths were reclassified as suicides in the Swedish data set. In total, the levels of certainty of the experts were 87% of suicides in the Norwegian data set, 77% in the Swedish data set and 92% in Danish data set; the uncertainty was highest in poisoning suicides.
   Conclusions: A high percentage of reported suicides were confirmed as being suicides. Few accidents and natural deaths were reclassified as suicides. Hence, reclassification did not increase the overall official suicide statistics of the 3 Scandinavian countries.

TI Low intelligence test scores in 18 year old men and risk of suicide:
   cohort study
SO BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID ACCIDENTAL DEATH; CHILDHOOD IQ; PREDICTORS
AB Objective To examine the association between intelligence test scores in men, measured at age 18, and subsequent suicide.
   Design Record linkage study of the Swedish military service conscription register (1968-94) with the multi-generation register, cause of death register, and census data. Four tests were performed. at conscription covering logic, language, spatial, and technical skills.
   Setting Sweden.
   Participants 987 308 Swedish men followed up for 5-26 years.
   Main outcome measure Suicide.
   Results 2811 Suicides occurred during follow up. The risk of suicide was two to three times higher in those with lowest compared with the highest test scores. The strongest associations were seen with the logic test: for each unit increase in test score the risk of suicide decreased by 12% (95% confidence interval 10% to 14%). Associations were only slightly attenuated when we controlled for parents' socioeconomic position. Greatest risks were seen among poorly performing offspring of well educated parents.
   Conclusions Performance in intelligence tests is strongly related to subsequent risk of suicide in men. This may be due to the importance of cognitive ability in either the aetiology of serious mental disorder or an individual's capacity to solve problems while going through an acute life crisis or suffering from mental illness.

AB The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of fatalities, timing of collisions and characteristics of persons killed in train-pedestrian collisions on Finnish railways during 2005-2009. In addition, the Finnish results were compared with those collected in Sweden. The Finnish data were combined from five different sources. The results showed that 311 pedestrians were killed in train-pedestrian collisions, including 264 suicides, 35 accidents and 12 unclassified events. For each event type, most of the victims were male. Most suicide victims were in the 20-29 year age group and on average younger than people who chose some other form of suicide. About half of all victims were intoxicated by alcohol, medicines and/or drugs. Both suicides and accidents occurred most often at the end of the week but no specific peak for time of year was found. Suicides occurred most frequently from afternoon to night and accidents during the rush hours. Most train-pedestrian fatalities happened in densely populated areas. In conclusion, the effective prevention of railway suicides and accidents calls for a systems approach involving effective measures introduced by authorities responsible for urban planning, railways, education and public health.

TI Psychotropic prescriptions and elderly suicide rates
SO MEDICINE SCIENCE AND THE LAW
LA English
DT Article
ID ANTIDEPRESSANTS; PREVENTION; SWEDEN; TRENDS
AB Suicide rates in the elderly have declined in recent years in several countries including England and Wales. There have also been major changes in prescribing patterns of psychotropics in many countries during recent years. This study examined the association between a trend of decline in suicide rates in the elderly in England and Wales and changes in the prescribing of psychotropics for the period 1985 to 1996. Data on suicide rates was ascertained from the annual mortality statistics for the years 1985 to 1996.
   Data on the prescriptions of psychotropics was ascertained from the Statistic Division (SD1E) at the Department of Health. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rho) was used to examine the relationship between the prescription of psychotropics and suicide rates.
   The main findings of this study were: (i) a highly significant negative correlation between the prescription of tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and elderly suicide rates; (ii) a significant positive correlation between the prescription of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and elderly suicide rates; (iii) a highly significant negative correlation between the prescription of antimanics and antipsychotics and elderly suicide rates; (iv) a highly significant positive correlation between the prescription of hypnotics, anxiolytics and barbiturates and elderly suicide rates; and, (v) a significant negative correlation between the prescription of analgesics and elderly suicide rates.
   A trend of decline in suicide rates in the elderly in England and Wales for 1985 to 1996 and changes in the prescribing of psychotropics were significantly associated. The results of this study suggest that prescription patterns of psychotropics may be an important factor contributing to the recent decline in suicide rates in the elderly in England and Wales but this effect should be viewed in the context of other health and social factors.

TI Individual- and area-level influence on suicide risk: a multilevel

ID MENTAL-HEALTH; PSYCHOTIC-DISORDERS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ASSOCIATION; LONDON;
   COHORT; NEIGHBORHOODS; DETERMINANTS; INEQUALITIES; DEPRIVATION
AB Background
   Characteristics related to the areas where people live have been associated with suicide risk, although these might reflect aggregation into these communities of individuals with mental health or social problems. No studies have examined whether area characteristics during childhood are associated with subsequent suicide, or whether risk associated with individual characteristics varies according to childhood neighbourhood context.
   Method
   We conducted a longitudinal study of 204323 individuals born in Sweden in 1972 and 1977 with childhood data linked to suicide (n=314; 0.15%) up to age 26-31 years. Multilevel modelling was used to examine: (i) whether school-, municipality- or county-level characteristics during childhood are associated with later suicide, independently of individual effects, and (ii) whether associations between individual characteristics and suicide vary according to school context (reflecting both peer group and neighbourhood effects).
   Results
   Associations between suicide and most contextual measures, except for school-level gender composition, were explained by individual characteristics. There was some evidence of cross-level effects of individual- and school-level markers of ethnicity and deprivation on suicide risk, with qualitative interaction patterns. For example, having foreign-born parents increased the risk for individuals raised in areas where they were in a relative minority, but protected against suicide in areas where larger proportions of the population had foreign-born parents.
   Conclusions
   Characteristics that define individuals as being different from most people in their local environment as they grow up may increase suicide risk. If robustly replicated, these findings have potentially important implications for understanding the aetiology of suicide and informing social policy.

DT Article
ID FOLLOW-UP; JOB LOSS; MORTALITY; RISK; DURATION; DENMARK; TRENDS
AB Objectives. We tested 2 hypotheses found in studies of the relationship between suicide and unemployment: causal (stress and adversity) and selective interpretation (previous poor health).
   Methods. We estimated Cox models for adults (n = 3 424 550) born between 1931 and 1965. We examined mortality during the recession (1993-1996), postrecession (1997-2002), and a combined follow-up. Models controlled for previous medical problems, and social, family, and employer characteristics.
   Results. During the recession there was no excess hazard of mortality from suicide or events of undetermined intent. Postrecession, there was an excess hazard of suicide mortality for unemployed men but not unemployed women. However, for unemployed women with no health-problem history there was a modest hazard of suicide. Finally, there was elevated mortality from events of undetermined intent for unemployed men and women postrecession.
   Conclusions. A small part of the relationship may be related to health selection, more so during the recession. However, postrecessionary period findings suggest that much of the association could be causal. A narrow focus on suicide mortality may understate the mortality effects of unemployment in Sweden.

ID NEW-SOUTH-WALES; 1ST-GENERATION; ADOLESCENTS; IMMIGRANTS; PARENTS
AB Purpose Generally, due to limited availability of official statistics on the topic, little is known about suicide mortality in second-generation migrants. A recent study from Sweden showed that these people could be at a high suicide risk. In a generalised phenomenon, this aspect would represent an important issue in suicide prevention. This paper aims to report the profile of second-generation migrants who died by suicide and the suicide risk differentials of second-generation migrants with other Australians.
   Methods Official suicide data from 2001 to 2008 were linked with State/Territory registries to collect information about the birthplace of the deceased's parents to differentiate migration status (first, second or third-plus generation). The profile and suicide risk of second-generation migrants were compared with other generations by logistic and Poisson regression.
   Results Suicide in second-generation migrants accounted for 811 cases (14.6 %). These tended to be represented by younger subjects, more often never married, as compared to the other cases. Second-generation males aged 25-39 years tended to have a higher suicide risk than first-generation migrants, but the risk was lower when compared with the third-plus generation. Second-generation migrants aged 60+ tended to have a lower suicide risk than first-generation migrants.
   Conclusion In Australia, second-generation migrants are not at a higher suicide risk as compared to first-generation migrants or locals (third-plus-generation). In males aged 25-39, a lower suicide risk was found in second-generations as compared to Australian-born third generation, which may be explained by their more advantageous socioeconomic status and the flexibility and resources rendered by having grown up in a bicultural environment. The higher suicide rates found amongst older first-generation migrants require further examination.

   1ST-GENERATION
AB Suicide mortality among immigrant groups is an important health issue, particularly in countries with growing segments of immigrant populations such as Norway. Through linkage of Norwegian national registers we wanted to estimate suicide rates (per 100,000 population) in immigrant groups and to profile characteristics of suicide by immigration background with respect to sex, age, method and seasonality of suicide as well as time since immigrating to Norway. Among all 11,409 suicides during 1992-2012, 1,139 (10%) were individuals with an immigration background. Suicide rate was lower in first-generation immigrants (foreign-born persons to two foreign-born parents) than native Norwegians (9.53 vs 12.22, P < 0.01), with a significant difference confined to male rates only. Foreign-born persons with at least one Norwegian-born parent had significantly higher suicide rates than natives in both sexes (22.42 vs 18.03 in males, 11.67 vs 6.54 in females, P < 0.01). The most frequently used suicide method in all the population groups was hanging; this method accounted for 44.0% of all suicides of first-generation immigrants, 45.2% of all suicides of foreign-born persons with at least one Norwegian-born parent, and 35.4% of all suicides of natives. Suicide by firearms accounted for a much smaller proportion of cases of first-generation immigrants (6.7%) and foreign-born persons with at least one Norwegian-born parent (6.8%) than cases of native Norwegians (20.7%). In terms of monthly distribution, suicides of first-generation immigrants displayed two peaks, in May and in November (P= 0.01). More than 25% of all first-generation immigrant suicides occurred in the first five years after immigration; but differences in time since immigration were observed by sex and country group of origin, in particular among those aged 35 years or less when moving to Norway. In conclusion, there are notable differences in characteristics of suicides by immigration background. Knowledge of immigrant mortality according to suicide method, seasonality of suicide, and time since immigration may be useful when planning suicide preventive measures.

AB Encountering the body of a child who died by suicide at the site of death is believed to be especially harmful for bereaved parents. We investigated the association between encountering the body at the site of the suicide and psychological distress in 666 suicide-bereaved parents. Parents who had encountered their child's body at the site of the suicide (n=147) did not have a higher risk of nightmares (relative risk [RR] 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67-1.35), intrusive memories (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84-1.13), avoidance of thoughts (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.74-1.27), avoidance of places or things (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.66-1.25), anxiety (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.64-1.33), or depression (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.63-1.42) compared with parents who had not encountered the body (n=512). Our results suggest that losing a child by suicide is sufficiently disastrous by itself to elicit posttraumatic responses or psychiatric morbidity whether or not the parent has encountered the deceased child at the site of death.

AB Neighborhood context can change the effect of a socio-demographic attribute on the risk of suicide. Eight hypotheses about the interactions between neighborhood composition, ethnicity, income, and socially disadvantaged propositions are proposed based on social support, social comparison, and social regulation mechanisms. They are tested with a population-based dataset of all adults (1.4 million) who lived in the greater Stockholm area in the 1990s. On one hand, multi-level analysis shows that suicide risk increases with the level of affluence in one's neighborhood, particularly among individuals with low income. This supports the notion that income comparison can have negative consequences. On the other hand, social welfare recipients are less likely to commit suicide when there are other social welfare recipients in the neighborhood. Suicide risk among immigrants decreases with the proportion of co-ethnics in the neighborhood, confirming previous findings on social support and suicide. However, further analyses show that the protection effect of having co-ethnic neighbors is limited to immigrants from countries with low suicide rates. This study shows that administrative data can be used to examine neighborhood effects on rare outcomes. The findings are relevant to the contemporary trends towards rising income inequality and ethnic diversity.

AB Objective To obtain more accurate calculations of maternal and pregnancy-related mortality ratios in Sweden from 1988 to 2007 by using information from national registers and death certificates. Design A national register-based study, supplemented by a review of death certificates. Setting Sweden, 1988-2007. Population The deaths of 27 957 women of reproductive age (1549 years). Methods The Swedish Cause of Death Register, Medical Birth Register, and National Patient Register were linked. All women with a diagnosis related to pregnancy in at least one of these registers within 1 year prior to death were identified. Death certificates were reviewed to ascertain maternal deaths. Maternal mortality ratio (the number of maternal deaths/100 000 live births, excluding and including suicides), and pregnancy-related mortality ratio (number of deaths within 42 days after termination of pregnancy, irrespective of cause of death/100 000 live births) were calculated. Main outcome measures Direct and indirect maternal deaths and pregnancy-related deaths. Results The maternal mortality ratio in Sweden, based on the current method of identifying maternal deaths, was 3.6. After linking registers and reviewing death certificates, we identified 64% more maternal deaths, resulting in a ratio of 6.0 (or 6.5 if suicides are included). The pregnancy-related mortality ratio was 7.3. A total of 478 women died within a year after being recorded with a diagnosis related to pregnancy. Conclusions By including the 123 cases of maternal death identified in this study, the mean maternal mortality ratio from 1988 to 2007 was 64% higher than reported to the World Health Organization.

AB IMPORTANCE Suicide attempts are common in individuals with eating disorders. More precise understanding of the mechanisms underlying their concomitant occurrence is needed.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the association between eating disorders and suicide attempts and whether familial risk factors contribute to the association.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A Swedish birth cohort including individuals born in Sweden between January 1, 1979, and December 31, 2001, was followed up from age 6 years to December 31, 2009 (N = 2 268 786). Information was acquired from Swedish national registers. All individuals were linked to their biological full siblings, maternal half siblings, paternal half siblings, full cousins, and half cousins. Data analysis was conducted from October 5, 2014, to April 28, 2015.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Eating disorders were captured by 3 variables (any eating disorder, anorexia nervosa, and bulimia nervosa) identified by any lifetime diagnoses recorded in the registers. Suicide attempts were defined as any suicide attempts, including death by suicide, recorded in the registers. We examined the association between eating disorders and death by suicide separately, but the study was underpowered to explore familial liability for this association.
   RESULTS Of 2 268 786 individuals, 15 457 females (1.40% of all females) and 991 males (0.09% of all males) had any eating disorder, 7680 females (0.70%) and 453 males (0.04%) had anorexia nervosa, and 3349 females (0.30%), and 61 males (0.01%) had bulimia nervosa. Individuals with any eating disorder had an increased risk (reported as odds ratio [95% CI]) of suicide attempts (5.28 [5.04-5.54]) and death by suicide (5.39 [4.00-7.25]). The risks were attenuated but remained significant after adjusting for comorbid major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and substance use disorder (suicide attempts: 1.82 [1.72-1.93]; death by suicide: 2.04 [1.49-2.80]). Similar results were found for anorexia nervosa (suicide attempts: crude, 4.42 [4.12-4.74] vs adjusted, 1.70 [1.56-1.85]; death by suicide: crude, 6.46 [4.38-9.54] vs adjusted, 2.67 [1.78-4.01]) and bulimia nervosa (suicide attempts: crude, 6.26 [5.73-6.85] vs adjusted, 1.88 [1.68-2.10]; death by suicide: crude, 4.45 [2.44-8.11] vs adjusted, 1.48 [0.81-2.72]). Individuals (index) who had a full sibling with any eating disorder had an increased risk of suicide attempts (1.41 [1.29-1.53]). The risk was attenuated for any eating disorder in more-distant relatives (maternal half siblings, 1.10 [0.90-1.34]; paternal half siblings, 1.21 [0.98-1.49]; full cousins, 1.11 [1.06-1.18]; half cousins, 0.90 [0.78-1.03]). This familial pattern remained stable after adjusting for the index individuals' eating disorders. Similar patterns were found for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results suggest an increased risk of suicide attempts in individuals with lifetime eating disorders and their relatives. The pattern of familial coaggregation suggests familial liability for the association between eating disorders and suicide. Psychiatric comorbidities partially explain this association, suggesting particularly high-risk presentations.

AB The use of antidepressant in depressive illness results in a reduction of suicidal attempts and deaths due to suicide, conditions that are generally present in this disorder. Recently, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) prohibited the use of antidepressants during childhood and adolescence. This decision was based on a supposed increase in suicidal thinking in these age groups. However the evidence came from flawed clinical studies, some of them not even published, in which no significant differences were observed when compared to placebo. It is not possible to ascribe a direct responsibility to antidepressants, because depression, by definition, has suicidal ideation. On the contrary, the reduction of suicidal rates supports the effectiveness of these medications.

AB Background: We aimed to compare the prevalence of impulsive suicide attempts (ISA) among young adults and those over 25 who present at hospital in connection with attempted suicide. We also aimed to identify factors associated with ISA in young adults and to assess medical severity as well as the probability of repeated suicide attempts in this age group.
   Method: A prospective multicentre cohort study included hospital known cases of suicide attempt (N = 666). The prevalence of ISA was compared between young adults (18-25) and adults aged > 26. We used logistic regression models to identify factors associated with ISA, associations of ISA with high medical severity and prediction of new fatal or non-fatal suicide attempts within 6 months.
   Results: 43.7% of the young patients had made an ISA, and 30.2% among those aged > 26 (p = 0.001). Among the young, substance use disorder was associated with ISA; crude odds ratio (OR) 2.0 (1.0-4.2), and adjusted OR 2.1 (0.99-4.4). Affective disorder and unemployment/sickness absence implied lower odds of ISA. ISA resulted in injuries of high medical severity as often as more planned attempts and non-fatal or fatal repetition within 6 months was equally common (30%) in both groups. Limitations: The study was set in psychiatric emergency services, which limits the generalizability.
   Conclusions: Clinicians should acknowledge that suicide attempts among youth often occur without previous planning and may result in medically severe injuries. The probability of new fatal or non-fatal suicide attempts should be kept in mind also after an impulsive suicide attempt.

AB Background Income inequalities have risen from the 1990s to 2000s, following the economic recession in 1994, but little research has investigated socioeconomic inequalities in suicide mortality for working-age men and women (aged between 30 and 64 years) over the time using longitudinal data in Sweden.
   Methods Using Swedish national register data between 1990 and 2007 as a series of repeated cohort studies with a 3-year follow-up (sample sizes were approximately 3.7 to 4.0million in each year), relative and slope indices of inequality (RII and SII respectively) based on quintiles of individual disposable income were calculated and tested for temporal trends.
   Results SII for the risk of suicide mortality ranged from 27.6 (95% CI 19.5 to 35.8) to 44.5 (36.3 to 52.6) in men and 5.2 (0.2 to 10.4) to 16.6 (10.7 to 22.4) in women (per 100000 population). In men, temporal trends in suicide inequalities were stable in SII but increasing in RII by 3% each year (p=0.002). In women, inequalities tended to increase in both RII and SII, especially after the late-1990s, with 10% increment in RII per year (p<0.001).
   Conclusions Despite universal social security and generous welfare provision, income inequalities in suicide were considerable and have widened, especially in women. The steeper rise in women may be partially related to higher job insecurity and poorer working conditions in the female dominated public sector after the recession. To reduce health consequences following an economic crisis and widened income inequalities, additional measures may be necessary in proportion to the levels of financial vulnerability.

AB One area of research in suicidology aims at understanding the processes underlying aggregation or clustering of suicide cases within a limited period of time or space (suicide epidemics). Susceptibility to, or propagation of, suicidal behavior due to given risk factors may be operating through media other than space, and its susceptibility for the receiver may be different within different types of strata that are determined by socio-demographic, personality-related or biological-susceptibility differences. We use the term "assortative susceptibility'' for this phenomenon. Aggregated cases, comprising calendar months with an unusually large number of suicides after adjusting for seasonal and yearly variations, were defined in the register of all 1093 completed suicides during 1969-93 in the county of Vasterbotten in northern Sweden. Binary multiple logistic regressions were performed to compare the aggregated cases with the remaining cases. Compared with the remaining cases, the aggregated cases included significantly more of males and of those living in the rural forested regions. Also, suicide by firearms was significantly more aggregated than the other methods. Our results suggest that middle-aged or older men from the rural areas, who have access to firearms, are likely to belong to the socio-demographic stratum that is susceptible to the processes that give rise to aggregations or clusters of suicides in this county (assortative susceptibility).

AB Each year, almost 1 million people die from suicide, which is among the leading causes of death in young people. We studied how birth order was associated with suicide and other main causes of death. A follow-up study based on the Swedish population register was conducted for sibling groups born from 1932 to 1980 who were observed during the period 1981-2002. Focus was on the within-family variation in suicide risk, meaning that we studied sibling groups that consisted of 2 or more children in which at least 1 died from suicide. These family-fixed effects analyses revealed that each increase in birth order was related to an 18% higher suicide risk (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14, 1.23, P = 0.000). The association was slightly lower among sibling groups born in 1932-1955 (hazard ratio = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.21, P = 0.000) than among those born in 1967-1980 (hazard ratio = 1.24, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.57, P = 0.080). Further analyses suggested that the association between birth order and suicide was only modestly influenced by sex, birth spacing, size of the sibling group, own socioeconomic position, own marital status, and socioeconomic rank within the sibling group. Causes of death other than suicide and other external causes were not associated with birth order.

AB The paper summarises results from five studies exploring psychosocial outcomes for international adoptees in Sweden. Cohorts of international adoptees were identified in national Swedish registers. The study groups were compared with: 1) general population, 2) national adoptees, 3) immigrants, 4) children on welfare, and 5) birth children of the adoptive parents. The international adoptees had around three-fold excess risks of hospitalisation due to psychiatric problems and suicidal behaviour in models adjusted for age, sex and the adoptive family's social prerequisites. The risk of suicidal behaviour was also high in national adoptees, but lower than that of foster children who had even higher risks. Educational attainment was on par with the general population. Age at adoption over 4 years was related to a poorer outcome. In conclusion, international adoptees are more vulnerable than non-adoptees.

AB To study the association between loss of an adult sibling due to suicide and mortality from various causes up to 18 years after bereavement.
   We conducted a follow-up study between 1981 and 2002, based on register data representing the total population of Swedes aged 25-64 years (n = 1,748,069).
   An elevated mortality rate from all causes was found among men (RR 1.26; 95 % CI: 1.14-1.40) and women (1.27; 1.11-1.45) who had experienced a sibling's suicide. The standardized rate ratio of suicide of bereaved to non-bereaved persons was 2.46 (1.86-3.24) among men and 3.25 (2.28-4.65) among women. We also found some indications of an interrelation between sibling suicide and subsequent deaths from external causes other than suicide in men (1.77; 1.34-2.34) and deaths from cardiovascular disease in women (1.37; 0.99-1.91). An elevated all-cause mortality rate was found after the first year of bereavement in men, while bereaved women experienced higher mortality rates during the first 2 years and after 5 years of bereavement.
   Our study provides support for adverse health effects among survivors associated with sibling loss due to suicide. Sibling suicides were primarily associated with suicide in bereaved survivors, although there was an increased mortality rate from discordant causes, which strengthens the possibility that the observed associations might not be entirely due to shared genetic causes.

AB Objective: Using a prospective design, to examine the relation between self-image (assessed using the Structural Analysis of Social Behavior) and suicide attempts/completions in women with anorexia nervosa-restricting type (ANR), anorexia nervosa-binge/purge type (ANBP), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED), and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS); and to assess whether these self-image variables add unique predictive value to suicide when considering other baseline predictors.
   Method: Women (N = 2269) aged 12 to 45 (M = 22.1) presenting to specialist eating disorders clinics in Sweden between 2005 and 2009 were identified through the Stepwise Eating Disorders Quality Register. Data on age, body mass index, eating disorder severity (Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire scores), psychiatric comorbidity, global assessment of functioning, and self-image were abstracted from Stepwise and included as baseline predictors or covariates. Suicide information (prior attempt and attempt/completion after Stepwise registration) was obtained from the National Patient Register and Cause of Death Register.
   Results: Prevalence of detected suicide attempts/completions over the study period was 9.2%. Negative self-image variables were associated with prior suicide attempts in ANR and EDNOS and later suicide attempts/completions in women with BN. In a stepwise Cox proportional hazards model, only low self-affirmation predicted time to suicide attempts/completions in women with BN when accounting for age and prior suicide attempt.
   Conclusion: Assessing self-image might assist with identifying women with BN at elevated risk for suicide. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction Familial clustering of suicidal behaviour and psychopathology has been reported in young suicide attempters. Most of these studies were predominantly carried out in clinical treatment settings and lacked statistical power to assess the independent and modifying influences of own and familial psychopathology and suicidal behaviour. Methods We carried out a population-based record-linkage study with a nested case control design. The 14,440 individuals hospitalised due to suicide attempt (cases) and 144,400 matched controls were born in Sweden between 1968 and 1980 and followed up till December 31, 1999. Results Among the strongest independent familial risk factors for youth suicide attempt were siblings' (OR 3.4; 2.8-4.1), maternal (OR 2.7; 2.5-3.1) and paternal (OR 1.9; 1.7-2.1) suicide attempt. Other important risk factors were familial personality and substance abuse disorders, maternal schizophrenia, non-affective psychoses and organic disorders and parental neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (1.9-3.2 fold increase), and paternal (OR 1.9; 1.6-2.3) and maternal (OR 1.8; 1.3-2.4) suicide completion. Mental illnesses in index subjects, particularly substance abuse, affective and personality disorders, were the dominant determinants of suicide attempt. Strong interactions were observed between psychopathology in index subjects and familial suicidality. Familial suicide completion had a stronger effect on suicide attempt of earlier onset and on boys. Nearly half (47%) of all suicide attempts could be attributed to familial psychopathology (13%), family suicide attempt (7%) and suicide completion (1%) and own psychopathology (25%). Conclusion Early recognition and adequate treatment of individual mental illness contribute to prevent youth suicide attempts. Children of parents with psychopathology and suicidal behaviour should receive early support and attention. Evaluation of familial suicidal behaviour seems to be vital for suicide risk assessment in young psychiatric inpatients. There appears to be an independent effect of familial suicidal behaviour as well as familial psychopathology on youth suicide attempt beyond the transmission of mental illness.

AB Background: National mortality statistics should be comparable between countries that use the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases. Distinguishing between manners of death, especially suicides and accidents, is a challenge. Knowledge about accidents is important in prevention of both accidents and suicides. The aim of the present study was to assess the reliability of classifying deaths as accidents and undetermined manner of deaths in the three Scandinavian countries and to compare cross-national differences.
   Methods: The cause of death registers in Norway, Sweden and Denmark provided data from 2008 for samples of 600 deaths from each country, of which 200 were registered as suicides, 200 as accidents or undetermined manner of deaths and 200 as natural deaths. The information given to the eight experts was identical to the information used by the Cause of Death Register. This included death certificates, and if available external post-mortem examinations, forensic autopsy reports and police reports.
   Results: In total, 69 % (Sweden and Norway) and 78 % (Denmark) of deaths registered in the official mortality statistics as accidents were confirmed by the experts. In the majority of the cases where disagreement was seen, the experts reclassified accidents to undetermined manner of death, in 26, 25 and 19 % of cases, respectively. Few cases were reclassified as suicides or natural deaths. Among the extracted accidents, the experts agreed least with the official mortality statistics concerning drowning and poisoning accidents. They also reported most uncertainty in these categories of accidents. In a second re-evaluation, where more information was made available, the Norwegian psychiatrist and forensic pathologist increased their agreement with the official mortality statistics from 76 to 87 %, and from 85 to 88 %, respectively, regarding the Norwegian and Swedish datasets. Among the extracted undetermined deaths in the Swedish dataset, the two experts reclassified 22 and 51 %, respectively, to accidents.
   Conclusion: There was moderate agreement in reclassification of accidents between the official mortality statistics and the experts. In the majority of cases where there was disagreement, accidents were reclassified as undetermined manner of death, and only a small proportion as suicides.

TI Are cancer patients at higher suicide risk than the general population?:

AB Objectives: The aims were to test whether suicide is more prevalent among cancer patients than among the general population, whether the association changes over time, and whether the risk depends on the severity of the cancer disease. Design: A register study was carried out, where standardized suicide rates for different cancer sites were analysed by sex, time periods ( 1965 - 74, 1975 - 84, and 1985 - 94), and five-year survival rates. Setting: The setting was the Swedish population from 1965 to 1999. Subjects: The cohort studied was 1,031,919 cancer cases and 2,587,152 person-years. Main outcome measures: The main outcome measure was the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) with the world population as standard population. Results: Cancer patients run a higher risk of suicide than the general population. The suicide rate ratio between male cancer patients and the general population was about 2.5 in 1965 - 74, which thereafter reduced to about 1.5 in 1985 94. The suicide rate among female cancer patients was in excess of 2.9 in 1965 - 74 and 2.3 in 1985 - 94. In fact, a slightly higher rate for women was observed for 1985 - 94 than for 1975 - 84. There is also a strong negative association between survival rates and suicide rates, i.e. suicide rates are higher for severe cancer sites with low survival rates. Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that cancer patients run greater risks of committing suicide than the general population does. The severity of the cancer increases the suicide risk. More attention to cancer patients' psychological and care situation is called for.

AB Specimens of blood and other body fluids were obtained at autopsy from all deaths in Sweden classified as suicide covering a 10-year period (N = 11,441 cases). The mean age (+/- standard deviation, SD) of the victims was 51.3 +/- 18.8 years witha clear predominance of males 71%(mean age 51.3 +/- 18.8 years) compared with 29% females (mean age 51.4 +/- 18.9 years). The concentration of ethanol in blood samples was determined in duplicate by headspace gas chromatography and a mean blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.1 g/L (10 mg/100 mL) was the cut-off used to identify ethanol positive cases. The suicides were coded (ICD-9) as self-poisonings (N = 2462, 22%), hanging (N = 4474, 39%), asphyxia by gas (N = 509, 4.4%), drowning (N = 803, 7.0%), gun shot (N = 1307, 11.4%), fall from height (N = 632, 5.5%), self-inflicted cuts or sharp-force injury (N = 363, 3.1%) and miscellaneous ways (N = 891, 7.8%). On average 34% of all suicide victims in Sweden had consumed alcohol before death, 36% of the males and 31% of the females had a positive BAC. The mean (median) concentration of alcohol in femoral blood for men was 1.34 g/L (1.3 g/L) compared with 1.25 g/L (1.1 g/L) for women. Many victims were heavily intoxicated and the 90th percentiles of the BAC distributions ranged from 2.3 to 2.8 g/L depending on manner of death. Elevated blood-alcohol was most prevalent in poisoning deaths (45%) and gas asphyxia (51%) and least prevalent in falls from height (19%) and sharp-force injury (18%). Toxicological analysis for presence of drugs other than alcohol showed a predominance of paracetamol, SSRI antidepressants, anti-psychotics, sedative-hypnotics, and centrally acting opioids. A host of psycho-social factors drive a person to commit suicide and one of the catalysts is over-consumption of alcohol and acute alcohol intoxication. Heavy drinking leads to a loss of inhibitions, impulsive behaviour, poor judgment and a tendency to take risks, all of which might increase the propensity of predisposed individuals to take their own lives.

AB Background: A few studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between the general population and suicide rates and antidepressant prescribing rates. Correlations between general population suicide rates and prescribing rates of other psychotropic drugs have also been observed. There have not been any studies during the last decade.
   Methods: The relationship between adult suicide rates and prescription rates of psychotropic drugs by the broad British National Formulary (BNF) categories, for individual psychotropic drug groups within the BNF categories (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and for individual psychotropic drugs was examined over a 12-year period (1995-2006) was examined using Spearman's rank correlation. All data were ascertained from the archives of the Office for National Statistics.
   Results: There was an absence of significant correlations between adult suicides rates and rates of prescriptions of psychotropic drugs in the broad BNF categories, individual psychotropic drug groups and individual psychotropic drugs.
   Discussion: The findings may be due to methodological errors. Should the findings be accurate, then the following approaches require consideration to reduce suicide rates further: (i) development of strategies to ensure continued prescription of psychotropic drugs at the current level; (ii) development of strategies to improve non-pharmacological measures, including improved mental health services provision for adults, improved assessment of suicide risk, increased availability of psychosocial interventions and restricting the availability of methods of suicide; and (iii) development of strategies to implement improvement in distal risk (e.g. societal socio-economic status) and protective (e.g. societal educational attainment) factors for suicide at a societal level.

DE Physician-assisted suicide; public attitudes; trust
ID EUTHANASIA
AB Aim: To investigate the attitudes among the Swedish population towards physician-assisted suicide, with special regard to the possible effects on trust in the medical services of physician-assisted suicide being allowed. Design: A postal questionnaire about physician-assisted suicide under certain conditions and its possible influence on trust in the medical services was distributed to 1206 randomly selected individuals living in the county of Stockholm. Two reminders were distributed, followed by a short version of the questionnaire containing only the question about the attitude towards physician-assisted suicide. Results: The total response rate was 51%, a short-version reminder adding another 7%. Of all participants, 73% were in favour of physician-assisted suicide, 12% were against, and 15% were undecided. They believed that their trust in the medical services would increase (38%) or not be influenced at all (45%) if physician-assisted suicide were to be allowed. However, 75% of those who were against physician-assisted suicide believed that their trust would decrease. As compared to those reporting high trust in medical services (n = 492), those with low trust (n = 97) stated that their trust would increase, 36% (confidence interval (CI) = 35-37%) vs. 49% (95% CI = 39-59%). Thirty-three per cent (95% CI = 28-38%) of the younger respondents (< 50 years), and 43% (95% CI = 37-49%) of the older respondents believed that their trust would increase. Conclusions: We found no evidence for the assumption that trust in the medical services would be unambiguously jeopardized if physician-assisted suicide were to be legalized. Only among the minority who opposed physician-assisted suicide did a majority of respondents report that their trust would decrease.

AB Background: Decreased binding capacity of SERT in the prefrontal cortex has been observed in both suicide victims and suicide attempters. Moreover, some studies have shown that SERT has a seasonal variation with lower binding capacity in the spring and summer, which coincides with a seasonal peak of suicides. Our aim was to explore whether the season of treatment initiation with antidepressants is associated with suicide or suicide attempt and compare it with the underlying suicide seasonality in the general population.
   Methods: Using Swedish registers, patients who initiated treatment with an antidepressant were followed up to three months for suicidal behavior. Cox regression analyses were used. Results were compared with the underlying seasonal pattern by calculating standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for suicides and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for suicide attempts.
   Results: Patients aged years had higher risk for suicide when initiating antidepressant treatment in the summer, and also a higher risk for suicide attempt when initiating treatment in the spring and summer. Young patients (0-24 years) presented a higher risk for suicide attempt when initiating treatment in the autumn. Patients with previous suicide attempt had a seasonal pattern, with a higher risk to carry out a suicide attempt in the summer and autumn. Results from the SMR and SIR calculations numerically support these findings.
   Limitations: We used information of filling an antidepressant prescription as a proxy of actual antidepressant treatment. Patients with combination, augmentation therapy or those switching antidepressant during followup were excluded. Thus, our results refer to less complicated psychopathology.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate an interaction between biological and health care-related factors for the observed seasonal pattern of suicidal behavior in the elderly, whereas psychological and societal factors may be more important for the seasonality observed in the younger patients.

AB Background and aim: Individuals with coeliac disease have increased risk of depression and death from external causes, but conclusive studies on death from suicide are missing. We examined the risk of suicide in coeliac disease and amongst individuals where the small intestinal biopsy showed no villous atrophy.
   Methods: We collected biopsy data from all 28 clinical pathology departments in Sweden for individuals diagnosed during 1969-2007 with coeliac disease (Marsh 3: villous atrophy; n = 29,083 unique individuals), inflammation without villous atrophy (Marsh 1-2; n = 13,263) or positive coeliac disease serology but normal mucosa (Marsh 0, n = 3719). Through Cox regression we calculated Hazard ratios for suicide as recorded in the Swedish Cause of Death Register.
   Results: The risk for suicide was higher in patients with coeliac disease compared to general population controls (HR = 1.55; 95%Cl = 1.15-2.10; based on 54 completed suicides). Whilst suicide was also more common amongst individuals with inflammation (HR = 1.96; 95%Cl = 1.39-2.77), no such increase was seen amongst individuals with a normal mucosa but positive coeliac disease serology (HR = 1.06; 95%Cl = 0.37-3.02).
   Conclusions: We found a moderately increased risk of suicide amongst patients with coeliac disease. This merits increased attention amongst physicians treating these patients. (C) 2011 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Numerous authors have reported serious shortcomings in the treatment of suicidal patients. This study examined the treatment suicide attempters admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Switzerland had received prior to the suicide attempt.
   Method: Thirty-one patients were admitted to this hospital within a year, representing 36 suicide attempts, which corresponds to 6.5% of the annual admission number. Three of these patients were admitted twice, and one patient was admitted three times. Information on previous treatment was collected in personal interviews and included medication, and its dosage, at I month and 2 weeks prior to the suicide attempt, and whether the patient had received psychotherapy. In addition, details of the psychosocial event and the means of the suicide attempt were recorded.
   Results: Twenty-one patients had been prescribed psychotropic drugs in 24 events, but only in 17 events concerning 15 patients, antidepressants were prescribed prior to hospitalisation. Antipsychotics and benzodiazepines were prescribed in 6 and 21 events, respectively (including 8 events with hypnotics). None of the patients was treated with lithium. In 19 events, 16 patients had received psychotherapy prior to admission. In 32 events, psychotropic drugs were used for the suicide attempt.
   Conclusion: The findings confirm the undertreatment of patients attempting suicide reported by other authors. In spite of the majority of patients being under psychiatric care, no adequate pharmacotherapy had been prescribed particularly for depressed patients. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines the impact of job loss on overall and cause-specific mortality. Using linked employer-employee data, we identified the workers displaced due to all establishment closures in Sweden in 1987 and 1988. Hence, we have extended the case study approach, which has dominated the plant closure literature. The overall mortality risk among men increased by 44 percent during the first four years following job loss, while there was no impact on either female overall mortality or in the longer run. For both sexes, however, there was an about twofold short-run increase in suicides and alcohol-related mortality.

AB This study analyses the relationship between early life circumstances and suicide during adolescence and young adulthood among men in a Stockholm birth cohort born in 1953. Relevant variables were derived from Durkheim's proposition of social integration and suicide and Merton's strain theory of deviance. The links between our background variables and suicide were estimated with rare events logistic regression, a statistical method specially developed for situations in which rare events are endemic to the data. We found that self-rated loneliness at age 12-13 as an indicator of social isolation, school absenteeism at the same age as an indicator of school integration, and growing up in a family which received means-tested social assistance at least once during the period 1953-1965 as an indicator of childhood poverty, were statistically related to subsequent suicide risk between 1970 and 1984. Furthermore, following Bourdieu's rereading of Durkheim's Suicide, we argue that social isolation and school integration can be seen as important forms of deprivation, since "social integration" can also be understood in terms of "social recognition". This view emphasises the importance of taking the emotional and social poverty of children just as seriously as their material poverty when it comes to suicide. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Prescription drugs for many indications are labeled with warnings for potential risk of suicidal ideation or behavior. Exposures to prescription drugs labeled for adverse effects of suicidal behavior or ideation among 100 Air Force personnel who died by suicide between 2006 and 2009 are described. Air Force registry data were linked to administrative prescription data. Descriptive statistics illustrate utilization: 89 personnel had a prescription history, 35 filled at least one prescription labeled with a warning, 26 had antidepressants on hand at death, and 2 died by drug overdose. Most airmen were not exposed to any prescriptions labeled for risk of suicidal ideation or behavior prior to death by suicide.

AB Purpose: This study assessed psychiatric medications and their potential lethality in a representative sample of suicide attempts. Materials and methods: During 1996-98, 563 suicide attempts were studied in a general hospital in Madrid (Spain). Medication overdose was used in 456 suicide attempts (81%). The ratio between dose taken and maximum prescription dose recommended was used to evaluate the medication toxicity. Results: Benzodiazepines were the drugs most often used in self-poisoning (65% of overdoses), followed by new antidepressants (11%), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (10%), and antipsychotics (8%). An overdose with any of the three latter psychiatric medications was significantly more frequent in patients prescribed those medications. The overdoses for TCA were potentially lethal in 47% of the cases. However, all patients who overdosed on psychiatric medications recovered well and were discharged without any sequelae. Discussion: This study suggests that psychiatric medications, particularly benzodiazepines, new antidepressants and antipsychotics, are relatively safe when they are used for self-poisoning. If patients with mental illnesses are under treated, there is a clear and documented higher risk for suicide. Conclusion: It is better to prescribe psychiatric medications, particularly the new ones, rather than withhold them due to an exaggerated fear of a lethal overdose (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

AB ObjectiveTo investigate differences in suicide risk among immigrant population in Norway compared with native Norwegians, with respect to associated country group of origin.
   MethodsBased on the entire national population, a nested case-control design was adopted using Norwegian national longitudinal registers to obtain 23073 suicide cases having occurred in 1969-2012 and 373178 controls. Odds ratios (ORs) for suicide were estimated using conditional logistic regression analysis adjusting for socio-economic factors.
   ResultsCompared with native Norwegians, suicide risk was significantly lower in first- and second-generation immigrants but higher in Norwegian-born with one foreign-born parent and foreign-born individuals with at least one Norwegian-born parent. When stratifying data by country group of origin, first-generation immigrants had lower ORs in most of the strata. Subjects born in Asia and in Central and South America with at least one Norwegian-born parent had a significantly higher risk of suicide. The observed results remained mostly unchanged in the analyses controlled for socio-economic status.
   ConclusionsSuicide risk is lower in first- and second-generation immigrants but higher in subjects born in Norway with one foreign-born parent and those born abroad with at least one Norwegian-born parent, with notable differences by country group of origin.

AB Background: There is a need for evidence-based guidelines on how professionals should act following a suicide. In an effort to provide empiric knowledge, we designed a nationwide population-based study including suicide-bereaved parents. Aim: To describe the process from creating hypotheses through interviews to the development of a population-based questionnaire. Method: We used interviews, qualitative analysis and various means of validation to create a study-specific questionnaire to be used in a nonselected nationwide population of suicide-bereaved parents and a control population of nonbereaved (N = 2:1). The Swedish Register of Causes of Death and the Multdgeneration Register were used to identify eligible individuals. All presumptive participants received a letter of invitation followed by a personal contact. Results: We developed a questionnaire covering the participants' perception of participation, their daily living, psychological morbidity, professional actions, and other experiences in immediate connection to the time before and after the suicide. Almost three out of four parents (bereaved = 666, nonbereaved = 377) responded to the questionnaire. Conclusions: By involving parents early in the research process we were able to create a questionnaire that generated a high participation rate in a nationwide population-based study that might help us to answer our hypotheses about bereavement after suicide.

AB Background: The use of antidepressants is associated with decreased suicide risk in late life, and these drugs are often prescribed after a suicide attempt. Yet little is known about attitudes to antidepressants in older persons with suicidal behavior. The aim of this study was to assess beliefs about antidepressant medicines in older persons in treatment one year after a suicide attempt.
   Methods: Forty-four individuals aged 70 years and older, who were treated in emergency wards at five hospitals in western Sweden in connection with a suicide attempt, were interviewed at index attempt and one year later. Beliefs about medicines questionnaire (BMQ) specific for antidepressants were analyzed one year after index attempt, in relation to sociodemographic variables, medication use, psychiatric evaluation, and personality traits.
   Results: The majority of participants perceived the necessity of their antidepressant medicine to outweigh their concerns. Lower perceived necessity of antidepressants was observed in those who were not on antidepressants at the time of the attempt as well as those with no prior history of suicide attempt before the index attempt. Individuals reporting hopelessness at follow-up had a higher perceived concern about using medication.
   Conclusions: Beliefs about antidepressants tended to be more positive than negative in older persons taking these drugs in the aftermath of a suicide attempt. Further studies are called for, and should include objective measures of medication adherence.

AB Background: Drowning deaths constitute a significant proportion of unnatural deaths globally. In Sweden and other high-income countries, drowning deaths have decreased. This study investigates the epidemiology and current trends of unintentional, intentional, and undetermined drowning deaths with emphasis on the presence of alcohol and other drugs.
   Methods: During an 18-years period, 5,125 drowning deaths were autopsied in Sweden. Data on cases including toxicological analysis on alcohol, pharmaceutical drugs, and illicit drugs were obtained from the National Board of Forensic Medicine.
   Results: During the study period, the annual incidence of drowning deaths in Sweden was 3.1/100,000 inhabitants and decreased on average by about 2% each year (p<0.001). The highest incidence was found among males and in middle/older age groups. The incidence increased 3% for each year of age. Children/adolescents (<= 18 years) constituted 5% of all drowning deaths. Of all drowned females in the study, 55% (847/1,547) committed suicide, which was a significantly higher proportion compared with males (21%, 763/3,578) (p<0.001). In total, 38% (1,656/4,377) of tested drowned persons had alcohol in their blood and the mean concentration was 1.8 g/l. In the unintentional drowning group, intentional drowning group, and the undetermined group, the proportion of alcohol positive was 44%, 24%, and 45%, respectively. One or several psychoactive drugs were present in the blood in 40% (1,688/4,181) of all tested persons and in 69% (965/1,394) of tested persons who died from suicidal drowning. The most common drug was benzodiazepines (21%, 891/4,181). Illicit drugs were detected in 10% (82/854) of tested persons.
   Conclusion: Presence of alcohol and drugs were frequent and may have contributed to the drowning deaths. The incidence of drowning deaths significantly decreased during the study period. Males and the middle/older age groups had a higher incidence compared to females and children. Suicidal drowning was common especially among women.

AB BackgroundHematological malignancies can cause high levels of distress, but few studies have assessed risk of suicidal behavior among these patients.
   MethodsWe evaluated risk of attempted and completed suicide in a cohort of 46,309 patients diagnosed with malignant lymphoma, myeloma and leukemia in Sweden 1992 to 2009 and 107,736 cancer-free subjects, using Poisson regression.
   ResultsIn all, 146 suicide attempts and 63 completed suicides occurred during a median follow up of 3.1 years (maximum 19 years). The risk of completed suicide was 3.5-fold increased among patients with myeloma [incidence rate ratio (IRR)=3.52, 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.05-6.03] and 1.9-fold increased among patients with lymphoma (IRR=1.87, 95% CI=1.31-2.67) but not significantly increased among patients with leukemia. Risk of attempted suicide was increased among patients with myeloma (IRR=2.13, CI=1.39-3.26) and lymphoma (IRR=1.34, 95% CI = 1.07-1.69). Both male and female patients were at increased risk of attempted as well as completed suicide. A pre-malignant history of mental disorders conferred 15-fold to 30-fold increased risks, but elevated risks were also observed among patients without such history.
   ConclusionsSuicidal actions in patients with hematological malignancies have high suicidal intent, and that subgroups of patients should be monitored for suicidal ideation. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Nurses' Experiences of Assessing Suicide Risk in Specialised Mental
   Health Outpatient Care in Rural Areas
SO ISSUES IN MENTAL HEALTH NURSING
LA English
DT Article
ID QUALITATIVE CONTENT-ANALYSIS
AB This study describes nurses' experiences of assessing suicide risk in specialised mental health outpatient care in rural areas in Sweden. We used a qualitative, descriptive design based on twelve interviews that were subjected to qualitative content analysis. The results showed that the nurses felt anguish due to a lack of control. They expressed uncertainty and loneliness, and they struggled with ethical issues and organisational challenges. Having the sole responsibility to assess suicide risk can increase a person's emotional vulnerability and moral stress. Consequently, in order to prevent ill health among these nurses, there is a need for a tolerant work climate and an organisation that provides support to its employees.Assessing suicide risk is a demanding task within mental health outpatient care. Further, nurses operating in rural areas have to initiate and conduct assessments on their own, and they are, together with the physician in charge, also held individually responsible for their assessments. Consequently, it is important to describe nurses' experiences of how they deal with questions concerning suicide risk. Their experiences can foster awareness of the responsibility and the ethical standpoints related to assessing suicide risk, can help outline the need for further education and supervision, and can improve support from co-workers and management.

TI Fetal and childhood growth and the risk of violent and non-violent

LA English
DT Article
ID LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; BODY-MASS INDEX; PSYCHOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE;
   ASSOCIATION; HEIGHT; WOMEN; SCHIZOPHRENIA; SEROTONIN; BEHAVIOR; INSULIN
AB Background: Inverse associations of birth length with suicide attempts have recently been reported. Whether growth during childhood alters this association is not known. The influences on patterns of growth in fetal life and childhood might be different for violent and nonviolent suicide attempts.
   Objective: To investigate the effect of fetal and childhood growth and possible effect modification on suicide attempts, both violent and non-violent, adjusting for potential maternal confounding factors.
   Method: 318 953 Men were followed by record linkage from the date of birth in Sweden (1973-1980) to the date of attempted suicide, date of death, emigration or to the end of 1999.
   Results: The risk of suicide attempt was increased for men with reduced linear growth in fetal life across all levels of adult stature. Men with appropriate birth length for gestational age but short adult height also experienced a raised risk of suicide attempts: 1.56 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.1). Tall adult stature was protective. Short birth length for gestational age was more strongly related to violent (2.39; 95% CI 1.1 to 4.9) than non-violent (1.53; 95% CI 1.1 to 2.1) suicide attempts. The risk of violent attempts was most strongly increased for men with low birth weight and adequate adult stature: 2.54 (95% CI 1.1 to 5.7).
   Conclusions: The inverse association of linear growth in fetal life and suicide attempt does not seem to be modified by linear childhood growth. Short adult stature entails an additional risk. Short birth length seems particularly to increase the risk of violent suicide attempts.

TI Life events and psychosocial factors in elderly suicides - a
   case-control study
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID PSYCHIATRIC-PATIENTS; BEHAVIOR; VICTIMS; FAMILIES; HISTORY
AB Background. Stressful life events, such as family conflicts, separation, bereavement, somatic illness and financial problems are common antecedents of suicide. Studies on suicide among younger persons dominate the literature, despite the fact that a large proportion of suicides occur among elderly persons.
   Methods. The occurrence of stressful life events was investigated among elderly suicide cases and population controls. The study was conducted in the southwestern part of Sweden and included 85 persons (46 males and 39 females) 65 years and above who had committed suicide from January 1994 to May 1996. Population controls (84 males and 69 females) were randomly selected. Interviews were carried out with the controls and with informants for the suicide cases. Questions on sociodemographic background, mental and somatic health status, and life events (0-6, 7-12 and 13-24 months preceding suicide/interview) were included in the interviews.
   Results. Somatic illness, family discord and financial trouble were significant risk factors during all three time periods. Other risk factors were mental disorder, lower education, feelings of loneliness and previous suicide in the family. Factors associated with a decreased risk included active participation in organizations and having a hobby. Variables that remained in the multivariate logistic regression model were mental disorder (men, odds ratio (OR) = 62.4, 95% CI 17.9-217.5; women, OR = 55.9, 95% CI 14.1-222.3) and family discord (men, OR = 10.0, 95% CI 1.7-59.8; women, OR = 9.2, 95% CI 1.9-44.8).
   Conclusions. Mental disorder and family discord were the two major risk factors for suicide among elderly men and women.

AB This study is based on qualitative interviews with 20 adult international adoptees of colour and eight adoptive parents with internationally adopted children in Sweden regarding their experiences of racialization, ethnic identifications and coping strategies. The findings suggest that the non-white bodies of the adoptees are constantly made significant in their everyday lives in interactions with the white Swedish majority population, whether expressed as 'curious questions' concerning the ethnic origin of the adoptees or as outright aggressive racialization. The study argues that race has to be taken into consideration by Swedish adoption research and the Swedish adoption community, to be able to fully grasp the high preponderance of psychic ill health among adult adoptees as found by quantitative adoption research.

AB The arrival of large numbers of economic migrants and refugees has seen the Swedish immigrant population increase rapidly. Research has shown that immigrants may be more susceptible to mental disorders because of traumatic events prior to immigration and adverse circumstances in their new country. The aim of this literature review is to summarize and interpret recent research on the mental health of immigrants to Sweden. Methods: A systematic search for relevant literature in PubMed was performed on 13 February 2014. Relevant literature was limited to original research articles published between 1 January 1994 and 13 February 2014. Content relating to mental disorders and suicide was reviewed and summarized. Results: Nationwide studies showed increased risks of common mental disorders such as depression, as well as psychotic disorders, in immigrants to Sweden compared to native Swedes. However, the results are complex, with notable differences between different immigrant groups and between males and females. Risk of suicide was increased in some immigrant groups, but decreased in others. There has been little qualitative research on the mental health of immigrants and few intervention studies have targeted immigrants. Conclusion: Immigrants to Sweden are a mixed group with differing, but often increased, risks of mental disorders. Targeted qualitative and intervention studies may facilitate efforts to develop and implement preventive methods for immigrants at high risk of mental ill health, and to tailor treatment to the specific needs of different immigrant groups.

AB Background Until now, sparse and contradictory results about an association between adverse neonatal, obstetric, and maternal conditions and heightened suicide risk in adolescents have been reported. The aims of this study were to investigate the relations between fetal growth, obstetric complications, and the mother's psychosocial and socioeconomic situation and the risk in early adulthood of suicide and attempted suicide in the offspring.
   Methods Obstetric, neonatal, and maternal risk factors for suicide and attempted suicide in 713 370 young adults, born in Sweden between 1973 and 1980, who were followed-up until Dec 31, 1999, were examined by data linkage between Swedish registers. Univariate and multivariate hazard ratios, derived from proportional-hazard models, were estimated.
   Findings Significantly raised risk of attempted suicide was reported for individuals of short birth length, adjusted for gestational age (hazard ratio 1.29, 95% Cl 1.18-1.41, p < 0.0001); born fourth or more in birth order (1.79, 1.62-1.97, p < 0.0001); born to mothers with a low educational level (1.36, 1.27-1.46, p < 0.0001) (attributable proportion 10.3%); and those who, at time of delivery, had mothers aged 19 years or younger (2.09, 1.89-2.32, p < 0.0001). Significant predictors of suicide were low birthweight, adjusted for gestational age (2.23, 1.43-3.46, p < 0.0001), and teenage motherhood (2.30, 1.64-3.22, p < 0.0001).
   Interpretation Multiparity and low maternal education predicted suicide attempt, whereas restricted fetal growth and teenage motherhood were associated with both suicide completion and attempt in offspring.

AB Background. The objectives were to assess thoughts about suicide, plans to commit suicide and suicide attempts in the community, to investigate the use of health services following a suicide attempt, and to describe basic socio-cultural indices of the community.
   Method. The community survey was one component of the larger WHO multisite intervention study on suicidal behaviours (SUPRE-MISS). In each site, it aimed at randomly selecting and interviewing at least 500 subjects of the general population living in the catchment area of the emergency department where the intervention component of the study was conducted. Communities of eight SUPRE-MISS sites (in Brazil, China, Estonia, India, Iran, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam) participated plus two additional sites from Australia and Sweden conducting similar surveys.
   Results. Suicide attempts (0(.)4-4(.)2%), plans (1(.)1-15(.)6%), and ideation (2(.)6-25(.)4%) varied by a factor of 10-14 across sites, but remained mostly within the ranges of previously published data. Depending on the site, the ratios between attempts, plans, and thoughts Of Suicide differed substantially. Medical attention following a suicide attempt varied between 22% and 88% of the attempts.
   Conclusions. The idea of the suicidal process as a continuous and smooth evolution from thoughts to plans and attempts of suicide needs to be further investigated as it seems to be dependent on the cultural setting. There are indications, that the burden of undetected attempted suicide is high in different cultures; an improved response from the health sector on how to identify and support these individuals is needed.

TI Aspects of Additional Psychiatric Disorders in Severe

AB Objective: Additional and comorbid diagnoses are common among suicide victims with major depressive disorder (MDD) and have been shown to increase the suicide risk. The aim of the present study was first, to investigate whether patients with severe depression/melancholia who had died by suicide showed more additional psychiatric disorders than a matched control group. Second, general rates of comorbid and additional diagnoses in the total group of patients were estimated and compared with literature on MDD. Method: A blind record evaluation was performed on 100 suicide victims with severe depression/melancholia (MDD with melancholic and/or psychotic features: MDD-M/P) and matched controls admitted to the Department of Psychiatry, Lund, Sweden between 1956 and 1969 and monitored to 2010. Diagnoses in addition to severe depression were noted. Results: Less than half of both the suicides and controls had just one psychiatric disorder (47% in the suicide and 46% in the control group). The average number of diagnoses was 1.80 and 1.82, respectively. Additional diagnoses were not related to an increased suicide risk. Anxiety was the most common diagnosis. Occurrence of suspected schizophrenia/schizotypal or additional obsessive-compulsive symptoms were more common than expected, but alcohol use disorders did not appear very frequent. Conclusions: The known increased risk of suicide in MDD with comorbid/additional diagnoses does not seem to apply to persons with MDD-M/P (major depressive disorder-depression/Melancholia). Some diagnoses, such as schizophrenia/schizotypal disorders, were more frequent than expected, which is discussed, and a genetic overlap with MDD-M/P is proposed.

AB PurposeWe endeavored to investigate whether previous findings of an association between antemortem exposure to selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI) and method of suicide could be replicated.MethodsUsing the Swedish National Board of Forensic Medicine's toxicology database and the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare's national registries of causes of death and prescriptions, 10,002 incidents of suicide were retrieved. Risks of violent suicide conferred by SSRIs, expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were estimated using logistic regression. In accordance with previous work, suicide by violent meanscaseswere defined as death attributable to causes designated by ICD-10 codes X70-X83 and Y20-Y33; and suicide by non-violent meanscontrolsby codes X60-X69 and Y10-Y19.ResultsOur results imply that SSRI exposure confers a risk of violent suicide for shorter treatment durations; and that antemortem exposure to other substances (including illegal drugs) confounds estimates of risk. After adjustment for age, sex, and other substances, SSRIs treatment not exceeding 28days conferred an almost fourfold risk of violent suicide (OR 3.6 [95% CI 1.9-6.8]), a finding partly in line with a recent Swedish study that employed a case-crossover design.ConclusionsAlthough risks associated with shorter treatment duration may reflect latencies to onset of therapeutic effect, it is unclear how latencies would influence the choice of suicide method, unless conditions for which SSRIs are prescribed are themselves associated with violent suicide. Finally, in the total dataset, SSRIs were not associated with an increased risk of violent suicide; however, by adjusting for other substances, we avoided the spurious conclusion that the effect of medications in this regard is protective.

AB ObjectiveTo analyse mortality and life expectancy in people with alcohol use disorder in Denmark, Finland and Sweden.
   MethodA population-based register study including all patients admitted to hospital diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (1158486 person-years) from 1987 to 2006 in Denmark, Finland and Sweden.
   ResultsLife expectancy was 24-28years shorter in people with alcohol use disorder than in the general population. From 1987 to 2006, the difference in life expectancy between patients with alcohol use disorder and the general population increased in men (Denmark, 1.8years; Finland, 2.6years; Sweden, 1.0years); in women, the difference in life expectancy increased in Denmark (0.3years) but decreased in Finland (-0.8years) and Sweden (-1.8years). People with alcohol use disorder had higher mortality from all causes of death (mortality rate ratio, 3.0-5.2), all diseases and medical conditions (2.3-4.8), and suicide (9.3-35.9).
   ConclusionPeople hospitalized with alcohol use disorder have an average life expectancy of 47-53years (men) and 50-58years (women) and die 24-28years earlier than people in the general population.

AB Background: Immigrants have higher rates of suicidal behaviour in comparison to the indigenous population.
   Aims: To describe the characteristics of foreign nationality suicide completers and search for differences between them and native Greeks. This is the first study focused on immigrant suicide victims in Greece.
   Methods: Data were collected for all recorded cases of completed suicide for the two-year period November 2007 to October 2009 at the Athens Department of Forensic Medicine, the largest, by far, of its kind in Greece covering approximately 35% of the country's population. The material was collected using the method of psychological autopsy as well as from the victims' forensic records.
   Results: Nearly 10% of Greece's 11 million population are of foreign nationality. Approximately half of them live in Athens and its suburbs, an area where 35% of Greece's population lives. In our sample, 15.8% of the suicide victims were of foreign nationality (53 cases): 41 men (77.4%) and 12 women (22.6%). Higher suicide rates were found for citizens of Kuwaiti (9.1%), Somali (6.7%) and Afghan (0.9%) nationality (immigrant communities with very few members); the lower suicide rates were for individuals of Egyptian (0.01%), Ukrainian (0.01%) and Albanian (0.006%) nationality (the Albanian immigrant community is the largest in Greece). In comparison to their Greek counterparts, immigrant victims were younger (mean age 38.7 vs 54.9 years, p < .001) more often unemployed (p = .007) and with a history of alcohol abuse (p < .001). The main suicide method used by immigrants was hanging (p <.001) while for Greeks it was jumping from a height.
   Conclusions: Individuals who belong to small national communities seem to have the highest risk of dying by suicide. Immigrant suicide victims differ from the indigenous population in several parameters. Our data could help define the most vulnerable of them and apply more effective suicide prevention strategies.

ID VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA; VIEWS; EXPERIENCES; CARE
AB Aims: To investigate the attitudes of Swedish physicians towards physician-assisted suicide. Design: A postal questionnaire on the respondent's opinion of physician-assisted suicide was sent to a randomly selected sample of physicians in Sweden. The respondents were given the opportunity of furnishing arguments of their own and of prioritizing arguments. They were also asked about possible influence on their own and patients' trust in the healthcare system if physician-assisted suicide was to be legally accepted. Participants: 1,200 physicians from six specialties, approximately 200 individuals each in: general practice, geriatrics, internal medicine, oncology, psychiatry and surgery. Setting: The study was commissioned by the Swedish Medical Society and its logo was printed on questionnaires and envelopes. Results: The total response rate was 74%, ranging between 63%-80% among the specialties. On average 34% were pro physician-assisted suicide, 39% against it and 25% were doubtful; 2% per cent did not respond to the question at all. Psychiatrists were significantly more accepting than oncologists, who were the most restrictive specialty. Older physicians (> 50 years) provided a significantly more accepting attitude than younger ones (51 years). Conclusions: Despite the fact that the World Medical Association condemns physician-assisted suicide as unethical, the present survey indicates that there is no clear majority for or against physician-assisted suicide among Swedish physicians, and that significantly more elderly physicians have an accepting attitude towards physician-assisted suicide. There is a need for further research explaining the differences between the age groups as well as the variation between specialities.

   DISORDER
AB Objective: The risk of suicide is elevated after discharge from a psychiatric hospital. This study aimed to investigate how recent suicidal behavior affects the risk of suicide in patients with different psychiatric diagnoses immediately after discharge.
   Methods: Registers with national coverage were linked to create a study cohort including all individuals discharged from psychiatric hospitals in Sweden from 1973 through 2009. Hazard ratios for discharge diagnoses were calculated. The risk of suicide within 30 days after discharge in each diagnostic category when suicidal behavior had been registered within 30 days before admission was estimated.
   Results: A total of 3,695 suicides occurred after 2,883,088 discharges. If recent suicidal behavior was registered, the risk of completed suicide increased prominently in all diagnostic categories, but particularly for schizophrenia (hazard ratio [HR] = 8.9; 95% CI, 6.4-12.4) and other nonorganic psychosis (HR = 6.8; 95% CI, 5.1-9.0). Patients suffering from depression had the highest overall risk of suicide postdischarge (HR = 3.0; 95% CI, 2.7-3.3). This finding applied especially to male patients with depression (HR = 4.5; 95% CI, 4.0-5.0) or with reaction to crisis (HR = 3.6; 95% CI 3.0-4.4).
   Conclusions: A distinct elevation of the risk of suicide was seen in all diagnostic groups if a recent self-harm event had occurred, particularly among patients with psychotic disorders. Overall, the immediate risk of suicide after discharge was high regardless of recent suicidal behavior. The findings in this study have relevance for clinical decisions about immediate after-care and treatment in connection with discharge from psychiatric inpatient care.

AB Background
   Work-related functional impairment in terms of sickness absence and disability pension (SA/DP) has been reported to be associated with subsequent suicide. However, there is only limited knowledge on SA/DP patterns prior to suicide. The aim was to identify trajectories of work-related functional impairment prior to suicide and to describe associations of socio-demographic and medical factors with such trajectories.
   Methods
   This is a population-based retrospective cohort study of the 4 209 individuals aged 22-65 years who committed suicide during 2007-2010 in Sweden. Work-related functional impairment was measured as mean annual number of months of SA/DP. We analyzed trajectories of SA/DP during five years prior to suicide (i.e., 2002-2009) by a group-based trajectory method. Associations between socio-demographic and medical factors with different groups of trajectories were estimated by chi(2)-test and multinomial logistic regression.
   Results
   Five different functional impairment trajectory groups were identified prior to suicide. One group had constant low levels of SA/DP (46%), while 30% had constant high levels of SA/DP. Two groups (16%) showed increasing number of SA/DP months. The remaining 7% showed decreasing number of SA/DP months before the suicide. Sex, age, educational level, family situation, and diagnosis-specific healthcare were significantly associated with different trajectory groups (Likelihood ratio X-2 tests <0.05). A larger proportion of higher educated and younger men with a lower proportion of previous suicide attempts were found in the group with constant low levels. Opposite characteristics were displayed in the group with constant high levels.
   Conclusions
   This study identified five different groups of work-related functional impairment trajectories before suicide. These differences might be partly explained by the variations in socio-demographic profiles and health care consumptions five years before suicide.

AB Astonishingly little is known about the relationship between high educational achievements and suicidal behaviour among women. This is remarkable given that a woman breaking into traditionally male-dominant spheres is a well established example of social-role marginality. The current study combines fatal and non-fatal suicidal behaviour and analyses, by means of logistic regression, the degree to which high school performance during pre-adolescence in the mid-1960s, in Sweden, had a detrimental effect on suicidal behaviour for women, as opposed to men, in adolescence and young adulthood. The Stockholm birth cohort study was used for this purpose. The results show that girls with both above and below average marks had an elevated risk of engaging in suicidal behaviour. However, this relation only held for girls who had grown up with supportive parental ambitions in terms of educational commitment. For boys, only low school performance was shown to be suicidogenic, irrespective of parental ambitions.

AB Research considering the basis for mental health nurses wanting to enable recovery among people who suffer from suicidal behavior is sparse. The aim of this study is to explore and evaluate how a new recovery-oriented caring approach (ROCA) was experienced by a suicidal patient in a context of close relatives and nurses. A single-case study with a qual-quan mixed-method design was chosen. Participants were recruited from a psychiatric clinic in Sweden and consisted of one patient, one close relative to the patient, and three nurses. The results reveal that the ROCA enabled the patient to narrate, bear experiences of hopelessness, and ask for support, rather than view suicide as the only possible solution. ROCA has the potential to support patients, relatives, and nurses to develop a common language, considering the patient's life situation and struggles and to use this as a source for the patient's individual care planning.

TI Skepticism towards the Swedish vision zero for suicide: interviews with
   12 psychiatrists
SO BMC MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Suicide; Prevention; Bioethics; Public health; Goals; Psychiatry
AB Background: The main causes of suicide and how suicide could and should be prevented are ongoing controversies in the scientific literature as well as in public media. In the bill on public health from 2008 (Prop 2007/08: 110), the Swedish Parliament adopted an overarching "Vision Zero for Suicide" (VZ) and nine strategies for suicide prevention. However, how the VZ should be interpreted in healthcare is unclear. The VZ has been criticized both from a philosophical perspective and against the background of clinical experience and alleged empirical claims regarding the consequences of regulating suicide prevention. This study is part of a larger research project in medical ethics with the overarching aim to explore whether the VZ is ethically justifiable. The aim is to enrich the normative discussion by investigating empirically how the VZ is perceived in healthcare.
   Methods: Interviews based on a semi-structured interview guide were performed with 12 Swedish psychiatrists. The interviews were analysed with descriptive qualitative content analysis aiming for identifying perceptions of the Vision Zero for Suicide as well as arguments for and against it.
   Results: Though most of the participants mentioned at least some potential benefit of the Vision Zero for Suicide, the overall impression was a predominant skepticism. Some participants focused on why they consider the VZ to be unachievable, while others focused more on its potential consequences and normative implications.
   Conclusions: The VZ was perceived to be impossible to realize, nonconstructive or potentially counterproductive, and undesirable because of potential conflicts with other values and interests of patients as well as the general public. There were also important notions of the VZ having negative consequences for the working conditions of psychiatrists in Sweden, in increasing their work-related anxiety and thwarting the patient-physician relationship.

TI Time to Hospitalization for Suicide Attempt by the Timing of Parental
   Suicide During Offspring Early Development
SO JAMA PSYCHIATRY

ID CHILDHOOD BEREAVEMENT; DEATH; SURVIVORS; IMPACT; ADOLESCENTS;
   ATTACHMENT; CHILDREN; SUPPORT; HAZARD; YOUTH
AB Context: Previous studies have suggested that children who experience parental suicide at earlier ages are at higher risk of future hospitalization for suicide attempt. However, how the trajectories of risk differ by offspring age at the time of parental suicide is currently unknown.
   Objective: To study time at risk to suicide attempt hospitalization among offspring of suicide decedents as compared with offspring of unintentional injury decedents by their developmental period at the time of parental death.
   Design: Population-based retrospective cohort study.
   Setting: Sweden.
   Participants: Twenty-six thousand ninety-six offspring who experienced parental suicide and 32 395 offspring of unintentional injury decedents prior to age 25 years between the years 1973 and 2003.
   Main Outcome Measure: Parametric survival analysis was used to model the time to hospitalization for suicide attempt among offspring who lost a parent during early childhood (0-5 years old), later childhood (6-12 years old), adolescence (13-17 years old), and young adulthood (18-24 years old).
   Results: The risk in offspring who lost a parent to suicide or an unintentional injury during childhood surpassed the other age groups' risk approximately 5 years after the origin and, for the youngest group, continued to rise over decades. Offspring who lost a parent during adolescence or young adulthood were at greatest risk within 1 to 2 years after parental death, and risk declined over time. Offspring who lost a parent to suicide in childhood and young adulthood had earlier onset of hospitalization for suicide attempt compared with offspring who lost a parent to an unintentional injury.
   Conclusions: The hospitalization risk for suicide attempt in offspring who lost a parent during their childhood is different from those who lost a parent later in development. The results suggest critical windows for careful monitoring and intervention for suicide attempt risk, especially 1 to 2 years after parental death for the older age groups and over decades for childhood survivors of parental death.

AB Suicide is strongly correlated to mental disorders. In several studies up to more than 90% of the deceased could be given psychiatric diagnoses. The aim of this study is to account for psychiatric and somatic disorders in suicide and to discuss their relation to the suicide and the implications for preventive work. One hundred consecutive cases of suicide in Vasterbotten County, 25 women and 75 men, were investigated by means of telephone interviews with close relatives, police reports, psychiatric and other medical records, and data from the forensic investigation. In 96% at least one axis-I diagnosis according to DSM-III-R was found. The most common psychiatric disorders were mood disorders (63%), psychoactive substance use disorders (37%), and personality disorders (22%). Two-thirds of the subjects had one or more somatic disorder of significance for the case. In 50% of the cases two or more psychiatric diagnoses could be given.. Schizophrenic subjects died on average 14 years after their first psychiatric contact, at a mean age of 36 years, whereas subjects with major depression died on average 14 years after their first contact, at 55 years. The finding that 96% of the deceased had at least one mental disorder and a high occurrence of somatic disorders is interpreted as a severe increase in the burden of the person, which restricts his/her ability to satisfy vital dependency needs. The issue of specific personality characteristics in suicide should be further investigated.

AB Objective: Previous research suggests that a strong relation exists between alcohol consumption and suicide in Soviet and post-Soviet Russia. This study extends this analysis across a much longer historical time frame by examining the relationship between heavy drinking and suicide in tsarist and post-World War 11 Russia. Method: Using alcohol poisoning mortality data as a proxy for heavy drinking, time-series analytical modeling techniques were used to examine the strength of the alcohol-suicide relation in the provinces of European Russia in the period 1870-1894 and for Russia in 1956-2005. Results: During 1870-1894, a decreasing trend was recorded in heavy drinking in Russia that contrasted with the sharp increase observed in this phenomenon in the post-World War 11 period. A rising trend in suicide was recorded in both study periods, although the increase was much greater in the latter period. The strength of the heavy drinking suicide relation nevertheless remained unchanged across time, with a 10% increase in heavy drinking resulting in a 3.5% increase in suicide in tsarist Russia and a 3.8% increase in post-World War II Russia. Conclusions: Despite the innumerable societal changes that have occurred in Russia across the two study periods and the growth in the level of heavy drinking, the strength of the heavy drinking-suicide relation has remained unchanged across time. This suggests the continuation of a highly detrimental drinking culture where the heavy episodic drinking of distilled spirits (vodka) is an essential element in the alcohol-suicide association. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 72, 341-347, 2011)

AB Objective: To identify factors associated with attempted suicide in the elderly. Design: Social, psychological, and psychiatric characteristics were compared in suicide attempters (70 years and older) and a representative population sample. Settings: Emergency departments at five hospitals in western Sweden and a representative sample of the elderly population. Participants: Persons with Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score <15 were excluded. One hundred forty persons who sought hospital treatment after a suicide attempt were eligible and 103 participated (57 women, 46 men, and mean age 80 years). Comparison subjects matched for gender and age group (N = 408) were randomly selected among participants in our general population studies. Measurements: Symptoms were rated with identical instruments in cases and comparison subjects. The examination included the MMSE and tests of short-and long-term memory, abstract thinking, aphasia, apraxia, and agnosia. Depressive symptomatology was measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and major and minor depressions were diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, using symptom algorithms. Results: Factors associated with attempted suicide included being unmarried, living alone, low education level, history of psychiatric treatment, and previous suicide attempt. There was no association with dementia. Odds ratios were increased for both major (odds ratio [OR]: 47.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 19.1-117.7) and minor (OR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.5-4.7) depressions. An association was observed between perceived loneliness and attempted suicide; this relationship was independent of depression (OR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.3-6.1). Conclusions: Observed associations mirrored those previously shown for completed suicide. Results may help to inform clinical decisions regarding suicide risk evaluation in this vulnerable and growing age group.(Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 2010; 18: 57-67)

AB Background: Studies of family reactions following teenage suicide are hampered by the psychological difficulties of approaching families and recruiting an unbiased sample of study subjects. By using a small but consecutive series of cases, we examined the qualitative aspects of loosing a teenage family member due to suicide. Such an understanding is important for future organisation of proper programs that provide professional support in the grief process.
   Methods: From a large project on teenage unnatural death in northern Sweden 1981-2000 (including 88 suicides), 13 cases from 1995 through 1998 were retrospectively identified and consecutively analysed. Ten families agreed to participate. The open interviews took place 15 to 25 months after the suicide. The information gathered was manually analysed according to a grounded theory model, resulting in allocation of data into one of three domains: post-suicidal reactions, impact on daily living, and families' need for support.
   Results: Teenager suicide is a devastating trauma for the surviving family and the lack of sustainable explanations for the suicide is a predominant issue in the grief process. The prolonged social and psychological isolation of the families in grief should be challenged. At the time of the interview, the families were still struggling with explaining why the suicide occurred, especially since most suicides had occurred without overt premonitory signs. The bereaved family members were still profoundly affected by the loss, but all had returned to an ostensibly normal life. Post-suicide support was often badly timed and insufficient, especially for younger siblings.
   Conclusion: Family doctors can organise a long-term, individually formulated support scheme for the bereaved, including laymen who can play a most significant role in the grief process. There is also a need for better understanding of the families who have lost a teenager whom committed suicide and for the development and testing of treatment schemes for the bereaved family.

AB Background: Despite high rates of youth suicide attempt, little is known about patterns of functional impairment in terms of sickness absence and disability pension (SA/DP) before and after an attempt. The aim was to identify SA/DP trajectories among young adults with or without suicide attempt and to describe associations of socio-demographic and clinical factors with such trajectories.
   Methods: This is a population-based cohort study of 5385 individuals aged 25-40 years with a first suicide attempt during 2007-2009. One control for each case without suicide attempt was matched by socio-demographic factors. Trajectories of annual SA/DP months over an eight-year period were analysed by group-based trajectory modelling. Associations between socio-demographic and clinical factors with trajectory groups were estimated by chi(2)-test and multinomial logistic regression.
   Results: Two groups of suicide attempters had low SA/DP levels over time (62%). One group had constantly high SA/ DP levels (16%). The remaining two groups had increased SA/DP initially, which then decreased at different time points. Socio-demographic and clinical factors were associated with different trajectories (R-2 = 0.44). Suicide attempters with low levels of SA/DP were likely to be unemployed whereas a larger proportion of those with high levels of SA/DP had psychiatric health care before the suicide attempt, particularly due to schizophrenia and non-affective psychoses or personality disorders.
   Conclusions: Young suicide attempters even with no/low levels of SA/DP were likely to be marginalised at the labour market. Schizophrenia/non-affective psychoses and personality disorders were important clinical factors for differentiating the levels of SA/DP among young suicide attempters.

AB OBJECTIVE
   To examine the relation between childhood adversity, the role of school performance, and childhood psychopathology and the risk of suicide.
   DESIGN
   Cohort study of register based indicators of childhood adversity (at ages 0-14) including death in the family (suicide analysed separately), parental substance abuse, parental psychiatric disorder, substantial parental criminality, parental separation/single parent household, receipt of public assistance, and residential instability.
   SETTING
   Swedish medical birth register and various Swedish population based registers.
   PARTICIPANTS
   548 721 individuals born 1987-91.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
   Estimates of suicide risk at ages 15-24 calculated as incidence rate ratios adjusted for time at risk and confounders. Results Adjusted incidence rate ratios for the relation between childhood adversity and suicide during adolescence and young adulthood ranged from 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.4) for residential instability to 2.9 (1.4 to 5.9) for suicide in the family. There was a dose-response relation between accumulating childhood adversity and risk: 1.1 (0.9 to 1.4) for those exposed to one adversity and 1.9 (1.4 to 2.5) and 2.6 (1.9 to 3.4) for those exposed to two and three or more adversities, respectively. The association with increased risk of suicide remained even after adjustment for school performance and childhood psychopathology.
   CONCLUSION
   Childhood adversity is a risk factor for suicide in adolescence and young adulthood, particularly accumulated adversity. These results emphasise the importance of understanding the social mechanisms of suicide and the need for effective interventions early in life, aiming to alleviate the risk in disadvantaged children.

AB Little is known about cancer incidence among patients with a history of suicide attempt. Suicide attempters have lower levels of oxytocin, a hormone related to lactation, stress, social functioning, and well-being, and recent research indicates influence on carcinogenesis. We hypothesized that the low oxytocin levels among suicide attempters results in an increased risk of cancer in general and in organs with oxytocin receptors in particular.
   A nationwide cohort study of patients aged 15 years or older with hospitalization for self-inflicted injury or attempted suicide was identified from the Swedish patient register in 1968-2011. The cancer outcomes were identified from the Swedish cancer register. Cancer risk in suicide attempters was compared with the risk in the background population of the corresponding age, sex, and calendar period by calculating standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI).
   The 186,627 patients (83,637 men and 102,990 women) hospitalized for self-inflicted injury or attempted suicide contributed with 2.6 million person-years at risk. The SIR for all cancer was 1.3 (95 % CI 1.27-1.33) in men and 1.25 (1.22-1.28) in women. For cancers in organs rich in oxytocin receptors (uterus, breast, and brain), the corresponding SIRs were 1.02 (0.87-1.19) and 1.13 (1.09-1.17), respectively. There was a particularly increased risk of cancers related to alcohol and tobacco in both sexes.
   Patients attempting suicide have an increased risk of cancer. However, this increase does not seem to be associated with low oxytocin levels, but rather to exposures like tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption.

AB Objectives. To investigate the experience of suicidal expressions (death wishes, life weariness, ideation, plans and attempts) in young Swedish Sami, their attitudes toward suicide (ATTS), and experience of suicidal expressions and completed suicide in significant others and to compare with Swedes in general.
   Methods. A cross-sectional study comprising 516 Swedish Sami, 18-28 years of age together with an age and geographically matched reference group (n = 218). Parts of the ATTS questionnaire have been used to cover different aspects of the suicidal complex. Data were analysed with regard to gender, occupation, counties and experience of negative societal treatment due to Sami background.
   Results. Both young Sami and young Swedes reported suicidal ideation, life weariness, and death wishes in a high degree (30-50%), but it was more common among the Sami. Having had plans to commit suicide showed a significant gender difference only in the Sami. The prevalence of suicide attempts did not differ significantly between Sami and Swedes. Subgroups of the Sami reported a higher degree of suicidal behaviour, Sami women and reindeer herders reported a 3, 5-fold higher odds of suicide attempts and a 2-fold higher odds having had plans committing suicide. Sami living in Vasterbotten/Jamtland/Vasternorrland and Sami with experience of ethnicity related bad treatment 2-fold higher odds of suicidal plans compared to those living in other counties.
   Conclusion. An increased occurrence of suicidal ideation/death wishes/life weariness in young Sami compared to young majority Swedes was found, but not an increased prevalence of suicide attempts and positive attitudes together with an increased awareness to handle suicide problems could be a contributing factor. Severe circumstances and experience of ethnicity-related bad treatment seems to contribute to increased levels of suicidal plans and attempts in subgroups of Sami.

AB This report is about the findings in association with the extended suicides of nine victims killed by sharp force. All victims were killed by sharp force. The perpetrators were predominantly the parents, the victims their children. Regarding the criteria for differentiating self-inflicted injuries from injuries inflicted by another person, the victims' injuries presented patterns usually found solely in suicides. Thus eight of nine cases presented tentative and hesitation injuries, in three of five cases areas of injury covered by clothing had been exposed beforehand. Despite extremely narrow intercostal spaces in children, injuries to the bones in thoracic stabbing were avoided more often than not (four of seven cases). Only the criterion "defence injury" occurred nearly as often as in homicide victims (three of nine cases). The psychopathology of extended suicide can explain this pattern. The perpetrator's motive is characterised by his pseudoaltruistic belief to save the loved ones from a world that is in his opinion unacceptable. A fusion or integration of the victim into the perpetrator's own self is based on an identity problem. Physical interrelation of forces between perpetrator and victim restricts the victim in his defence and presents an important prerequisite for acquiring the patterns of described injuries.

Data were collected in a written survey using the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) as well as questions on attempted suicide and auto-aggressive behaviour. Participants experienced a mean of three traumatic events, with 14 per cent developing a Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) subsequently. In each national sample, more than 50 per cent of the participants were in need of treatment because of psychological symptoms and nearly one-third had attempted suicide.

AB Objective: Using the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide as a guiding framework, we investigated older adults' causal attributions for suicidal behavior. We hypothesized that older adults who attributed their suicidal behavior to thwarted belongingness or perceived burdensomeness would be more likely to use more immediately lethal means and to re-attempt suicide during the 12-month follow-up. Design: Prospective cohort study in western Sweden. Participants: A total of 101 older adults who presented to medical emergency rooms for suicide attempts. Measurements: Participants were asked why they attempted suicide. Results: Attributions included: a desire to escape (N = 29), reduced functioning and autonomy (N = 24), psychological problems, including depression (N = 24), somatic problems and physical pain (N = 16), perceived burdensomeness (N = 13), social problems that reflected either thwarted belongingness or family conflict (N = 13), and lack of meaning in life (N = 8); 41 participants provided more than one reason. No specific reason was given by 28 participants, 15 of whom reported not understanding or remembering why they attempted suicide and 13 reported simply wanting to die (or go to sleep and not wake up). As hypothesized, patients who attributed the attempt to thwarted belongingness were more likely to use more immediately lethal means for their index attempt and were more likely to re-attempt during follow-up. This was not the case for those reporting burdensomeness. Conclusion: People who attribute suicide attempts to thwarted belongingness use more lethal methods and have a poorer prognosis. Replications across diverse cultural settings are needed to determine whether attributing suicide attempts to thwarted belongingness may warrant increased monitoring.

AB This study highlights the experiences of patients during in-patient psychiatric care in Sweden following a suicide attempt. Eighteen patients were interviewed as close to being discharged as possible. Each respondent was asked to narrate his/her experiences of the care received. An interview guide concerned the following areas: admission to the hospital, feelings and reactions, and positive as well as negative experiences during the hospital stay. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and a qualitative content analysis concerning the meanings, intuitions, consequences and the context of the data was performed. Three central categories were identified: being a psychiatric patient, patients' perceptions of the caregivers and the care provided, as well as important aspects of the psychiatric care received. The importance of being well cared for and receiving understanding and confirmation was emphasized. Lack of confirmation may have contributed in some cases to a feeling of being burdensome, demands for discharge or even another suicide attempt. Verbal contacts with the staff were seen as essential for the process of healing and for the desire to go on living.

This study offers objective information about connection between the postmortem findings of illegal drugs and the causes and manners of death of their users. However, further studies, comparing prevalence of drug use in general population and at the postmortem tests, are needed for more detailed elucidation of this connection.

AB Objectives: Several studies have reported a higher risk of suicide among the unemployed. Some individuals may be more prone to both unemployment and suicide due to an underlying health-related factor. In that case, suicide among the unemployed might be a consequence of health-related selection. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between unemployment and suicide, and the importance of previous sickness absence to this relationship.
   Study design: The study was based on 771,068 adults aged 25-58 years in Stockholm County in 1990-1991. Data on sickness absence in 1990-1991 and unemployment in 1991-1993 were collected from registers for each individual. Time and cause of death in 1994-1995 were obtained from Sweden's Cause of Death Register.
   Methods: The association between sickness absence in 1990-1991 and unemployment in 1992-1993, and the association between unemployment in 1992-1993 and suicide in 1994-1995 was investigated using logistic regression.
   Results: Unemployment lasting for >90 days in 1992-1993 was associated with suicide in men in 1994-1995 [odds ratio (OR) 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.38-3.38], while unemployment lasting for <= 90 days in 1992-1993 was associated with suicide in women in 1994-1995 (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.23-5.85). Higher levels of sickness absence were related to an increased risk of subsequent unemployment in both sexes. The higher prevalence of sickness absence among the unemployed attenuated the association between unemployment and suicide in both men and women.
   Conclusions: Unemployment is related to suicide. Individuals in poor health are at increased risk of unemployment and also suicide. The higher relative risk of suicide among the unemployed seems to be, in part, a consequence of exclusion of less healthy individuals from the labour market.

AB Objective: To compare the rates of suicidal behaviour during vs. after discontinuation of treatment with antidepressants, and to determine the comparative rates of suicidal behaviour for patients maintained on tricyclic (TCA) vs. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants.
   Method: Charts were reviewed for 521 patients with major depressive disorder and/or dysthymic disorder. Periods of active treatment or discontinuation with SSRIs or TCAs were determined. Rates of completed suicide, suicide attempts, and hospitalization for suicidality were analyzed.
   Results: There was greater than a five-fold increase in risk for suicidal behaviour after discontinuation of antidepressant treatment (P < 0.0001). The rates of suicidal behavior during treatment with SSRIs or TCAs were similar.
   Conclusion: Suicidal behaviour in unipolar depressed patients treated with antidepressants increases substantially after medication discontinuation. This effect occurred in both patients who were maintained on SSRIs and TCAs. The findings support a possible protective effect on suicidal behaviour for both SSRIs and TCAs.

AB Objective To estimate the cardiovascular mortality among persons with bipolar disorder in Sweden compared to the general population.
   Design Population register-based cohort study with a 20-year follow-up.
   Setting Sweden.
   Participants The entire population of Sweden (n=10.6 million) of whom 17101 persons were diagnosed with bipolar disorder between 1987 and 2006.
   Main outcome measures Mortality rate ratios (MRR), excess mortality (excess deaths), cardiovascular disorder (CVD) and specifically cerebrovascular disease, coronary heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac deaths and hospital admission rate ratio (ARR).
   Results Persons with bipolar disorder died of CVD approximately 10years earlier than the general population. One third (38%) of all deaths in persons with bipolar disorder were caused by CVD and almost half (44%) by other somatic diseases, whereas suicide and other external causes accounted for less than a fifth of all deaths (18%). Excess mortality of both CVD (n=824) and other somatic diseases (n=988) was higher than that of suicide and other external causes (n=675 deaths). MRRs for cerebrovascular disease, coronary heart disease and acute myocardial infarction were twice as high in persons with bipolar disorder compared to the general population. Despite the increased mortality of CVD, hospital admissions (ARR) for CVD treatment were only slightly increased in persons with bipolar disorder when compared to the general population.
   Conclusions The increased cardiovascular mortality in persons with bipolar disorder calls for renewed efforts to prevent and treat somatic diseases in this group. Specifically, our findings further imply that it would be critical to ensure that persons with bipolar disorder receive the same quality care for CVD as persons without bipolar disorder.

AB Suicide in later life is a global public health problem. The aim of this review was to conduct a systematic analysis of studies with comparison groups that examined the associations between social factors and suicidal behavior (including ideation, non-fatal suicidal behavior, or deaths) among individuals aged 65 and older. Our search identified only 16 articles (across 14 independent samples) that met inclusion criteria. The limited number of studies points to the need for further research. Included studies were conducted in Canada (n = 2), Germany (n = 1), Hong Kong (n = 1), Japan (n = 1), Singapore (n = 1), Sweden (n = 2), Taiwan (n = 1), the U. K. (n = 2), and the U.S. (n = 3). The majority of the social factors examined in this review can be conceptualized as indices of positive social connectedness-the degree of positive involvement with family, friends, and social groups. Findings indicated that at least in industrialized countries, limited social connectedness is associated with suicidal ideation, non-fatal suicidal behavior, and suicide in later life. Primary prevention programs designed to enhance social connections as well as a sense of community could potentially decrease suicide risk, especially among men.

AB Purpose: Risk of suicide is increased among men with prostate cancer. We investigated this association among men with low-risk cancer, usually detected by prostate specific antigen (PSA)-testing.
   Patients and Methods: Relative risk (RR) of suicide was calculated by use of Poisson regression analysis within the Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe) 2.0, a nation-wide, population-based database, comparing 105,736 men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1997-2009 to 528,658 matched prostate cancer-free men.
   Results: During the first 6 months after diagnosis, there were 38 suicides among men with prostate cancer; incidence rate 0.73 per 1000 person-years (PY) and 30 suicides in the comparison cohort; 0.11 per 1000 PY, corresponding to a RR of suicide of 6.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.0-10). Risk was highest among men with distant metastases, incidence rate 1.25 per 1000 PY, RR 10 (95% CI 5.1-21) but risk was also increased for men with low-risk tumours, incidence rate difference 0.45 per 1000 PY and RR 5.2 (95% CI 2.3-12) and across categories of socioeconomic status and comorbidity. Eighteen months after diagnosis, risk of suicide had decreased to 0.27 per 1000 PY, RR 1.0 (95% CI 0.68-1.5) for low-risk prostate cancer but remained increased among men with metastases, 0.57 per 1000 PY, RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.1-2.9).
   Conclusion: Although the increase in absolute risk of suicide was modest, our findings reflect the severe psychological stress that prostate cancer patients may experience after diagnosis. The increased risk of suicide observed in men with prostate cancer, including low-risk, calls for increased awareness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB IMPORTANCE The prevention of suicidal behavior is one of the most important tasks for mental health clinicians. Although a few studies have indicated an increased risk of suicidal behavior among individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, the development of more effective ways of identifying and modifying the risk is hampered by our limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms for this association.
   OBJECTIVE To explore whether attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and suicidal behavior share genetic and environmental risk factors.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Matched cohort design across different levels of family relatedness recorded from January 1, 1987, to December 31, 2009. We identified 51 707 patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (through patient and prescribed drug registers) in Sweden and their relatives by linking longitudinal population-based registers. Control participants were matched 1:5 on sex and birth year.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Any record of suicide attempt or completed suicide defined by discharge diagnoses of the International Classification of Diseases.
   RESULTS Individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (probands) had increased risks of attempted and completed suicide, even after adjusting for comorbid psychiatric disorders (odds ratio [OR] = 3.62 [95% CI, 3.29-3.98] and 5.91 [95% CI, 2.45-14.27], respectively). The highest familial risk was observed among first-degree relatives (attempted suicide: OR = 2.42 [95% CI, 2.36-2.49] among parents of probands with ADHD and OR = 2.28 [95% CI, 2.17-2.40] among full siblings of probands with ADHD; completed suicide: OR = 2.24 [95% CI, 2.06-2.43] and OR = 2.23 [1.83-2.73], respectively), whereas the risk was considerably lower among more genetically distant relatives (attempted suicide: OR = 1.59 [95% CI, 1.47-1.73] among maternal half siblings, OR = 1.57 [95% CI, 1.45-1.70] among paternal half siblings, and OR = 1.39 [95% CI, 1.35-1.43] among cousins; completed suicide: OR = 1.51 [95% CI, 1.08-2.10], OR = 2.02 [95% CI, 1.47-2.79], and OR = 1.51 [95% CI, 1.36-1.67], respectively). These familial aggregation patterns remained similar across sex, after excluding relatives with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and probands with suicidal behavior, and after excluding probands and relatives with severe comorbid disorders.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is associated with an increased risk of both attempted and completed suicide. The pattern of familial risks across different levels of relatedness suggests that shared genetic factors are important for this association. This is an important first step toward identifying the underlying mechanisms for the risk of suicidal behavior in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and suggests that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and their family members are important targets for suicide prevention and treatment.

AB Background
   More effective prevention of suicide requires a comprehensive understanding of sociodemographic, psychiatric and somatic risk factors. Previous studies have been limited by incomplete ascertainment of these factors. We conducted the first study of this issue using sociodemographic and out-patient and in-patient health data for a national population.
   Method
   We used data from a national cohort study of 7140589 Swedish adults followed for 8 years for suicide mortality (2001-2008). Sociodemographic factors were identified from national census data, and psychiatric and somatic disorders were identified from all out-patient and in-patient diagnoses nationwide.
   Results
   There were 8721 (0.12%) deaths from suicide during 2001-2008. All psychiatric disorders were strong risk factors for suicide among both women and men. Depression was the strongest risk factor, with a greater than 15-fold risk among women or men and even higher risks (up to 32-fold) within the first 3 months of diagnosis. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer, spine disorders, asthma and stroke were significant risk factors among both women and men (1.4-2.1-fold risks) whereas diabetes and ischemic heart disease were modest risk factors only among men (1.2-1.4-fold risks). Sociodemographic risk factors included male sex, unmarried status or non-employment; and low education or income among men.
   Conclusions
   All psychiatric disorders, COPD, cancer, spine disorders, asthma, stroke, diabetes, ischemic heart disease and specific sociodemographic factors were independent risk factors for suicide during 8 years of follow-up. Effective prevention of suicide requires a multifaceted approach in both psychiatric and primary care settings, targeting mental disorders (especially depression), specific somatic disorders and indicators of social support.

TI Death of a Close Relative and the Risk of Suicide in Sweden-A Large
   Scale Register-Based Case-Crossover Study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID BEREAVEMENT; MORTALITY; SPOUSE; LIFE
AB Background
   Bereavement is thought to be a risk factor for suicide but the association has not been thoroughly investigated according to specific sensitive time periods and risk groups using a self-matched design. We aimed to 1) determine the risk of suicide within the first year after death of a close relative, 2) investigate if and how the risk changes within this time window and 3) determine if sex, age, and type of relationship, affect this association.
   Methods
   A self-matched, case-crossover study was performed by linking Swedish registers. In total, 31 059 individuals with suicide between 1990 and 2011 were included. Different periods within the year prior to the suicide were compared with corresponding periods one year earlier in the same individual's life. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for suicide after death of a close relative.
   Results
   Increased ORs of suicide were seen during the first month, OR 1.77 (95% CI 1.35-2.34), and the first half-year, 1.27 (1.13-1.43). An even higher OR was found within the first week, 3.43 (1.89-6.22). Patterns were similar for women and men and across age groups. Death of a partner or child but not death of a sibling or parent was associated with a significantly increased suicide risk. The strongest association was seen after death of a partner in individuals aged 45 and older.
   Discussion
   These findings provide knowledge of sensitive time periods and at-risk groups in the early period of bereavement. Due to the use of a self-matched study design, methodological challenges of unmeasured residual confounding could be overcome.

AB This study aimed to compare young individuals who differed in terms of birth region and history of suicide attempt regarding socio-demographic and healthcare factors, and with regard to their risks of subsequent unemployment, sickness absence and disability pension.
   Prospective cohort study based on register linkage of 2,801,558 Swedish residents, aged 16-40 years in 2004, without disability pension and with known birth country, followed up 2005-2011. Suicide attempters treated in inpatient care during 2002-2004 (N = 9149) were compared to the general population of the same age without attempt 1987-2011 (N = 2,792,409). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for long-term unemployment (> 180 days), sickness absence (> 90 days), and disability pension were calculated with Cox regression, adjusted for several risk markers.
   Compared to Swedish natives with suicide attempt, migrants of non-Western origin with attempt received less specialised mental healthcare. Distinct differences between native Swedes and migrants were present for the three labour market outcomes, but differences between migrant subgroups were inconsistent. As compared to native Swedes without attempts, non-European migrants with suicide attempt had adjusted HRs and CIs for subsequent unemployment 2.8 (2.5-3.1), sickness absence 2.0 (1.7-2.3) and disability pension 2.2 (1.8-2.6). Respective estimates for natives with suicide attempt were 2.0 (1.9-2.1); 2.7 (2.6-2.9) and 3.4 (3.2-3.6), respectively.
   Migrant suicide attempters receive less specialised mental health care before their attempt than native Swedes, and their marginalzation patterns are different. Healthcare and policy makers need to take the differential risk profile for migrant and native populations into account.

AB Previous studies have shown decreasing child homicide rates in many countries - in Sweden mainly due to a drop in filicideesuicides.
   This study examines the rate of child homicides during 21 years, with the hypothesis that a decline might be attributable to a decrease in the number of depressive filicide offenders (as defined by a proxy measure). In addition, numerous characteristics of child homicide are presented. All homicide incidents involving 0e14-year-old victims in Sweden during 1992-2012 (n = 90) were identified in an autopsy database. Data from multiple registries, forensic psychiatric evaluations, police reports, verdicts and other sources were collected.
   Utilizing Poisson regression, we found a 4% annual decrease in child homicides, in accordance with prior studies, but no marked decrease regarding the depressive-offender proxy. Diagnoses from forensic psychiatric evaluations (n = 50) included substance misuse (8%), affective disorders (10%), autism-spectrum disorders (18%), psychotic disorders (28%) and personality disorders (30%). Prior violent offences were more common among offenders in filicides than filicideesuicides (17.8% vs. 6.9%); and about 20% of offenders in each group had previously received psychiatric inpatient care. Aggressive methods of filicide predominated among fathers. Highly lethal methods of filicide (firearms, fire) were more commonly followed by same-method suicide than less lethal methods. Interestingly, a third of the extra-familial offenders had an autism-spectrum disorder.
   Based on several findings, e.g., the low rate of substance misuse, the study concludes that nontraditional risk factors for violence must be highlighted by healthcare providers. Also, the occurrence of autism-spectrum disorders in the present study is a novel finding that warrants further investigation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

AB Compilations of substances detected in fatal intoxications are important in order to observe changes in intoxication patterns, to monitor effects of preventive work and to discover new trends in drug usage. The aim of the present study was to describe the current pattern of substances detected in fatal intoxications in Sweden. Fatal intoxications investigated at the Department of Forensic Chemistry, Linkoping, Sweden, during 1992-2002, were analysed. All suicides, uncertain cases and accidents where the cause of death were fatal intoxications (ICD-9: E950, E980 and E859) were included and substances detected in more than 50 fatal intoxications (in femoral blood) were listed. For each substance, a cut off value was set, above which concentrations were considered toxic. Fatal intoxications were detected by forensic-chemical analyses in 12% (6998/60,314) of the forensic autopsies during the study period. Among the suicides, an average of 3.8 substances were detected per case, the corresponding figure for uncertain cases and accidents were 3.5 and 4.1 substances, respectively. Ethanol was by far the most frequently detected substance, detected in 43% (3039) of the fatal intoxications, of which 32% (960) had toxic concentrations, followed by propoxyphene, detected in 27% (1863) of the fatal intoxications of which 74% (1370) had toxic concentrations. The number of cases where ethanol and propoxyphene were detected decreased during the study period. Moreover, other CNS-active drugs such as antidepressants, analgesics and anxiolytics were also frequently detected. The drugs with high proportions of cases with toxic concentrations detected were propoxyphene, amitriptyline, zolpidem, carisoprodol, alprazolam, thioridazine, methadone and ketobemidone. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) were detected in 12% (833) and 10% (665), respectively. A significantly (P < 0.001) higher proportion of cases where TCA were detected had toxic concentrations when compared with cases where SSRI were detected (64% versus 31%).

AB PurposeTo estimate the incidence trend and outcome of paracetamol poisoning, in relation to increased availability of paracetamol from non-pharmacy outlets in 2009.
   MethodPatients' serum paracetamol results over 14years (2000-2013) from 20 (out of 21) regions in Sweden were linked to national registers of hospital care, cause of death, and prescriptions. Paracetamol poisonings were defined by serum paracetamol levels, hospital diagnoses, or cause of death. The change in incidence of poisonings following increased availability of paracetamol was analysed by using segmental regression of time series.
   ResultsOf the 12068 paracetamol poisonings, 85% were classified as intentional self-harm. Following increased availability from non-pharmacy outlets, there was a 40.5% increase in the incidence of paracetamol poisoning, from 11.5/100000 in 2009 to 16.2/100000 in 2013. Regression analyses indicated a change in the trend (p<0.0001) but not an immediate jump in the incidence (p=0.5991) following the increased availability. Adjusting for trends in hospital episodes for self-harm, suicides, and the sales volume of paracetamol did not influence the result. All-cause mortality at 30days (3.2%) did not change over time.
   ConclusionsThe incidence of paracetamol poisoning in Sweden has increased since 2009, contrasting the decreased incidence in the period of 2007-2009. The change in trend was temporally associated with the introduction of availability of paracetamol from non-pharmacy outlets but did not appear to be related to sales volume of paracetamol or general trends in self-harm or suicides.

AB Few studies have examined temporal changes in the contribution of psychosis to homicide offending. This research examines whether the incidence and the proportion of people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, compared to all homicide offenders, have changed over a 20-year period in Sweden. All homicide offenders in Sweden from 1987 through 2006 were identified in the National Register for Criminal Convictions and linked on an individual level to the Central Archive of the National Board of Forensic Medicine, where data concerning individuals subjected to a forensic psychiatric examination in Sweden are registered. Offenders with a diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (F20-F29) formed the subgroup of offenders with psychosis. While the overall incidence of homicide did not change over time, both the incidence and the proportion of offenders with schizophrenia spectrum disorders decreased somewhat in relation to all homicide offenders. Although offenders with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder still comprise a disproportionately large share of all homicide offenders, their contribution to the overall incidence of homicide is at least not increasing in Sweden. Yet, it remains a significant problem that needs to be addressed by clinicians and researchers.

AB BackgroundSmall studies suggest that subjects who have undergone bariatric surgery are at increased risk of suicide, alcohol and substance use disorders. This population-based cohort study aimed to assess the incidence of treatment for alcohol and substance use disorders, depression and attempted suicide after primary Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).
   MethodsAll patients who underwent primary RYGB in Sweden between 2001 and 2010 were included. Incidence of hospital admission for alcohol and substance use disorders, depression and suicide attempt was measured, along with the number of drugs prescribed. This cohort was compared with a large age-matched, non-obese reference cohort based on the Swedish population. Inpatient care and prescribed drugs registers were used.
   ResultsBefore RYGB surgery, women, but not men, were at higher risk of being diagnosed with alcohol and substance use disorder compared with the reference cohort. After surgery, this was the case for both sexes. The risk of being diagnosed and treated for depression remained raised after surgery. Suicide attempts were significantly increased after RYGB. The adjusted hazard ratio for attempted suicide in the RYGB cohort after surgery compared with the general non-obese population was 2.85 (95 per cent c.i. 2.40 to 3.39).
   ConclusionPatients who have undergone RYGB are at an increased risk of being diagnosed with alcohol and substance use, with an increased rate of attempted suicide compared with a non-obese general population cohort.

AB A recent study found that Swedish adolescents were more disapproving of a suicidal disclosure by a fictional friend than their Turkish counterparts. Given this finding, the present study investigated whether or not more adolescents in Turkey than in Sweden disclose their own suicidal thoughts to someone, to whom adolescents disclose their suicidal thoughts, what reactions such disclosures produce, and reasons for not disclosing suicidal feelings among 966 Swedish and 956 Turkish high school students. A questionnaire was used to collect information about different aspects of suicidal disclosures. More Turkish than Swedish adolescent suicide ideators disclosed their thoughts. More Turkish than Swedish students believed also that young people thinking about and planning suicide tell others of their plans and thereby ask for help. All overwhelming majority of adolescents in both groups revealed their thoughts to peers. The social reactions to suicidal disclosures in both samples were mainly positive. The two most common reasons for not disclosing in both groups involved interpersonal hopelessness. Adolescents who disclosed their past suicidal thoughts to someone reported having lower current suicidal ideation than those who had not. In line with favorable social attitudes towards suicidal disclosures and lower suicidal mortality rates in Turkey compared with Sweden, more Turkish than Swedish adolescents reported having disclosed their own suicidal thoughts to someone in their social milieu.

AB Toxicologic analysis is an integral component in the investigation of suicide and requires correlation with a detailed scene inspection, with an extensive exploration into the decedent's medical and social background to uncover suicidal ideation or intent and a postmortem examination of the body. In this review, the authors analyzed 2864 cases classified as suicide upon autopsy and toxicologic examinations between 1993 and 2002 in the Kentucky Division of Medical Examiner's Services. Blood and urine were collected in 95.0% and 72.3% of cases, respectively. A total of 32.5% of the victims had negative blood toxicologic results, and 52.7% of urine toxicology screens yielded no drugs. Analysis of the data indicated that 3 times as many women had taken antidepressants and more than twice as many had consumed opioids. Drug toxicity ("overdose") ranked as the third (9.9%) leading cause of suicide after firearm injury (67.5%) and hanging (13.7%). Women succumbed to drug toxicity more than men (27.5% versus 5.9%). Of the overdose deaths, 66.5% had a negative blood alcohol concentration (BAC), while antidepressants, opioids, and benzodiazepines were detected in blood in 54.4%, 37.4%, and 29.2% of the subjects, respectively. The collection of these data serves the goals of public health and clinicians in devising strategies for suicide prevention.

AB Background To investigate whether school performance is a risk factor for suicide death later in life and, if so, to what extent this is explained by intergenerational effects of parental education.
   Methods This population-based cohort study comprises national birth cohorts between 1972 and 1981 in Sweden. We followed 898 342 students, graduating between 1988 and 1997 from the 9 years of compulsory school, equivalent to junior high school, until 31 December 2006, generating 11 148 758 person-years and 1490 suicides. Final school grades, in six categories, and risk of suicide were analysed with Poisson regression.
   Results The incidence rate ratio (RR) for suicide death for students with the lowest grades was 4.57 (95% CI 2.82 to 7.40) for men and 2.67 (1.42 to 5.01) for women compared to those with highest grades after adjustment for a number of sociodemographic and parental morbidity variables, such as year of graduation, parental education, lone parenthood, household receiving social welfare or disability pension, place of schooling, adoption, maternal age and parent's mental illness. Students with grades in the middle categories had RRs in between. These relationships were not modified by parental education.
   Conclusions The strong association between low school grades and suicide in youth and young adulthood emphasises the importance of both primary and secondary prevention in schools.

AB Objectives This study aimed to investigate whether violent and non-violent offending were related to elevated risk of suicide. We also investigated whether the risk was higher among those with repeated offences and how experiences of substance misuse and suicide attempt modified the relationship.
   Design A nationwide prospective cohort study.
   Setting A register study of 48 834 conscripted men in 1969/1970 in Sweden followed up during a 35-year period in official registers.
   Participants A birth cohort of 48 834 men who were mandatory conscripted for military service in 1969/70 at the age of 18-20years. Possible confounders were retrieved from psychological assessments at conscription and the cohort was linked to mortality and hospitalisation and crime records from 1970 onwards. Estimates of suicide risks were calculated as HR with 95% CIs using Cox proportional regression analyses with adjustment for potential confounding by family, psychological and behavioural factors including substance use and psychiatric disorders.
   Results Of the total cohort, 2671 (5.5%) persons died during the follow-up period. Of these, 615 (23%) persons died due to suicide. Non-violent criminality was evident for 29% and violent criminality for 4.7% of all the participants. In the crude model, the violent offenders had nearly five times higher risk (HR=4.69, 3.56 to 6.19) to die from suicide and non-violent criminals had about two times higher risk (HR=2.08, 1.72 to 2.52). In the fully adjusted model, the HRs were still significant for suicide in the non-violent group.
   Conclusions Experiences of violent or non-violent criminality were associated with increased risk of suicide. Comorbidity with alcohol and substance use and psychiatric disorders modified the risk, but the suicide risk remained significantly elevated for non-violent criminals. It is crucial to identify offenders and especially repeated offenders who also suffer from alcohol or substance misuse and psychiatric illness in clinical settings in order to prevent suicide.

AB Objective To investigate the association between drug treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and risk of concomitant suicidal behaviour among patients with ADHD.
   Design Register based longitudinal study using within patient design.
   Setting Linkage of multiple national registers in Sweden.
   Participants 37 936 patients with ADHD born between 1960 and 1996 and followed from 2006 to 2009 for treatment status by ADHD drug treatment and suicide related events (suicide attempt and completed suicide).
   Main outcome measure Incidence rate of suicide related events during ADHD drug treatment periods compared with that during non-treatment periods.
   Results Among 37 936 patients with ADHD, 7019 suicide related events occurred during 150 721 person years of follow-up. At the population level, drug treatment of ADHD was associated with an increased rate of suicide related events (hazard ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 1.44). However, the within patient comparison showed a reverse association between ADHD drug treatment and rate of suicide related events (0.89, 0.79 to 1.00). Among stimulant users, a reduced within patient rate of suicide related events was seen during treatment periods (0.81, 0.70 to 0.94). Among non-stimulant/mixed users, no significantly increased within patient rate of suicide related events during non-stimulant treatment periods was seen (0.96, 0.72 to 1.30).
   Conclusions This study found no evidence for a positive association between the use of drug treatments for ADHD and the risk of concomitant suicidal behaviour among patients with ADHD. If anything, the results pointed to a potential protective effect of drugs for ADHD on suicidal behaviour, particularly for stimulant drugs. The study highlights the importance of using within patient designs to control for confounding in future pharmacoepidemiological studies.

TI Association between mortality from suicide in England and antidepressant
   prescribing: an ecological study
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID RATES; PREVENTION; DEPRESSION; OVERDOSE; DEATHS; SWEDEN; TRENDS; SSRIS
AB Background: Antidepressant prescribing has been increasing in England. Studies in other countries suggest that while this may be associated with reduced suicide rates, it may also be associated with increased fatal poisoning from antidepressant drugs. We therefore conducted an ecological study to assess the association between prescription rates for antidepressants and suicide or fatal antidepressant- related poisoning in England.
   Methods: The Office for National Statistics provided information on the number of suicides, antidepressant- related poisoning deaths and populations for England between 1993 and 2002. The Department of Health supplied data on prescriptions for all antidepressants dispensed in England. Associations between prescriptions and deaths were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
   Results: There were 46,747 suicides, 3,987 deaths involving tricyclic antidepressants and 430 involving selective serotonin re- uptake inhibitors and other antidepressants. Increased antidepressant prescribing was statistically associated with a fall in suicide rates ( Spearman's r(s) = 0.73, p = 0.02) and fatal poisoning involving tricyclic antidepressants ( r(s) = - 0.64, p = 0.05). In contrast, increased prescribing of selective serotonin re- uptake inhibitors and other antidepressants was statistically associated with an increase in fatal poisoning involving these drugs ( r(s) = 0.99, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Increased prescribing of antidepressants may indicate improved diagnosis and treatment of depression in primary care. Our analysis suggests that this was accompanied by lower suicide rates. A decrease in poisoning deaths involving tricyclic antidepressants may suggest a change in preference for using serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and other antidepressant drugs for high- risk patients. This may also partially explain the increase in deaths involving these drugs. Due to the ecological nature of the design, we cannot say conclusively whether reduced suicide rates are a direct consequence of increased antidepressant prescribing rates. To confirm these associations, individual level data on prescribing and suicide is needed.

AB This study examined the first participants who registered for the Huntington's disease predictive testing program 1990-1995 in Stockholm, Sweden. A psychosocial investigation was performed to evaluate potential effects of the presymptomatic testing. The results showed no significant differences between 13 genecarriers and 21 noncarriers in pretest attitudes, expectations, general well-being, life satisfaction and lifestyle, the need for support, estimated sense of well-being or degree of health. However, both groups showed high suicidal ideation and self-injurious behavior. Noncarriers had a very high frequency of attempted suicide, and both groups had similarly pronounced psychiatric dysfunction. Their relatives also had high frequencies of psychiatric diseases, suicide or suicidal attempts. Most of the participants had a desire to meet a psychologist or a social worker. The need for counseling, using a well designed protocol, and the importance of focusing on suicide risk of participants in predictive testing programs is emphasized.

AB Background As the suicide rates in young adults do not show a clear decline, it is important to elucidate possible risk factors. Juvenile delinquency has been pointed out as a possible risk behaviour.
   Methods This register-based cohort study comprises the birth cohorts between 1972 and 1981 in Sweden. We followed 992 881 individuals from the age of 20 years until 31 December 2006, generating 10 210 566 person-years and 1482 suicides. Juvenile delinquency was defined as being convicted of a crime between the ages of 15 and 19 years. Estimates of risk of suicide were calculated as incidence rate ratio (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Poisson regression analysis with adjustment for potential confounding by their own and their parents' mental illness or substance abuse, parental education, single parenthood, social assistance, adoption and foster care.
   Results Among females, 5.9%, and among males, 17.9%, had at least one conviction between the ages 15 and 19 years. In the fully adjusted model, females with one conviction had a suicide risk of 1.7 times higher (95% CI 1.2-2.4), the corresponding IRR for men was 2.0 (95% CI 1.7-2.4) and 5.7 (95% CI 2.5-13.1) and 6.6 (95% CI 5.2-8.3), for women and men with five or more convictions. The effect of severe delinquency on suicide was independent of parental educational level.
   Conclusions This study supports the hypothesis that individuals with delinquent behaviour in late adolescence have an increased risk of suicide as young adults. Regardless of causality issues, repeated juvenile offenders should be regarded by professionals in health, social and correctional services who come into contact with this group as a high-risk group for suicide.

AB Objective: The primary aim was to relate Toxoplasma gondii seropositivity and serointensity to scores on the self-rated Suicide Assessment Scale (SUAS-S). Another aim was to reevaluate the previously reported positive association between T gondii serointensity and a history of nonfatal suicidal self-directed violence.
   Method: This cross-sectional, observational study compared T gondii serointensity and seropositivity in plasma from 54 adult suicide attempters (inpatients at Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden) and 30 adult control subjects (randomly selected from the municipal population register in Lund, Sweden) recruited between 2006 and 2010.The potential of patients and controls for self-directed violence was evaluated with the SUAS-S. Psychiatric diagnoses were made according to DSM-IV criteria. Plasma samples were tested for immunoglobulin G antibodies to T gondii, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus type 1. Data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression to investigate the association between T gondii serointensity or seropositivity and a history of nonfatal suicidal self-directed violence; multivariable linear regression was used to explore the relationship between T gondii serointensify or seropositivity and the SUAS-S. Both regression models included sex, age, and body mass index as covariates.
   Results: Seropositivity of T gondii (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=7.12; 95% CI, 1.66-30.6; P=.008) and serointensity of T gondii (adjusted OR=2.01; 95% CI, 1.09-3.71; P=.03) were positively associated with a history of nonfatal suicidal self-directed violence. Seropositivity of T gondii was associated with higher SUAS-S scores, a relationship significant for the whole sample (P=.026), but not for suicide attempters only. No significant associations with other pathogens were identified.
   Conclusions: These results are consistent with previous reports on the association between T gondii infection and nonfatal suicidal self-directed violence. Confirming these results in future large longitudinal studies and including suicide as an outcome may lead to novel individualized approaches in suicide prevention.

AB The increasingly punitive measures taken by European governments to deter people seeking asylum, including increased use of detention, internalised controls, reductions in in-country rights and procedural safeguards, have a hugely damaging impact on the lives and wellbeing of women survivors of torture, sexual and domestic violence. This article, based on a two-year research project examining Britain, Denmark and Sweden, involved more than 500 hours speaking with people seeking asylum, as well as interviews with practitioners. It highlights among other issues non-adherence to the Istanbul Convention (for Denmark and Sweden, who have ratified it); non-application of gender guidelines; and significant wholesale violations of refugee rights. It demonstrates some of the ways in which increasingly harsh policies impact on women seeking asylum and highlights the experiences relayed by some who are affected: those stuck in asylum systems and practitioners seeking to provide support. Indeed, it indicates that women seeking asylum in Britain, Denmark and Sweden are made more vulnerable to violence due to the actions or inactions of the states that are supposed to protect them.

AB Durkheim conceived of suicide as a product of social integration and regulation. Although the sociology of suicide has focused on the role of disintegration, to our knowledge, the interaction between integration and regulation has yet to be empirically evaluated. In this article we test whether more egalitarian gender norms, an important form of macro-regulation, protects men and women against suicidality during economic shocks. Using cross-national data covering 20 European Union countries from the years 1991 to 2011, including the recent economic crises in Europe, we first assessed the relation between unemployment and suicide. Then we evaluated potential effect modification using three measures of gender equality, the gender ratio in labour force participation, the gender pay gap, and women's representation in parliament using multiple measures. We found no evidence of a significant, direct link between greater gender equality and suicide rates in either men or women. However, a greater degree of gender equality helped protect against suicidality associated with economic shocks. At relatively high levels of gender equality in Europe, such as those seen in Sweden and Austria, the relationship between rising unemployment rates and suicide in men disappeared altogether. Our findings suggest that more egalitarian forms of gender regulation may help buffer the suicidal consequences of economic shocks, especially in men.

AB Introduction: Psychotic experiences are associated with later substance use disorder and suicidal behavior, but individual psychotic experiences have not been examined in a longitudinal data set. Also, the potential dose-response relationship between these phenomena remains unknown.
   Method: Cohort study including 9242 adolescents who participated in The Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS). At ages 15 and/or 18, seven psychotic experiences (auditory and visual hallucinations, and five delusions) were assessed via questionnaires. Outcomes at follow-up were physician-assigned diagnoses of substance use disorder and suicide attempts ascertained from the Swedish Patient Register. Associations were estimated with Cox regressions and expressed as hazard ratios.
   Results: All psychotic experiences were associated with later substance use disorder and/or suicide attempts, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.6 to 3.0. A dose-response relationship was observed between psychotic experiences and later substance use disorder, and suicide attempt.
   Discussion: Auditory and visual hallucinations as well as delusions in adolescence are associated with later development of substance use disorder and suicide attempt, and there is a dose-response relationship between the load of psychotic experiences and these adverse outcomes. Clinicians should assess subclinical hallucinations as well as delusions in psychiatric evaluations of adolescents. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This longitudinal study examines to what extent the risk of mortality-all-cause, natural death, suicide, and unintentional injury mortality-differs by types and severity of disabilities as well as disability status.
   Data were the National Sample Cohort of 1,025,340 individuals in South Korea followed from 2002 to 2013. Cox regression with time-variant variables was used to estimate the hazard ratio of mortality by disability.
   Individuals with disabilities had a higher risk of mortality compared to those without (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.80-1.88 for natural death; HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.64-2.03 for suicide; HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.38-1.71 for unintentional injury). All types of disability were associated with an increased risk of natural death. Individuals with mental disability were the highest risk group for suicide (HR 7.14, 95% CI 5.31-9.60). People defined as having severe disability had an elevated risk for all categories of mortality.
   Disabilities are important markers of high risk of mortality. Findings call for actions to reduce mortality risk of people with disabilities, including preventing suicidal behaviors of those with mental disability.

AB Background: Treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) is one of the most common treatments for depression. It is however not clear whether or not there is an increased short-term suicide risk during initiation with SSRI.
   Methods: A register-based nationwide case-crossover study including 5,866 suicides, 1,698 women and 4,168 men, from the Death Register 2007-2010 in Sweden. SSRI initiation was defined as a dispensed prescription of SSRI within 28 days prior to the date of suicide with no previous dispensed prescription of SSRI within 4 months prior that prescription. The control period took place one year earlier. Odds ratio (OR) was estimated using conditional logistic regression.
   Result: During the 28 day period prior to suicide 48 women and 138 men were exposed to SSRI initiation (while not being exposed in the control period) and 22 women and 43 men were exposed in the control period (while not being exposed in the case period). The OR for suicide after initiation with SSRI was 2.7 (95% CI: 1.6-44) for women, and 4.3 (95% CI: 3.0-6.1) for men. The highest OR was found 8-11 days after initiation with SSRI 9.7 (95% CI: 3.0-31.7) for women and men combined.
   Conclusion: The main limitation in this study is confounding by indication, but the descriptive question is however not confounded by indication. Together with plausible biological mechanisms and previous clinical and epidemiological observations our findings, linking initiation of SSRI to increased short-term suicide risk, deserve further attention specifically in the clinical setting.

ID TRAIN-PEDESTRIAN FATALITIES; RAILROADS; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS
AB Each year, approximately 80-100 people are killed on state-owned railways due to train-person collisions in Sweden. Underlying causes are suicide and accidents; suicide constituting a vast majority. Earlier Swedish studies at a national level revealed a relation between population density and incident frequency, however, with places of occurrence often located to the outskirts of cities some distance away from station areas where victims can await approaching trains in seclusion. The aim of this study was to investigate whether this national pattern also applies to larger urban areas such as greater Stockholm, and to discuss preventative implications based on these observations. All registered incidents (N = 41) where people were hit or run-over by trains with a fatal outcome over the four-year period 2005-2008 were investigated. Results deviating from the national pattern include that most incidents occur at station areas, and that most victims enter the tracks from platforms. Passing express trains appear to be overrepresented, compared to commuter trains. Due to a low number of cases, our observations must be interpreted with caution. However, they imply that preventative measures in this type of area should focus on platform safety foremost, especially protection against rapid trains passing by station areas.

AB IMPORTANCE Childhood adversity (CA) is associated with an increased risk of suicide in young adulthood that might be explained by maladaptive trajectories during adolescence. Although adolescent violent offending is linked with suicide, little is known about its role in the association between CA and suicide.
   OBJECTIVE To examine whether adolescent violent offending mediates the association between CA and suicide in early adulthood.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based, longitudinal cohort study with a follow-up time spanning 5 to 9 years included 476 103 individuals born in Sweden between 1984 and 1988. The study population was prospectively followed up from 20 years of age until December 31, 2013, with respect to suicide. Data analysis was performed from January 1, 1984, to December 31, 2013.
   EXPOSURES Register-based CAs included parental death, parental substance abuse and psychiatric disorder, parental criminal offending, parental separation, public assistance recipiency, child welfare intervention, and residential instability. Adolescent violent offending was defined as being convicted of a violent crime between the ages of 15 and 19 years.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Estimates of risk of suicide after 20 years of age (from 2004 if born in 1984 and from 2008 if born in 1988) until the end of 2013 were calculated as incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% CIs using Poisson regression analysis. Adjustments were made for demographics and psychiatric disorder. In addition, binary mediation analysis with logistic regression was used.
   RESULTS A total of 476 103 individuals (231 699 [48.7%] female) were included in the study. Those with a conviction for violent offending had been exposed to all CAs to a greater extent than those with no violent offending. Cumulative CA was associated with risk of suicide in nonconvicted (adjusted IRR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.5-3.9) and convicted youths, who had a higher risk of suicide (adjusted IRR, 8.5; 95% CI, 4.6-15.7). Adolescent violent offending partly mediated the association between CA and suicide.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Individuals with a history of CA who also engage in violent offending in adolescence have a high risk of suicide. Interventions to prevent externalizing behavior during childhood and increased support to youths with delinquent behavior may have the potential to prevent suicide related to CA.

AB Associations between substance use variables and suicidal behavior were analyzed in an urban population sample from ("the Women and Alcohol in Gothenburg" study). In Phase I, 20-year-old women (n = 2,069) completed a screening questionnaire. Interviews were carried out with a stratified sample (n = 560). Data, collected in 1995 and 2000, were analyzed using logistic regression to generate odds ratios. Drug use, but not risky alcohol consumption, was associated with suicidal thoughts after adjusting for current depression. Study limitations and implications for suicide prevention are discussed. The study was funded by the Swedish Research Council and the Alcohol Research Council of Sweden.

AB Background: Risk factors for suicide and fatal accidental intoxication are extensively studied, while risk factors for intoxications/injuries of undetermined intent are less well known. The latter have shown an overlap with suicides, but also with fatal accidental intoxications. The objective was to analyze potential differences and similarities in the patterns of risk factors for accidental intoxications, injuries/intoxications with undetermined intent, and suicides, respectively.
   Methods: A follow-up register study was conducted, using data from ASI interviews with clients in the criminal justice system in Sweden (n=6744), followed in the National Causes of Death Register. A set of risk factors from the ASI interview were tested in bivariate analysis with the respective cause of death, yielding significant risk factors further analyzed in three Cox regression models.
   Results: In Cox regression analyses, death from fatal accidental intoxication was associated with male gender (HR 4.09), use of heroin (HR 2.86), and use of cannabis (HR 1.94), and death from intoxication/injury of undetermined intent was associated with use of heroin (HR 3.48), binge drinking of alcohol (HR 2.46) and previous psychiatric hospitalization (HR 2.41), while negatively associated with depression (HR 0.33). Death from suicide was associated with previous suicide attempts (HR 2.78) and use of sedatives (HR 2.17).
   Conclusions: In this population of criminal justice clients with reported substance use problems, fatal injuries/intoxications with undetermined intent - like fatal accidental intoxications - appear to be associated with substance use variables, and cannot readily be assumed to represent the same background factors as suicide.

AB To explore the comparability of postmortem forensic toxicologic testing across jurisdictions, the authors administered a survey to 11 laboratories serving pilot sites for a violent death reporting system. With few exceptions, all sites tested for the same substances but did not use the same methodology. Limit of detection thresholds for drugs of abuse and psychoactive medications varied up to 30-fold, limiting the comparability of cross-jurisdictional toxicologic data.

AB Trends in the well-being of Swedish youth were examined to determine whether they have shown improvement or deterioration since the passage of the 1979 corporal punishment ban. Rates of youth involvement in crime, alcohol and drug use, rape, and suicide have decreased. Trends in rates of nonsexual assault are equivocal due to shifts in enforcement. Legal sanctioning of corporal punishment appears to be unnecessary to improve youth well-being.

AB The body of knowledge regarding health and recovery as experienced by patients at risk of suicide is limited. More research is needed into the meaning of recovery and what strengthens the desire to live. The aim of this study was to describe the phenomenon of recovery in a context of nursing care as experienced by persons at risk of suicide. In line with a reflective lifeworld research approach, 14 patients from a psychiatric clinic in Sweden participated in phenomenon-oriented interviews. Data were analyzed to describe the essence of the phenomenon. The results reveal that the phenomenon of recovery means 'reconnecting with oneself while struggling between life and death'. Three meaning constituents emerged: being in an expressive space and giving voice to oneself, regaining dignity through nurturing connectedness, and finding a balance in the tension between life and death. In conclusion, the meaning of recovery is to experience the ability to manage one's own life. Professional caregivers need to acknowledge patients' lifeworlds, in a way that enable patients to experience themselves as capable of managing their own lives. Professional caregivers should also facilitate the involvement of supportive relatives.

AB Restricted fetal growth and young maternal age have been associated with increased risk of suicidal behaviour later in life. Research investigating the independent and interacting effects of these risk factors with parental mental health and socio-economic status is scarce. A case-control study was effected through record linkage between Swedish registers. Individuals born 1973-1983 who were hospitalized due to a suicide attempt (n = 17,159) or committed suicide (n = 1,407) were matched to <= 10 controls by sex, month and county of birth. Controlling for parental conditions, significantly increased odds ratios (OR) for suicide attempt were found for low birth weight (OR = 1.12, 95 % CI 1.01-1.25), short birth length (OR = 1.15, 95 % CI 1.08-1.22), short and light for gestational age (OR = 1.23, 95 % CI: 1.10-1.38), short but not light for gestational age (OR = 1.18, 95 % CI: 1.09, 1.29), teenage motherhood (OR = 1.66, 95 % CI 1.53-1.80), young fatherhood (OR = 1.33, 95 % CI 1.27-1.39) and multiparity (OR = 1.40, 95 % CI 1.31-1.50). For completed suicide, increased odds ratios were found for low birth weight (OR = 1.65, 95 % CI 1.16-2.35), teenage motherhood (OR = 1.44, 95 % CI 1.09-1.90) and young fatherhood (OR = 1.20, 95 % CI 1.02-1.41). There was a synergy effect between teenage motherhood and parental psychiatric inpatient care with regard to suicide attempt in offspring [synergy index = 1.53 (95 % CI 1.27-1.84)]. Low birth weight and length, and short and light for gestational age may increase the risk of subsequent suicidal behaviour, and more research is needed to investigate underlying mechanisms. Public health implications from this study include measures to improve pre- and perinatal parental mental health, particularly in teenage pregnancies.

AB Objective The aim of this study was to clarify the role of 'contagion', or social transmission, in risk of suicidal behaviour (SB) among siblings. Methods We followed Swedish sibling pairs until one of them (S1; N = 111,848) was registered for a suicide attempt or completion. We tested the effect of geographic proximity between siblings on risk of a first SB registration of S1's sibling (S2). To control for familial confounding, we conducted complementary analyses of sibling trios (N = 701), comparing risk in different siblings as a function of their respective proximity to S1. Results The best-fitting model across sibling pairs included an effect of distance between siblings (HR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.93-0.99). Hazard ratios declined quickly up to 25 km and largely stabilized beyond 150 km. Across all pairs, a larger age difference between siblings was associated with reduced SB risk (HR = 0.96 95% CI = 0.93-0.98). Findings were consistent within the sibling trios. Conclusions Consistent with the concept of suicide contagion, risk of suicidal behaviour subsequent to a sibling's suicide completion or attempt is higher as a function of sibling closeness. These findings are robust to potentially confounding familial factors.

AB In Sweden, about 550 individuals die every year of drug intoxication. Many of these drugs are metabolized by CYP enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. A lack of these enzymes, resulting in poor metabolism, can lead to adverse reactions and even to fatality. On the other hand, an ultrarapid metabolism can lead to insufficient drug plasma concentration, resulting in failure of treatment, or it can lead to high concentrations of active/toxic metabolites. The aim of this project was to study the genetic profile of individuals with regard to the presence of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genes, in cases of fatal intoxication (242), suicide (intoxications excluded) (262), and natural death (212). PCR, followed by pyrosequencing, was used for all the analyses. We found that, among those who died of suicide (suicide cases), there was a higher number carrying more than two active CYP2D6 genes (corresponding to the phenotype of ultrarapid metabolizer) as compared with those who died of natural causes (natural-death cases) (P = 0.007).

   Analysis of linked population-wide data
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID QUALITY-OF-LIFE; MARITAL-STATUS; HEALTH; IDEATION; CARE; MORTALITY
AB Background
   An elevated risk of suicide after a diagnosis of prostate cancer has been reported previously in the USA and Sweden. We aimed to identify whether prostate cancer survivors resident in New South Wales Australia are at higher risk of suicide and if so, who is most at risk.
   Methods
   Data were obtained from the New South Wales (NSW) Cancer Registry for all men diagnosed with prostate cancer in NSW during 1997 to 2007. These were linked by the Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL) to Australian Bureau of Statistics Mortality Data to the end of 2007 to determine vital status and cause of death. We compared the number of suicides observed for prostate cancer survivors with the expected number of suicides based on age-and calendar year-specific rates for the NSW male population using standardised mortality ratios (SMRs). Suicide rate ratios (RR) by disease and patients' characteristics were estimated using multivariable negative binomial regression to determine the most at risk groups.
   Results
   During the study period 51,924 NSW men were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Forty nine of these men were subsequently recorded as committing suicide up to 10 years after diagnosis with an SMR of 1.70 (95% Cl:1.26-2.25). Twenty six (53%) of these suicides occurred within 12 months after diagnosis. Risk diminished over time since diagnosis (RR in 1-2 years after diagnosis = 0.29, 95% Cl: 0.12-0.71, 2-4 years RR = 0.30, 95% Cl: 0.14-0.16 and 4+ years RR = 0.26, 95% Cl: 0.11-0.60 compared with <1 year since diagnosis). Men with non-localised disease had a higher risk of suicide compared to men with localised disease (RR = 2.68, 95% Cl: 1.15-6.23). Men living outside major cities had lower risk of suicide compared to those resident in major cities (rate ratio = 0.42, 95% Cl: 0.20-0.87). Single, divorced, widowed or separated men were more likely to commit suicide than married men (RR = 4.18, 95% Cl: 2.36-7.42).
   Conclusion
   Risk of suicide is higher for NSW men diagnosed with prostate cancer than the general age matched male population. Vulnerable or lonely men and those with pre-existing depression or suicidal ideation who are diagnosed with prostate cancer should be offered additional psychological support.

   Objective: To investigate the excess mortality in different diagnostic categories due to suicide and other external causes of death, and due to specific causes in connection with diseases and medical conditions.
   Methods: In longitudinal national psychiatric case registers from Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, a cohort of 270,770 recent-onset patients, who at least once during the period 2000 to 2006 were admitted due to a psychiatric disorder, were followed until death or the end of 2006. They were followed for 912,279 person years, and 28,088 deaths were analyzed. Life expectancy and standardized cause-specific mortality rates were estimated in each diagnostic group in all three countries.
   Results: The life expectancy was generally approximately 15 years shorter for women and 20 years shorter for men, compared to the general population. Mortality due to diseases and medical conditions was increased two-to three-fold, while excess mortality from external causes ranged from three-to 77-fold. Mortality due to diseases and medical conditions was generally lowest in patients with affective disorders and highest in patients with substance abuse and personality disorders, while mortality due to suicide was highest in patients with affective disorders and personality disorders, and mortality due to other external causes was highest in patients with substance abuse.
   Conclusions: These alarming figures call for action in order to prevent the high mortality.

AB Objective: To identify specific risk factors for filicide, parental killing of one's own children.
   Method: A nationwide matched cohort study of filicides, including filicide-suicide, was conducted in Sweden 1973-2008 (N = 151). We linked longitudinal national registry data on offender psychiatric and neurologic morbidity (ICD codes), suicide attempts, traumatic injury, and previous criminality. We compared filicide offenders and their children to ageand sex-matched general population controls and their children. To compare homicide perpetrator subtypes, parallel analyses were made with nonfilicide homicide offenders (N = 3,979) and matched controls.
   Results: History of major psychiatric disorder, defined as psychotic, affective, or personality disorder, was more common among filicide perpetrators even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors and other potential perpetrator and child confounders (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 8.6; 95% CI, 3.7-20.0). Substance misuse was not an independent risk factor, whereas prior suicide attempt conferred a marked increase of filicide risk (AOR = 11.6; 95% CI, 4.0-33.3). Multiple birth was the only child risk factor for filicide that was significant (AOR = 4.8; 95% CI, 1.3-17.6) in multivariate analyses. Overall, nonfilicide homicide offenders exhibited similar risk factors as filicide perpetrators; additionally, substance misuse and violent crime were significantly more frequent and suicide attempt less common (nonoverlapping 95% CIs) than in filicide offenders.
   Conclusions: Major psychiatric disorder and previous suicide attempt were strong independent risk factors of filicide; however, substance misuse and prior violent crime were less common than among nonfilicide homicide offenders. Filicide prevention attempts should focus major psychiatric disorder and suicidal behavior in particularly strained parents, instead of more general risk factors for interpersonal violence such as substance misuse.

TI A Life-Course Study on Effects of Parental Markers of Morbidity and
   Mortality on Offspring's Suicide Attempt
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID FAMILIAL PATHWAYS; RISK; BEHAVIOR; POPULATION; ADOLESCENTS; CHILDREN;
   DENMARK; DEATH
AB Background: Research on the temporal relationship of parental risk factors with offspring's suicide attempt is scarce and a life course approach has not been applied to date. We investigated the temporal relationship of parental morbidity and mortality with offspring's suicide attempt and whether any such association was modified by offspring's age at attempt.
   Methods: We designed a case-control study through linkage of Swedish registers. Cases comprised all individuals in Sweden born 1973-1983 with inpatient care due to suicide attempt (15-31 years of age) and with information on both biological parents (N = 15 193). Ten controls were matched to each case (National Patient register with national complete coverage). Conditional logistic and spline regressions were applied.
   Results: Particularly for women, most parental markers showed the strongest effect sizes if exposure was short-term (within 2 years after exposure) and related to the mother. Especially short-term exposure to maternal inpatient care due to psychiatric diagnoses had a significantly stronger effect on suicide attempt risk in women compared to men. Regarding exposure to parental inpatient care due to psychiatric diagnoses, short-term as opposed to long-term (exceeding 2 years after exposure) effects were highest during adolescence and decreased significantly with age for female and male offspring, respectively.
   Conclusions: Although limited by the fact that data on parental morbidity and the outcome of suicidality were based on inpatient data only, the data suggest that the high risks of suicide attempt in case of exposure to parental psychopathology and suicidal behavior particularly during adolescence and the strong short-term effects associated with maternal psychopathology for female offspring are of direct clinical importance.

TI Suicide mortality in Belgium at the beginning of the 21st century:
   differences according to migrant background
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article

   1ST-GENERATION; IDEATION; HEALTH; SWEDEN; RATES
AB Background: Suicidal behaviour has long been recognized to vary widely between countries. Yet, rates of suicidal behaviour do not only vary between, but also within countries. Gender and socioeconomic differences in suicidal behaviour are well established, but the literature on suicidal behaviour and migrants is sparse, particularly in Belgium. The present study maps out the occurrence of suicide mortality across three of the largest migrant groups (Italians, Turks and Moroccans) versus the native population in Belgium, and verifies whether this association persists after accounting for socioeconomic variables. Methods: Census-linked mortality follow-up data covering the period 2001-2011 were used to probe into suicide mortality. To compare absolute differences by migrant background, indirect standardisation analyses were carried out. To assess relative differences, Cox proportional hazards models were performed. Analyses were restricted to 18- to 64-year-olds. Results: Belgian men and women have the highest suicide mortality risk, persons of Moroccan/Turkish origin the lowest, and Italians are somewhere in between. When migration generation is considered, the risk is higher for second-generation groups compared to that of the first-generation. Accounting for socioeconomic determinants, the difference between the native population and the various nationality groups intensifies. Conclusion: Although the risk is generally lower for minorities compared to the majority population, the results across migration generations underscore minorities' increased vulnerability to suicide over time. Future research should focus on understanding the risks and protective factors of suicidal behaviour across different nationality groups. This way, tailored policy recommendations can be developed in order to tackle the burden of suicide.

   ADOLESCENT SUICIDE; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; CHILD; PROGRAM; PARTICIPATION;
   DEPRESSION
AB Background: There have been only a few reports illustrating the moderate effectiveness of suicide-preventive interventions in reducing suicidal behavior, and, in most of those studies, the target populations were primarily adults, whereas few focused on adolescents. Essentially, there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and cultural adaptability of suicide-prevention strategies in schools. There is also a lack of information on whether suicide-preventive interventions can, in addition to preventing suicide, reduce risk behaviors and promote healthier ones as well as improve young people's mental health.
   The aim of the SEYLE project, which is funded by the European Union under the Seventh Framework Health Program, is to address these issues by collecting baseline and follow-up data on health and well-being among European adolescents and compiling an epidemiological database; testing, in a randomized controlled trial, three different suicide-preventive interventions; evaluating the outcome of each intervention in comparison with a control group from a multidisciplinary perspective; as well as recommending culturally adjusted models for promoting mental health and preventing suicidal behaviors.
   Methods and design: The study comprises 11,000 adolescents emitted from randomized schools in 11 European countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden serving as the scientific coordinating center. Each country performs three active interventions and one minimal intervention as a control group. The active interventions include gatekeeper training (QPR), awareness training on mental health promotion for adolescents, and screening for at-risk adolescents by health professionals. Structured questionnaires are utilized at baseline, 3- and 12-month follow-ups in order to assess changes.
   Discussion: Although it has been reported that suicide-preventive interventions can be effective in decreasing suicidal behavior, well-documented and randomized studies are lacking. The effects of such interventions in terms of combating unhealthy lifestyles in young people, which often characterize suicidal individuals, have never been reported. We know that unhealthy and risk-taking behaviors are detrimental to individuals' current and future health. It is, therefore, crucial to test well-designed, longitudinal mental health-promoting and suicide-preventive interventions by evaluating the implications of such activities for reducing unhealthy and risk behaviors while concurrently promoting healthy ones.

AB Purpose To identify occupations and socio-economic groups with detrimental or protective effect on suicide mortality. Methods For every occupation and economic activity/industry, we computed directly age-standardized mortality rates (DSRs) using the age structure of the European population (2010) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for suicide using national cause-specific mortality rates. We further stratified analyses by socio-economic variables, job-skill level, and by three calendar periods (1990-1998/1999-2006/2007-2014). Results The study sample comprised 5,834,618 participants (94,918,456 person-years). The highest DSRs were observed among unemployed/job-seeking group, in agricultural, fishery and related male workers, and in health and social activities female workers. The lowest DSRs were observed in real estate and renting, research and development, IT and other business activities in men and in agriculture, hunting and forestry industry in women. A consistent reduction in DSRs across three calendar periods was observed in men. In female corporate managers, DSRs increased over the 2007-2014 period compared with 1999-2006. Compared to general working-age population, unemployed/job-seeking people, manufacturing labourers, personal care and related workers, and motor vehicle drivers of both sexes were identified at risk of suicide. Moreover, an excess of suicide was observed among male material recording and transport clerks; nursing and midwife-associated professionals; and agricultural workers as well as among female writers and performing artists. Conclusions The findings suggest the detrimental effect of low socioeconomic positions, including unemployment, with respect to suicide mortality and a relationship between suicide and poor psychosocial working conditions in elementary occupations. Sex-specific results need further investigation.

AB Previous research has documented an association between birth order and suicide, although no study has examined whether it depends on the cultural context. Our aim was to study the association between birth order and cause-specific mortality in Finland, and whether it varies by ethno-linguistic affiliation. We used data from the Finnish population register, representing a 5% random sample of all Finnish speakers and a 20% random sample of Swedish speakers, who lived in Finland in any year 1987-2011. For each person, there was a link to all children who were alive in 1987. In total, there were 254,059 siblings in 96,387 sibling groups, and 9797 deaths. We used Cox regressions stratified by each siblings group and estimated all-cause and cause-specific mortality risks during the period 1987-2011. In line with previous research from Sweden, deaths from suicide were significantly associated with birth order. As compared to first-born, second-born had a suicide risk of 1.27, third-born of 1.35, and fourth- or higher-born of 1.72, while other causes of death did not display an evident and consistent birth-order pattern. Results for the Finnish-speaking siblings groups were almost identical to those based on both ethno-linguistic groups. In the Swedish-speaking siblings groups, there was no increase in the suicide risk by birth order, but a statistically not significant tendency towards an association with other external causes of death and deaths from cardiovascular diseases. Our findings provided evidence for an association between birth order and suicide among Finnish speakers in Finland, while no such association was found for Swedish speakers, suggesting that the birth order effect might depend on the cultural context.

TI Death and suicide among former child and adolescent psychiatric patients
SO BMC PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID EXCESS MORTALITY; BEHAVIOR; DENMARK
AB Background: Increased mortality rates among previous child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) patients have been found in Scandinavian studies up to the 1980s. The suicide risk in this group has been estimated to be almost five times higher than expected. This article addresses two questions: Do Swedish CAP patients continue to risk premature death and what kind of information related to psychiatric symptoms and/or behavior problems can predict later suicide?
   Methods: Hospital files, Sweden's census databases (including immigration and emigration) and administrative databases (including the Swedish Hospital Discharge register and the Persons Convicted of Offences register), and the Cause of Death register were examined to determine the mortality rate in a group of 1,400 former CAP inpatients and outpatients over a period of 12-33 years. Observed and expected numbers of deceased were calculated with the prospective method and the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) method. The relative risk or the risk ratio (RR) is presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Significance level tests were made using two-by-two tables and chi-square tests. The Cox proportional-hazards regression model was used for survival analysis.
   Results: Twenty-four males and 14 females died. Compared with the general population, the standardized mortality ratio in this group of CAP patients was significantly higher in both sexes. Behavioral problems, school problems, and co-morbid alcohol or drug abuse and criminality (including alcohol-related crimes) were found to be important predictors. Thirty-two deaths were attributed to suicide, intoxication, drug overdose, or accident; one patient died of an alcohol abuse-related disorder, and five patients died of natural causes. Suicide was the most common cause of death, but only 2 of these 19 cases were initially admitted for attempted suicide.
   Conclusion: We suggest that suicide and death prevention among CAP patients may not be a psychiatric issue per se but a future function of society's juvenile social-welfare investments and juvenile-delinquency prevention programs.

AB An increased rate of suicide among women with cosmetic breast implants has been consistently reported in the epidemiologic literature. We extended by 8 years the follow-up of our earlier mortality study of a nationwide cohort of 3527 Swedish women with cosmetic breast implants to examine in greater detail. suicide and other causes of death. The number of deaths observed among these women was compared with the number expected among the age-and calendar-period-matched general female population of Sweden. Women with breast implants were followed for over 65,000 person-years, with a mean follow-up of 18.7 years (range, 0.1-37.8 years). Overall, 175 deaths occurred among women with breast implants versus 133.4 expected (standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.5). Among women with implants, we observed statistically significant 3-fold excesses of suicide (SMR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.9-4.5) and deaths from alcohol or drug dependence (SMR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.0-7.3), as well as an excess of deaths from accidents and injuries consistent with substance abuse or dependence. The increased risk of suicide was not apparent until 10 years after implantation. Deaths from cancer overall were close to expectation (SMR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8-1.4). Women with cosmetic implants had elevated SMRs for lung cancer and chronic respiratory disease. There was no excess of breast cancer mortality. The excess of deaths from suicides, drug and alcohol abuse and dependence, and other related causes suggests significant underlying psychiatric morbidity among these women. Thus, screening for preimplant psychiatric morbidity and postimplant monitoring among women seeking cosmetic breast implants may be warranted.

AB Objectives: To compare lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) in older adults who were hospitalized in connection with a suicide attempt and in a population comparison group, as well as to compare previous suicidal behavior in attempters with and without AUD. Design: Case-comparison. Setting: Five hospitals in Western Sweden. Participants: Persons 70 years or older, who were treated in a hospital because of a suicide attempt during 2003-2006 were recruited. Of 133 eligible participants, 103 participants were enrolled (47 men, 56 women, mean age 80 years, response rate 77%). Four comparison subjects per case were randomly selected among participants in our late-life population studies. Measurements: Lifetime history of AUD in accordance with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, was discerned on the basis of interview data, case record review, and the hospital discharge register. Depression symptoms were rated using the Montgomery-Asberg Rating Scale. Results: AUD was observed in 26% of the cases and in 4% of the comparison group (odds ratio [OR]: 10.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.9-22.5). Associations were noted in men (OR: 9.5; 95% CI: 4.0-22.8) and women (OR: 12.0; 95% CI: 2.4-59.5). More than half of the cases with AUD and a third of those without AUD had made at least one prior suicide attempt. In these, AUD was associated with a longer interval between the first attempt and the index attempt. Conclusions: A strong association between AUD and hospital-treated suicide attempts was noted in both sexes in this northern European setting. Given the high rates of suicide worldwide in this fast-growing and vulnerable group, comparison studies in other settings are needed. (Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 2013; 21:196-203)

AB This article analyses and compares recent research on Scandinavian physicians' attitudes towards, as well as their practice of, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. The studies discussed are quite dissimilar in their design, resulting in considerable difficulties as far as comparability is concerned. Such difficulties are common in these fields of research. As an intended contribution to the amendment of future research, we suggest what we take to be detailed and precise definitions of the terms euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide for use internationally. Our definitions, or interpretations, basically draw on the Dutch experience and understanding of these terms. The Dutch approach implies that acts of abstention from life-prolonging treatment, i.e., withholding and withdrawing treatment, and pain and symptom treatment that theoretically could shorten life (including terminal sedation) are to be considered,normal medical practice'. Furthermore, death is seen as having natural causes in all of these acts. That, however, is not the case with euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. When a physician performs either of these acts, he or she is required to state 'unnatural death' in the patient's death certificate. Our conceptual suggestions do not address the ethical status of the various medical decisions that are made with regard to the death of patients; our aim is conceptual clarity only, As far as euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in Scandinavia is concerned, even though comparisons prove difficult, we do think some observations may be made: physicians from Norway, Denmark and Sweden display differences in both attitude and practice concerning these phenomena. Norwegian physicians are most restrictive with regard to attitude. Danish and Swedish physicians display a more liberal attitude, the latter being the most liberal. These findings did not fit the physicians' practice. Danish physicians have performed euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide more often than Norwegian physicians. Swedish physicians, even though they are the most liberal when it comes to attitude, appear never to have performed euthanasia and very seldom physician-assisted suicide.

AB Our objective was to investigate which drugs young people who attempt suicide use in the Lund catchment area-eight municipalities in Skane, southern Sweden. All patients aged up to 18 years admitted to Lund University Hospital after deliberate or probably deliberate self-poisoning from 1 January 1991 until 31 December 1995 were included. Forty-nine (58%) had used a single drug; 20 (24%) had used 3 or more drugs. Fifty-two (61%) used analgesics-paracetamol was used by 38 (45%) and propoxyphene by 17 (20%). Thirty-one (36%) had ingested psychotropics-13 used benzodiazepines, 10 antidepressants, and 8 antipsychotics. Eleven (15%) had used drugs in combination with alcohol. We conclude that it is important to follow changes in self-poisoning patterns, to monitor the effects of preventive work and discover new trends in drug use.

AB This study provides an overview of homicide clearance in four West European countries: Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Using data from the European Homicide Monitor, employing similar definitions and uniform coding schemes, this study allowed for unique cross-country comparisons in factors influencing differences in homicide clearance rates. Findings based on homicides occurring in the period 2009-14 revealed overall low homicide rates in all countries, with a wide variety in homicide clearance rates, ranging from 77 percent in the Netherlands to 98 percent in Finland. Results further showed that both event-based as well as victim-based characteristics significantly influenced the likelihood of homicide clearance, suggesting that homicide clearance rates can, for a large part, be attributed to the prevalent types of homicide in each of these European countries.

AB Objective To assess the risk of attempted suicide before, during, and after treatment with isotretinoin for severe acne.
   Design Retrospective cohort study linking a named patient register of isotretinoin users (1980-9) to hospital discharge and cause of death registers (1980-2001).
   Setting Sweden, 1980-2001.
   Population 5756 patients aged 15 to 49 years prescribed isotretinoin for severe acne observed for 17 197 person years before, 2905 person years during, and 87 120 person years after treatment.
   Main outcome measures Standardised incidence ratio (observed number divided by expected number of suicide attempts standardised by sex, age, and calendar year), calculated up to three years before, during, and up to 15 years after end of treatment.
   Results 128 patients were admitted to hospital for attempted suicide. During the year before treatment, the standardised incidence ratio for attempted suicide was raised: 1.57 (95% confidence interval 0.86 to 2.63) for all (including repeat) attempts and 1.36 (0.65 to 2.50) counting only first attempts. The standardised incidence ratio during and up to six months after treatment was 1.78 (1.04 to 2.85) for all attempts and 1.93 (1.08 to 3.18) for first attempts. Three years after treatment stopped, the observed number of attempts was close to the expected number and remained so during the 15 years of follow-up: standardised incidence ratio 1.04 (0.74 to 1.43) for all attempts and 0.97 (0.64 to 1.40) for first attempts. Twelve (38%) of 32 patients who made their first suicide attempt before treatment made a new attempt or committed suicide thereafter. In contrast, 10 (71%) of the 14 who made their first suicide attempt within six months after treatment stopped made a new attempt or committed suicide during follow-up (two sample test of proportions, P=0.034). The number needed to harm was 2300 new six month treatments per year for one additional first suicide attempt to occur and 5000 per year for one additional repeat attempt.
   Conclusions An increased risk of attempted suicide was apparent up to six months after the end of treatment with isotretinoin, which motivates a close monitoring of patients for suicidal behaviour for up to a year after treatment has ended. However, the risk of attempted suicide was already rising before treatment, so an additional risk due to the isotretinoin treatment cannot be established. As patients with a history of suicide attempts before treatment made new attempts to a lesser extent than did patients who started such behaviour in connection with treatment, patients with severe acne should not automatically have isotretinoin treatment withheld because of a history of attempted suicide.

AB Objectives: Increasing rates of disability pension (DP), particularly owing to mental diagnoses, have been observed among young adults in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. There is a lack of knowledge about the health prognosis in this group. The aim of this study was to investigate whether DP in young adulthood owing to specific mental diagnoses or somatic diagnoses predicts suicidal behaviour and all-cause mortality.
   Design: A nationwide prospective cohort study.
   Setting: A register study of all young adults who in 2005 were 19-23 years old and lived in Sweden. Registers held by the National Board of Health and Welfare, Statistics Sweden and the National Social Insurance Agency were used.
   Participants: 525 276 young adults. Those who in 2005 had DP with mental diagnoses (n=8070) or somatic diagnoses (n=3975) were compared to all the other young adults in the same age group (n=513 231).
   Outcome measures: HRs for suicide attempt, suicide and all-cause mortality in 2006-2010 were calculated by Cox proportionate hazard regression models, adjusted for sex, country of birth, parental education and parental and previous own suicidal behaviour.
   Results: The adjusted HR for suicide attempt was 3.32 (95% CI 2.98 to 3.69) among those on DP with mental diagnoses and 1.78 (95% CI 1.41 to 2.26) among those on DP with somatic diagnoses. For the specific mental diagnoses, the unadjusted HRs ranged between 2.42 (mental retardation) and 22.94 (personality disorders), while the adjusted HRs ranged between 2.03 (mental retardation) and 6.00 (bipolar disorder). There was an increased risk of mortality for young adults on DP in general, but only those with mental DP diagnoses had a significantly elevated HR of completed suicide with an adjusted HR of 3.92 (95% CI 2.83 to 5.43).
   Conclusions: Young adults on DP are at increased risk of suicidal behaviour and preterm death, which emphasises the need for improved treatment and follow-up.

ID FIREARM; SUICIDE; SWEDEN
AB Gunshot injuries are a major problem worldwide from the human, medical, and economic perspectives. The number and characteristics of gunshot fatalities have been observed to vary significantly between countries. This study analyzes fatal gunshot wounds in the region of Uusimaa, Southern Finland, between 1995 and 2001. Gunshot wounds were typically found in suicides committed by men aged between 20 and 60 years. In most cases, a handgun was used. Mental disorders were present in the history of almost one quarter of the victims. Alcohol was identified in postmortem toxicology in half of the cases, but drugs of abuse were relatively uncommon.
   The autopsy rate in Finland is among the highest of the European Union countries, and a medicolegal investigation is performed in virtually all fatal gunshot incidents. This study is therefore representative of forensic investigations of gunshot fatalities in Finland overall.

ID EXTERNAL COSTS
AB The purpose of the present study is to estimate accident risks and marginal costs for railway level crossings in Sweden. The marginal effect of train traffic on the accident risk is used to derive the marginal cost per train passage that is due to level crossing accidents. The estimations are based on Swedish data from 2000 to 2012 on level crossing accidents, train volume, and crossing characteristics. In this study we estimate the accidents risk for both motorized road traffic and vulnerable road users. As a proxy for road traffic flow we use three categories of road type, and to capture the influences of pedestrians and bicyclists we use information about the number of persons living nearby the level crossing. The results show that both protection device, road type, traffic volume of the trains, and number of persons living nearby the level crossing have significant influence on the accident probability. The marginal cost per train passage regarding motor vehicle accidents is estimated at EUR 0.15 on average in 2012 (price level of 2017). The corresponding number for accidents with vulnerable road users excluding suicides is EUR 0.08 or including suicides EUR 0.50. The cost per train passage varies substantially depending on type of protection device, road type, the traffic volume of the trains, and number of persons living nearby the crossing.

SO ETHOLOGY

ID FILICIDE; INFANTICIDE; SUICIDE; QUEBEC
AB Evolutionary models have been used to explain parental child homicide. One idea is that children with low fitness value to their parents will be less loved and cared for and therefore more at risk in conflict situations. It is then important to investigate if conflicts with the children are the major pattern in cases of parental child homicide. The aim of this study is to survey the background circumstances of parental child homicide in Sweden and relate them to the evolutionary model suggested. We more specifically investigate if the homicides occur in conflict situations with the child, the frequency of several victims (including the partner or former partner) and if there are differences in characteristics of homicides between stepparents and genetic parents. Our results show that parental child homicide is a heterogeneous phenomenon, where relatively few cases were the result of a conflict with the child-victims. Instead severe conflicts between parents were the most common circumstance in which children were killed. Many children were victims of an extended suicide, which often included several members of the family. Step-parents were more likely to kill children aggressively in conflicts with them than genetic parents. The complexity of the phenomenon suggests that an evolutionary model based upon a mechanism related to conflicts with the child-victim has limited explanatory value on parental child homicide in general.

   REGISTER; DENMARK; STRESS
AB Background: Stressful life events have been shown to be associated with altered risk of various health consequences. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the emotional stress evoked by a prostate cancer diagnosis increases the immediate risks of cardiovascular events and suicide.
   Methods and Findings: We conducted a prospective cohort study by following all men in Sweden who were 30 y or older (n = 4,305,358) for a diagnosis of prostate cancer (n = 168,584) and their subsequent occurrence of cardiovascular events and suicide between January 1, 1961 and December 31, 2004. We used Poisson regression models to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of cardiovascular events and suicide among men who had prostate cancer diagnosed within 1 y to men without any cancer diagnosis. The risks of cardiovascular events and suicide were elevated during the first year after prostate cancer diagnosis, particularly during the first week. Before 1987, the RR of fatal cardiovascular events was 11.2 (95% CI 10.4-12.1) during the first week and 1.9 (95% CI 1.9-2.0) during the first year after diagnosis. From 1987, the RR for cardiovascular events, nonfatal and fatal combined, was 2.8 (95% CI 2.5-3.2) during the first week and 1.3 (95% CI 1.3 1.3) during the first year after diagnosis. While the RR of cardiovascular events declined, the RR of suicide was stable over the entire study period: 8.4 (95% CI 1.9-22.7) during the first week and 2.6 (95% CI 2.1-3.0) during the first year after diagnosis. Men 54 y or younger at cancer diagnosis demonstrated the highest RRs of both cardiovascular events and suicide. A limitation of the present study is the lack of tumor stage data, which precluded possibilities of investigating the potential impact of the disease severity on the relationship between a recent diagnosis of prostate cancer and the risks of cardiovascular events and suicide. In addition, we cannot exclude residual confounding as a possible explanation.
   Conclusions: Men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer are at increased risks for cardiovascular events and suicide. Future studies with detailed disease characteristic data are warranted.

AB Although our knowledge of the relationship between migration and health in women is increasing, we still have a limited knowledge of the migration and health of women of reproductive age. A cross-sectional analysis of a simple random sample of 10,661 women aged 20-49 in Sweden in 1980-1985 and 9585 such women in 1992-1997 was carried out to assess their health. The risk factors for self-reported, poor health and psychosomatic complaints for female refugees and women from Finland, Southern Europe, Western countries and Sweden were examined. Country of birth was a significant risk factor for poor self-reported health and psychosomatic complaints, with women from Southern Europe, female refugees and Finnish women being at higher risk in this respect than Swedish women. The increased risk remained significant after adjustment for demographic and socio-economic factors. Swedish-born women, female refugees, and Finnish women reported poorer health and had more psychosomatic complaints (not Finns) in the 1990s than in the 1980s.

TI Viewing the Body after Bereavement Due to Suicide: A Population-Based
   Survey in Sweden
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PRIMARY-CARE; DEATH; DEPRESSION; PHQ-9
AB Background: Research on the assumed, positive and negative, psychological effects of viewing the body after a suicide loss is sparse. We hypothesized that suicide-bereaved parents that viewed their childs body in a formal setting seldom regretted the experience, and that viewing the body was associated with lower levels of psychological morbidity two to five years after the loss.
   Methods and Findings: We identified 915 suicide-bereaved parents by linkage of nationwide population-based registries and collected data by a questionnaire. The outcome measures included the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). In total, 666 (73%) parents participated. Of the 460 parents (69%) that viewed the body, 96% answered that they did not regret the experience. The viewing was associated with a higher risk of reliving the child's death through nightmares (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.32) and intrusive memories (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.38), but not with anxiety (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.40) and depression (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.83). One limitation of our study is that we lack data on the informants' personality and coping strategies.
   Conclusions: In this Swedish population-based survey of suicide-bereaved parents, we found that by and large everyone that had viewed their deceased child in a formal setting did not report regretting the viewing when asked two to five years after the loss. Our findings suggest that most bereaved parents are capable of deciding if they want to view the body or not. Officials may assist by giving careful information about the child's appearance and other details concerning the viewing, thus facilitating mental preparation for the bereaved person. This is the first large-scale study on the effects of viewing the body after a suicide and additional studies are needed before clinical recommendations can be made.

ID PREVENTION; SWEDEN; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; PEOPLE; TRENDS
AB Elderly suicide rates have declined in recent years in several countries including England and Wales. This study examined the association between a trend of decline in age-specific suicide rates in the elderly in England and Wales and changes in various health and social factors for the period 1985 to 1998. Data on age-specific suicide rates was ascertained from the annual mortality statistics for the years 1985 to 1998.
   Data on the various health and social variables was ascertained from both the Statistics Division at the Department of Health and the Health and Personal Social Services Statistics, the yearly publications of the Department of Health from 1985 to 1998.
   The main findings of this study were (i) a significant negative correlation between the number of general practitioners and all categories of wholetime-equivalent (WTE) hospital medical staff and suicide rates for each of the four five-year age bands for males and females after the age of 65; (ii) a significant negative correlation between the number of new outpatient appointments for mental illness and suicide rates in males and females for each of the four five-year age bands between the ages 65-85 years; (iii) a significant positive correlation between the average daily number of available beds for mental illness and elderly suicide rates, for all five-year age bands between the ages 65-85 years; (iv) a significant negative correlation between the number of field social work staff and day centre staff and elderly suicide rates for each of the four five-year age bands after the age of 65 for males and females; and, (v) a significant positive correlation between the total number of elderly in all residential homes and the number of elderly in local authority residential homes and elderly suicide rates for each of the four five-year age bands between the ages 65-85 years for males and females.
   A trend of decline in age-specific suicide rates in the elderly in England and Wales from 1985 to 1998 was significantly associated with changes in various health and social variables. These included the number of general practitioners and hospital medical staff, the hospital psychiatric services, the number of local authority staff and the number of elderly residents in accommodation supported by a local authority. The results of this study suggest that changes in these variables may be important factors contributing to the recent decline in suicide rates but this effect should be viewed in the context of other health and social factors.

ID ACNE; ISOTRETINOIN; DEPRESSION; SUICIDE; GUIDELINES; COHORT; RISK
AB P>Aim
   Sundstrom et al. (BMJ 2010; 341: c5812) aimed to assess suicide risk before, during and after isotretinoin treatment.
   Hypothesis
   People with severe acne may be at higher risk of attempted suicide regardless of exposure to isotretinoin.
   Setting and design
   This retrospective cohort study from Sweden linked a patient register of isotretinoin users (1980-1989) or patients identified through specified pharmacies (1986-1989) to hospital discharges and a register of causes of death (1980-2001).
   Study exposure
   The study exposure was isotretinoin, identified from a register of named patients given isotretinoin (special application to the Medical Products Agency) or patients prescribed isotretinoin in a dermatology clinic with 'clinic approval' to prescribe the medication without individual application.
   Outcomes
   The outcomes were recorded suicide attempts (identified using ICD-8 and ICD-9 codes E950-E958, ICD-10 codes Y6-64); accidents with unclear intent and an 'external cause' (ICD-8 and ICD-9 codes E980-E988 and ICD-10 codes Y10-Y34) and deaths with underlying causes.
   Primary outcome measure
   Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of suicide rates compared with the general population 3 years before, during and up to 15 years after completion of treatment with isotretinoin.
   Results
   The cohort included 5756 people. During the 21-year follow-up period, 128 (2 center dot 2%) had a hospital admission for a suicide attempt. For all attempts, the SIR [95% confidence interval (CI)] increased from 0 center dot 99 (0 center dot 65-1 center dot 44) 3 years prior to treatment to 1 center dot 57 (0 center dot 86-2 center dot 63) in the year before treatment, increasing to 1 center dot 78 (1 center dot 04-2 center dot 85) within 6 months after starting treatment and decreasing to 1 center dot 04 (0 center dot 74-1 center dot 43) 3 years following treatment. For first suicide attempts, the SIR (95% CI) increased from 0 center dot 89 (0 center dot 54-1 center dot 37) 3 years prior to treatment to 1 center dot 36 (0 center dot 65-2 center dot 50) in the year before treatment, increasing to 1 center dot 93 (1 center dot 08-3 center dot 18) within 6 months of treatment and decreasing to 0 center dot 97 (0 center dot 64-1 center dot 40) 3 years following treatment. Twelve (38%) of 32 patients who attempted suicide prior to treatment made a further attempt or committed suicide at some stage during follow up. Of the 14 who attempted suicide during or within 6 months of treatment, 10 (71%) made a further attempt during follow up.
   Conclusions
   Sundstrom et al. (BMJ 2010; 341: c5812) conclude that there was an increased risk of suicide attempts up to 6 months after the end of treatment with isotretinoin and advise close monitoring for up to a year after completing a course of treatment. Patients with a history of suicide attempts before treatment made fewer new attempts at suicide than those where suicidality was observed in connection with treatment, suggesting that patients with severe acne with a history of attempted suicide should not automatically be refused isotretinoin treatment. The authors also state that suicide risk was already rising prior to treatment and that the additional risk cannot therefore be attributed to isotretinoin use.

AB Aim: We investigated mortality from external causes in Swedish people who had been hospitalised with a severe mental disorder. Methods: Hospitalisations in people aged 15 years or older admitted to hospital with a main diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar mood disorder or unipolar mood disorder between 1987 and 2010 were linked to their causes of death. Results: The mortality rate from all external causes was 20-fold higher in those with unipolar mood disorder, 15-fold higher in those with bipolar disorder and 12-fold higher in those with schizophrenia than in the general population. Over the study periods, the mortality rate declined more for people with unipolar mood disorder (-35%) and schizophrenia (-29%) than the total population (-25%) and those with bipolar mood disorder (-15%). The suicide rate declined most for those with unipolar mood disorder and schizophrenia (-42% for both) and less for the general population (-37%) and those with bipolar mood disorder (-21%). For external causes other than suicide, the mortality rate declined in the general population (-17%) but increased in people with schizophrenia (14%), bipolar mood disorder (30%) and unipolar mood disorder (52%). Conclusions: People with mental disorders have high but declining excess mortality from suicide. Mortality from other external causes has increased, as has the gap in mortality rates between psychiatric patients and the general population.

AB Background
   Parents who lose a child by suicide have elevated risks of depression. No clinical prediction tools exist to identify which suicide-bereaved parents will be particularly vulnerable; we aimed to create a prediction model for long-term depression for this purpose.
   Method
   During 2009 and 2010 we collected data using a nationwide study-specific questionnaire among parents in Sweden who had lost a child aged 15-30 by suicide in years 2004-2007. Current depression was assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and a single question on antidepressant use. We considered 26 potential predictors assumed clinically assessable at the time of loss, including socio-economics, relationship status, history of psychological stress and morbidity, and suicide-related circumstances. We developed a novel prediction model using logistic regression with all subsets selection and stratified cross-validation. The model was assessed for classification performance and calibration, overall and stratified by time since loss.
   Results
   In total 666/915 (73%) participated. The model showed acceptable classification performance (adjusted area under the curve [AUC] = 0.720, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.673-0.766), but performed classification best for those at shortest time since loss. Agreement between model-predicted and observed risks was fair, but with a tendency for underestimation and overestimation for individuals with shortest and longest time since loss, respectively. The identified predictors include female sex (odds ratio [OR] = 1.84); sick-leave (OR = 2.81) or unemployment (OR = 1.64); psychological premorbidity debuting during the last 10 years, before loss (OR = 3.64), or more than 10 years ago (OR = 4.96); suicide in biological relatives (OR = 1.54); with non-legal guardianship during the child's upbringing (OR = 0.48); and non-biological parenthood (OR = 0.22) found as protective.
   Conclusions
   Our prediction model shows promising internal validity, but should be externally validated before application. Psychological premorbidity seems to be a prominent predictor of long-term depression among suicide-bereaved parents, and thus important for healthcare providers to assess.

AB Background: Despite the magnitude and increase of sickness absence due to mental diagnoses, little is known regarding long-term health outcomes. The aim of this nationwide population-based, prospective cohort study was to investigate the association between sickness absence due to specific mental diagnoses and the risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality.
   Methods: A cohort of all 4 857 943 individuals living in Sweden on 31.12.2004 (aged 16-64 years, not sickness absent, or on retirement or disability pension), was followed from 01.01.2005 through 31.12.2008 for all-cause and cause-specific mortality (suicide, cancer, circulatory disease) through linkage of individual register data. Individuals with at least one new sick-leave spell with a mental diagnosis in 2005 were compared to individuals with no sickness absence. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by Cox regression, adjusting for age, sex, education, country of birth, family situation, area of residence, and pre-existing morbidity (diagnosis-specific hospital inpatient (2000-2005) and outpatient (2001-2005) care).
   Results: In the multivariate analyses, mental sickness absence in 2005 was associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality: HR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.47-1.86 in women and in men: 1.73, 1.57-1.91; for suicide, cancer (both smoking and nonsmoking related) as well as mortality due to circulatory disease only in men. Estimates for cause-specific mortality ranged from 1.48 to 3.37. Associations with all-cause mortality were found for all mental sickness absence diagnostic groups studied.
   Conclusions: Knowledge about the prognosis of patients sickness absent with specific mental diagnoses is of crucial clinical importance in health care. Sickness absence due to specific mental diagnoses may here be used as a risk indictor for subsequent mortality.

AB Aim: Research on the east-west health divide has provided extensive evidence of poorer health in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union than in Western Europe. This study focuses on immigrants from Eastern to Western Europe and analyses whether they have an increased risk of self-reported poor health compared with the host population and what determines that. Methods: This cross-sectional study is based on 373 immigrants from Poland, other East European countries, and the former Soviet Union, aged 25-84, who arrived in Sweden after 1944 and were interviewed during 1993 2000 along with their 35,711 Swedish counterparts. Results: Age- and sex-adjusted unconditional logistic regression showed in general a 92% higher risk of reporting poor health among immigrants than among Swedish-born respondents. The risk also persisted after adjustment for several potential confounders (living singly, having a poor social network, low socioeconomic status, and smoking) and after an additional adjustment for acculturation (language at home), and years in Sweden. Conclusions: Being born in Eastern Europe or the former Soviet Union was an independent risk factor for reporting poor health. It is therefore suggested that it is important for primary and public care services to be aware of the health status and needs of immigrants from these countries.

AB Objectives. Unnatural deaths among Indigenous populations, including the Swedish Sami, occur more often than among the general population. To find prevention strategies, we explored the circumstances of the unnatural deaths of members of reindeer-herding Sami families.
   Study design. The number of deaths from among a cohort of 7,482 members of reindeer-herding Sami families were retrieved from the National Board of Health and Welfare for the years 1961 2001.
   Methods. An evaluation of the information from autopsy records at the National Board of Forensic Medicine, police reports, and available medical records identified 158 unnatural deaths. These were then analysed in detail.
   Results. Transport-related deaths and suicides were the most common unnatural deaths among Swedish reindeer-herding Sami family members. Suicides contributed to 23% of all deaths, road traffic accidents to 16%, and snowmobile fatalities to 11%. The accidents generally reflected an "outdoor lifestyle" and the working conditions were characterized by the use of off-road vehicles such as snowmobiles. Half of the number of victims tested positive for alcohol and alcohol abuse was documented in 15% of all victims.
   Conclusions. The results indicate that alcohol is an important factor in preventing unnatural deaths among reindeer-herding Sami, together with increased safety of both on-road and off-road transportation. (Int J Circumpolar Health 2010; 69(2):129-137)

AB Our objective was to compare sociodemographic conditions and risky/health behaviors affecting Turkish or Middle Eastern versus ethnic Swedes and Finnish immigrant adolescents, respectively.
   All eligible adolescents 13-18 years old (3,216 pupils) in a medium-sized town in Sweden completed a validated in-depth questionnaire (Q90), with 165 questions.
   One hundred and one adolescents were Turkish or Middle Eastern immigrants, while 73 were immigrants from Finland, a neighboring country to Sweden. Turkish/Middle Eastern immigrants were more likely to attend a theoretical program in school, were rarely bullied, as compared to ethnic Swedes and Finns. Turkish/Middle Eastern girls used alcohol at a lower frequency, and reported less depression and sexual experiences than ethnic Swedish girls and Finns. A higher frequency of Finnish adolescents had been bullied and had vandalized, and Finnish adolescents were also determined to have used tobacco and cannabis and to be heavy drinkers more frequently than boys from Turkey/the Middle East.
   We concluded that adolescent immigrants from Turkey and the Middle East seem to be well adapted to Sweden and also have ambitions for a higher education. Differences in risky behaviors were particularly pronounced in comparisons with immigrants from Finland for both boys and girls.

AB Context: The treatment for transsexualism is sex reassignment, including hormonal treatment and surgery aimed at making the person's body as congruent with the opposite sex as possible. There is a dearth of long term, follow-up studies after sex reassignment.
   Objective: To estimate mortality, morbidity, and criminal rate after surgical sex reassignment of transsexual persons.
   Design: A population-based matched cohort study. Setting: Sweden, 1973-2003.
   Participants: All 324 sex-reassigned persons (191 male-to-females, 133 female-to-males) in Sweden, 1973-2003. Random population controls (10: 1) were matched by birth year and birth sex or reassigned (final) sex, respectively.
   Main Outcome Measures: Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (Cl) for mortality and psychiatric morbidity were obtained with Cox regression models, which were adjusted for immigrant status and psychiatric morbidity prior to sex reassignment (adjusted HR [aHR]).
   Results: The overall mortality for sex-reassigned persons was higher during follow-up (aHR 2.8; 95% Cl 1.8-4.3) than for controls of the same birth sex, particularly death from suicide (aHR 19.1; 95% Cl 5.8-62.9). Sex-reassigned persons also had an increased risk for suicide attempts (aHR 4.9; 95% Cl 2.9-8.5) and psychiatric inpatient care (aHR 2.8; 95% Cl 2.0-3.9). Comparisons with controls matched on reassigned sex yielded similar results. Female-to-males, but not male-to-females, had a higher risk for criminal convictions than their respective birth sex controls.
   Conclusions: Persons with transsexualism, after sex reassignment, have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behaviour, and psychiatric morbidity than the general population. Our findings suggest that sex reassignment, although alleviating gender dysphoria, may not suffice as treatment for transsexualism, and should inspire improved psychiatric and somatic care after sex reassignment for this patient group.

DE Caffeine; Fatal; Poisoning; Toxicology
ID OVERDOSE; SCOTLAND; DRUGS; PRODUCTS; PATTERNS; IMPACT; DEATH
AB Objective. Caffeine is widely available in beverages and in different over-the-counter products, including tablets containing 100 mg caffeine. Because intentional fatal intoxications with caffeine occur, the maximum quantity of caffeine tablets that can be bought over the counter in a single purchase was restricted from 250 to 30 in Sweden in the year 2004. The objective of this article was to study the effect of this decision on the number of fatal caffeine intoxications. Method. In Sweden 95% of all cases undergoing forensic autopsy are screened for a number of drugs including caffeine. All cases during January 1993-September 2009 with a caffeine concentration above 80 mu g/g blood were recorded. Results. During the study period toxicological investigations were performed in 83,580 forensic autopsies. Caffeine contributed to the fatal outcome in 20 cases (0.02%). Thirteen (65%) of these fatalities occurred before the introduction of the sales restriction. However, no fatal intoxications where caffeine contributed to the cause of death was recorded between May 2007 and September 2009. Conclusion. Overdoses of tablets containing caffeine can be fatal, suicides as well as accidents occur. Restricting the maximum quantity of caffeine tablets available over the counter seemed to be effective in preventing suicides because of caffeine although some time elapsed until the effect was noted. Further monitoring is required to ensure that the observed lower caffeine mortality is a sustained effect.

AB This paper examines the impact of job loss on a number of non-fatal health events, which are nonetheless severe enough to require hospital in-patient care. We focus on job loss due only to establishment closures, as this reduces the problem of distinguishing between causation and selection. Using linked employee-employer register data, we identify the job losses due to all establishment closures in Sweden in 1987 or 1988. During a subsequent 12-year period, we find that job loss significantly increases the risk of hospitalization due to alcohol-related conditions, among both men and women, and due to traffic accidents and self-harm, among men only. We find no evidence, however, that job loss increased the risk of severe cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction or stroke. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Refugees worldwide suffer high levels of distress and are at increased risk for death by suicide. The Refugee Health Screener (RHS) was developed to screen for emotional distress among refugees and can be used to assess distress severity. This paper examines the association between distress severity and suicidal ideation in a sample of refugees residing in asylum accommodations. Data from the RHS and item 9 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was analyzed. Results showed that individuals at moderate and severe levels of distress were much more likely to exhibit suicidal ideation than individuals with low levels of distress. Even though we cannot conclude that individuals with low levels of distress do not have thoughts of ending their lives, further suicide assessment is warranted in asylum seekers with moderate to severe distress on the RHS.

AB Background. Previous studies have shown an elevated risk for self-harm in adolescents from ethnic minorities. However, potential contributions to this risk from socio-economic factors have rarely been addressed. The main aim of this article was to investigate any such effects.
   Method. A national cohort of 1009 157 children born during 1973-1982 was followed prospectively from 1991 to 2002 in Swedish national registers. Multivariate Cox analyses of proportional hazards were used to estimate the relative risk of hospital admission for self-harm. Parental country/region of birth was used as proxy for ethnicity.
   Results. Youth with two parents born outside Sweden (except those from Southern Europe) had higher age- and gender-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of self-harm than the majority population (HR 1.6-2.3). The HRs decreased for all immigrant groups when socio-economic factors were accounted for but remained significantly higher for immigrants from Finland and Western countries and for youth with one Swedish-born and one foreign-born parent.
   Conclusions. Socio-economic factors explain much of the variation by parental country of birth of hospital admissions for self-harm in youth in Sweden.

AB Background and Aims: Jumping from great height is an aggressive method of suicide attempt where the frequent combination of psychiatric disorder and somatic injuries makes treatment difficult. Our aim was to evaluate survival rate and get patient-reported outcome in patients operated for a pelvic or acetabular fracture sustained when jumping from a height as a suicide attempt.
   Patients and Methods: During the period 2003-2004, 12 patients (11 women) of whom eight were below 30 years of age, were prospectively included. At two years HRQoL (Health-Related Quality of Life) questionnaires (SF-36 and LiSat-11) were used to describe outcome, and at four years a structured psychiatric interview SCID-I (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders) was done.
   Results: At four years all patients were alive. One patient had made a new suicide attempt. Eight patients gave adequate reply on SF-36 and LiSat-11 at two years. In all domains patients scored lower than a norm group with the relatively lowest values in physical domains. Younger patients assessed life as better when compared with middle aged patients.
   Conclusions: This study showed a very low recurrence rate into suicidal behaviour in a group of jumpers and all patients were alive at four years after a suicidal attempt by jumping. The high proportion of psychiatric disorder in these patients highlights the need for a combined treatment effort between orthopaedic and psychiatric expertise.

AB This study sets out to analyze the effect of social isolation at age 12-13 on suicide in early and middle adulthood, adjusting for early life stress and exploring for possible moderation effects among different indicators of perceived burdensomeness and acquired capability for suicide during emerging adulthood. The data are drawn from the Stockholm Birth Cohort Study (n = 9502), in which one can follow individuals from birth (1953) to the age of 55 (2008), and analyzed trough penalized maximum likelihood logistic regressions. Those who had rated themselves as being mostly alone as 12-13-year-olds (1966) were found to be approximately two and a half times as likely to commit suicide between 1981 and 2008 as those who had rated themselves as being mostly with other people (OR = 2.38), irrespective of well-established suicidogenic risk factors measured both prior (e.g., prenatal stress, social welfare recipiency and family rupture) and subsequent (e.g., unemployment, mental disorder and parasuicide) to the measurement of social isolation. The perception of being mostly alone as a child should be treated as a major adverse social condition in its own right, with the potential to explain even distal outcomes across the life span. Further, it is suggested that the framework of social recognition can be used to provide a different nuance to our understanding of the suicidogenic effect of social isolation.

AB Obstetric and neonatal complications have been associated with completed and attempted suicide (suicidal acts) in young offspring. Maternal smoking is one of the most important risk factors for obstetric complications, but the association between prenatal smoking exposure and offspring risk of suicidal acts is unknown. We performed a population-based study of 1,449,333 single births born in Sweden between 1983 and 1996, derived from linked registry data. Maternal smoking and risks of suicidal acts in offspring were estimated using hazard ratios, derived from proportional-hazard models, controlling for potential confounding of parental socio-demographic factors and psychiatric care in first degree relatives. To control for unmeasured familial confounding, a matched case-control analysis of suicidal acts was performed within sibling pairs discordant for prenatal smoking exposure. In the cohort analysis, the adjusted hazard ratio for completed suicide among offspring to women smoking 1-9 cigarettes and at least 10 cigarettes per day were 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.29-2.16, and 1.54, 95% CI, 1.12-2.10. For suicidal acts, corresponding hazard ratios were 1.28, 95% CI 1.21-1.35 and 1.48, 95% CI 1.39-1.57, respectively. However, in sibling pairs discordant for suicidal acts and prenatal smoking exposure, we found no evidence that prenatal smoking exposure increased the risk of suicidal acts. We conclude that the association between prenatal smoking exposure and offspring risk of suicidal acts is probably confounded by unmeasured familial factors.

ID CIRRHOSIS MORTALITY; CONSUMPTION
AB (i) To compare actual developments of alcohol-related harm in Sweden with estimates derived prior to major policy changes in 1995 and (ii) to estimate the effects on consumption and alcohol-related harm of reducing alcohol prices in Sweden. Design Alcohol effect parameters expressing the strength of the relationship between overall alcohol consumption and different alcohol-related harms were obtained from ARIMA ( Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) time-series analyses. Measurements Measures of Swedish alcohol-related mortality ( liver cirrhosis, alcoholic psychosis, alcoholism and alcohol poisoning), accident mortality, suicide, homicide, assaults and sickness absence from 1950 to 1995. Findings Previous estimates of alcohol-related harm based on changes in alcohol consumption for the period 1994 - 2002 for Sweden were, in some cases ( e. g. violent assaults and accidents), relatively close to the actual harm levels, whereas in other cases ( e. g. homicides, alcohol-related mortality and suicide) they diverged from observed harm levels. A tax cut by 40% on spirits and by 15% on wine is estimated to increase total per capita alcohol consumption by 0.35 litre. This increase is estimated to cause 289 additional deaths, 1627 additional assaults and 1.6 million additional sickness absence days. Conclusions The estimates of future changes in harm based upon even relatively modest increases in alcohol consumption produce considerable negative effects, with large economic consequences for the Swedish economy. The additional alcohol-related deaths, for instance, amount to more than half the number of yearly traffic fatalities in Sweden.

AB Context: A US Food and Drug Administration advisory has warned that antidepressants may be associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents. This prompted a meta-analysis of trials in adults that found no overall increase in risk, but individual agents could not be studied.
   Objective: To assess the risk of suicide and suicide attempts associated with individual antidepressant agents.
   Design: Cohort study of incident users of antidepressant agents.
   Setting: Population-based health care utilization data of all residents of British Columbia, Canada, aged 18 years and older between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2005.
   Patients: British Columbia residents who had antidepressant therapy initiated and had a recorded diagnosis of depression.
   Intervention: Initiation of various antidepressant medications.
   Main Outcome Measures: Combined suicide death or hospitalization due to self-harm.
   Results: In a population of 287 543 adults aged 18 years and older with antidepressant therapy initiated, we ob-served outcome rates ranging from 4.41/1000 person-years to 9.09/1000 person-years. Most events occurred in the first 6 months after treatment initiation. After extensive propensity score adjustment, we found no clinically meaningful variation in the risk of suicide and suicide attempt between antidepressant agents compared with fluoxetine hydrochloride initiation: citalopram hydrobromide, hazard ratio=1.00 (95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.57); fluvoxamine maleate, hazard ratio=0.98 (95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.51); paroxetine hydrochloride, hazard ratio=1.02 (95% confidence interval, 0.77-1.35); and sertraline hydrochloride, hazard ratio=0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.53-1.05). Compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as a drug class, other classes including serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic agents, and other newer and atypical agents had a similar risk. Restriction to patients with no antidepressant use in the past 3 years further reduced apparent differences between groups.
   Conclusions: Our finding of equal event rates across antidepressant agents supports the US Food and Drug Administration's decision to treat all antidepressants alike in their advisory. Treatment decisions should be based on efficacy, and clinicians should be vigilant in monitoring after initiating therapy with any antidepressant agent.

AB Objective Some data suggest an association between teenage childbearing and premature death. Whether this possible increase in risk is associated with social circumstances before or after childbirth is not known. We studied premature death in relation to age at first birth, social background and social situation after first birth.
   Design Population-based cohort study.
   Setting Women born in Sweden registered in the 1985 Swedish Population Census.
   Population Swedish women born 1950-1964 who had their first infant before the age of 30 years (N = 460,434).
   Methods Information on the women's social background and social situation after first birth was obtained from Population Censuses. The women were followed up with regard to cause of death from December 1, 1990 to December 31, 1995. Mortality rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
   Main outcome measures Mortality rates by cause of death.
   Results Independent of socio-economic background, teenage mothers faced an increased risk of premature death later in life compared with older mothers (rate ratio 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.9). The increased risk was most evident for deaths from cervical cancer, lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease, suicide, inflicted violence and alcohol-related diseases. Some, but not all, of these increases in risk were associated with the poorer social position of teenagers mothers.
   Conclusions Teenage mothers, independent of socio-economic background, face an increased risk of premature death. Strategies to reduce teenage childbearing are likely to contribute to improved maternal and infant health.

AB Objective To investigate suicide and mortality risk in deployed military veterans versus non-deployed comparators who had gone through military conscription testing.
   Design Population-based matched cohort study.
   Setting Sweden.
   Participants Participants were identified from the Military Service Conscription Register and deployment status from the Swedish Military Information Personnel Register. Of 1.9 million conscripts, 21 721 had deployed at some time between 1990 and 2013 (deployed military veterans). Non-deployed comparators were matched to deployed military veterans in two ways: (1) by cognitive ability, psychological assessment, mental health, body mass index, sex, birth-year and conscription-year (carefully matched), with further adjustment for exercise capacity and suicide attempt history; and (2) by sex, birth-year and conscription-year (age-and sex-matched).
   Main outcome Suicide retrieved from the Swedish National Patient and Causes of Death Register until 31 December 2013.
   Results During a median follow-up of 12 years, 39 and 211 deaths by suicide occurred in deployed military veterans (n=21 627) and carefully matched non-deployed comparators (n=107 284), respectively (15 vs 16/100 000 person-years; adjusted HR (aHR) 1.07; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.52; p=0.72) and 329 in age-and sex-matched non-deployed comparators (n=108 140; 25/100 000 person-years; aHR 0.59; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.82; p=0.002). There were 284 and 1444 deaths by suicide or attempted suicides in deployed military veterans and carefully matched non-deployed comparators, respectively (109 vs 112; aHR 0.99; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.13; p=0.93) and 2061 in age-and sex-matched non-deployed comparators (158; aHR 0.69; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.79; p<0.001). The corresponding figures for all-cause mortality for carefully matched non-deployed comparators were 159 and 820 (61 vs 63/100 000 person-years; aHR 0.97; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.15; p=0.71) and 1289 for age-and sex-matched non-deployed comparators (98/100 000 person-years; aHR 0.62; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.73; p<0.001).
   Conclusion Deployed military veterans had similar suicide and mortality risk as non-deployed comparators after accounting for psychological, psychiatric and physical factors. Studies of mental health in deployed veterans need to adjust for more factors than age and sex for comparisons to be meaningful.

AB This study addresses the burden of grief after the death of an adolescent or young adult offspring. Parental bereavement following the death of an adolescent or young adult offspring is associated with considerable psychiatric and somatic impairment. Our aim is to fill a research gap by examining offspring death due to suicide, accidents, or natural causes in relation to risk of parental sickness absence with psychiatric or somatic disorders.
   This whole population-based prospective study included mothers and fathers of all offspring aged 16-24 years in Sweden on December 31, 2004 (n = 1,051,515). This study had no loss to follow-up and exposure, confounders, and the outcome were recorded independently of each other. Cox survival analysis was used to model time to sickness absence exceeding 30 days, adjusting for parental demographic characteristics, previous parental sickness absence and disability pension, and inpatient and outpatient psychiatric and somatic healthcare prior to offspring death in 2001-2004. This large study population provided satisfactory statistical power for stratification by parents' sex and adolescent and young adults' cause of death.
   Mothers and fathers of offspring suicide and accident decedents both had over tenfold higher risk for psychiatric sickness absence exceeding 30 days as compared to parents of live offspring. Fathers of suicide decedents were at 40 % higher risk for somatic sickness absence.
   This is the largest study to date of parents who survived their offspring's death and the first study of work-related outcomes in bereaved parents. This study uses a broad metric of work-related functional impairment, sickness absence, for capturing the burden of sudden offspring death.

AB Background Childhood cancer survivors have been reported to be vulnerable to psychiatric morbidities and risky health behavior. Suicides, substance abuse, accidents, and violence as causes of death can be regarded as an extreme manifestation of risky health behavior. In the current study, the authors studied the risk of suicide and other risky health behavior-related deaths among childhood cancer patients in Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Methods Using linkage between national cancer, population, and cause-of-death registries, the authors investigated the causes of death in 29,285 patients diagnosed with cancer before age 20 years between 1971 and 2009 compared with a cohort of 146,282 age-matched, sex-matched, and country-matched population comparisons. Rate ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs were estimated using Poisson regression models, adjusting for demographic factors. Results The overall risk of dying of a risky health behavior was found to be increased among childhood cancer patients (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.06-1.47) when compared with population comparisons. The elevated risk was statistically significant among patients with central nervous system tumors (RR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.08-2.05) and patients diagnosed at ages 5 to 9 years and 15 to 19 years (RR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.01-2.24] and RR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.03-1.67], respectively). The overall risk of suicide was found to be increased (RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.02-1.83), and statistically significantly so when patients were diagnosed between ages 15 and 19 years (RR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.09-2.39). Conclusions Childhood cancer patients appear to have an increased risk of risky health behavior-related causes of death compared with the general population. The results of the current study suggest the importance of integrating psychosocial support into the follow-up care of these individuals.

AB Study objective-This study hypothesises that the presumed increased risk of self reported longstanding psychiatric illness and intake of psychotropic drugs among Iranian, Chilean, Turkish, and Kurdish adults, when these groups are compared with Polish adults, can be explained by living alone, poor acculturation, unemployment, and low sense of coherence.
   Design-Data from a national sample of immigrants/refugees, who were between the ages of 20-44 years old, upon their arrival in Sweden between 1980 and 1989. Unconditional logistic regression was used in the statistical modelling.
   Setting-Sweden.
   Participants-1059 female and 921 male migrants from Iran, Chile, Turkey, Kurdistan and Poland and a random sample of 3001 Swedes, all between the ages of 27-60 years, were interviewed in 1996 by Statistics Sweden.
   Main results-Compared with Swedes, all immigrants had an increased risk of self reported longstanding psychiatric illness and for intake of psychotropic drugs, with results for the Kurds being nonsignificant. Compared with Poles, Iranian and Chilean migrants had an increased risk of psychiatric illness, when seen in relation to a model in which adjustment was made for sex and age. The difference became non-significant for Chileans when marital status was taken into account. After including civil status and knowledge of the Swedish language, the increased risks for intake of psychotropic drugs for Chileans and Iranians disappeared. Living alone, poor knowledge of the Swedish language, non-employment, and low sense of coherence were strong risk factors for self reported longstanding psychiatric illness and for intake of psychotropic drugs. Iranian, Chilean, Turkish and Kurdish immigrants more frequently reported living in segregated neighbourhoods and having a greater desire to leave Sweden than their Polish counterparts.
   Conclusion-Evidence substantiates a strong association between ethnicity and self reported longstanding psychiatric illness, as well as intake of psychotropic drugs. This association is weakened by marital status, acculturation status, employment status, and sense of coherence.

AB Background: Immigration to the Nordic countries has increased in the last decades and foreign-born inhabitants now constitute a considerable part of the region's population. Several studies suggest poorer self-reported health among foreign-born compared to natives, while results on mortality and life expectancy are inconclusive. To date, few studies have summarized knowledge on mortality differentials by country of birth. This article aims to systematically review previous results on all-cause and cause-specific mortality by country of birth in the Nordic countries.
   Methods: The methodology was conducted and documented systematically and transparently using a narrative approach. We identified 43 relevant studies out of 6059 potentially relevant studies in August 2016, 35 of which used Swedish data, 8 Danish and 1 Norwegian.
   Results: Our findings from fully-adjusted models on Swedish data support claims of excess mortality risks in specific categories of foreign-born. Most notably, immigrants from other Nordic countries, especially Finland, experience increased risk of mortality from all causes, and specifically by suicide, breast and gynaecological cancers, and circulatory diseases. Increased risks in people from Central and Eastern Europe can also be found. On the contrary, decreased risks for people with Southern European and Middle Eastern origins are found for all-cause, suicide, and breast and gynaecological cancer mortality. The few Danish studies are more difficult to compare, with conflicting results arising in the analysis. Finally, results from the one Norwegian study suggest significantly decreased mortality risks among foreign-born, to be explored in further research.
   Conclusions: With new studies being published on mortality differentials between native and foreign-born populations in the Nordic countries, specific risk patterns have begun to arise. Regardless, data from most Nordic countries remains limited, as does the information on specific causes of death. The literature should be expanded in upcoming years to capture associations between country of birth and mortality more clearly.

AB Background: Most previous studies on mortality in violent offenders or victims are based on prison or hospital samples, while this study analyzed overall and cause specific mortality among violent offenders, victims, and individuals who were both offenders and victims in a general sample of 48,834 18-20 year-old men conscripted for military service in 1969/70 in Sweden.
   Methods: Each person completed two non-anonymous questionnaires concerning family, psychological, and behavioral factors. The cohort was followed for 35 years through official registers regarding violent offenses, victimization, and mortality. The impact of violence, victimization, early risk factors and hospitalization for psychiatric diagnosis or alcohol and drug misuse during follow up on mortality was investigated using Cox proportional hazard regression analyses.
   Results: Repeat violent offenses were associated with an eleven fold higher hazard of dying from a substancerelated cause and nearly fourfold higher hazard of dying from suicide. These figures remained significantly elevated also in multivariate analyses, with a 3.03 and 2.39 hazard ratio (HR), respectively. Participants with experience of violence and inpatient care for substance abuse or psychiatric disorder had about a two to threefold higher risk of dying compared to participants with no substance use or psychiatric disorder.
   Conclusions: Violent offending and being victimized are associated with excess mortality and a risk of dying from an alcohol or drug-related cause or suicide. Consequently, prevention of violent behavior might have an effect on overall mortality and suicide rates. Prevention of alcohol and drug use is also warranted.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate what actually happens between physicians and adult patients in difficult end-of-life situations. We circulated an anonymous questionnaire to a randomized sample of 952 Swedish physicians registered in specialties com prising care of dying adult patients, 122 palliative care physicians, and 130 physicians from the Swedish Association for the Study of Pain. Of special interest were themes in conversations between the physicians and the patients, desires expressed by the patients, and actions performed by the physicians that might affect the patients' expected survival. The overall response rate was 79%. Of these, 63% of the randomized physicians, 95% of the palliative care physicians, and 43% of the Association for the Study of Pain physicians had more than occasionally treated dying adult patients during the past year. About half of them had discussed palliative care with all their dying patients, and more than half of the physicians had heard their patients expressing a wish to die. About one-third of all the physicians had given analgesic or other drugs in such doses that some of their patients' deaths were hastened. The same proportion had also been asked for active euthanasia, while 10% had been asked to assist suicide. No case of euthanasia and only a few cases of assisted suicide were reported. By implication, the study suggests that improving patients' awareness of the possibilities to relieve pain, anxiety and dyspnoea during the final days of life is an important way to reduce requests for active euthanasia.

AB We conceptualize social capital as an aggregate factor affecting health production and analyze the effect of community social capital (CSC) externalities on individual mortality risk in Sweden. The study was based on a random sample from the adult Swedish population of approximately 95,000 individuals who were followed up for 4-21 years. Two municipality-level variables - registered election participation rate and registered crime rate - were used to be a proxy for CSC. The impact of CSC on mortality was estimated with an extended Cox model, controlling for the initial health status and a number of individual characteristics. The results indicate that both proxies of CSC were associated with individual risk from all-cause mortality for males older than 65+ (p = 0.013 and p = 0.008) but not for females. A higher election participation rate negatively and significantly associated with the mortality risk from cancer for males (p = 0.007), and may also have exerted protective associations for cardiovascular mortality (p = 0. 134) and deaths due to "suicide" (p = 0. 186) or "other external causes" (p = 0.055). Similar associations were observed for the crime rate variable. The findings were robust to alternative specifications examined in the sensitivity analysis. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Homicide committed by female offenders is an understudied phenomenon. This study examines whether incidence rates of male-perpetrated and female-perpetrated homicide have changed from 1990 to 2010, and investigates similarities and differences between male and female homicide offenders, by examining a dataset comprising all cases of homicide in Sweden (N = 1,570). The results indicate a decline in the incidence of both male-perpetrated and female-perpetrated homicide during the observed period, as well as stable proportions of female offenders. There were also pronounced differences between male and female homicide offenders with adult victims: victims of female offenders were more often male, intimate partners, intoxicated at the time of the offense, and killed by sharp force injuries. Previous violence between victim and offender was also more common in cases with female offenders, and they committed homicide-suicide less often. There were less pronounced differences between male and female homicide offenders with child victims, but female offenders more often used asphyxia and less often had previous convictions. It can be concluded that incidence rates for male-perpetrated and female-perpetrated homicide have decreased in Sweden, and that male and female offenders with child victims are more similar than male and female offenders with adult victims.

TI Immigration, Transition into Adult Life and Social Adversity in Relation
   to Psychological Distress and Suicide Attempts among Young Adults
SO PLOS ONE

   PREVALENCE; TRENDS; DISORDERS; BEHAVIOR; ANXIETY; DEPRESSION
AB Background: The increasing incidence of mental health problems among young people is a major concern in many Western countries. The causal mechanisms underlying these trends are not well established, but factors influenced by current societal changes ought to be implicated. Such factors include immigration and social adversity as well as the timing of taking on adult social roles (e.g. gainful employment, parenthood and own housing tenure). We therefore examined relationships between these factors and the risks of psychological distress as well as suicide attempts in young adults, with a focus on gender differences.
   Methods: We conducted a population-based study including 10,081 individuals aged 18-29, recruited in 2002 and 2006 in Stockholm, Sweden. Data were collected by record linkage and questionnaires.
   Results: Non-European immigrants had an increased risk of distress, and female non-European immigrants had a markedly higher risk of suicide attempts. Both early parenthood (<= 24 years) and not being a parent, being a student and the lack of own housing tenure were associated with distress, but only in women. In both sexes, financial strain was associated with the increased risk of distress and suicide attempts, while unemployment was only associated with distress.
   Conclusions: Immigration from outside Europe and social adversity are associated with mental health problems in young adults, especially females. Postponed transition into adulthood is associated with poor mental health in young women. These factors are influenced by current societal changes, and may have contributed to the increasing incidence of mental health problems among young people in Western countries.

TI Injury mortality in the European Union 1984-1993 - An overview
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE epidemiology; injury; mortality; trends
AB Background: Approximately 190,000 European Union (EU) citizens die annually as a result of an injury. In response, the European Commission identified accidents and injuries as a priority area for action in the field of public health in 1993. In 1984, the World Health Organization (WHO) Health for All targets were set in Europe to reduce unintentional injuries by 25% and reverse the rising trends in suicide by the year 2000. The aim of this study was to examine the trends in mortality due to externally caused physical injuries between 1984 and 1993 in the 15 countries which are currently members of the EU. Methods: Injury mortality data for all countries were obtained from the WHO and national government agencies. Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated for both unintentional and intentional injuries and examined over time. Results: Downward trends in age-standardized injury mortality due to unintentional injuries were identified in most countries. Marked variations were observed between countries, with low rates in the UK, The Netherlands and Sweden and high rates in Finland, Portugal and France. Age-standardized suicide rates decreased in most countries over the study period, with marked variations between countries. In general, countries in northern Europe experienced higher suicide rates than countries in southern Europe. Mortality rates due to homicide and other violent causes were low and relatively stable over the study period. Conclusions: Most countries appear to be on track to meet the WHO targets for unintentional injury mortality and suicide mortality. However, disparities between countries remain, for reasons that are unclear. While mortality data were valuable in describing the epidemiology of fatal injury in Europe, agreement on standardized practices of data collection, coding and analysis would improve the comparability of data between countries.

AB Objective: The primary aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that relapse prevention with continuation electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) plus pharmacotherapy is more effective than pharmacotherapy alone after a course of ECT for depression.
   Methods: A multicenter, nonblinded, randomized controlled trial with 2 parallel groups was performed from 2008 to 2012 in 4 hospitals in Sweden. Patients eligible had unipolar or bipolar depression and had responded to a course of ECT. The patients (n = 56) were randomly assigned (1: 1) to receiving either 29 treatments of continuation ECT with pharmacotherapy or pharmacotherapy alone for 1 year. The pharmacotherapy consisted of antidepressants (98%), lithium (56%), and antipsychotics (30%). The main outcome was relapse of depression within 1 year. Relapse was defined as 20 or more points on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale or inpatient psychiatric care or suicide or suspected suicide. All 56 patients randomized were analyzed according to an intention to treat analysis.
   Results: Sixty-one percent of the patients treated with pharmacotherapy versus 32% of the patients treated with ECT plus pharmacotherapy relapsed within 1 year (P = 0.036). The Cox proportional hazard ratio was 2.32 (1.03-5.22).
   Cognitive function and memory measures were stable for patients without relapse in both groups. One suspected suicide and 3 suicide attempts by intoxication occurred, all in the pharmacotherapy-alone group.
   Conclusions: The post-ECT relapse rates were substantial in both treatment groups with a statistically significant advantage for combined treatment with pharmacotherapy and continuation ECT. Further studies are needed to define indications for continuation ECT, pharmacotherapy, and their combination.

AB Background: The impact of macroeconomic conditions on health has been extensively explored, as well as the relationship between individual unemployment and health. There are, however, few studies taking both aspects into account and even fewer studies looking at the relationship in a life course perspective. In this study the aim was to assess the role of macroeconomic conditions, such as national unemployment level, for the long-term relationship between individual unemployment and functional somatic symptoms (FSS), by analysing data from two longitudinal cohorts representing different periods of unemployment level in Sweden.
   Methods: A difference-in-difference (DiD) analysis was applied, looking at the difference over time between recession and pre-recession periods for unemployed youths (age 21 to 25) on FSS in adulthood. FSS was constructed as an index of ten self-reported items of somatic ill-health. Covariates for socioeconomics, previous health status and social environment were included.
   Results: An association was found in the difference of adult FSS between unemployed and employed youths in the pre-recession and recession periods, remaining in the adjusted model for the pre-recession period. The DiD analysis between unemployed youths showed that men had significantly lower adult FSS during the recession compared to men in the pre-recession time.
   Conclusions: Adulthood FSS showed to be significantly lower among unemployed youths, in particular among men, during recession compared to pre-recession times. Since this is a fairly unexplored research field, more research is needed to explore the role of macroeconomic conditions for various health outcomes, long-term implications and gender differences.

AB Objective Based on the increased prescription of antidepressants, the aim of this study was to analyse the changes in self-poisonings with antidepressants during the period 1987-1997. Methods:. A total of 909 patients who were admitted to hospital after deliberate self-poisoning were investigated regarding psychiatric diagnoses and drugs ingested. Results In the whole group, there was no significant change in the rate of antidepressant overdoses between 1987 and 1990 (20%) and 1995 and 1997 (17 %), but among females with a mood disorder overdoses decreased from 43% to 22% (p=0.01). The proportion of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in self-poisonings was significantly lower than expected from sales figures.<LF>Conclusion The increased antidepressant sales have not caused an increased use of antidepressants in self-poisonings. It is, therefore, tempting to assume that an increased use of antidepressants for appropriate indications causes decreased self-poisoning rates.

AB This study analyzes accidental fatalities caused by electricity-at work and during leisure time-to evaluate risk factors, the role of alcohol, and to identify possible preventive strategies. In Sweden, data on fatalities by electrocution from 1975 through 2000 were collected from the National Cause-of-Death Register. Additional cases were found in the archives of The Swedish National Electrical Safety Board. Suicides and deaths by lightning were excluded. Two hundred and eighty-five deaths were found, including occupational (n=132), leisure time (n=151), and unknown (n=2). Most deaths were caused by aerial power lines, and the most common place for an electrical injury was a railway area or residential property. Postmortem blood from 20% (n=47) of the tested cases was found positive for alcohol, and these persons were killed mainly during leisure time. During the study period, the overall incidence of electricity-related fatalities has decreased, in spite of increased use of electricity. This indicates that safety improvements have been successful.

AB Within a two-year period between 2009 and 2010, the Forensic Medicine Division of the Health Sciences Authority conducted a total of 3560 autopsies on cases reported to the coroner. This retrospective study reviews the type and distribution of these cases, and serves as a pilot study for future analysis of the various subgroups. Nearly half of these deaths (48.93%) are a result of natural disease processes, of which a cardiac cause by far predominates (64.64%), followed by diseases of the respiratory (16.92%) and central nervous (5.28%) systems. Of the deaths by unnatural means (51.07%), a substantial number of these deaths are consequent to fall from height, i.e. off a building (35.86%), with a smaller proportion of death arising from traffic and industrial accidents (17.60%), asphyxia (14.25%) and short distance falls (11.00%). Fall from height is the leading mode of suicide in this densely populated urban city where 85% of the population reside in high-rise apartments.

AB Objectives: The Survey of Living Condition in the Arctic (SLiCA) is an international research project on health and living conditions among Arctic indigenous peoples. The main objective of this article is to examine the prevalence of self-reported suicide thoughts among the study population in Alaska, Greenland, Sweden and Norway.
   Study design: Population-based survey.
   Methods: Indigenous participants aged 16 years (15 years in Greenland) and older living in traditional settlement regions in Alaska, Sweden and Norway and across the entire Greenland were invited to participate. Data were collected in three periods: in Alaska from January 2002 to February 2003, in Greenland from December 2003 to August 2006, in Sweden from spring 2004 to 2006 and in Norway in 2003 and from June 2006 to June 2008. The principal method in SLiCA was standardised face-to-face interviews using a questionnaire. A questionnaire had among other things, questions about health, education, traditional activities, ethnicity and suicidal thoughts.
   Results: Information about suicidal thoughts, gender and age were available in 2,099 participants between the ages of 16 and 84 from Alaska, Greenland, Sweden and Norway. Greenland had the highest rates of suicidal thoughts when adjusting for age and gender (p = 0.003). When stratifying on age and gender, significant differences across countries were only found for females in the two youngest age groups. Differences in suicidal thoughts across countries could partly be explained by educational level.
   Conclusion: Swedish respondents had less suicidal thoughts than those in any other countries. In the future, analyses of suicidal thoughts should take socioeconomic status into account as well as self-reported health, depression and anxiety.

AB Background: Previous studies have shown that birth order is an important predictor of later life health as well as socioeconomic attainment. In this study, we examine the relationship between birth order and hospitalization for alcohol and narcotics use in Sweden.
   Methods: We study the relationship between birth order and hospitalization related to alcohol and narcotics use before and after the age of 20 using Swedish register data for cohorts born 1987-1994. We apply Cox proportional hazard models and use sibling fixed effects, eliminating confounding by factors shared by the siblings.
   Results: Before age 20 we find that later born siblings are hospitalized for alcohol use at a higher rate than first-borns, and there is a monotonic increase in the hazard of hospitalization with increasing birth order. Second-borns are hospitalized at a rate 47% higher than first-borns, and third-borns at a rate 65% higher. Similar patterns are observed for hospitalization for narcotics use. After age 20 the pattern is similar, but the association is weaker. These patterns are consistent across various sibling group sizes.
   Conclusions: Later born siblings are more likely to be hospitalized for both alcohol and narcotics use in Sweden. These birth order effects are substantial in size, and larger than the estimated sex differences for the risk of hospitalization related to alcohol and drug use before age 20, and previous estimates for socioeconomic status differences in alcohol and drug abuse.

AB Objective: To measure socio-economic differences in intentional injuries among Swedish adolescents.
   Method: A cross-sectional study, based on linkage of records from national registers, considering injuries incurred by all adolescents domiciled in Sweden in 1990-94. Absolute and relative differences between adolescents from four household socio-economic groups (SEGs) were measured, considering separately males and females, two age categories (10-14 and 15-19 years) and injuries caused by interpersonal violence and self-inflicted injuries.
   Results: Absolute differences (in injury incidence) between SEGs were greatest for self-inflicted injuries, among older female adolescents. There were clear social gradients in all instances, but relative differences (relative risks) reached a peak for interpersonal violence among younger adolescents, for both boys and girls.
   Conclusion: There is a clear association among Swedish adolescents between type of intentional injury and gender, with absolute differences remarkably wide for self-inflicted injuries. For a given age category, gender-specific social gradients are quite comparable within diagnosis.

AB Although low school performance is related to attempted and completed suicide, its relationship with suicidal thoughts has been less clear. We conducted a population-based study including 10081 individuals aged 18-29 years in Stockholm, Sweden, and found a clear positive gradient in the risk of lifetime suicidal thoughts with decreasing levels of compulsory school leaving grades. This relationship was somewhat attenuated but remained significant in multivariate models accounting for family background, severe adult psychopathology and adult socioeconomic conditions. School failure is associated with an increased risk of experiencing suicidal thoughts and may also increase the tendency of acting upon them.

AB Background: Male and female physicians are at elevated suicide risk. The work environment has become a focus of attention as a possible contributor to this risk. The potential association between work environment and suicidal thoughts has been examined among female physicians in several countries, and significant findings have been reported.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the role of the work environment in relation to suicidal thoughts among male university hospital physicians in 2 European countries.
   Methods: Cross-sectional multivariate analysis was performed to identify significant associations between work-related factors and suicide risk among male physicians from the Health and Organization among University Hospital Physicians in Europe (HOUPE) study. The dependent variable was termed recent suicidal thoughts, which includes having thought about suicide and/or having thought about specific ways to commit suicide within the previous year. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and CIs are reported.
   Results: Of the 456 Swedish (56%) and 241 Italian (39%) male physicians who participated, 12% of the physicians from each country reported affirmatively regarding recent suicidal thoughts. Degrading work experiences were associated with recent suicidal thoughts for the Swedish and Italian physicians (OR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.01-4.5; OR = 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3-8.0, respectively). Role conflict was associated with recent suicidal thoughts among the Swedish physicians (OR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.2). Support at work when difficulties arose appeared to be protective for the Swedish physicians (OR = 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.96). Italian physicians with little control over working conditions had an increased risk of recent suicidal thoughts, whereas confidential discussions about work experiences appeared to be protective (OR = 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9).
   Conclusion: Attention should be paid to the work environment as it relates to suicide risk among male university hospital physicians, particularly to bolstering social support and preventing harassment. (Gend Med. 2011;8:269-279) (C) 2011 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Current methodologies employed in collecting data for suicide research present several limitations. In this article, we describe a novel method and tool to prospectively study suicidal behavior and its related risk and protective factors in different countries. This tool is a web-based database, which will initially be developed and piloted by suicide research groups from Austria, Brazil, Chile, France, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, and the US. The database will develop and integrate research tools key to collaboration, permit exploration of ethical considerations, and provide a universal interface in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, and German that will make it possible to incorporate new groups from different countries to the network. The common database resulting of this cross-national effort will allow researchers to share and compare data across countries in a large sample of patients. Using anonymous electronic records of patients, we will: 1) determine the impact of risk and protective factors (viz. aggression and religious affiliation) in different socio-cultural environments; 2) develop a clinical model of suicidal behavior that integrates the multiple dimensions implicated; 3) try differentiating the effects of biological, environmental, and cultural factors on suicidal behavior, and 4) offer the global psychiatric research community a tool that will standardize assessment across nations, allowing for better generalization.

AB Objectives To explore the extent to which muscular strength in adolescence is associated with all cause and cause specific premature mortality (<55 years).
   Design Prospective cohort study.
   Setting Sweden.
   Participants 1 142 599 Swedish male adolescents aged 16-19 years were followed over a period of 24 years.
   Main outcome measures Baseline examinations included knee extension, handgrip, and elbow flexion strength tests, as well as measures of diastolic and systolic blood pressure and body mass index. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios for mortality according to muscular strength categories (tenths).
   Results During a median follow-up period of 24 years, 26 145 participants died. Suicide was a more frequent cause of death in young adulthood (22.3%) than was cardiovascular diseases (7.8%) or cancer (14.9%). High muscular strength in adolescence, as assessed by knee extension and handgrip tests, was associated with a 20-35% lower risk of premature mortality due to any cause or cardiovascular disease, independently of body mass index or blood pressure; no association was observed with mortality due to cancer. Stronger adolescents had a 20-30% lower risk of death from suicide and were 15-65% less likely to have any psychiatric diagnosis (such as schizophrenia and mood disorders). Adolescents in the lowest tenth of muscular strength showed by far the highest risk of mortality for different causes. All cause mortality rates (per 100 000 person years) ranged between 122.3 and 86.9 for the weakest and strongest adolescents; corresponding figures were 9.5 and 5.6 for mortality due to cardiovascular diseases and 24.6 and 16.9 for mortality due to suicide.
   Conclusions Low muscular strength in adolescents is an emerging risk factor for major causes of death in young adulthood, such as suicide and cardiovascular diseases. The effect size observed for all cause mortality was equivalent to that for well established risk factors such as elevated body mass index or blood pressure.

AB The detrimental effects of substance abuse on the individual and on society are well known. Health care resources must target where they are most needed This study investigated (1) whether the increased risk of being hospitalized for alcohol abuse and drug abuse among certain immigrant groups is present in the next generation and (2) whether having one parent born in the host country (i.e., Sweden) has a protective effect on the risk of being hospitalized for alcohol abuse and drug abuse among second-generation immigrants. In total, 2,243,546 persons aged 20-39 years were followed from I January 1992 until 31 December 1999 for first hospital admission due to alcohol abuse or drug abuse. A Cox regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios for each diagnosis group. When the Swedish majority population was used as reference, the highest risks of alcohol abuse and drug abuse were found among first- and second-generation Finns, after adjustment for income. Among second-generation Finns with one parent born in Sweden, the increased risk of being hospitalized for alcohol abuse and drug abuse was lower than among second-generation Finns with both parents born in Finland. Health care resources need to target certain groups of first- and second-gene ration immigrants.

DE health; inequality; mortality; homicide; suicide
ID INCOME INEQUALITY; POPULATION HEALTH; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; DETERMINANT;
   TRENDS
AB We investigate whether changes in economic inequality affect mortality in rich countries. To answer this question we use a new source of data on income inequality: tax data on the share of pretax income going to the richest 10% of the population in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US between 1903 and 2003. Although this measure is not a good proxy for inequality within the bottom half of the income distribution, it is a good proxy for changes in the top half of the distribution and for the Gini coefficient. In the absence of country and year fixed effects, the income share of the top decile is negatively related to life expectancy and positively related to infant mortality. However, in our preferred fixed-effects specification these relationships are weak, statistically insignificant, and likely to change their sign. Nor do our data suggest that changes in the income share of the richest 10% affect homicide or suicide rates. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The incidence of disability pension (DP) is high in several European countries. However, knowledge on associations of cause-specific DP and premature death is limited. The aims were to: 1) investigate the association between cause-specific DP and all-cause and cause-specific mortality among women and men and 2) examine period effects of this association.
   Methods: Three prospective population-based cohort studies were conducted, the first including all individuals aged 16-64 years who lived in Sweden all of 1995 and who were not on DP before 1995 (N = 5 006 523, 48.8% women). Those granted DP in 1995 were compared to those not granted DP regarding mortality during 1996-2009. Two other cohorts were created in a similar fashion, for 2000 and 2005, respectively, and in comparisons each of the three cohorts were followed up for four years with regard to all-cause mortality as well as death due to cancer, circulatory disorders, or suicide. All analyses were stratified by sex and we controlled for a number of socio-demographic factors and inpatient care.
   Results: Individuals with granted DP had a higher mortality risk, women (HR 1.75; 95% CI 1.68-1.82) and men (HR 1.66; 95% CI 1.61-1.71) and highest for cancer. People on DP with some diagnoses had higher risk of premature death in other causes of death than their DP diagnoses. All-cause mortality risk varied with DP-diagnosis and was lowest for musculoskeletal diagnoses. The mortality HR decreased among women with DP between the cohort 1995, HR 2.07 (1.92-2.24) and the cohort 2005, 1.84 (1.71-1.99). Here, temporal decreases in mortality risk occurred particularly in DP due to mental diagnoses and cancer.
   Conclusions: All DP diagnoses were associated with a higher mortality risk. Even individuals granted DP due to diagnoses with low mortality risk displayed a higher risk for premature death. This warrants close monitoring of disability pensioners and further studies on consequences of being on disability pension.

AB Purpose: This study assessed self-reported pain in the oldest old and examined its changes over time and in relation to other measures of health and functioning. Design and Methods: A population-based sample of the oldest old (86-92 years of age) residing in Sweden who were participating in a multiwave longitudinal investigation were interviewed about their experience of pain, as well as other dimensions of health and functioning. Results: Prevalence of pain at baseline was 34% and rose to 40% at follow-up. Incidence of new pain cases during that period was 16 percent. Pain was significantly related to sleep difficulties, medication usage, global subjective health, depressive symptoms, and mobility, though the magnitude of the associations was relatively small. Implications: Our results extend previous cross-sectional findings by demonstrating there is both an increase in the proportion of people reporting pain over time after the age of 85 as well as the possibility of recovery. The modest strength of associations of pain with other areas of functioning suggests adaptation and selectivity among survivors in very late life.

AB Background: Epidemiologic studies indicate that women with cosmetic breast implants have a significantly increased risk of suicide. Our objectives were to examine mortality among Danish women who underwent cosmetic breast implant surgery and to evaluate the baseline prevalence of psychopathological disorders as measured by admission to a psychiatric hospital among women seeking cosmetic surgery.
   Methods: Cohort study of 2761 women who underwent cosmetic breast implant surgery at private clinics of plastic surgery or public hospitals, 7071 women who underwent breast reduction surgery at public hospitals, and 1736 women who attended private clinics for cosmetic surgery other than breast implantation, between 1973 and 1995. Causes of death through 1999 were identified through the Danish Mortality Files. Information on admission to psychiatric hospitals prior to cosmetic surgery was obtained from the Danish Psychiatric Central Register.
   Results: Women with cosmetic breast implants had significantly elevated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for death overall (SMR, 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.7), nonmalignant lung disease (3.4; 95% CI, 1.46.9), and suicide (SMR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.7-5.2). Women who underwent breast reduction exhibited low SMRs for death overall (0.7; 95% CI, 0.7-0.8) and several specific causes, including breast cancer (0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.6), whereas death from suicide was moderately above expectation (SMR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0-2.5). The prevalence of psychiatric admission prior to cosmetic surgery was higher among women who underwent cosmetic breast implant surgery (8.0%; 95% CI, 7.0%-9.0%) than among women who underwent breast reduction (4.7%; 95% CI, 4.2%-5.2%) or other cosmetic procedures (5.5%; 95% CI, 4.5%-6.7%). When compared with all control groups, women with cosmetic implants had an odds ratio for prior psychiatric admission of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.4-2.0).
   Conclusions: Danish women with cosmetic breast implants experienced higher overall mortality compared with women in the general population owing in part to a 3-fold increase in suicide. Women with breast reduction had a low total and cause-specific mortality but a moderate excess risk of suicide. For the first time, to our knowledge, we found evidence of an increased prevalence of mental illness as measured by admission to a psychiatric hospital prior to implant surgery among women receiving cosmetic breast implants. Studies are needed to clarify the underlying reasons for the consistently reported 2- to 3-fold excess of suicide among women with cosmetic breast implants.

   Marginalization in Young Hospitalized Suicide Attempters
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID SICKNESS ABSENCE; RISK-FACTORS; HEALTH; WORK
AB Background
   Individuals with a history of suicide attempt have a high risk for subsequent labour market marginalization. This study aimed at assessing the effect of individual and parental factors on different measures of marginalization.
   Methods
   Prospective cohort study based on register linkage of 5 649 individuals who in 1994 were 16-30 years old, lived in Sweden and were treated in inpatient care for suicide attempt during 1992-1994. Hazard ratios (HRs) for labour market marginalization defined as long-term unemployment (>180 days), sickness absence (>90 days), or disability pension in 19952010 were calculated with Cox regression.
   Results
   Medical risk factors, particularly any earlier diagnosed specific mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia: HR 5.4 (95% CI: 4.2, 7.0), personality disorders: HR 3.9, 95% CI: 3.1, 4.9), repetitive suicide attempts (HR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.4, 1.9) were associated with a higher relative risk of disability pension. Individual medical factors were of smaller importance for long-term sickness absence, and of only marginal relevance to long-term unemployment. Country of birth outside Europe had an opposite effect on disability pension (HR 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4, 0.8) and long-term unemployment (HR 1.5, 95% CI: 1.3, 1.8). Female sex was positively correlated with long-term sickness absence (HR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.4, 1.7), and negatively associated with long-term unemployment (HR: 0.8, 95% CI: 0.7, 0.9).
   Conclusions
   As compared to disability pension, long-term sickness absence and unemployment was more strongly related to socio-economic variables. Marginalization pathways seemed to vary with migration status and sex. These findings may contribute to the development of intervention strategies which take the individual risk for marginalization into account.

AB Socioeconomic differences appear to be reflected in both, the development and the treatment of common mental disorders (CMDs, i.e. depressive, anxiety and stress-related disorders). Underlying mechanisms of these inequalities are to date not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate if (1) there are socioeconomic differences with regard to type of treatment and (2) if the socioeconomic status modifies the association between treatment and subsequent inpatient care or suicide attempt, respectively, in individuals with CMDs.
   The study population comprised 66,097 individuals aged 18-59 on sick-leave due to a CMD during 2006 in Sweden. Cox regression with a follow-up from 2007 through 2010 estimated crude and multivariate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
   Individuals with sickness absence due to CMDs and a higher educational level were had a lower proportions of specialised health care and combined psychiatric medication than their counterparts with lower education. However, if high educated CMD patients received more combined medication, associations with subsequent mental inpatient care (p < 0.01) and suicide attempt (p < 0.05) were stronger than for their counterparts with low education. Moreover, previous inpatient care due to mental disorders was associated with higher HRs of subsequent suicide attempt in CMD patients with high education (HR 5.88; CI 3.02-11.45) compared to those with low education (1.96; 1.06-3.60).
   Findings suggest that socioeconomic inequalities shape differences in treatment measures and mental health development in individuals with CMDs. These differences might signal discrepancies in treatment per se or reflect morbidity differences requiring different treatment regimens, or may be due to the fact that different diagnoses are given in different educational strata due to differential role of stigma.

AB In 1983 Finland became the second country in the world, after Sweden, to adopt a law prohibiting all kinds of physical punishment towards children, also by parents. The present investigation was carried out in 2011, 28 years after the law was adopted. Changes in exposure to various types of physical punishment towards respondents born between 1931 and 1996 are presented. A representative sample from Western Finland, consisting of 4,609 respondents (2,632 females, 1,977 males) between 15 and 80 years, filled in a paper-and-pencil questionnaire. A number of psychosocial concomitants were measured. The results showed a significant drop in reports of being slapped and beaten with an object among respondents who were born after the law was adopted. The decline in physical punishment was associated with a similar decline in the number of murdered children. Respondents who had been exposed to higher amounts of physical punishment than average scored significantly higher on alcohol abuse, depression, mental health problems, and schizotypal personality. Divorced respondents had been significantly more physically punished than others. Respondents who had attempted suicide during the last 12 months had been exposed to physical punishment during childhood significantly more often than those who had not attempted suicide. Aggr.

AB Background: The stresses and life changes associated with migration may have harmful long-term health effects, especially for mental health. These effects are exceedingly difficult to establish, because migrants are typically a highly selected group.
   Methods: We examined the impact of migration on health using "naturally occurring "historical events. In this article, we use the forced migration of 11% of the Finnish population after WWII as such a natural experiment. We observed the date and cause of death starting from 1 January 1971 and ending in 31 December 2010 for the cohort of 242,075 people. Data were obtained by linking individual-level data from the 1950 and 1970 population censuses and the register of death certificates from 1971 to 2010 (10% random sample). All-cause and cause-specific mortalities were modeled using Poisson regression.
   Results: Models with full adjustment for background variables showed that both all-cause mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01, 1.05), and ischemic heart disease mortality (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.08, 1.15) were higher in the displaced population than in the nondisplaced population. Suicide mortality was lower (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64, 0.92) in displaced than in the general population.
   Conclusions: In our long-term follow-up study, forced migration was associated with increased risk of death due to ischemic heart diseases. In contrast, lower suicide mortality was observed in association with forced migration 25 years or more.

AB For most of the 20th century the sex gap in life expectancy in the industrialized countries has widened in favor of women. By the early 1980s a reversal in the long-term pattern of this differential had occurred in some countries, where it reached a maximum and thereafter followed a declining trend. Of particular interest to the present investigation is the anomalous experience of Japan, where unlike other high-income countries the female advantage in life expectancy has been expanding. We contrast the case of Japan with that of Sweden, where, like many other high-income nations, the sex differential in longevity has been narrowing in recent years. We observe that in Sweden, until the early 1980s, the sex gap in life expectancy (female-male) exceeded that of Japan; but this situation reversed in subsequent periods, when the Swedish differential narrowed and that of Japan widened. A decomposition analysis indicates that these divergent patterns since 1980 have resulted mainly from larger than expected reductions in male mortality in Sweden due to heart disease and from accidents and violence, lung cancer and "other" cancers. In Japan, death rates for men and women from heart disease-which is a leading cause of death-have tended to decline more or less at the same pace since the early 1980s; and with regard to lung cancer, and "other" neoplasms, male death rates in Japan have been rising while those of women have either declined or risen more slowly. Moreover, during the 1990s, male and female suicide rates rose in Japan, but the rates for men went up faster. Altogether, the net effect of these divergent mortality trends for men and women in Japan underlie much of the observed widening of its sex differential in longevity in recent years.

AB Aims: The aim of this study was to estimate whether the risk for total and cause-specific mortality was related to employment status, and whether mortality in different non-employed groups differed during high and low levels of unemployment. Methods: Structured interviews were used from the Swedish Survey of Living Conditions in 1984-89 and 1992-97, including women and men aged 18 to 64, classified as unemployed (n=2,067), retired or on temporary disability pension (n=2,674), economically inactive for other reasons (n=1,373), and employed (n=38,293). Data were linked to death certificates, as registered in the Cause of Death Register. Cox proportional hazards models were performed for the mortality risk up until eight and a half years following the interview. Results: Being unemployed (OR=1.43), retired, or on temporary disability pension (OR=2.28) or being economically inactive for other reasons (OR=1.63) was related to a risk for total mortality, after considering the level of unemployment, sociodemographic factors and longstanding illness. The risk of death due to external causes was excessive among the unemployed and among those retired or on temporary disability pension, and resulted to a large extent from suicide. The interaction between employment status and level of unemployment was not significant. Conclusions: The level of unemployment seems to have no major influence on the mortality risk. Future interventions for the non-employed groups should focus on preventing avoidable mortality, such as injury and suicide.

ID MORTALITY; BEREAVEMENT; POPULATION; RELATIVES; HEALTH; IMPACT
AB Studies have found that sibling loss is associated with an increased risk of death from external causes (i.e. suicides, accidents and homicides). Increased psychiatric health problems following bereavement could underlie such an association. We studied the influence of sibling loss during childhood on psychiatric care in young adulthood, adjusting for psychosocial covariates shared by siblings in childhood. A national cohort born in Sweden in 1973-1982 (N=701,270) was followed prospectively until 2013. Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyse the association between sibling loss during childhood and psychiatric inpatient and outpatient care identified by the Hospital Discharge Register. After adjustment for confounders, the HRs of psychiatric care in men who experienced sibling loss were 1.17 (95% CI 1.07-1.27) while the associations turned non-significant in women after adjustment for family-related psychosocial covariates, HR 1.07 (95% CI 0.99-1.16). An increased risk was found in men bereaved in early childhood (1.22 95% CI 1.07-1.38) and adolescence (1.27 95% CI 1.08-1.48). Among women, loss of a sibling during adolescence was significantly associated with psychiatric care (1.19 95% CI 1.03-1.36). Increased psychiatric health problems following bereavement could underlie the previously found association between sibling loss and mortality from external causes. Family-related psychosocial conditions shared by siblings in childhood may account for the association between sibling death and psychiatric care in adulthood.

AB Studies of diet and health focus increasingly on dietary patterns. Although the traditional Mediterranean diet is perceived as being healthy, there is little information on its possible benefit to young people. We studied whether closer adherence to the traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern was associated with overall and cancer mortality in a cohort of 42 237 young women, aged 30-49 years at enrolment, who were recruited in 1991-2 from the general population in the Uppsala Health Care Region, Sweden, and followed up, almost completely, for about 12 years. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed by a 10-point score incorporating the characteristics of this diet. Among women less than 40 years old at enrolment - whose causes of death are mainly cancer with probable genetic influences, injuries or suicide - there was no association of the Mediterranean diet score with total or cancer mortality. Among women 40-49 years old at enrolment, a 2-point increase in the score was associated with considerable reductions in overall mortality (13 %; 95 % CI 1 %, 23 %; Psimilar to0 center dot 05) and cancer mortality (16 %; 95 % CI -1 %, 29 %; Psimilar to0 center dot 06). Few cardiovascular deaths occurred in this cohort of young women. The findings of the present study in a northern European population of young women indicate that closer adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern reduces mortality even among young persons.

AB Previous studies have shown that parental death influences health and mortality in bereaved offspring. To date, few studies have examined whether exposure to parental bereavement in childhood is associated with suicidality later in life. The aim of the present research was to investigate whether parental death during childhood influences self-inflicted injuries/poisoning in young adulthood. A national cohort born during 1973-1982 (N = 871,402) was followed prospectively in the National Patient Discharge Register from age 18 to 31-40 years. Cox regression analyses of proportional hazards, with adjustment for socio-demographic confounders and parental psychosocial covariates, were used to test hypotheses regarding parental loss and hospital admission due to self-inflicted injuries/poisoning. Parental deaths were divided into deaths caused by (1) external causes/substance abuse and (2) natural causes. Persons who had lost a parent to an external cause/substance abuse-related death had the highest risk of being admitted to a hospital for a self-inflicted injury/poisoning; HRs 2.03 (1.67-2.46) for maternal death and 2.03 (1.84-2.25) for paternal death, after adjustment for socio-demographic confounders and risk factors among surviving parents. Risks were also increased for parental death due to natural causes, but at a lower level: 1.19 (1.01-1.39) and 1.28 (1.15-1.43), respectively. Losing a father before school age was associated with a higher risk of hospital admission for a self-inflicted injury/poisoning than was loss at an older age for both genders. Maternal loss before school age was associated with a higher risk only for men, particularly maternal death by natural causes (p < 0.01).

ID SAFETY
AB Context: The long-term mortality in adults treated with recombinant GH during childhood has been poorly investigated. Recently released data from the French part of the European Union Safety and Appropriateness of GH treatments in Europe (EU SAGhE) study have raised concerns on the long-term safety of GH treatment.
   Objective: To report preliminary data on long-term vital status and causes of death in patients with isolated GH deficiency or idiopathic short stature or born small for gestational age treated with GH during childhood, in Belgium, The Netherlands, and Sweden.
   Design: Data were retrieved from national registries of GH-treated patients and vital status from National Population Registries. Causes of death were retrieved from a National Cause of Death Register (Sweden), Federal and Regional Death Registries (Belgium), or individual patient records (The Netherlands).
   Patients: All patients diagnosed with isolated GH deficiency or idiopathic short stature or born small for gestational age started on recombinant GH during childhood from 1985-1997 and who had attained 18 yr of age by the end of 2010 were included. Vital status was available for approximately 98% of these 2,543 patients, corresponding to 46,556 person-years of observation.
   Main Outcome Measure: Vital status, causes of death, age at death, year of death, duration of GH treatment, and mean GH dose during treatment were assessed.
   Results: Among 21 deaths identified, 12 were due to accidents, four were suicides, and one patient each died from pneumonia, endocrine dysfunction, primary cardiomyopathy, deficiency of humoral immunity, and coagulation defect.
   Conclusions: In these cohorts, the majority of deaths (76%) were caused by accidents or suicides. Importantly, none of the patients died from cancer or from a cardiovascular disease. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 97: E213-E217, 2012)

AB Objectives. To study. prospectively, in young adult patients, the mortality during the first years after the diagnosis of diabetes.
   Design. The Diabetes Incidence Study in Sweden (DISS) aims to register all incident cases aged 15-34 years. During a 10-year period all deaths were identified by record linkage to the national Cause of Death Registry.
   Subjects. During the period, 4097 new cases were registered and classified as type 1 diabetes (73%). type 2 (16%), secondary (2%) and unclassified (9%). The median follow-up was 5 years (21 001 person-years).
   Main outcome measures. Calculation of the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Evaluation of all deceased by scrutiny of clinical records, death certificates and autopsy protocols.
   Results. Fifty-eight patients died, corresponding to an SMR of 3.5 (CI = 2.7-4.5), which increased from 1.5 at 15-19 years to 4.1 at 30-34 years, SMR was 2.7 in primary diabetes: 2.3 (1.6-3.3) in type 1 and 4.1 (2.6-6.7) in type 2. In secondary diabetes, alcohol-associated pancreatitis a common cause, SMR was 32 (CI = 24-45). Evidence of alcohol or drug misuse, mental dysfunction or suicide was found in 40 of all 58 deceased cases. Less often, hypoglycaemia (n = 7) or hyperglycaemia-ketoacidosis (n = 11) was present at death. Unexplained 'dead in bed' was found once.
   Conclusions. In the investigated population-based cohort the early mortality was about threefold increased. Hypoglycaemia and ketoacidosis per se played a relatively small role compared with a heavy impact from social and mental dysfunction, and from careless use of alcohol or drugs.

AB Paediatricians and other professionals in Sweden note that the amount of children with psychiatric and psychosomatic symptoms is growing in number. Suicide attempts among the young (15-24 y) increased by more than 30% from 1998-2003. The Swedish National Board for Health and Welfare's 2004 guidelines for school healthcare shed light on this increasing problem among schoolchildren. An article in this issue of Acta Paediatrica, " Living conditions and psychosomatic complaints in Swedish schoolchildren'', analyses economic stress as a causative factor leading to psychosomatic symptoms such as headache, abdominal pain and difficulty in falling asleep. Living conditions, however, most likely include other factors related to our modern and ever-changing society that also have an impact on the growing child.

AB Purpose: The association between victimisation and adverse health in children is well established but few studies have addressed the effect of victimisation, especially multiple victimisations, in older adolescents and young adults. The aim of this study was to assess self-reported health in young women (15-22 years) victimised to one or more types of violence, compared with non-victimised.aEuro integral Methods: Young women visiting youth health centres in Sweden answered a questionnaire constructed from standardised instruments addressing violence victimisation (emotional, physical, sexual and family violence), socio-demographics, substance use and physical and mental health. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and attributable risk (AR) were assessed.aEuro integral Results: Of 1051 women (73% of eligible women), 25% were lifetime victims of one type of violence and 31% of two or more types of violence. Sexual-minority young women were more victimised than heterosexual women. Violence victimisation increased the risk for adverse health outcomes, especially evident for those multiply victimised. Victims of two or more types of violence had AOR 11.8 (CI 6.9-20.1) for post-traumatic stress symptoms, 6.3 (CI 3.9-10.2) for anxiety symptoms and 10.8 (CI 5.2-22.5) for suicide ideation. The AR of victimisation accounted for 41% of post-traumatic stress symptoms, 30% of anxiety symptoms and 27% of suicide ideation. Stratified analyses showed that lower economic resources did not influence health negatively for non-victimised, whereas it multiplicatively reinforced ill-health when combined with violence victimisation.aEuro integral Conclusion: Violence victimisation, and particularly multiple victimisations, was strongly associated with mental ill-health in young women, especially evident in those with low economic resources.

AB Introduction Sweden has one of the world's lowest child injury mortality rates, but injuries are still the leading cause of death among children. Child injury mortality in the country has been declining, but this decline seems to decrease recently. Our objective was therefore to further examine changes in the mortality of children's death from injury over time and to assess the contribution of various effects on mortality. The underlying hypothesis for this investigation is that the incidence of lethal injuries in children, still is decreasing and that this may be sex specific.
   Patients and methods We studied all deaths from injury in Sweden under-18-year-olds during the 14 years 1999-2012. We identified those aged under 18 whose underlying cause of death was recorded as International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis from V01 to X39 in the Swedish cause of death, where all dead citizens are registered.
   Results From the 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2012, 1213 children under the age of 18 died of injuries in Sweden. The incidence declined during this period (r = -0.606, p = 0.02) to 3.3 deaths/100,000 children-years (95 % CI 2.6-4.2). Death from unintentional injury was more common than that after intentional injury (p < 0.0001). There was a reduction in the incidence of unintentional injuries during the study period (r = -0.757, p = 0.03). The most common causes of death were injury to the brain (n = 337, 41 %), followed by drowning (n = 109, 13 %). The number of deaths after intentional injury increased (r = 0.585, p = 0.03) and at the end of the period was 1.5 deaths/100,000 children-years. The most common causes of death after intentional injuries were asphyxia (n = 177, 45 %), followed by injury to the brain (n = 76, 19 %).
   Discussion Mortality patterns in injured children in Sweden have changed from being dominated by unintentional injuries to a more equal distribution between unintentional and intentional injuries as well as between sexes and the overall rate has declined further. These findings are important as they might contribute to the preventive work that is being done to further reduce mortality in injured children.

AB In this retrospective study, we report the epidemiological characteristics of all poisoning deaths in Epirus, Greece, from 1998 to 2010; we present the toxicological findings and the statistical evaluation of the results. This is the first detailed scientific report on all the officially certified poisoning deaths concerning part of the Greek population. A total of 126 poisoning fatalities were recorded, 67 of them being mono-intoxications (53.2%). The cause of poisoning was as follows: drugs of abuse (60%); carbon monoxide (19.8%); pesticides (9.5%); corrosives (4.8%); pharmaceuticals (4.8%); and spider bite (0.8%). The most frequently detected poisonous substances were as follows: heroin (65 cases), ethanol (55), benzodiazepines (42), carbon monoxide (25), cocaine (17), cannabinoids (17) and pesticides (12). Increasing tendency in poisoning death rates was recorded, due to an increase in accidental poisoning deaths attributed mainly to drugs of abuse (total, accidental, and drugs-of-abuse poisoning death rates per 100,000 inhabitants per year were 1.87, 1.19, and 0.79, respectively, in the period 19982002 and 3.97, 3.41, and 2.55, respectively, in the period 20072010).

AB Objectives (1) investigate risk factors associated with repeated deliberate self-harm (DSH) among patients attending the emergency department due to DSH, (2) stratify these patients into risk categories for repeated DSH and (3) estimate the proportion of repeated DSH within 12 months.
   Design A consecutive series of individuals who attended one of Scandinavia's largest emergency departments during 2003-2005 due to DSH. Data on sociodemographic factors, diagnoses and treatment, previous DSH at any healthcare facility in Sweden (2002-2005) and circumstances of the index DSH episode were collected from hospital charts and national databases. A nationwide register based on follow-ups of any new DSH or death by suicide during 2003-2006.
   Main outcome measure Repeated DSH episode or suicide.
   Results 1524 patients were included. The cumulative incidence for patients repeating DSH within 12 months after the index episode was 26.8% (95% CI: 24.6 to 29.0). Risk factors associated with repeating DSH included previous DSH, female gender, self-injury as a method for DSH and if the self-injury required a surgical procedure, current psychiatric or antidepressant treatment and if the patient suffered from a substance use disorder or adult personality disorder or did not have children under the age of six.
   Conclusion Patients attending an emergency department due to DSH have a high risk of repeating their self-harm behaviour. We present a model for risk stratification for repeated DSH describing low-risk (18%), median-risk (28% to 32%) and high-risk (47% to 72%). Our results might help caretakers to direct optimal resources to these groups.

AB Background People with schizophrenia and related disorders are at an increased risk of adverse outcomes, including conviction of a violent offence, suicide, and premature mortality. However, the rates of, and risk factors for, these outcomes need clarification as a basis for population-based and targeted interventions. We aimed to determine rates and risk factors for these outcomes, and investigate to what extent they are shared across outcomes and are specific to schizophrenia and related disorders.
   Methods We undertook a total population cohort study in Sweden of 24 297 patients with schizophrenia and related disorders between January, 1972 and December, 2009. Patients were matched by age and sex to people from the general population (n=485 940) and also to unaffected sibling controls (n=26 357). First, we investigated rates of conviction of a violent offence, suicide, and premature mortality, with follow-up until conviction of a violent offence, emigration, death, or end of follow-up (Dec 31, 2009), whichever occurred first. Second, we analysed associations between these adverse outcomes and sociodemographic, individual, familial, and distal risk factors, for men and women separately, with Cox proportional hazards models. Finally, we assessed time trends in adverse outcomes between 1972 and 2009, for which we compared patients with unaffected siblings, and analysed associations with changes in the number of nights spent in inpatient beds in psychiatric facilities nationwide.
   Findings Within 5 years of their initial diagnosis, 13.9% of men and 4.7% of women with schizophrenia and related disorders had a major adverse outcome (10.7% of men and 2.7% of women were convicted of a violent offence, and 3.3% of men and 2.0% of women died prematurely of any cause). During the study, the adjusted odds ratio of any adverse outcomes for patients compared with general population controls was 7.5 (95% CI 7.2-7.9) in men and 11.1 (10.2-12.1) in women. Three risk factors that were present before diagnosis were predictive of any adverse outcome: drug use disorders, criminality, and self-harm, which were also risk factors for these outcomes in unaffected siblings and in the general population. Over the period 1973-2009, the odds of these outcomes increased in patients with schizophrenia and related disorders compared with unaffected siblings.
   Interpretation Schizophrenia and related disorders are associated with substantially increased rates of violent crime, suicide, and premature mortality. Risk factors for these three outcomes included both those specific to individuals with schizophrenia and related disorders, and those shared with the general population. Therefore, a combination of population-based and targeted strategies might be necessary to reduce the substantial rates of adverse outcomes in patients with schizophrenia and related disorders.

AB Background. Higher rates of suicidal behaviour have been reported among staff in mental health care than in the general population. However, no studies of these two groups have been carried out simultaneously, using the same methods. This study aims to investigate whether they differ in terms of age- and sex-standardized prevalence of suicidal behaviour.
   Methods. Identical questions about suicidal behaviour were addressed in the same year to a random sample of the general population and to mental health-care staff in Stockholm. Life weariness among the latter was also investigated.
   Results. Age- and sex-standardized past year prevalences of suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts were found to be similar among mental health-care staff and the general population. Lifetime prevalence of both suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts was significantly higher among mental health-care staff than among the general population. Psychologists/social workers have a higher probability of: lifetime thoughts of life is not worth living; death wishes; and, suicidal thoughts, than nurses/assistant nurses.
   Conclusions. Reports on lifetime prevalence of suicidal behaviour may be biased in populations that are not reminded of these problems in everyday life. Data on past year prevalence of suicidal behaviour show clearly the similarity between the general population and the mental health-care staff.

AB Objective: This study investigated the effects of manual-based Phenomenological Art Therapy for individuals living with depression in addition to treatment as usual (PATd/TAU) compared with only treatment as usual (TAU) for individuals diagnosed with moderate to severe depression. Method: 79 adults (men = 29.1%) were included in this randomized-controlled-trial (RCT), multicenter study in Sweden with an intention-to-treat design. Participants were randomized into either the PATd/TAU-group (n = 43) or TAU-group (n = 36). Data were collected at baseline and at end of treatment. The main outcomes were depression levels and self-esteem. Secondary outcomes were suicide ideation and sickness absence. Results: The PATd/TAU-group showed a significant decrease of depression levels. The PATd/TAU-group returned to work to a higher degree than the TAU-group. Self-esteem significantly improved in both groups. Suicide ideation was unaffected. Conclusion and Implications for Practice: Manual-based PATd works as expected, being an effective treatment, and contributes to recovery for individuals with moderate to severe depression. This outcome needs to be confirmed and its long-term effects examined in further studies.

AB Objectives To analyze whether hospitalization for a psychiatric disorder predicts Parkinson's disease (PD) in men and women in different age groups after accounting for socioeconomic status and geographical region. Methods Data from the MigMed database were used to identify all people in Sweden hospitalized for psychiatric disorder and PD during the study period (1987 to 2001). Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for PD were calculated among those with and without hospitalization for psychiatric disorder. Results There were 1876 cases of PD among those with psychiatric disorder during the study period. The risk of developing PD was strongest among those under age 50; the SIR was 11.56 (95% CI 9.15-14.41). The risk was attenuated with increasing age in both men and women. There were similar risk patterns in all subtypes of psychiatric disorders in PD patients. The overall risk of PD among people with psychiatric disorders was higher for women than men. Conclusions A psychiatric disorder is an appreciable risk factor for the development of PD, particularly in people under age 50. The association between PD and psychiatric disorders should be taken into account by clinicians and health care providers.

AB It is recognized that the majority of intimate partner homicide (IPH) victims are female; simultaneously, when females do commit homicide, they are more likely to perpetrate against an intimate partner. To date, there are only a few studies that discuss IPH across gender, leading to a gap of knowledge with regard to gender aspects of perpetration. The present nationwide study has a retrospective design, based on registries of all female (n = 9) and stratified male (n = 36) IPH committed in Sweden between 2007 and 2009. Our study suggests that female perpetrators are more likely to be unemployed, to have suffered from a substance abuse disorder at some point in life and to have been victimized by the victim. In other words, scrutiny of these characteristics reveals that females who commit partner-related homicides are qualitatively and clinically different from their male counterparts. Furthermore, the prevailing feature of intoxication in connection to the crime, both in male and female perpetrators, indicates that perpetrators might benefit from elements of substance abuse treatment in interventions targeting partner violence.

AB Objectives Analyse mortality differences between self-employed and paid employees with a focus on industrial sector, educational level and gender using Swedish register data.
   Methods A cohort of the total working population (4776135 individuals; 7.2% self-employed; 18-100years of age at baseline 2003) in Sweden with a 5-year follow-up (2004-2008) for all-cause and cause-specific mortality (57743 deaths). Self-employed individuals were categorised as sole proprietors or limited liability company (LLC) owners according to their enterprise's legal form. Cox proportional hazards models were applied to compare mortality rates between sole proprietors, LLC owners and paid employees, adjusted for sociodemographic confounders.
   Results Mortality from cardiovascular diseases was 16% lower and from suicide 26% lower among LLC owners than among paid employees, adjusted for confounders. Within the industrial category, all-cause mortality was 13-15% lower among sole proprietors and LLC owners compared with employees in manufacturing and mining (MM) as well as personal and cultural services (PCS), and 11-20% higher in sole proprietors in trade, transport and communication and the welfare industry (W). A significant three-way interaction indicated 17-23% lower all-cause mortality among male LLC owners in MM and female sole proprietors in PCS, and 50% higher mortality in female sole proprietors in W than in employees in the same industries.
   Conclusions Mortality differences between self-employed individuals and paid employees vary by the legal form of self-employment, across industries, and by gender. Differences in work environment exposures and working conditions, varying market competition across industries and gender segregation in the labour market are potential mechanisms underlying these findings.

AB Background: Polysubstance use is common in substance users, and may complicate their clinical course. This study, in a criminal justice setting in Sweden, examines the association between the number of concurrently used substance types and psychiatric symptoms during 30 days before incarceration, while controlling for background variables such as family history (drug and alcohol problems, psychiatric problems, criminality), demographic data and history of emotional, physical or sexual abuse.
   Methods: The data material comprised 5659 criminal justice clients reporting a substance use problem, examined with the Addiction Severity Index. Variables were compared in a multinomial regression analysis, comparing clients reporting one (n = 1877), two (n = 1408), three (n = 956), four (n = 443) and five or more (it = 167) substance types.
   Results: The 30-day prevalence of most psychiatric symptoms included in the study (depression, anxiety, cognitive problems, hallucinations, difficulty controlling violent behaviour, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts) was higher in individuals with a higher number of concurrent substance types used. In multinomial regression analysis, while controlling for background variables, these associations remained for concurrent suicidal ideation, cognitive problems, hallucinations and violent behaviour, with the latter two being associated with the higher numbers of substance types. Binge alcohol drinking, tranquilizers, opioids and the number of substance types reported were associated with several of the psychiatric symptoms.
   Conclusions: In the present criminal justice setting in Sweden, the use of multiple substance types and concurrent psychiatric symptoms appear to be associated, and a sub-group reporting particularly high numbers of concurrent substance types are particularly likely to report potentially severe psychiatric problems.

AB Objective To examine whether women who undergo in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment are at greater risk of postnatal suicide or postnatal depression (PND) requiring psychiatric care, compared with women who conceive spontaneously.
   Design Case-control study using data from national registers.
   Setting Sweden during the period 2003-2009.
   Population Cases were 3532 primiparous women who had given birth following IVF treatment. An aged-matched control group of 8553 mothers was randomly selected from the medical birth register.
   Methods Logistic regression analyses were performed with PND as the outcome, and with known risk factors of PND as well as IVF/spontaneous birth as covariates.
   Main outcome measures Postnatal depression (PND), defined as diagnoses F32-F39 of the tenth edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), within 12 months of childbirth.
   Results Initial analyses showed that PND was more common in the control group than in the IVF group (0.8 versus 0.4%; P = 0.04); however, these differences disappeared when confounding factors were controlled for. A history of any psychiatric illness (P = 0.000; odds ratio, OR = 25.5; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI = 11.7-55.5), any previous affective disorder (P = 0.000; OR = 26.0; 95% CI = 10.5-64.0), or specifically a personality disorder (P = 0.028; OR = 3.8; 95% CI = 1.2-12.7) increased the risk of PND. No woman in either group committed suicide during the first year after childbirth.
   Conclusions Whereas mothers who receive IVF treatment are not at increased risk of PND, the risk is increased among mothers with a history of mental illness.

AB Objectives: To update the incidence rate, aetiology and injury characteristics of acutely-injured adults with traumatic spinal cord injury in Stockholm, Sweden, using international standards of reporting.
   Study design: Prospective, (regional) population-based observation.
   Subjects: Forty-nine consecutively enrolled individuals.
   Methods: A surveillance system of newly-injured adults with traumatic spinal cord injury was implemented for an 18-month period. The International Spinal Cord Injury Core Data Set was used to collect data on those who survived the first 7 days post-injury.
   Results: After an 18-month period, 49 incident cases were registered, of whom 45 were included in this study. The crude incidence rate was 19.0 per million, consisting mainly of men (60%), and the mean age of the cohort was 55 years (median 58). Causes of injury were almost exclusively limited to falls and transport-related events, accounting for 58% and 40% of cases, respectively. The incidence has remained stable when compared with the previous study; however, significant differences exist for injury aetiology (p = 0.004) and impairment level (p = 0.01) in that more fall- and transport-related spinal cord injury occurred, and a larger proportion of persons was left with resultant tetraplegia, in the current study, compared with more sport-related injuries and those left with paraplegia in the previous study.
   Conclusion: The incidence rate appeared to remain stable in Stockholm, Sweden. However, significant changes in injury aetiology and impairment-level post injury were found, compared with the previous study. There remains a need for developing fall- related prevention strategies in rehabilitation settings as well as in population-based programmes.

AB In view of recent reports showing that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of monoamine metabolites exhibit season of birth variations, and that they are also associated with section II (impulse action patterns) of the diagnostic interview for borderline patients (DIB), we analyzed two samples of data to investigate the relationship between the season of birth and the DIB. The first sample comprised 202 patients participating in psychobiological research in Stockholm, and the second sample comprised 130 patients who had committed suicide in Vasterbotten in northern Sweden. Those with intermediate score for section II (impulse action patterns) were significantly more likely to have been born during the season October to January in the pooled data, and this tendency persisted in separate analyses for the two samples and for the two diagnostic groups mood disorders and schizophrenia, respectively. Those with high score for section IV (psychosis) were significantly more likely to have been born during February to April in the pooled sample and in the nonschizophrenic group. In the group with schizophrenia, those born during February to April had significantly high scores for section III (affects). These results throw further light on the role of season of birth in suicidology and in psychiatric morbidity. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB The protective role of positive beliefs and expectations against suicide has been studied using the Reasons For Living inventory (RFL). The RFL has shown to be useful in research and suggested for use in clinical practice. A Swedish translation of the RFL was examined for psychometric properties, reliability, latent structure and convergent validity in a Swedish general population. The RFL was distributed with the Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire (SBQ) to 1366 randomly selected subjects aged 20-65 years in the county of Ostergotland. The results were based on 506 complete replies. The Cronbach alpha of the total RFL was 0.92, ranging from 0.72 to 0.93 in the six scales of RFL. The intercorrelations between the scales were weak and the scale to total RFL score moderate to high. The factor structure and item loadings of the inventory showed great similarities with the American one with exception for the scales Responsibility to Family and Child-related Concerns, which formed one common factor. The convergent validity was supported by significant relationships to the items of the SBQ. It is concluded that the Swedish translation of the RFL inventory in a Swedish general sample possesses great similarities to the American original RFL. Thus, it is suggested as an instrument for research and clinical usage in Sweden.

AB IMPORTANCE Individuals who self-harm may have an increased risk of aggression toward others, but this association has been insufficiently investigated. More conclusive evidence may affect assessment, treatment interventions, and clinical guidelines.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between nonfatal self-harm and violent crime.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based longitudinal cohort study, conducted from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2013, studied all Swedish citizens born between 1982 and 1998 who were 15 years and older (N = 1 850 252). Individuals who emigrated from Sweden before the age of 15 years (n = 104 051) or immigrated to Sweden after the age of 13 years (ie, <2 years before the beginning of the follow-up; n = 22 009) were excluded. Data analysis was performed from April 21, 2016, to June 4, 2016.
   EXPOSURES Receipt of self-harm-associated clinical care.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Conviction of a violent crime according to the Swedish penal code.
   RESULTS The study cohort consisted of 1 850 525 individuals (950 382 males and 900 143 females), and the mean (SD) follow-up time was 8.1 (4.7) years (range, 0-17.0 years; minimum age, 15 years; maximum age, 32 years). During a mean follow-up period of 8.1 years, 55 185 individuals (3.0%) received clinical care for self-harm. The crude hazard ratio was 4.9 (95% CI, 4.8-5.0) for violent crime conviction in exposed individuals compared with the unexposed group. Women who self-harm were at particularly high risk for expressing violent behaviors. After adjustment for relevant psychiatric comorbidities and socioeconomic status, an almost doubled hazard of violent offense remained (hazard ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.8-1.9).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Self-harm is associated with an increased risk of conviction for a violent offense in both sexes. The risk of violence, as well as the risk of suicide and self-harm, should be assessed among offending and self-harming individuals.

AB Objective: To examine the indications for prescribing antidepressants and the clinical outcome when they are prescribed for the treatment of depression, and compare tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in these respects.
   Method: A naturalistic study of a prospective prescription monitoring database and medical records.
   Results: Depression was the indication for 23% of the tricyclic treatments and for 82% of the SSRI treatments. A successful treatment of the depression was found in 20% of the TCA cases and 41% of the SSRI cases (NS).
   Conclusion: This study provides evidence that the main use of SSRIs in 1995 is the treatment of depression. The study implies that SSRIs have a more favourable outcome in 'real life' than TCAs.

AB Postpartum depression has been described as a thief that steals motherhood. It can result in tragedy and sometimes in headline-gripping maternal suicide or infanticide. Because one of the highest priorities for nursing is to continually advance the knowledge the underlies nursing practice, it is essential that we understand what nurse researchers have done to advance the knowledge base of postpartum depression. This integrative review is a two-part series for MCN that summarizes 141 postpartum depression studies conducted by nurse researchers from around the globe, including United States, Australia, Canada, China (Hong Kong, Taiwan), Finland, Iceland Sweden, Turkey, and Malaysia. Specific areas of postpartum depression to which nurse researchers have devoted their primary attention include epidemiology, risk factors, transcultural perspectives, instrument development, screening, interventions and mother-infant interactions.

TI Psychiatric Disorders and Montelukast in Children: A Disproportionality
   Analysis of the VigiBase®
SO DRUG SAFETY
LA English
DT Article
ID CLINICAL-TRIALS; FOLLOW-UP; ASTHMA; SUICIDE; RISK
AB Introduction In 2008, the US FDA issued an alert about an increased risk of psychiatric events associated with montelukast. Recent national pharmacovigilance analyses in Sweden, France and Spain detected a potential increase in reporting risk of the association.
   Aim Our objective was to analyse spontaneous reports of psychiatric events in children and adolescents worldwide treated with montelukast.
   Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) recorded up to 1 January 2015 in the World Health Organization (WHO) database (VigiBase (R)), in which montelukast was associated with 'psychiatric disorders'. We used the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) approach for signal generation.
   Results A total of 14,670 ICSRs for montelukast were recorded, of which 2630 corresponded to psychiatric disorders in people aged <18 years. The main symptoms reported for infants (aged<2 years) were sleep disorders, for children (aged 2-11 years) the main symptoms were depression/anxiety, and for adolescents (aged 12-17 years) they were suicidal behaviour and depression/anxiety. Suicidal behaviour was over-represented in all age groups with information component (IC) values that reached 5.01 in children and 3.85 in adolescents. Unexpectedly, completed suicides were reported more frequently for children (IC: 3.15; IC025: 1.98) than for adolescents (IC: 3.11; IC025: 2.61) or the total population (IC 1.95; IC025: 1.73).
   Conclusions Neuropsychiatric disorders as side effects of montelukast were more frequently reported for children than for adults. Infants and children seem to be more prone to sleep disturbances, whereas adolescents present symptoms of depression/anxiety and psychotic reactions more often. Suicidal behaviour and completed suicide appear to be more frequently reported than previously thought in practice. Risk management plans and epidemiological studies are needed to quantify the risk. Practitioners should be aware of the risk of neuropsychiatric events associated with montelukast use, and should advise the patient and report new cases.

AB Background: Overdose (OD) is a common cause of death in opioid users. Also, many current opioid users report a history of non-fatal OD. The present study aimed to identify factors associated with a history of non-fatal OD.
   Methods: A sample of 7085 Swedish criminal justice clients with alcohol or drug misuse was assessed, using the Addiction Severity Index. Subjects reporting use of opioids during the 30 days prior to incarceration were included (n = 1113). Relevant variables of misuse pattern, heredity, psychiatric symptoms and previous criminal charges were analysed in a logistic regression model.
   Results: A history of non-fatal OD was reported by 55% (n =604). The estimated contribution to the variance in OD history was 25% for variables describing misuse pattern, compared to 10% for psychiatric symptoms, 8% for heredity, and 8% for previous criminal charges. The final model included the following variables: history of injection drug use (OR 3.28), history of heroin use (OR 2.87), history of suicide attempt (OR 1.92), history of tranquilliser use (OR 1.91), being born in Sweden or other Nordic countries (OR 1.74), difficulty in controlling violent behaviour (OR 1.68). and paternal alcohol problems (OR 1.57).
   Conclusions: Suicide attempts and difficulty in controlling violent behaviour were associated with history of non-fatal OD, independent of variables of misuse pattern. This may indicate a possible association with impulse control disturbances, and may have clinical applications. Country of birth and heredity of alcohol problems also had some influence. As expected, severity of misuse most strongly contributed to history of non-fatal OD. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In today's health care, participation is acknowledged as important. However, there is limited research on how relatives of patients at risk of suicide experience their opportunities to participate in care during periods when their close ones are subject to inpatient care. The aim of this study was to describe the phenomenon of participation, as experienced by relatives of persons who are subject to inpatient psychiatric care due to a risk of suicide. The study was conducted through a reflective lifeworld research (RLR) approach, based on phenomenological philosophy. Eight relatives of patients receiving care from professionals in a psychiatric specialist health care context in Sweden participated in phenomenon-oriented interviews. Data were analysed to elucidate a meaning structure of the phenomenon. The findings show that the phenomenon of participation was more associated with patients' recovery processes than with the caring process, and means "being actively involved in a process in which the person regains the desire to live". The meaning of participation is further described by its meaning constituents: struggling for being able to be present for the person at risk of suicide, being able to share everyday life, and nurturing sources for vitality. These insights into the meaning of participation highlight the importance of allowing supportive relatives to be a part of the patient's life, while the person is cared for in an inpatient hospital setting. Thus, participation enables relatives to be acknowledged as resourceful human beings in the patient's recovery process, and thereby facilitates a sense of being able to manage and share life itself together with the person. This means that mental health nurses need to recognize individual variations of relatives' participation processes, and take on the responsibility of acknowledging relatives' lifeworlds.

AB Background Epilepsy is associated with high rates of premature mortality, but the contribution of psychiatric comorbidity is uncertain. We assessed the prevalence and risks of premature mortality from external causes such as suicide, accidents, and assaults in people with epilepsy with and without psychiatric comorbidity.
   Methods We studied all individuals born in Sweden between 1954 and 2009 with inpatient and outpatient diagnoses of epilepsy (n=69 995) for risks and causes of premature mortality. Patients were compared with age-matched and sex-matched general population controls (n=660 869) and unaffected siblings (n=81 396). Sensitivity analyses were done to investigate whether these odds differed by sex, age, seizure types, comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, and different time periods after epilepsy diagnosis.
   Findings 6155 (8.8%) people with epilepsy died during follow-up, at a median age of 34.5 (IQR 21.0-44.0) years with substantially elevated odds of premature mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] of 11.1 [95% CI 10.6-11.6] compared with general population controls, and 11.4 [10.4-12.5] compared with unaffected siblings). Of those deaths, 15.8% (n=972) were from external causes, with high odds for non-vehicle accidents (aOR 5.5, 95 % CI 4.7-6.5) and suicide (3.7, 3.3-4.2). Of those who died from external causes, 75.2% had comorbid psychiatric disorders, with strong associations in individuals with co-occurring depression (13.0, 10.3-16.6) and substance misuse (22.4, 18.3-27.3), compared with patients with no epilepsy and no psychiatric comorbidity.
   Interpretation Reducing premature mortality from external causes of death should be a priority in epilepsy management. Psychiatric comorbidity plays an important part in the premature mortality seen in epilepsy. The ability of health services and public health measures to prevent such deaths requires review.

AB OBJECTIVE
   To assess the risk of psychiatric disorders and suicide attempts in children with type 1 diabetes and their healthy siblings.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
   We performed a population-based case-cohort study of individuals born in Sweden between 1973 and 2009. Children with type 1 diabetes (n = 17,122) and their healthy siblings (n = 18,847) were identified and followed until their 18th birthday. Their risk of psychiatric disorders was compared with that of matched control subjects.
   RESULTS
   The risk of psychiatric morbidity in children with type 1 diabetes compared with the general population was tripled within 6 months after the onset of diabetes (hazard ratio [HR] 3.0 [95% CI 2.7-3.4]) and doubled within the total observation period (HR 2.1 [95% CI 2.0-2.2]). An increased risk was noted in suicide attempts (HR 1.7 [95% CI 1.4-2.0]) and in most categories of psychiatric disorders. The risk of psychiatric disorders in probands declined from HR 2.7 (95% CI 2.2-3.3) for those in the cohort born 1973-1986 to 1.9 (95% CI 1.8-2.0) in those born 1997-2009. The risk for any psychiatric disorders among siblings of patients with type 1 diabetes was estimated to be HR 1.1 (95% CI 1.0-1.1), and there was no increased risk in any of the specific category of disorders.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Children with type 1 diabetes are at high risk of psychiatric disorders, which seems to be a consequence of the disease rather than due to a common familial etiology. The results support recommendations on comprehensive mental health surveillance in children with type 1 diabetes, especially in recently diagnosed children.

AB This study examines the relationship between the total amount of accumulated unemployment during the deep Swedish recession of 1992-1996 and mortality in the following 6 years. Nearly 3.4 million Swedish men and women, born between 1931 and 1965 who were gainfully employed at the time of the 1990 census were included. Almost 23% of these individuals were unemployed at some point during the recession. We conduct a prospective cohort study utilizing Cox proportional hazard regression with a mortality follow-up from January 1997 to December 2002. We adjust for health status (1982-1991), baseline (1991) social, family, and employer characteristics of individuals before the recession. The findings suggest that long-term unemployment is related to elevated all-cause mortality for men and women. The excess mortality effects were small for women and attributable to a positive, linear increase in the hazard of alcohol disease-related mortality and external causes-of-death not classified as suicides or transport accidents. For men, the excess hazard of all-cause mortality was best represented by a cubic, non-linear shape. The predicted hazard increases rapidly with the shortest and longest accumulated levels of unemployment. However, the underlying pattern differed by cause-of-death. The cancer, circulatory, and alcohol disease-related analyses suggest that mortality peaks with mid-levels of accumulated unemployment and then declines with longer duration unemployment. For men, we observed a positive, linear increase in the hazard ratios associated with transport and suicide mortality, and a very steep non-linear increase in the excess hazard ratio associated with other external causes of death that were not classified as suicide or transport accidents. In conclusion, mortality risk increases with the duration of unemployment among men and women. This was best described by a cubic function for men and a linear function for women. Behind this pattern, different causes-of-death varied in their relation to the accumulation of unemployment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background Minority sexual orientation is a robust risk indicator for self-reported suicidal ideation and attempts. However, little is known about patterns of medical care for intentional self-harm in this vulnerable population. We investigate sexual orientation-related differences in self-reported lifetime suicide symptoms and medical care for intentional self-harm between 1969 and 2010, including age at initial treatment and recurrence.
   Methods We used data from the Stockholm Public Health Cohort, a population-based sample of 874 lesbians/gays, 841 bisexuals and 67980 heterosexuals, whose self-administered surveys have been linked to nationwide registers. Estimates of risk for medical care were calculated as incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% CIs.
   Results Both suicidal ideation and attempts were more commonly reported by lesbian/gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals. Adjusting for risk-time and confounding, lesbians (IRR 3.8, 95% CI 2.7 to 5.4) and bisexual women (IRR 5.4, 95% CI 4.4 to 6.6) experienced elevated risk for medical care for intentional self-harm, as compared to heterosexual women. Gay men evidenced higher risk (IRR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.4) as compared to heterosexual men. Recurrent medical care was more frequent in LGB individuals, especially in bisexual women and gay men. Lesbian and bisexual women were also younger than heterosexual women when they first received medical care for intentional self-harm.
   Conclusions Positive histories of suicidal ideation, attempts and medical care for intentional self-harm, including higher levels of recurrence, are more prevalent among LGB individuals in contrast to heterosexuals. Lesbian/bisexual women evidence an earlier age of onset of treatment. Tailored prevention efforts are urgently needed.

AB Background: Gambling among adolescents is a growing public health concern in Sweden as in many other countries. Excessive gambling has been found to be associated with a wide range of negative consequences such as financial problems, strained relationships, criminal behaviour, depression, and an elevated risk for suicide. Research suggests a link between alcohol consumption and gambling, particularly among male gamblers. There are nevertheless gaps in the available knowledge pertaining to school-aged students in Sweden. Aim: The purpose of this study is to investigate predictors of gambling and frequent gambling among Swedish students in Grade 9 and Grade 11 (ages 15 and 17 years). Data and method: Data on gambling and alcohol consumption were obtained from the Swedish Council on Information and Other Drugs yearly school surveys (n = 4763) in Grade 9 and Grade 11 (n = 3720). Poisson regression models have been applied to estimate the association between less frequent and frequent gambling with the predictors of gender, family and school satisfaction, school situation, and alcohol and drug use. Results: Gambling among Swedish students is a highly gendered activity: boys gamble more and more frequently than girls. Having consumed alcohol was associated with both less frequent and more frequent gambling among Grade 9 students while controlling for other variables. In Grade 9, heavy episodic drinking was only associated with less frequent gambling, not with frequent gambling. Among Grade 11 students, both alcohol consumption and heavy episodic drinking was associated with less frequent gambling but heavy episodic drinking was only associated with frequent gambling. Moreover, drug use was associated with less frequent gambling in Grade 11. Skipping classes was the only school factor that was found to be associated with less frequent gambling (Grade 11). Such factors as family satisfaction and two measurements of economic situation were not associated with gambling at all.

AB An estimated 800 000 suicide deaths occur worldwide. The global suicide rate is 11.4 per 100 000 population; 15.0/100 000 for males and 8.0/100 000 for females. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds. In a collaborative effort to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental health problems among youth across Europe, the European Union 7(th) Framework funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. SEYLE is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to promote mental health and healthy lifestyles, while preventing psychopathology and suicidal behaviours among adolescents. The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD +/- 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged >= 16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged <= 15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called `invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised risk behaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the `invisible' risk group with those in the high-risk group, similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%), subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%), depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32%, respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-injurious behaviours (D-SIB) was 27.6%, with higher rates reported for occasional D-SIB (19.7%) compared to repetitive D-SIB (7.8%). Suicidal ideation was present in approximately one third of the sample (32.3%). More than four percent (4.2%) of the sample reported attempting suicide during their lifetime, with a significantly higher prevalence among girls (5.1% vs. 3.0%, p<0.05). In comparing the effectiveness of the three active SEYLE interventions, based on three specific preventive strategies directed towards teachers and school staff, professionals and pupils in comparison to a control group, the intervention empowering pupils, called the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) showed significant results in preventing new cases of suicide attempts, severe suicidal ideation with plans and depression. More than a 50% reduction of incident cases of suicide attempts (OR: 0.45 [0.24 - 0.85]; p=0.014), and of incident cases of severe suicidal ideation and plans (OR: 0.50 [0.27 - 0.92]; p=0.025), as well as a significant reduction by 30% of incident cases with moderate to severe depression (OR: 0.71 [0.52- 0.97]; p=0.031) was observed.

AB Due to its rapid economic development, China is facing a huge health, social, and economic burden resulting from injuries. The study's objective was to examine Safe Communities in China as a strategy for injury prevention and safety promotion programmes in the era of rapid economic growth. Literature searches in English and Chinese, which included grey literature, were performed on the Chinese Journal Full-text Search System and Medline, using the words "Safe Community", "injury", "economics", and "prevention". The results showed that the existing 35 recognized members of the International Safe Community Network have not placed due emphasis on suicide prevention, which is one of the leading problems in both rural and urban China. A few groups, such as children, the elderly, cyclists, and pedestrians, have received due emphasis, while other vulnerable groups, such as migrant workers, motorcyclists, students, players, and farmers have not received the necessary attention from the Safe Community perspective. As the evidence describes, Safe Communities in China can be a very effective strategy for injury prevention, but four aspects need to be strengthened in the future: (1) establish and strengthen the policy and regulations in terms of injury prevention at the national level; (2) create a system to involve professional organizations and personnel in projects; (3) consider the economic development status of different parts of China; and (4) intentional injury prevention should receive greater attention.

AB Two hundred and thirty-seven adolescents from a junior high school in a small community outside Goteborg, Sweden, completed the Youth Self Report (YSR) and the Depression Self Rating Scale (DSRS). Self-reported suicidality and biographical data were also recorded. The school doctor and nurse assessed the adolescents' somatic, psychological and behavioural problems using school health-records. The convergent validity of the YSR total problems scale and syndrome scales were tested against the DSRS. Discriminant validity was assessed by the two measures' ability to predict suicidality and school health problems. The Internalising (r = 0.65**) and Anxious/Depressed (r = 0.61**) syndrome scales of the YSR had the highest correlations with the DSRS. However, all YSR syndrome scales were significantly, though more modestly, correlated with the DSRS. Using stepwise logistic regression analysis, four YSR sub-scales [Social Withdrawal, Anxious/Depressed, Attention problems and Delinquency] predicted mild-severe self-reported depression (DSRS scores 12 and above). The YSR syndrome scales Anxious/Depressed and Delinquency predicted suicide ideation whereas the Self-destructive/Identity problem and Social Withdrawal (low scores) scales predicted Suicide attempts. The YSR Anxious/Depressed sub-scale and the DSRS total score seem to measure a similar dimension. However, the Anxious/Depressed and Self-destructive/Identity problem scales were superior in predicting suicidality.

AB Sweden's compulsory addiction system treats individuals with severe alcohol and narcotics use disorders. Merging data from three national level register databases of those sentenced to compulsory care from 2001 to 2009 (n = 4515), the aims of this study were to: (1) compute mortality rates to compare to the general Swedish population; (2) identify leading cause of mortality by alcohol or narcotics use; and (3) identify individual level characteristics associated with mortality among alcohol and narcotics users. In this population, 24% were deceased by 2011. The most common cause of death for alcohol users was physical ailments linked to alcohol use, while narcotics users commonly died of drug poisoning or suicide. Average age of death differed significantly between alcohol users (55.0) and narcotics users (32.5). Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified the same three factors predicting mortality: older age (alcohol users OR = 1.28, narcotic users OR = 1.16), gender [males were nearly 3 times more likely to die among narcotics users (p < .000) acid 1.6 times more likely to die among alcohol users (p < .01)] and reporting serious health problems (for alcohol users p < .000, for narcotics users p < .05). Enhanced program and government efforts are needed to implement overdose-prevention efforts and different treatment modalities for both narcotic and alcohol users. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Immigrants is an important minority in many countries, but little is known how they are self-selected. We analysed differences in psycho-social and health behavioural factors between international migrants and non-migrants prior to migration in a large cohort of Finnish twins. Methods: A questionnaire was sent to Finnish twins in 1975 (response rate 89, N = 26555 twin individuals). Follow-up data on migration and mortality were derived from population registries in Finland and Sweden up to 31 March 2002. In 1998, another questionnaire was sent to Finnish twins migrated to Sweden and their co-twins (response rate 71%, N = 1534 twin individuals). The data were analysed using Cox and conditional logistic regression models. Results: Life dissatisfaction, higher alcohol use and smoking at baseline predicted future migration. In men additionally, unemployment, neuroticism and extroversion increased the probability to migrate. Similar associations were found for alcohol use in men and smoking in men and women within twin pairs discordant for migration. Twins also reported retrospectively that prior to migration the migrated twin had been less satisfied with his/her educational institution or job and was generally less satisfied with life, used more alcohol (men) and smoked more (women) than the co-twin stayed in Finland. Conclusion: Migrants are self-selected by health behavioural and personality factors, which may compromise their health. The special requirements of migrants should be recognized in health care.

AB The objective of the study is to assess the relationships between personality traits, lifetime psychosocial functioning, and crime scene behavior. Thirty-five male offenders referred for forensic psychiatric assessment in Sweden (1996-2001) and assigned a main diagnosis of either antisocial personality disorder (APD) or autism spectrum disorder (AUT) were retrospectively studied. APD were subcategorized into impulsive (APDi) and controlled (APDc). Those in the AUT group were less intoxicated at the time of the crime and did not often use knives or guns compared to the APD group. Males in the APDi group were older and had a higher proportion of abuse of alcohol and drugs in biological parents, physical abuse during childhood, psychiatric contacts, and suicide attempts compared to the APDc group. In the APDi group, knives were used in the homicide compared to the use of guns in the APDc group. The results suggest differences in psychosocial functioning and crime scene characteristics related to personality traits.

AB OBJECTIVE
   To examine associations between gabapentinoids and adverse outcomes related to coordination disturbances (head or body injuries, or both and road traffic incidents or offences), mental health (suicidal behaviour, unintentional overdoses), and criminality.
   DESING
   Population based cohort study.
   SETTING
   High quality prescription, patient, death, and crime registers, Sweden.
   PARTICIPANTS
   191 973 people from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register who collected prescriptions for gabapentinoids (pregabalin or gabapentin) during 2006 to 2013.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
   Primary outcomes were suicidal behaviour, unintentional overdoses, head/body injuries, road traffic incidents and offences, and arrests for violent crime. Stratified Cox proportional hazards regression was conducted comparing treatment periods with non-treatment periods within an individual. Participants served as their own control, thus accounting for time invariant factors (eg, genetic and historical factors), and reducing confounding by indication. Additional adjustments were made by age, sex, comorbidities, substance use, and use of other antiepileptics.
   RESULTS
   During the study period, 10 026 (5.2%) participants were treated for suicidal behaviour or died from suicide, 17144 (8.9%) experienced an unintentional overdose, 12 070 (6.3%) had a road traffic incident or offence, 70 522 (36.7%) presented with head/body injuries, and 7984 (4.1%) were arrested for a violent crime. In within-individual analyses, gabapentinoid treatment was associated with increased hazards of suicidal behaviour and deaths from suicide (age adjusted hazard ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.20 to 1.32), unintentional overdoses (1.24, 1.19 to 1.28), head/body injuries (1.22, 1.19 to 1.25), and road traffic incidents and offences (1.13, 1.06 to 1.20). Associations with arrests for violent crime were less clear (1.04, 0.98 to 1.11). When the drugs were examined separately, pregabalin was associated with increased hazards of all outcomes, whereas gabapentin was associated with decreased or no statistically significant hazards. When stratifying on age, increased hazards of all outcomes were associated with participants aged 15 to 24 years.
   CONCLUSIONS
   This study suggests that gabapentinoids are associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, unintentional overdoses, head/body injuries, and road traffic incidents and offences. Pregabalin was associated with higher hazards of these outcomes than gabapentin.

ID MENTAL-HEALTH; FOLLOW-UP; IMPACT
AB In this note we test if unemployment has an effect on mortality. using a large individual level data set of nearly 30,000 individuals in Sweden aged 20-64 years followed-up for 10-17 years. We follow individuals over time that are initially in the same health state, but differ with respect to whether they are employed or unemployed (controlling also for a number of individual characteristics that may affect the depreciation of health over time). Unemployment significantly increases the risk of being dead at the end of follow-up by nearly 50% (from 5.36 to 7.83%). In an analysis of cause-specific mortality, we find that unemployment significantly increases the risk of suicides and the risk of dying from "other diseases" (all diseases except cancer and cardiovascular), but has no significant effect on cancer mortality, cardiovascular mortality or deaths due to "other external causes" (motor vehicle accidents, accidents and homicides).

AB This is a case report of the offender and offense characteristics of a targeted attack on a Swedish school using a sword, with a particular focus upon the offender's history, the relationship between mental disorder and ideology, and whether or not it was an act of terrorism. Findings indicate that the offender had no drug or psychiatric treatment history, but postoffense analysis suggests autism spectrum disorder, depression, and both suicidal ideation and intent. The offender planned and prepared for his attack, and the triggering event appeared to be the loss of a temporary job. He expressed chronic anger concerning immigrants to Sweden and blamed them for his failures. Comparison of the fact pattern to other cases of lone actor terrorism with the Terrorist Radicalization Assessment Protocol (TRAP-18) empirically demonstrates excellent criterion validity with other lone actor terrorists in Europe and North America-including right wing extremists-and contributes to further understanding of ideologically motivated mass murder.

ID CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR; HOMICIDE-SUICIDE; VIOLENT
AB Background: Few studies have addressed the relationship between dementia and crime. We conducted a study of persons who got a primary or secondary diagnosis of dementia or cognitive disorder in a forensic psychiatric examination.
   Methods: In Sweden, annually about 500 forensic psychiatric examinations are carried out. All cases from 2008 to 2010 with the diagnoses dementia or cognitive disorder were selected from the database of the Swedish National Board of Forensic Medicine. Out of 1471 cases, there were 54 cases of dementia or cognitive disorder. Case files were scrutinized and 17 cases of dementia and 4 cases of cognitive disorder likely to get a dementia diagnosis in a clinical setting were identified and further studied.
   Results: There were 18 men and 3 women; Median age 66 (n = 21; Range 35-77) years of age. Eleven men but no women had a previous criminal record. There were a total of 38 crimes, mostly violent, committed by the 21 persons. The crimes were of impulsive rather that pre-meditated character. According to the forensic psychiatric diagnoses, dementia was caused by cerebrovascular disorder (n = 4), alcohol or substance abuse (n = 3), cerebral haemorrhage and alcohol (n = 1), head trauma and alcohol (n = 2), Alzheimer's disease (n = 2), Parkinson's disease (n = 1), herpes encephalitis (n = 1) and unspecified (3). Out of four persons diagnosed with cognitive disorder, one also had delusional disorder and another one psychotic disorder and alcohol dependence. An alcohol-related diagnosis was established in ten cases. There were only two cases of Dementia of Alzheimer's type, one of whom also had alcohol intoxication. None was diagnosed with a personality disorder. All but one had a history of somatic or psychiatric comorbidity like head traumas, stroke, other cardio-vascular disorders, epilepsy, depression, psychotic disorders and suicide attempts. In this very ill group, the suggested verdict was probation in one case and different forms of care in the remaining 20 cases instead of prison.
   Conclusions: Few cases of dementia or cognitive disorder were identified by forensic psychiatric examinations. All but one suffered from a variety of serious mental and medical conditions affecting the brain. Alcohol abuse was prevalent.

   T-cell immunotherapy is a promising approach to treat disseminated cancer. However, it has been limited by the ability to isolate and expand T cells restricted to tumour-associated antigens. Using ex vivo gene transfer, T cells from patients can be genetically engineered to express a novel T cell receptor or chimeric antigen receptor to specifically recognize a tumour-associated antigen and thereby selectively kill tumour cells. Indeed, genetically engineered T cells have recently been successfully used for cancer treatment in a small number of patients. Here we review the recent progress in the field, and summarize the challenges that lie ahead and the strategies being used to overcome them.

AB In the context of our investigation, we found information on 432 (76%) of the 569 Jewish dermatologists in Germany. There is evidence that 57 (10%) of the Jewish dermatologists were murdered in concentration camps, 61 (10.7%) died a natural death, 13 (2%) committed suicide, and 25 (4%) survived the Third Reich in Germany. After 1933, 276 (49%) Jewish dermatologists were able to leave Germany; the United States of America was the main destination and 107 (or 41%) emigrated there. A total of 34 (13%) Jewish dermatologists emigrated from Germany to Palestine and 16 to Latin America. Regarding emigration to other European countries, 20 of the Jewish dermatologists from Germany went to Great Britain (including Walter Freudenthal, 1893-1952, and Ernst Sklarz, 1894-1975), and 24 emigrated to other European countries, such as France (Rudolf Mayer, 1895-1962), Sweden (Carl Lennhoff, 1883-1963), and the Netherlands (Otto Schlein, 1895-1944).

AB Objectives: Our objective was to examine the association between neighborhood linking social capital (a concept describing the amount of trust between individuals and societal institutions) and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the elderly.
   Design: The entire Swedish population aged 65+, a total of 1,517,336 men and women, was followed from 1 January 2002 until death, emigration, or the end of the study on 31 December 2010. Small geographic units were used to define neighborhoods. The definition of linking social capital was based on neighborhood voting participation rates, categorized into three groups. Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and between-neighborhood variance in three different models.
   Results: The results showed an overall association between linking social capital and all-cause mortality. The significant OR of 1.53 in the group with low linking social capital decreased, but remained significant (OR -1.27), after accounting for age, sex, family income, marital status, country of birth, education level, and region of residence. There were also significant associations between linking social capital and cause-specific mortality in coronary heart disease, psychiatric disorders, cancer, stroke, chronic lower respiratory diseases, type 2 diabetes, and suicide.
   Conclusion: There are associations between low linking social capital and mortality from chronic disorders and suicide in the elderly population. Community support for elderly people living in neighborhoods with low levels of linking social capital may need to be strengthened. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Suicidal feelings in the twilight of life: a cross-sectional
   population-based study of 97-year-olds
SO BMJ OPEN
LA English
DT Article
ID MENTAL-DISORDERS; PHYSICAL ILLNESS; DEATH IDEATION; RISK; RELIABILITY;
   SAMPLE; SCALE
AB Objective: To examine the occurrence of past month suicidal feelings in extreme old age. Further, to identify factors associated with such feelings.
   Design: Cross-sectional population-based study.
   Setting: Gothenburg, Sweden.
   Participants: 269 adults (197 women, 72 men) without dementia born in 1901-1909 who participated in a psychiatric examination.
   Main outcome measures: Death thoughts and suicidal feelings. The latter were rated in accordance with the Paykel questions (life not worth living, death wishes, thoughts of taking own life, seriously considered taking own life, attempted suicide) during the past month.
   Results: One quarter of the sample (26.7%) reported that they thought about their own death at least once a month. Past month thoughts that life was not worth living were acknowledged by 7.9% of the total sample, death wishes by 10.5% and thoughts of taking life by 3.8%. Few had serious thoughts of taking own life (0.8%) and none had attempted suicide. In all, 11.5% acknowledged some level of suicidal feelings. Most (77.4%) of those who reported such feelings fulfilled criteria for neither major nor minor depression. Neither poor perceived health nor disability (hearing, vision and motor function) was associated with suicidal feelings. Problematic sleep and deficient social contacts were also related to suicidal feelings after adjustment for depression.
   Conclusions: Suicidal feelings may occur outside the context of depression and disability in this age group. Results can inform clinicians who care for persons who reach extreme old age.

TI Effect of Brief Admission to Hospital by Self-referral for Individuals
   Who Self-harm and Are at Risk of Suicide A Randomized Clinical Trial
SO JAMA NETWORK OPEN
LA English
DT Article
ID BORDERLINE PERSONALITY-DISORDER; TREATMENT FIDELITY; INTERVENTION
AB IMPORTANCE To our knowledge, there is no consensus regarding when individuals who repeatedly self-harm and are at risk of suicide should be hospitalized. To evaluate a new alternative, we examined the effects of brief admission (BA) to hospital by self-referral.
   OBJECTIVES To determine the effects of BA on inpatient service use and on secondary outcomes of daily life functioning, nonsuicidal self-injuries, and attempted suicide among individuals who self-harm and are at risk of suicide.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The single-masked Brief Admission Skane Randomized Clinical Trial was conducted from September 2015 to June 2018 at 4 psychiatric health care facilities in southern Sweden. Data were collected 6 months retrospectively at baseline and at 6-month and 12-month follow-ups. Participants were randomized to either BA and treatment as usual (BA group) or treatment as usual (control group). The sample was a referral population, with the most important inclusion criteria being current episodes of self-harm and/or recurrent suicidality, at least 3 diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder, and hospitalization in the last 6 months.
   INTERVENTIONS Self-referred BA was offered for 12 months, with standard limits for duration and frequency, after the negotiation of a contract outlining the intervention.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prespecified main outcome measures were days admitted to the hospital, including voluntary admission, BA, and compulsory admission.
   RESULTS The 125 participants had a mean (SD) age of 32.0 (9.4) years, 106 (84.8%) were women, and 63 were randomized to the BA group and 62 to the control group. No significant advantage was observed in the number of days in the hospital for the BA group compared with the control group. Within-group analyses demonstrated significant decreases in both groups regarding days admitted to the hospital (BA group: chi(2) = 22.71; P < .001; control group: chi(2) = 23.01; P < .001) and visits to the emergency department (BA group: chi(2) = 13.95; P < .001; control group: chi(2) = 21.61; P < .001), but only the BA group showed a reduction in days with compulsory admission (chi(2) = 7.67; P = .02) and nonsuicidal self-injuries (chi(2) = 6.13; P = .047). The BA group showed significantly greater improvements in the mobility domain of daily life functioning (z = -2.39; P = .02) and significant within-group improvements in 3 other domains (cognition: F = 9.02; P < .001; domestic responsibilities: F = 3.23; P = .049; and participation: F = 3.79; P = .03).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Brief admission appears no more efficacious in reducing use of inpatient services than usual care for individuals who self-harm and are at risk of suicide. Future studies should explore other possible beneficial effects.

AB Objectives: To determine the direction and magnitude of participation bias in end-of-life research.
   Methods: Within the framework of a European survey on medical end-of-life decisions, a non-response study was conducted among physicians in Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. People were asked about their attitudes and experiences in the area of medial end-of-life decision. The response rates ranged from 12.8% (Netherlands) to 39.4% (Switzerland). The responders (n = 5403) and the non-responders (n = 866) were compared regarding socio-demographic characteristics, experiences with terminal patients and agreement with attitudes towards "end-of-life decisions". The reasons for non-participation to the study were analyzed.
   Results: Non-response did not cause socio-demographic distortion, but non-responders had statistically significantly fewer terminal patients than responders. Agreement rates were statistically significantly higher among responders than among non-responders for euthanasia, non-treatment decision and life-preserving statements. Neutral answers were statistically significantly more frequent among non-responders than among responders for life-preserving and euthanasia statements. The most commonly mentioned reason for non-participation was "lack of time".
   Conclusion: Non-participation does cause an overestimation of proponents of life-shortening, as well as of life-preserving end-of-life decisions. Non-responders more often have ambiguous attitudes towards end-of-life decisions than responders.

ID UNITED-STATES; PREGNANCY; MORTALITY; POPULATION; FINLAND; SWEDEN
AB IntroductionDespite the seriousness of the event, maternal deaths are substantially underreported. There is often a missed opportunity to learn from such tragedies. The aim of the study was to identify maternal deaths in the five Nordic countries, to classify causes of death based on internationally acknowledged criteria, and to identify areas that would benefit from further teaching, training or research to possibly reduce the number of maternal deaths.
   Material and methodsWe present data for the years 2005-2013. National audit groups collected data by linkage of registers and direct reporting from hospitals. Each case was then assessed to determine the cause of death, and level of care provided. Potential improvements to care were evaluated.
   ResultsWe registered 168 maternal deaths, 90 direct and 78 indirect cases. The maternal mortality ratio was 7.2/100 000 live births ranging from 6.8 to 8.1 between the countries. Cardiac disease (n = 29) was the most frequent cause of death, followed by preeclampsia (n = 24), thromboembolism (n = 20) and suicide (n = 20). Improvements to care which could potentially have made a difference to the outcome were identified in one-third of the deaths, i.e. in as many as 60% of preeclamptic, 45% of thromboembolic, and 32% of the deaths from cardiac disease.
   ConclusionDirect deaths exceeded indirect maternal deaths in the Nordic countries. To reduce maternal deaths, increased efforts to better implement existing clinical guidelines seem warranted, particularly for preeclampsia, thromboembolism and cardiac disease. More knowledge is also needed about what contributes to suicidal maternal deaths.

AB The current study is based on a retrospective investigation of firearm deaths in Diyarbakir, which were autopsied by the Diyarbakir Branch of the Council of Forensic Medicine during the 6- year period. Four hundred-forty four deaths were investigated from January 1996 through December 2001, including homicide (296 cases, 66.7%), suicide (120 cases, 27%) and accidental shootings (28 cases, 6.3%). The age range of all firearm deaths in the study period was 5 to 75 years with a median age of 29.8 years. The majority were in the groups aged 16-25 years (38.7%). In the homicide group, 248 subjects (83.8%) were male, and 48 (16.2%) were female. The 31.1% of the homicide victims were in the group aged at 20-30 years. Of the 120 suicide victims, 56 (46.7%) were in the group aged 1620 years. The head was by far the favoured site, accounting for 82 (68.3%) deaths: entry wounds in the right temple accounted for 72 of these. Twenty-eight cases were accidental shootings and 18 of them were male (64.3%). Twelve of the 28 accidental victims (42.9%) were in the group aged 0-10 years. The eight cases were due to their own accidental shootings, and the remaining 20 cases were shot by others. Our findings show that the contributing factors for increasing death by firearm are terrorists' activities, traditional habits of obtaining and using guns and blood feuds.

ID ROAD; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PREVENTION; TRANSPORT; CRASHES; MODELS
AB The Vision Zero policy was adopted by the Swedish parliament in 1997 as a new direction for road traffic safety. The aim of the policy is that no one should be killed or seriously injured due to traffic accidents and that the design of the road transport system should be adapted to those requirements. Vision Zero has been described as a policy innovation with a focus on the tolerance of the human body to kinetic energy and that the responsibility for road safety falls on the system designers. In Sweden, the Vision Zero terminology has spread to other safety related areas, such as fire safety, patient safety, workplace safety and suicide. The purpose of this article is to analyze, through a comparative content analysis, each Vision Zero policy by identifying the policy decision, policy problem,,policy goal, and policy measures. How a policy is designed and formulated has a direct effect on implementation and outcome. The similarities and differences between the policies give an indication of the transfer method in each case. The results show that the Vision Zero policies following the Vision Zero for road traffic contain more than merely a similar terminology, but also that the ideas incorporated in Vision Zero are not grounded within each policy area as one would expect. The study shows that it is easier to imitate formulations in a seemingly successful policy and harder to transform Vision Zero into a workable tool in each policy area.

AB Background Growing up with one parent has become increasingly common, and seems to entail disadvantages in terms of socioeconomic circumstances and health. We aimed to investigate differences in mortality, severe morbidity, and injury between children living in households with one adult and those living in households with two adults.
   Methods In this population-based study, we assessed overall and cause-specific mortality between 1991 and 1998 and risk of admission between 1991 and 1999 for 65 085 children with single parents and 921257 children with two parents. We estimated relative risks by Poisson regression, adjusted for factors that might be presumed to select people into single parenthood, and for other factors, mainly resulting from single parenthood, that might have affected the relation between type of parenting and risk.
   Findings Children with single parents showed increased risks of psychiatric disease, suicide or suicide attempt, injury, and addiction. After adjustment for confounding factors, such as socioeconomic status and parents' addiction or mental disease, children in single-parent households had increased risks compared with those in two-parent households for psychiatric disease in childhood (relative risk for girls 2.1 [95% CI 1.9-2.3] and boys 2.5 [2.3-2.8]), suicide attempt (girls 2.0 [1.9-2.2], boys 2.3 [2.1-2.6]), alcohol-related disease (girls 2.4 [2.2-2.7], boys 2.2 [2.0-2.4]), and narcotics-related disease (girls 3.2 [2.7-3.7], boys 4.0 [3.5-4.5]). Boys in single-parent families were more likely to develop psychiatric disease and narcotics-related disease than were girls, and they also had a raised risk of all-cause mortality.
   Conclusions Growing up in a single-parent family has disadvantages to the health of the child. Lack of household resources plays a major part in increased risks. However, even when a wide range of demographic and socioeconomic circumstances are included in multivariate models, children of single parents still have increased risks of mortality, severe morbidity, and injury.

AB Aim
   To examine the potential effects of replacing the Swedish alcohol retail system with a private licensing system on alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm.
   Design
   Two possible scenarios were analysed: (1) replacing the current alcohol retail monopoly with private licensed stores that specialize in alcohol sales or (2) making all alcohol available in grocery stores. We utilized a multiplicative model that projected effects of changes in a set of key factors including hours of sale, retail prices, promotion and advertising and outlet density. Next, we estimated the effect of the projected consumption increase on a set of harm indicators. Values for the model parameters were obtained from the research literature.
   Measurements
   Measures of alcohol-related harm included explicitly alcohol-related mortality, accident mortality, suicide, homicide, assaults, drinking driving and sickness absence.
   Findings
   According to the projections, scenario 1 yields a consumption increase of 17% (1.4 litres/capita), which in turn would cause an additional 770 deaths, 8500 assaults, 2700 drinking driving offences and 4.5 million sick days per year. The corresponding figures for scenario 2 are a consumption increase of 37.4% (3.1 litres/capita) leading to an additional annual toll of 2000 deaths, 20 000 assaults, 6600 drinking driving offences and 11.1 million days of sick leave.
   Conclusions
   Projections based on the research literature suggest that privatization of the Swedish alcohol retail market would significantly increase alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm.

AB Background Being a lone mother often implies disadvantage in terms of both socioeconomic circumstances and health. Our aim was to examine differences in mortality, severe morbidity and injury between lone mothers and mothers living with partners, on the assumption that the disadvantaged socioeconomic circumstances contribute to poor health.
   Methods The odds for receipt of hospital care or death between 1991 and 1994 were estimated for 26 619 lone mothers and 379 855 partnered mothers from data collected for the Swedish Population and Housing Census of 1990. We computed odds ratios by means of logistic regression, adjusting for confounders, mediators, and factors with an indeterminate position in various models. To control for health-selection effects, we only considered initially healthy women, as measured by non-hospitalization 4 years prior to follow-up. To reduce the impact of distress following divorce on health, we only included mothers who had been either lone or partnered for a period of greater than or equal to5 years.
   Results Lone mothers showed increased risks of total mortality, lung cancer, suicide/ suicide attempt, inflicted violence, traffic injury and other accident, psychiatric disease, and addiction. The main explanation for increased risks seems for most outcomes to lie in deficient household resources, as indicated here by receipt of social-welfare benefit and housing situation. For all the initially elevated outcomes, except for total mortality, significant risk increases remained unaccounted for even in the full model. Relationships varied according to subgroup. Lone motherhood was not related to accident, suicide and addiction among medium- and high-grade non-manual workers. Although lone mothers in general showed no increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, those receiving social benefit were exposed to a significantly increased risk.
   Conclusions Our findings suggest that lone motherhood entails health disadvantages. Lack of household resources seems to play a major role in accounting for increased risks, but the risks are partly independent of socioeconomic circumstances, selection factors, and distress following divorce.

AB Aim. This paper is a report of a study to explore different perceptions of psychiatric care among foreign- and Swedish-born people with psychotic disorders.
   Background. Research from different countries reports a high-incidence of psychosis among migrants. The risk-factors discussed are social disadvantages in the new country. To understand and meet the needs of people from different countries, their perspective of psychiatric care must be illuminated and taken into consideration.
   Method. A phenomenographic study was conducted in 2005-2006 using semi-structured interviews with a convenience sample of 12 foreign-born people and 10 Swedish-born people with psychosis.
   Findings. Three categories were identified: personal and family involvement in care; relating to healthcare staff; and managing illness and everyday life. Foreign-born people differed from Swedish-born people in that they struggled to attain an everyday life in Sweden, relied on healthcare staff as experts in making decisions, and had religious beliefs about mental illness. Among Swedish-born people, the need for more support to relatives and help to perform recreational activities was important.
   Conclusions. It is important to identify individual perceptions and needs, which may be influenced by cultural origins, when caring for patients with psychosis. Previous experience of care, different ways of relating to staff, and individual needs should be identified and met with respect. Social needs should not be medicalized but taken into consideration when planning care, which illustrates the importance of multi-professional co-operation.

AB The objective of the study was to investigate whether there is equalisation of socioeconomic differences in injury risks among Swedish children and adolescents. Equalisation was defined as a reduction in relative differences in risks between socioeconomic groups. All Swedish children and adolescents aged 5-19 in 1990 were grouped into three age cohorts and allocated to four household socioeconomic statuses, considering boys and girls separately. Each cohort was then followed up over a 5-year period (1990-1994) with regard to three injury diagnosis groups (as registered in the national Hospital Discharge and Causes of Death registers) with documented socioeconomic differences: injuries due to traffic, inter-personal violence, and self-infliction. The Relative Index of Inequality was used to measure the magnitude of relative socioeconomic differences, for each year of observation. Where applicable, relative risks were computed in order to see whether equalisation benefited all socioeconomic groups. Tendencies of equalisation were found among girls for two of the diagnosis groups: in traffic injuries for the youngest cohort (aged 5-9 in 1990) and in the case of self-inflicted injuries within the two older cohorts (10-14 and 15-19, in 1990). In conclusion, this study provides limited evidence of equalisation in injury risks between socioeconomic groups among Swedish adolescents. Equalisation appears to be a gender-specific phenomenon, that is, among girls, and manifests itself around the age of 5-13 in traffic-related injuries, when girls are in first and second levels of compulsory school, and later on in self-inflicted injuries. Given the economic recession in Sweden at the time of the study period, whether the equalisation processes are attributable to school, peer group and youth culture effects-as hypothesised by West-is debatable, particularly in the case of self-inflicted injuries.

DT Article

AB Background: Poisoning represents a significant part of admissions to intensive care units. The aim of this nationwide study was to describe recent national quality register data of demographics and mortality for these patients.
   Method: A retrospective national observational study including all patients over 19 years admitted to an ICU in Sweden, between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2011, with an ICD-10 code for poisoning. The data were collected from three national registers (The Swedish Intensive Care Register, The National Patient Register, and The Cause of Death Register).
   Results: The incidence of ICU-treated poisonings was 43/100,000. Twenty-one per cent (n = 8155) of all poisoned patients seeking medical care were admitted to the ICU. Their median age was 38 years (q1-q3: 26-51), as many men as women and 46.5% (n = 3790) had a previous registered poisoning. A mix of different substances was the most common type of suspected poisoning (29.7%, n = 2424). The in-hospital mortality was 1.9% and was correlated to invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 6.91 CI 95% 4.59-10.42), age > 40 (OR 4.54 CI 95% 2.86-7.21) and no previous hospitalisation for poisoning (OR 3.23 CI 95% 2.06-5.07). For 78.3% (n = 119) of the deceased patients, the fatal poisoning was their first diagnosed poisoning. The 30-day mortality was 2.7%, a majority died from poisoning (P < 0.01).
   Conclusion: In Sweden, patients treated in the ICU due to poisoning represent a fifth of all poisoned patients seeking medical care. Older men with no previous poisoning were considered a high-risk group.

AB Background: Little is known about the changes in the ranking of leading cause of death (COD) among people died with schizophrenia across years in the United States (U.S.). This study aims to determine the ranking of leading COD among U.S. decedents with mention of schizophrenia by age from 2000 to 2015.
   Methods: The mortality multiple COD files maintained by the National Center for Health Statistics were used to identify decedents aged 15 years old and above with mention of schizophrenia anywhere on the death certificates to determine the number and proportion of deaths attributed to various underlying CODs.
   Results: Of 13,289, 13,655, 14,135, and 15,033 people who died in 2000-2003, 2004-2007, 2008-2011 and 2012-2015 with mention of schizophrenia, similar to all decedents, heart disease and cancer was the first and the second leading COD throughout the study years. Schizophrenia ranked the third in most years except in 2004-2007. The first leading COD for decedents with mention of schizophrenia aged 15-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65-74, and 75+ years old in 2012-2015 was suicide, accidents, heart disease, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementia, respectively. Nevertheless, it was accidents, accidents, cancer, cancer, and heart disease, respectively for all decedents.
   Conclusion: The ranking of leading CODs among U.S. decedents with mention of schizophrenia changed across years and differed from all decedents by age, which suggest that different interventions should be designed accordingly. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Immune dysregulation due to chronic inflammation is a hypothesized risk factor underlying psychiatric disorders and suicidal behavior. Whether tonsillectomy and acute appendicitis used, respectively, as proxies for chronic and acute inflammation within the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) are associated with psychiatric disorders and suicidal behavior is currently unknown. A birth cohort study was conducted including 3,052,875 individuals born in Sweden between 1973 and 2003. We identified 210,686 individuals ever exposed to tonsillectomy and 86,928 individuals ever exposed to acute appendicitis, as well as 317,214 clusters of siblings discordant for tonsillectomy, and 160,079 sibling clusters discordant for acute appendicitis. Outcomes were an aggregate risk of 'any psychiatric disorder', 'any suicidal behavior', 12 individual psychiatric disorders, suicide attempts and deaths by suicide. Tonsillectomy was associated with increased odds of 'any psychiatric disorder' (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.38-1.41) and 'any suicidal behavior' (aOR = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.37-1.44), and most individual disorders. Acute appendicitis also increased the odds of 'any psychiatric disorder' and 'any suicidal behavior' (aOR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.20-1.25, and aOR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.28-1.37, respectively). Exposure to both tonsillectomy and appendicitis was associated with the highest odds of 'any psychiatric disorder' (aOR = 1.70; 95% CI = 1.59-1.82) and 'any suicidal behavior' (aOR = 1.90; 95% CI = 1.70-2.12). In sibling comparisons, the associations were attenuated but remained significant. We conclude that inflammation within the MALT, particularly when chronic, is robustly associated with a broad range of psychiatric disorders and suicidal behavior.

AB Objective To determine the risk of people with mental disorders being victims of homicide.
   Design National cohort study.
   Setting Sweden.
   Participants Entire adult population (n=7 253 516).
   Main outcome measures Homicidal death during eight years of follow-up (2001-08); hazard ratios for the association between mental disorders and homicidal death, with adjustment for sociodemographic confounders; potential modifying effect of comorbid substance use.
   Results 615 homicidal deaths occurred in 54.4 million person years of follow-up. Mortality rates due to homicide (per 100 000 person years) were 2.8 among people with mental disorders compared with 1.1 in the general population. After adjustment for sociodemographic confounders, any mental disorder was associated with a 4.9-fold (95% confidence interval 4.0 to 6.0) risk of homicidal death, relative to people without mental disorders. Strong associations were found irrespective of age, sex, or other sociodemographic characteristics. Although the risk of homicidal death was highest among people with substance use disorders (approximately ninefold), the risk was also increased among those with personality disorders (3.2-fold), depression (2.6-fold), anxiety disorders (2.2-fold), or schizophrenia (1.8-fold) and did not seem to be explained by comorbid substance use. Sociodemographic risk factors included male sex, being unmarried, and low socioeconomic status.
   Conclusions In this large cohort study, people with mental disorders, including those with substance use disorders, personality disorders, depression, anxiety disorders, or schizophrenia, had greatly increased risks of homicidal death. Interventions to reduce violent death among people with mental disorders should tackle victimisation and homicidal death in addition to suicide and accidents, which share common risk factors.

AB Objective: Children with orofacial clefts (OFC) may have an increased risk of poor mental health. This study aimed to investigate the risk of psychiatric diagnoses in individuals with OFC, stratified by cleft type.
   Method: A nationwide register-based cohort of all individuals born with nonsyndromic OFC in Sweden between 1973 and 2012 (n = 7,842) was compared to a matched cohort (n = 78,409) as well as to their unaffected siblings (n = 9,637). The risk of psychiatric diagnoses, suicide attempts, and suicides was examined by crude and adjusted Cox regression models. Effect modification by sex was investigated with interaction terms in the models.
   Results: Children with cleft lip (CL) had a significantly higher risk of any psychiatric disorder, intellectual disability, and language disorders; children with cleft lip and palate (CLP) had, in addition, an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Children with cleft palate only (CPO) had risk increases for the same diagnoses as children with CL and CLP, but with higher hazard ratios, and also for psychotic disorders, attention -deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and other behavioral or emotional disorders in childhood. Sex stratification indicated higher risk increases among females in CL and CLP but not in CPO. Siblings without OFC were less likely to be diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder, intellectual disability, language disorder, ASD, or ADHD compared to their siblings with OFC.
   Conclusion: Children with nonsyndromic clefts had a significantly higher risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. This risk is unlikely to be explained by familial influences such as inherited genetic or shared environmental factors.

   SUICIDE; MORTALITY; SWEDEN; SYSTEM
AB Background: Infant deaths cluster in families, but beyond infancy, little is known about familial aggregation of premature deaths. We hypothesized that an individual's risk of premature death would be influenced by prior premature deaths of any age in family members.
   Methods: For all Danish residents registered in the Civil Registration System, 1968-2005, information was linked to the Causes of Death Register and the Danish Family Relation Database, yielding a cohort of 4,870,821 persons linked to one or more relatives (93 million persons-years and 73,278 deaths). We used log-linear Poisson regression to estimate mortality rate ratios (relative risks) for premature death (before age 40 years) in persons with a family history of premature death, compared with persons without such a history.
   Results: Persons with a family history of premature death were 46% more likely themselves to die prematurely than persons without such a family history (relative risk [RR] = 1.46 [95% confidence interval = 1.42-1.50]). Relative risks were higher for concordant age at death, a close kinship relation, and similar causes of death. As expected, certain natural causes clustered among first-degree relatives (RRs ranged from 1.81-618), but unnatural causes of death, such as nonsimultaneous motor vehicle injuries, other injuries, and suicides, also clustered (RRs = 1.80, 3.53, and 4.23, respectively). Previous family history of premature death in a first-degree relative also increased the risk of dying from another cause (overall RR = 2.08 in infancy and 1.33 between ages 1 and 39).
   Conclusion: Premature deaths cluster in families, for both similar and dissimilar causes.

AB Objective: To investigate the risk of self-injury in parentally cancer-bereaved youth compared with their nonbereaved peers.
   Design: Population-based study of cancer-bereaved youth and a random sample of matched population controls.
   Setting: Sweden in 2009 and 2010.
   Participants: A total of 952 youth (74.8%) confirmed to be eligible for the study returned the questionnaire: 622 (73.1%) of 851 eligible young adults who lost a parent to cancer between the ages of 13 and 16 years, in 2000 to 2003, and 330 (78.4%) of 451 nonbereaved peers.
   Main Exposure: Cancer bereavement or nonbreavement during the teenage years.
   Main Outcome Measures: Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of self-injury after January 1, 2000.
   Results: Among cancer-bereaved youth, 120 (19.5%) reported self-injury compared with 35 (10.6%) of their nonbereaved peers, yielding an OR of 2.0 (95% CI, 1.4-3.0). After controlling for potential confounding factors in childhood (eg, having engaged in self-destructive behavior, having been bullied, having been sexually or physically abused, having no one to share joys and sorrows with, and sex), the adjusted OR was 2.3 (95% CI, 1.4-3.7). The OR for suicide attempts was 1.6 (95% CI, 0.8-3.0).
   Conclusions: One-fifth of cancer-bereaved youth reported self-injury, representing twice the odds for self-injury in their nonbereaved peers, regardless of any of the adjustments we made. Raised awareness on a broad basis in health care and allied disciplines would enable identification and support provision to this vulnerable group. JAMA Pediatr. 2013; 167(2):133-140.

AB Lingering grief associated with the death of a loved one has been hypothesized to precipitate acute health events among survivors on anniversary dates. We sought to study excess mortality risk in parents around the death date and birth date of a deceased child as an indication of a "bereavement effect". We conducted a population based follow-up study using Swedish registries including links between children and parents. All biological and Swedish-born parents who experienced the death of a minor child born were observed during the period 1973-2008 (n = 48,666). An increased mortality risk was found during the week of a child's death among mothers who lost a child aged 0-17 years (SMRR = 1.46, 95 % CI 0.98-2.17). The association was stronger among mothers who lost a child aged 1-17 years (SMRR = 1.89, 95 % CI 0.97-3.67) as compared to those who lost an infant (SMRR = 1.29, 95 % CI 0.78-2.12). Cardiovascular diseases and suicides were overrepresented as causes of death in mothers who died around the anniversary. We found no significant increase in the mortality risk around the date of child's birth, nor any suggestion of excess mortality risk among fathers, but rather a depression of paternal death (SMRR = 0.60, 95 % CI 0.34-1.03). Our study indicates an anniversary reaction among mothers who lost a young child. These results suggest that bereavement per se could have an effect on health and mortality which should be acknowledged by public health professionals working with bereaved people.

AB We aimed to examine whether early life bereavement, as indicator of severe stress, was associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia later in life.
   Based on population registers, we established a cohort of all children born in Denmark (N = 1 686 416) and Sweden (N = 2 563 659) from 1973 to 1997. Children were categorized as exposed if they lost a first-degree relative during the first 18 years of life. Outcome is the first diagnosis of schizophrenia as either inpatient or outpatient. Log-linear Poisson regression models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs).
   A total of 188,850 children (4.6%) experienced death of a first-degree relative from birth to 18 years of age. Compared with unexposed children, those exposed had overall a 39% higher risk of schizophrenia (= 1.39, 95% CI [confidence interval]: 1.32-1.47). The IRR was particularly high if the family member committed suicide (aIRR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.90-2.34) or died due to an injury or accident (aIRR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.27-1.63). The IRR of schizophrenia decreased with increasing child's age at bereavement (P < 0.0001). Children who experienced >1 death during the first 18 years of life (aIRR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.46-2.19) had a higher risk than those with a single death (aIRR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.30-1.45).
   The study suggested that exposure to death of a first-degree relative before 18 years was associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia in later life. The complex mechanisms behind these associations remain to be elucidated.

TI Does unemployment cause long-term mortality? Selection and causation
   after the 1992-96 deep Swedish recession
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH; WOMEN; MEN; SUICIDE; EUROPE; SWEDEN; COHORT; PERIOD; MODEL
AB Background: Mass unemployment in Europe is endemic, especially among the young. Does it cause mortality? Methods: We analyzed long-term effects of unemployment occurring during the deep Swedish recession 1992-96. Mortality from all and selected causes was examined in the 6-year period after the recession among those employed in 1990 (3.4 million). Direct health selection was analyzed as risk of unemployment by prior medical history based on all hospitalizations 1981-91. Unemployment effects on mortality were estimated with and without adjustment for prior social characteristics and for prior medical history. Results: A prior circulatory disease history did not predict unemployment; a history of alcohol-related disease or suicide attempts did, in men and women. Unemployment predicted excess male, but not female, mortality from circulatory disease, both ischemic heart disease and stroke, and from all causes combined, after full adjustment. Adjustment for prior social characteristics reduced estimates considerably; additional adjustment for prior medical history did not. Mortality from external and alcohol-related causes was raised in men and women experiencing unemployment, after adjustment for social characteristics and medical history. For the youngest birth cohorts fully adjusted alcohol mortality HRs were substantial (male HR = 4.44; female HR = 5.73). The effect of unemployment on mortality was not uniform across the population; men, those with a low education, low income, unmarried or in urban employment were more vulnerable. Conclusions: Direct selection by medical history explains a modest fraction of any increased mortality risk following unemployment. Mass unemployment imposes long-term mortality risk on a sizeable segment of the population.

TI Outcomes of Nordic mental health systems: life expectancy of patients

DT Article
ID EXCESS MORTALITY; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; DEATH CERTIFICATES; STOCKHOLM
   COUNTY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; CARE; DISCHARGE; SWEDEN; RISK
AB Background
   People with mental disorders evince excess mortality due to natural and unnatural deaths. The relative life expectancy of people with mental disorders is a proxy measure of effectiveness of social policy and health service provision.
   Aims
   To evaluate trends in health outcomes of people with serious mental disorders.
   Method
   We examined nationwide 5-year consecutive cohorts of people admitted to hospital for mental disorders in Denmark, Finland and Sweden in 1987-2006. In each country the risk population was identified from hospital discharge registers and mortality data were retrieved from cause-of-death registers. The main outcome measure was life expectancy at age 15 years.
   Results
   People admitted to hospital for a mental disorder had a two-to threefold higher mortality than the general population in all three countries studied. This gap in life expectancy was more pronounced for men than for women. The gap decreased between 1987 and 2006 in these countries, especially for women. The notable exception was Swedish men with mental disorders. In spite of the positive general trend, men with mental disorders still live 20 years less, and women 15 years less, than the general population.
   Conclusions
   During the era of deinstitutionalisation the life expectancy gap for people with mental disorders has somewhat diminished in the three Nordic countries. Our results support further development of the Nordic welfare state model, i.e. tax-funded community-based public services and social protection. Health promotion actions, improved access to healthcare and prevention of suicides and violence are needed to further reduce the life expectancy gap.

AB Aim: To explore whether the self-reported psychological distress among men with prostate cancer was to the extent that it required psychiatric treatment.
   Methods: PCBaSe Sweden, a merged database based on the National Prostate Cancer Register including 97% of all prostate cancers registered as well as age-matched controls. We calculated relative risks and 95% confidence intervals to compare risks of psychiatric treatment due to depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder controlling for age and socio-economic factors. We used odds ratios to compare use or no use of antidepressants.
   Findings: In total 72,613 men with prostate cancer and 217,839 men without prostate cancer were included for analyses. Psychiatric hospitalisation due to depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder were significantly increased (RR 1.29, (95% CI 1.14-1.45), RR 1.42 (95% CI 1.12-1.80) and RR 1.61 (95% CI 1.16-2.24), respectively). However, hospitalisations due to anxiety were only increased in men with more advanced tumours RR 2.28 (95% CI 1.45-3.57). The use of antidepressants was increased for all men with prostate cancer RR 1.65 (95% CI 1.54-1.77) and treatment strategies RR 1.93 (95% CI 1.75-2.13).
   Interpretation: Men diagnosed with prostate cancer had increased risk of psychiatric treatment for depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and use of antidepressants regardless of risk group and treatment strategy compared to age-matched controls, whilst more advanced prostate cancer was associated with severe anxiety disorders.

AB Background: The impact of treatment resistant depression (TRD) on mortality is not established.
   Methods: Using Swedish national registers, 118,774 patients between 18-69 years of age who had been prescribed an antidepressant and been diagnosed with depression in specialized care were identified. Patients with at least two additional treatment trials during the same depressive episode were classified as having TRD. Data on the covariates of sex, age, history of depression, self-harm, substance use disorders, and other psychiatric and somatic comorbidities was also used. Relative risks comparing TRD patients with other depressed patients were calculated as hazard ratios (HR) for all-cause mortality and for external and non-external causes of death, as well as excess mortality rate ratios (EMRR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
   Results: In total 15,013 patients (13%) were classified with TRD. Adjusted HR for all-cause mortality was 1.35 (95% CI 1.21-1.50). Mortality from external causes (including suicides and accidents) was markedly higher in TRD patients than in other depressed patients (HR 1.97; 1.69-2.29), while mortality from non-external causes was similar. The adjusted EMRR was 1.52 (1.31-1.76), highest among patients 18-29 years old (EMRR 2.03; 1.31-1.76) and patients without somatic comorbidity (EMRR 1.99; 1.63-2.43).
   Limitations: Severity of depression and adherence to treatment were not available in the data.
   Conclusions: Patients with TRD may have an increased all-cause mortality compared to other depressed patients, mainly for external causes of death. The relative mortality is highest among young and physically healthy patients.

AB Objective: The current study investigates the background and outcome of anorexia nervosa (AN) in young men.
   Method: All (N = 61) men, born in 1968-1977 with hospital care in Sweden between 1987 and 1992 due to AN, were compared with the general population. Information about socioeconomic background, health-related outcome (hospital care for AN, other psychiatric diagnoses, abuse of alcohol/drugs and/or suicide attempt), and social outcome (major income from sick leave/sick pension or >= 6 months social welfare, living with birth parents, and living with child and partner; education level) was taken from national registers.
   Results: On a group level, the findings suggest some differences between male patients with AN and the male population without AN concerning social background, capacity to support oneself, and living with partner and child. Mental ill-health outcome was almost the same for men with AN as for the general population.
   Conclusion: Male gender in AN - on a group level - suggests a good psychiatric prognosis. (c) 2006 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In 1995, a Swedish pilot study of Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) was launched to investigate its therapeutic efficacy and cost-effectiveness as treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) in suicidal women. In the same year, a sweeping reform of psychiatric care commenced, dramatically reducing the number of beds by the end of the decade. The psychiatry reform was presented as an important factor prompting the need for a community-based treatment for Borderline patients. This article suggests that the introduction of DBT in Sweden, and its relationship to the reform, can only be adequately explained with reference to the wider political shift occurring at the time, whereby the Swedish welfare state and its guiding ethos of egalitarianism were abandoned in favour of a neoliberal 'choice revolution'. With the new liberalism, hard work and individual responsibility replaced the idea of a Swedish 'people's home', a nationwide community and social support network. This language was reflected in DBT, which sought to teach patients the 'skills' necessary 'to create a life worth living'. In this context, therapy was constituted as a form of 'work' that the patient had to undertake to improve. Moreover, DBT rejected the prevailing view of Borderline patients as 'manipulative' and 'aggressive', suggesting instead that they were 'helpless', 'weak' and unable to regulate their emotions. This new Borderline persona fit neatly into the new liberal discourse: she could be taught to become a rational and independent person able to cope in a society that valued individual responsibility over social support.

AB Background: Meteorological parameters and air pollen count have been associated with affective disorders and suicide. Regarding peripartum depression, the literature is restricted and inconclusive.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study included women (pregnant, n = 3843; postpartum, n = 3757) who participated in the BASIC (Biology, Affect, Stress, Imaging, and Cognition) study 2010-2015 and the UPPSAT (Uppsala-Athens) study (postpartum, n = 1565) in 2006-2007. Cases were defined according to presence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy (gestational week 32) and 6 weeks postpartum, using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Exposure of sunshine, temperature, precipitation, snow coverage, and air pollen counts of durations of 1, 7, and 42 days prior to the outcome were studied for associations with depressive symptoms, using negative binomial regression.
   Results: Prior to Bonferroni correction, the concentration of mugwort pollen, both one week and six weeks before the EPDS assessment at gestational week 32, was inversely associated with depressive symptoms in pregnancy, both before and after adjustment for season. No associations were found between the exposure to meteorological parameters and pollen and depressive symptoms, at the same day of depressive symptoms' assessment, the previous week, or the six weeks prior to assessment, either during pregnancy or postpartum after Bonferroni correction.
   Conclusions: There was no evidence that neither short-term nor long-term exposure to meteorological parameters or air pollen counts were associated with self-reported peripartum depressive symptoms in Uppsala, Sweden. (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Background and purpose - Hyperactive behavior pattern (such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)) is proposed to be present in individuals with Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD). We investigated whether individuals with LCPD have a higher risk of AMID, depression, and mortality.
   Subjects and methods - We identified 4,057 individuals with LCPD in Sweden during the period 1964-2011.40,570 individuals without LCPD were randomly selected from the Swedish general population and matched by year of birth, sex, and region (control group). We used Cox proportional hazard regression to estimate the relative risks.
   Results - Compared to the control group, individuals with LCPD had a raised hazard ratio (HR) of 1.5 (95% CI: 1.2-1.9) for AMID. The risks were higher for female individuals (HR = 2.1, CI: 1.3-3.5) than for male individuals (HR = 1.4, CI: 1.1-1.8). Individuals with LCPD had a modestly higher hazard ratio for depression (HR = 1.3, CI: 1.1-1.5) than the control group. Furthermore, individuals with LCPD had a slightly higher mortality risk than the control group (HR = 1.2, CI: 1.0-1.4)
   Interpretation - Individuals with LCPD have a higher risk of ADHD. Hyperactivity could expose the femoral head to higher mechanical stress and contribute to the etiology of LCPD. The higher risk of depression may be due to the burden of LCPD itself or could reflect neurobehavioral aspects of ADHD changing into depression later in life. Individuals with LCPD have a higher mortality risk, with higher risk of suicide and cardiovascular diseases.

AB A major issue in the care of terminally ill patients is communication and information provision. This paper reports the extent to which physicians in Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland discuss topics relevant to end of life care with terminally ill patients and their relatives (without first informing the patient), and possible associations between physician-specific characteristics and such discussions. Response rates to the postal survey ranged from 39% to 68% (n = 10139). Physicians in most of the countries except Italy in principle, always' discuss issues related to terminal illness with their patients but not with patients' relatives without first informing the patient, unless the relatives ask. Cross-national differences remained strong after controlling for physician characteristics. The majority of physicians appeared to support the principle of patient-centred care to terminally ill patients, consistent with palliative care philosophy and with the law and/or professional guidelines in most of the countries studied.

AB In the context of an European collaborative research project (EURELD), a study on attitudes towards medical end-of-life decisions was conducted among physicians in Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Australia also joined the consortium. A written questionnaire with structured questions was sent to practising physicians from specialties frequently involved in the care of dying patients. 10,139 questionnaires were studied. Response rate was equal to or larger than 50% in all countries except Italy (39%). Apart from general agreement with respect to the alleviation of pain and symptoms with possible life-shortening effect, there was large variation in support-between and within countries-for medical decision that may result in the hastening of death. A principal component factor analysis found that 58% of the variance of the responses is explained by four factors. 'Country' explained the largest part of the variation of the standardized factor scores. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aims The risk of alcohol-related disorders in first- and second-generation rants in Sweden were investigated and compared with the Swedish majority population to assess how alcohol habits are modified over generations in a new society.
   Design Register study based on multivariate analyses of demographic data, including information on country of birth, from the Swedish Population and Housing Census of 1985 linked to data on hospital admissions for alcohol-related disorders during 1990-99 in the National Hospital Discharge Register.
   Participants The study population consisted of a national cohort of 1.25 million youth born 1968-79 and 1.47 million adults born 1929-65. Results First- and second-generation immigrants from Finland had higher relative risks (RRs) for hospital admission because of an alcohol-related disorder compared to the Swedish majority population (socio-economic adjusted RRs 2.1 and 1.9, respectively), while first-generation immigrants born in southern Europe, the Middle East and other non-European countries had lower risks. Second-generation immigrants with heritage in southern Europe, the Middle East and other non-European countries had socio-economic adjusted RRs that were higher relative to the first generation immigrants but lower relative to the Swedish majority population. Intercountry adoptees had the highest adjusted RR (2.5).
   Conclusions Patterns of alcohol abuse in the country of origin are strong determinants of alcohol-related disorders in first-generation immigrants. The patterns in second-generation immigrants are influenced by parental countries of origin as well as patterns in the majority population. The Finnish minority and intercountry adoptees are of particular concern in prevention.

AB This study aims to analyse mental symptoms, psychotropic drug use and alcohol consumption, in immigrant women born in Finland, the other Nordic countries, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and countries outside Europe, compared with Swedish-born women, and furthermore, to study if age at immigration may have an influence. All women (n = 10,766) aged 50 - 59 years and living in the Lund area of southern Sweden received a postal invitation to a health survey named the Women's Health in Lund Area; 64.2% (n = 6917) participated. The participants answered a questionnaire including prevalence of mental symptoms during the past 3 months, regular use of psychotropic drugs, alcohol consumption during an average week, country of birth and age at immigration. Severe mental symptoms were more common among most immigrant groups compared with native Swedes, but the association to country of birth was not significant after adjustment for possible confounders. Regular use of hypnotics was more common among Nordic immigrants only (odds ration, OR = 4.4). East European and non-European immigrants less often were alcohol consumers (OR = 1.6 and OR = 3.8). Heavy drinking was more common among non-Nordic immigrants who immigrated at a younger age than at an older age. Furthermore, it was found that although East European and non-European immigrants had a higher educational level, they were less often gainfully employed compared with native Swedes. In middle-aged women, country of birth as well as age at immigration are important factors to consider in relation to alcohol consumption, but these factors may be of less importance considering mental health.

This study highlights the independent contribution of neighbourhood and individual-level demographic and socioeconomic attributes to child and adolescent injuries. All individuals between the ages of 7 and 16 years living in Stockholm County in January 1998 (n = 184545) were followed up for their injuries during a five-year period considering injuries sustained as a pedestrian/cyclist/motor-vehicle rider and intentional injuries (violence-related and self-inflicted). A series of two-level logistic regressions were conducted to examine the association between the occurrence of injuries and individual (compositional) characteristics nested into parish of residence as well as contextual characteristics. For children and adolescents living in Stockholm County, contextual socioeconomic and social attributes of their place of residence were significant for injuries sustained as motor-vehicle riders but not for those sustained as pedestrians/cyclists or those inflicted intentionally. In the latter case, only the highest concentration of social benefit recipients was associated with significantly higher odds ratios. This emphasises that each injury mechanism has its own socioeconomic and social pathway, where contextual and compositional factors come into play to varying degrees. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: To assess overall and cause-specific mortality and the quality of somatic care among psychiatric patients.
   Design: A register-based cohort study.
   Setting: All individuals aged 20-79 years in Sweden in 2005.
   Participants: In total 6 294 339 individuals.
   Primary outcome measure: The individuals were followed for mortality in 2006 and 2007, generating 72 187 deaths. Psychiatric patients were grouped according to their diagnosis in the National Patient Register. Mortality risk of psychiatric patients was compared with that of non-psychiatric patients. Estimates of RR of mortality were calculated as incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% CIs using Poisson regression analysis. Psychiatric patients were compared with non-psychiatric patients for three healthcare quality indicators: the proportion of avoidable hospitalisations, case death rate after myocardial infarction and statin use among diabetic patients.
   Results: Compared with individuals with no episodes of treatment for mental disorder, psychiatric patients had a substantially increased risk of all studied causes of death as well as death from conditions considered amenable to intervention by the health service, that is, avoidable mortality. The highest mortality was found among those with another mental disorder, predominantly substance abuse (for women, an IRR of 4.7 (95% CI 4.3 to 5.0) and for men, an IRR of 4.8 (95% CI 4.6 to 5.0)). The analysis of quality of somatic care revealed lower levels of healthcare quality for psychiatric patients, signalling failures in public health and medical care.
   Conclusion: This study shows a marked increase in excess mortality, suggesting a lower quality of somatic healthcare in psychiatric patients.

AB Objective To investigate symptoms of anxiety and depression in lesbian couples undergoing assisted reproductive treatment (ART), and to study the relationship of demographic data, pregnancy outcome and future reproductive plans with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Design Descriptive, a part of the prospective longitudinal Swedish study on gamete donation'. Setting All university clinics in Sweden performing gamete donation. Population A consecutive sample of 214 lesbian couples requesting assisted reproduction, 165 of whom participated. Methods Participants individually completed three study-specific questionnaires and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS): time point 1 (T1), at commencement of ART; time point 2 (T2), approximately 2months after treatment; and time point 3 (T3), 25years after first treatment. Main outcome measures Anxiety and depression (HADS), pregnancy outcome and future reproductive plans. Results The vast majority of lesbian women undergoing assisted reproduction reported no symptoms of anxiety and depression at the three assessment points. A higher percentage of the treated women, compared with the partners, reported symptoms of anxiety at T2 (14% versus 5%, P=0.011) and T3 (10% versus 4%, P=0.018), as well as symptoms of depression at T2 (4% versus 0%, P=0.03) and T3 (3% versus 0%, P=0.035). The overall pregnancy outcome was high; almost three-quarters of lesbian couples gave birth 25years after sperm donation treatments. Open-ended comments illustrated joy and satisfaction about family building. Conclusion Lesbian women in Sweden reported good psychological health before and after treatment with donated sperm.

AB The present cross-cultural study compared self-reported assertiveness in 652 Swedish and 654 Turkish high school students by using a multidimensional measure called the Scale for Interpersonal Behavior (SIB). Four hypotheses were tested in the study. First, the hypothesis that Swedish adolescents would be more assertive than their Turkish counterparts was supported by the data. Second, the expectation that Turkish boys would be more assertive than Turkish girls, while there would be no differences between Swedish girls and boys, was not confirmed. In general, girls were found to be more skilled than boys in expressing and dealing with personal limitations. Third, as expected, more assertive adolescents in both Sweden and Turkey reported having more friends and receiving more social support than their less assertive peers. Finally, the data supported the expectation that older adolescents would be more assertive than younger ones. The results are discussed in terms of cultural and gender differences.

DE Eighteenth-century Russian literature; Karamzin's 'Letters of a Russian
   Traveler'; violation of political and moral norms; antimilitarism
ID 18TH-CENTURY RUSSIA; WAR; POETRY; SELF
AB In Karamzin's 'Letters of a Russian Traveller' the narrator displays a strong inclination to confound his readers, to irritate and to provoke them. Under the surface of his sentimental style we encounter persistent violations of norms generally accepted in eighteenth-century Russian society, including the Petrine ethos of service and the relationship of official to private values. The narrator frequently ignores traditional morality. He depicts suicide not as a mortal sin, but as a human catastrophe. The same goes for norms of marital fidelity and social hierarchy; venerable concepts like 'love of the fatherland' and `historical greatness' are reinterpreted. The latter phenomenon is especially striking: in 1790, while Russia was fighting two wars (against the Ottoman empire and against Sweden), the Traveller constantly displays a love of peace, implicitly condemning Catherine II and her bellicose foreign politics. A concluding digression touches upon the striking political difference between the youthful and the mature Karamzin.

AB IMPORTANCE Longer-term mortality in individuals who have survived a traumatic brain injury (TBI) is not known.
   OBJECTIVES To examine the relationship between TBI and premature mortality, particularly by external causes, and determine the role of psychiatric comorbidity.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS We studied all persons born in 1954 or later in Sweden who received inpatient and outpatient International Classification of Diseases-based diagnoses of TBI from 1969 to 2009 (n = 218 300). We compared mortality rates 6 months or more after TBI to general population controls matched on age and sex (n = 2 163 190) and to unaffected siblings of patients with TBI (n = 150 513). Furthermore, we specifically examined external causes of death (suicide, injury, or assault). We conducted sensitivity analyses to investigate whether mortality rates differed by sex, age at death, severity (including concussion), and different follow-up times after diagnosis.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of premature death by external causes in patients with TBI compared with general population controls.
   RESULTS Among those who survived 6 months after TBI, we found a 3-fold increased odds of mortality (AOR, 3.2; 95% CI, 3.0-3.4) compared with general population controls and an adjusted increased odds of mortality of 2.6 (95% CI, 2.3-2.8) compared with unaffected siblings. Risks of mortality from external causes were elevated, including for suicide (AOR, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.9-3.7), injuries (AOR, 4.3; 95% CI, 3.8-4.8), and assault (AOR, 3.9; 95% CI, 2.7-5.7). Among those with TBI, absolute rates of death were high in those with any psychiatric or substance abuse comorbidity (3.8% died prematurely) and those with solely substance abuse (6.2%) compared with those without comorbidity (0.5%).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Traumatic brain injury is associated with substantially elevated risks of premature mortality, particularly for suicide, injuries, and assaults, even after adjustment for sociodemographic and familial factors. Current clinical guidelines may need revision to reduce mortality risks beyond the first few months after injury and address high rates of psychiatric comorbidity and substance abuse.

AB In recent years, the European euthanasia debate has become more intense, and the practice was legalized in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. We aimed to determine the current degree of public acceptance of euthanasia across Europe and investigate what factors explain differences.
   Data were derived from the 2008 wave of the European Values Survey (EVS), conducted in 47 European countries (N = 67,786, response rate = 69 %). Acceptance of euthanasia was rated on a 1-10 scale.
   Relatively high acceptance was found in a small cluster of Western European countries, including the three countries that have legalized euthanasia and Denmark, France, Sweden and Spain. In a large part of Europe public acceptance was relatively low to moderate. Comparison with the results of the previous EVS wave (1999) suggests a tendency towards a polarization in Europe, with most of Western Europe becoming more permissive and most of Eastern Europe becoming less permissive.
   There is roughly a West-East division in euthanasia acceptance among the European public, making a pan-European policy approach to the issue difficult.

AB Research on child-related risk factors for filicide is scant. We investigated whether prior healthcare use for injury (including poisoning) influences filicide risk. Victims (0-14 years; n = 71) were identified in a national autopsy database for the years 1994-2012 and compared to matched, general population controls (n = 355). Healthcare use data were retrieved from a national patient registry. Risks were estimated using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For females, prior inpatient care for injury conferred a statistically significant sevenfold risk (OR = 6.67 [95% CI: 1.49-29.79]), and any prior injury-related healthcare use conferred a statistically significant fourfold risk (OR = 3.57 [95% CI: 1.13-11.25]), of filicide victimization. No statistically significant risks were found for males. Healthcare personnel should be aware that children treated for injuries, especially females, may be at an elevated risk of filicide victimization. Nevertheless, the filicide base rate remains low, and parents may be stigmatized by unfounded alerts; thus, prudent reflection should precede reports to the authorities.

AB Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) in adolescents is a significant problem that needs to be addressed, and in some cases managed, in school settings. The current feasibility study uses screening questionnaires and follow up-interviews on NSSI in a community sample of adolescents (N = 1,052) in Sweden. Both adolescents reporting self-injury (n = 66) and a comparison group (n = 31) were interviewed, and information disclosed about self-injury, as well as the results from the interviewers assessments of the seriousness of these behaviors, were examined. Generally, adolescents reported positive feelings about being interviewed, and 52% of those who had reported self-injury in the questionnaire disclosed NSSI in the interviews. Further, a majority of these cases, 76%, were not assessed as very serious. When NSSI was reported in a questionnaire 1 year after the interview, there were no indications of iatrogenic effects from participating in the interview. The results support the feasibility of using NSSI screening questionnaires in combination with follow-up interviews in schools.

AB Background: The aims of present study were to assess the prevalence of suicidal expression in the general population, to compare prevalences over time, to identify risk groups and to examine the evidence regarding the proposition that there is a continuous sequence of suicidal expressions with an underlying gradient of severity. Method. Two postal questionnaire studies were conducted, in 1986 and in 1996, involving representative samples of about 700 and 1000 persons respectively, in the age range 18-65 years. Response rates of 76% and 64%, respectively, were obtained. Results: A higher proportion (34%) reported some degree of suicidal expression during the past year in the 1996 survey, compared to 1986 (23%). This was mainly attributed to higher reporting of life-weariness and death-wishes, since there was a simultaneous lower reporting of suicidal ideation (12.5% vs; 8.6%). The total lifetime incidence of suicidal expression was identical (52%) in both studies. Respective proportions of 0.6% and 0.2% reported that they had made a suicide attempt during the last year, and 2.6% and 2.7%, respectively, during their lifetime. Higher prevalences of combined suicidal expression during the previous year were reported by women, younger persons, those living alone and women living in urban areas. Concerning suicidal ideation during last year, no gender differences were found. For a total of 21% of those reporting some degree of suicidal expressions during the past year, no simple cumulative relationship between the different types of suicidal expression was found. Conclusions: It is possible to use a postal questionnaire approach for studies on suicidal expression in the general population, and the study indicates that such suicidal expression is fairly prevalent. The pronounced gender differences concerning most types of suicidal behaviours and expression are not valid for suicidal ideation, which is important to consider in a preventional context.

AB Objective To investigate if unemployment during an economic downturn is associated with mortality, even among men with markers of better health (higher cognitive function scores and qualifications), and to assess whether the associations vary by age at unemployment.
   Design Longitudinal register-based cohort study.
   Setting Study entry was in 1990 and 2001 when Sweden was entering periods of significant economic contraction.
   Participants A representative sample of men from the general population (n=234782) born between 1952 and 1956 who participated in military conscription examinations. Men in receipt of disability or sickness benefit at study entry were excluded.
   Main outcome measure All-cause mortality.
   Results Unemployment compared with employment in 1991 (ages 34-38years) produced adjusted HRs (with 95% CIs) for all-cause mortality (3651 deaths) during follow-up to 2001 and after stratification by education of 2.35 (1.99 to 2.76) for compulsory education, 2.25 (1.97 to 2.58) for up to 3years postcompulsory education and 1.90 (1.40 to 2.57) for more than 3years postcompulsory education. When unemployment was compared with employment in 2001 (ages 45-49years) with follow-up to 2010, the pattern of mortality risk (4271 deaths) stratified by education was reversed, producing adjusted HRs of 2.81 (2.47 to 3.21) for compulsory education, 2.87 (2.58 to 3.19) for up to 3years postcompulsory education and 3.44 (2.78 to 4.25) for more than 3years postcompulsory education. Interaction testing confirmed effect modification by age/period (p=0.003). The degree of gradient reversal was slightly less pronounced after stratification by cognitive function but produced a similar pattern of results (p=0.004).
   Conclusions Unemployment at older ages is associated with greater mortality risk than at younger ages, with the greatest relative increase in risk among men with markers of better health, suggesting the greater vulnerability of all older workers to unemployment-associated exposures.

AB Objective: To examine differences in end-of-life decision-making in patients dying at home, in a hospital or in a care home.
   Design: A death certificate study: certifying physicians from representative samples of death certificates, taken between June 2001 and February 2002, were sent questionnaires on the end-of-life decision-making preceding the patient's death.
   Setting: Four European countries: Belgium (Flanders), Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland (German-speaking part).
   Main outcome measures: The incidence of and communication in different end-of-life decisions: physician-assisted death, alleviation of pain/symptoms with a possible life-shortening effect, and non-treatment decisions.
   Results: Response rates ranged from 59% in Belgium to 69% in Switzerland. The total number of deaths studied was 12 492. Among all non-sudden deaths the incidence of several end-of-life decisions varied by place of death. Physician-assisted death occurred relatively more often at home (0.3-5.1%); non-treatment decisions generally occurred more often in hospitals (22.4-41.3%), although they were also frequently taken in care homes in Belgium (26.0%) and Switzerland (43.1%). Continuous deep sedation, in particular without the administration of food and fluids, was more likely to occur in hospitals. At home, end-of-life decisions were usually more often discussed with patients. The incidence of discussion with other caregivers was generally relatively low at home compared with in hospitals or care homes.
   Conclusion: The results suggest the possibility that end-of-life decision-making is related to the care setting where people die. The study results seem to call for the development of good end-of-life care options and end-of-life communication guidelines in all settings.

AB Objective: Large-scale studies examining future trajectories of marginalisation and health in adolescents with mental illness are scarce. The aim of this study was to examine if non-psychotic psychiatric disorders (NPDs) were associated with future indicators of marginalisation and mortality. We also aimed to determine whether these associations might be mediated by education level and attenuated by high cognitive ability.
   Design: This is a prospective cohort study with baseline data from the Swedish Conscription register.
   Setting: The study was carried out in Sweden from 1969 to 2005.
   Participants: All of the participants were 18-year-old men at mandatory conscription in Sweden between 1969 and 2005 (n=1 609 690).
   Measures: NPDs were clinically diagnosed at conscription. Cognitive ability was measured by a standardised IQ test at conscription. National register data covered information on welfare support, long-term unemployment, disability pension (DP) and mortality over a period of 1-36 years.
   Results: NPD at the age of 18 years was a predictor of future welfare support, OR 3.73 (95% CI 3.65 to 3.80); long-term unemployment, OR 1.97 (95% CI 1.94 to 2.01); DP, HR 2.95 (95% CI 2.89 to 3.02); and mortality, HR 2.45 (2.33-2.52). The adjusted models suggested that these associations were not confounded by fathers' educational level, cognitive ability had only a minor attenuating effect on most associations and the mediating effect of own educational level was small.
   Conclusions: The present study underlines a higher prevalence of future adversities in young men experiencing NPDs at the age of 18 years. It also indicates that higher cognitive ability may work as a potential resilience factor against future marginalisation and mortality.

AB Importance: We demonstrate that patients who have undergone gastric bypass surgery (GBS) have a higher risk of inpatient care for alcohol dependence than those who have undergone restrictive surgery. This highlights a need for health care providers to be aware of this so that early detection and treatment can be put in place.
   Objective: To evaluate inpatient care for alcohol abuse before and after GBS compared with restrictive surgery (vertical banded gastroplasty and gastric banding).
   Design: Retrospective population-based cohort study including all patients who underwent GBS, vertical banded gastroplasty, and gastric banding in Sweden from 1980 through 2006. The relative risk of inpatient care for alcohol abuse was studied before and after surgery.
   Setting: All hospitals in Sweden performing bariatric surgery.
   Participants: A total of 11 115 patients older than 18 years (mean [SD] age, 40.0 [10.3] years; 77% women) who underwent a primary gastric bypass procedure, vertical banded gastroplasty, and gastric banding during the study period.
   Main Outcome Measures: Inpatient care for alcohol abuse, substance abuse, depression, and attempted suicide.
   Results: Mean follow-up time was 8.6 years. Before surgery, there was no difference in inpatient treatment of alcohol abuse among patients who underwent gastric bypass or a restrictive procedure (incidence rate ratio, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8-1.4). After surgery, there was a 2-fold increased risk of inpatient care for alcohol abuse among patients who had GBS compared with those who had restrictive surgery (hazard ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.7-3.2).
   Conclusions and Relevance: Patients who had undergone GBS had more than double the risk of inpatient care for alcohol abuse postoperatively compared with patients undergoing a restrictive procedure, highlighting a need for healthcare professionals to be aware of this for early detection and treatment.

AB The importance of family and friends for patients with mental health problems has been recognized over the past few years. Significant others (SO) of patients admitted to a psychiatric ward specializing in affective disorders and suicide prevention filled in a self-rating questionnaire concerning their burden as SOs, the Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire (IEQ). The aims of this study were twofold: first, to test whether the questionnaire IEQ was applicable in psychiatric services in Sweden and second, to relate the IEQ results to socio-demographic data and diagnosis of the patients, and also to the situation of the SOs. We found the questionnaire useful. Nearly half of the SOs had difficulties in accepting and handling the patient's psychiatric problems. More than half had been worried that the patient was going to harm him/herself and because of this had kept close watch on the patient. Almost all SOs worried about the patient's general health and future. Most of them felt obliged to intervene in the patient's activities of daily living. More than half worried about the kind of medical and psychological treatment the patient was receiving. Most SOs concluded that they were burdened by their engagement in the patient. Our results were compared with a European study of schizophrenic patients also investigated with the IEQ. The comparison indicated that the perceived burden on SOs of these different kinds of psychiatric patients can be equally burdensome. SOs need information, help and support in their difficult support role.

AB Objectives Little is known about the long-term medical status of patients with severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) undergoing capsulotomy, a neurosurgical last-resort treatment. The present study used national registers to identify all operated patients with OCD in Sweden and evaluated their long-term medical status, including mortality, hospital admissions and psychotropic medication after capsulotomy for OCD.
   Design Register-based long-term follow-up cohort study.
   Participants We used the procedural and diagnostic codes in the Swedish National Patient Register to define the study population between 1970 and March 2013. Verification by manual review of medical records of the indication for surgery in those identified by the register yielded the final study cohort of 70 patients, followed 13-43 years after surgery. The sensitivity of the case selection method was 86%.
   Outcome measures We studied hospitalisation 5 years before and after surgery. Mortality data were derived from the Causes of Death Register. The Prescribed Drug Register was used to study psychotropic drug utilisation.
   Results By March 2013, 29 of the 70 patients were deceased. Their mean age at the time of death was 68 years (SD=14). Two patients had committed suicide and one had died of suspected suicide. Seventy per cent had been admitted to a psychiatric ward in the 5 years preceding surgery, and 84% in the first five postoperative years. Seventy-five per cent of those alive in 2012 were prescribed at least two psychotropic medications, often at high doses, the most common being antidepressants.
   Conclusions Malignant OCD has a poor long-term prognosis. Patients who are candidates for surgery should be informed that, while OCD symptoms may be ameliorated with surgery, they should not expect long-term freedom from medication and psychiatric care.

AB OBJECTIVE
   To assess the possible relationship between treatment with selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the occurrence of nocturia.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS
   An unselected group of adult men and women, living in the city of Ostersund, Sweden, were sent a postal questionnaire containing questions on somatic and mental health, sleep, sleepiness and nocturia. For depression diagnostics, the Major Depression Inventory (MDI) was used. Prescription data on antidepressant drugs were extracted from a register in the county of Jamtland, Sweden.
   RESULTS
   The questionnaire was completed by 1375 subjects, of whom 609 (44%) were men; the response rate was 69%. Prescription data were available for all respondents. The mean (<smallcapitals>sd</smallcapitals>) age of the men and women participating were 48.0 (18.2) and 50.1 (19.1) years, respectively. Two or more nocturnal micturition episodes were reported in 15.6% of the men and 16.5% of the women. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, independent correlates for two or more nocturnal voids vs no more than one were: age 45-59 years vs < 45 (odds ratio 2.9; 95% confidence interval 1.9-4.7); age 60-74 vs < 45 (6.0; 3.7-9.8); age > 75 vs < 45 (13.4; 7.9-22.6); major depression, yes vs no (4.6; 2.8-7.5); and being on treatment with SSRI, yes vs no (2.2; 1.1-4.5). Gender was deleted by the logistic regression model.
   CONCLUSION
   Major depression has previously been found to be associated with increased nocturnal micturition. In the present study, twice as many men and women treated with SSRIs as those not so treated had two or more nocturnal voids, after adjusting for major depression and age. The implication for the risk of fall injuries is discussed.

AB Major findings of the Survey of Living Conditions in the Arctic (SLiCA) are: (1) A combination of traditional activities and cash employment is the prevailing lifestyle of Arctic indigenous peoples; (2) family ties, social support of each other, and traditional activities have a lot to do with why indigenous people choose to remain in Arctic communities; (3) well-being is closely related to job opportunities, locally available fish and game, and a sense of local control. Well-being and depression (and related problems like suicide) are flip sides of the same coin. Improving well-being may reduce social problems; and, (4) health conditions vary widely in the Arctic: three-in-four Greenlandic Inuit self-rate their health as at least very good compared with one-in-two Canadian and Alaska Inuit and one-in-five Chukotka indigenous people. Findings are based on 7,200 interviews in a probability sample of Inupiat settlement regions of Alaska, the four Inuit settlement regions of Canada, all of Greenland, and the Anadyrskij, Anadyr, Shmidtovs, Beringovskij, Chukotskij, Iujl'tinskij, Bilibinskij, Chaunskij, Providenskij, Uel'Kal' districts of Chukotka. Indigenous people and researchers from Greenland, Russia, Canada, the United States, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland collaborated on all phases of the study.

AB We investigated the drugs used in the alleviation of pain and symptoms (APS) with a possible life-shortening side effect in six European countries' end-of-life care. We sent mail questionnaires to physicians who signed a representative sample of death certificates in each country. APS with a possible life-shortening effect occurred from 19 % of all deaths in Italy to 26 % in Denmark. Physicians usually administered opioids (from 76 % of APS cases in Italy to 96 % in The Netherlands), but the type of opioids and administration Practice differed markedly between countries. The doses of opioids given in the last 24 hours also varied signifcantly and were usually lower than 300 mg oral morphine equivalent (from 83 % of cases in Belgium to 93 % in Sweden). The highly variable results bring into question whether existing guidelines for pain relief were applied appropriately and to what extent unfounded concerns about the possible life-shortening effect of opioids resulted in less than optimal Symptom management in end-of-life care.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of self-assessed preoperative physical activity, alcohol consumption and smoking with self-assessed quality of life, negative intrusive thoughts and depressed mood after radical prostatectomy.Materials and methods: The Laparoscopic Prostatectomy Robot Open (LAPPRO) trial was a prospective, controlled, non-randomized longitudinal trial of patients (n=4003) undergoing radical prostatectomy at 14 centers in Sweden. Validated patient questionnaires were collected at baseline, and 3, 12 and 24 months after surgery.Results: Preoperative medium or high physical activity or low alcohol consumption or non-smoking was associated with a lower risk of depressed mood. High alcohol consumption was associated with increased risk of negative intrusive thoughts. Postoperatively, quality of life and negative intrusive thoughts improved gradually in all groups. Depressed mood appeared to be relatively unaffected.Conclusions: Evaluation of preoperative physical activity, tobacco and alcohol consumption habits can be used to identify patients with a depressed mood in need of psychological support before and immediately after surgery. Quality of life and intrusive thoughts improved postoperatively.

Nonfarming rural men had lower mortality than urban referents for all causes of deaths (HR 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70-0.94). Farmers and nonfarming rural men had significantly lower morbidity risks of cancer and of psychiatric disorders than urban referents. Farmers had significantly lower risk of endocrine disorders, cardiovascular disorders, and respiratory, disorders. In general, morbidity was lower among arming rural men compared with urban referents and was even lower among farmers. Urban referents had, however, significantly less musculoskeletal disorder Morbidity. All urban-rural factor and a Farming occupational or lifestyle factor results in lower mortality and morbidity rates except concerning musculoskeletal disorders.

AB Background Self-inflicted injury in youth has increased in many Western countries during recent decades. Education is the most influential societal determinant of living conditions in young people after early childhood. This study tested the hypothesis that school performance predicts self-inflicted injury.
   Methods A national cohort of 447929 children born during 1973-77 was followed prospectively in the National Patient Discharge Register from the end of their ninth and last year of compulsory school until 2001. Multivariate Cox analyses of proportional hazards were used to test hypotheses regarding grades in ninth grade as predictors of hospital admission due to self-inflicted injury.
   Results The risk of hospital admission because of self-inflicted injury increased steeply in a step-wise manner with decreasing grade point average. Hazard ratios were 6.2 (95% confidence interval 5.5-7.0) in those with the lowest level of grade point average compared with the highest. The risks were similar for women and men. Adjustment for potential socio-economic confounders in a multivariate proportional hazards regression analysis attenuated this strong gradient only marginally.
   Conclusion School performance is a strong factor for predicting future mental ill-health as expressed by self-inflicted injury.

AB BackgroundThere are few prospective, population-based studies on childhood parental death and psychiatric disorders in adulthood, and previous findings are inconclusive. This study investigated the association between parental death from natural and external (suicides, accidents or homicides) causes before 18years and the risk of clinical depression in young adults, in relation to age at loss and gender of both child and parent.
   MethodsIn this register-based study, a national cohort born in Sweden during 1973-1982 (n=862,554) was followed with regard to hospital admissions and outpatient care for depression during 2006-2013. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the impact of parental death, taking sociodemographic and parental psychosocial covariates into account.
   ResultsMaternal death from natural causes was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of outpatient care for depression of 1.19 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.40] in men and 1.15 (1.01-1.31) in women, after adjustment for sociodemographic confounders, with similar effect sizes for paternal natural death. Death from external causes consistently had higher effect size compared with natural deaths, in particular in relation to risk of hospital admissions for depression where they were as high as HR 3.23 (2.38-4.38) for men, and 1.79 (1.30-2.47) for women after a loss of a mother. Losing a parent in preschool age, compared with losing a parent as a teenager, was associated with higher risks of both hospitalization (p=.006) and outpatient care (p=.001) for depression.
   ConclusionsThis study indicates that parental loss to death from natural causes during childhood is associated with a small increased risk of long-term consequences for psychological health. Children who lose their parents to death from external causes, that is suicides, accidents or homicides, and children losing a parent in young ages are, however, at particular risk and should be given priority in preventive interventions after parental loss.

AB Background: In several countries, immigrants have higher disability pension (DP) rates than natives. Reasons for this are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate if the risk of diagnosis-specific DP differed in first, second, and second/intermediate generation immigrants compared to natives, in general and across regions of birth, and stratified by age.
   Methods: A population-based prospective cohort study of all 3,507,055 individuals aged 19-50 years and living in Sweden in 2004 with a 6-year follow-up period. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for mental and somatic DP were estimated by Cox regression for first, second, and second/intermediate generation immigrants compared to natives, across regions of birth and stratified by age.
   Results: After multivariate adjustment, HRs for both mental and somatic DP were higher at follow-up in the first generation compared to natives: mental HR 1.17 (CI 1.12-1.22) and somatic 1.15 (1.09-1.22) for individuals <35 years; 1.74 (1.69-1.79) and 1.70 (1.66-1.74) >= 35 years (median), respectively. Immigrants born in Europe outside EU25, and countries outside Europe had particularly elevated HRs. Also in the second generation, HRs were higher in mental 1.29 (1.21-1.37) and somatic DP: 1.30 (1.19-1.42) in those <35 years; and 1.18 (1.10-1.27); and 1.10 (1.03-1.17) for those >= 35 years, respectively. Among second generation immigrants there were no strong differences in HRs between regions of birth.
   Conclusions: Compared to natives, the risk of DP was higher in first and second generation immigrants. Higher estimates were seen for immigrants from Europe outside EU25 and from the rest of the world in the first generation. No considerable differences in estimates regarding mental or somatic DP diagnoses were found.

AB Background: Understanding the association between parental socioeconomic position and self-harm in adolescence is crucial due to its substantial magnitude and associated inequality. Most previous studies have been either of cross-sectional nature or based solely on self-reports or hospital treated self-harm. The aim of this study is to determine the association between parental socioeconomic position and self-harm among adolescents with a specific focus on gender and severity of self-harm.
   Methods: A total of 165,932 adolescents born 1988-1994 who lived in Stockholm at the age of 13 were followed in registers until they turned 18. Self-harm was defined as first time self-harm and severity of self-harm was defined as hospitalized or not. Socioeconomic position was defined by parental education and household income. Cox proportional hazards regression were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
   Results: Analyses showed an association between parental socioeconomic position and self-harm. Among adolescents with parents with primary and secondary education compared to tertiary parental education the HR were 1.10 (95% CI 0.97-1.24) and 1.16 (95% CI 1.08-1.25) respectively. Compared to the highest income category, adolescents from the lower income categories were 1.08 (95% CI 0.97-1.22) to 1.19 (95% CI 1.07-1.33) times more likely to self-harm. In gender-stratified analyses, an association was found only among girls. Further, restriction to severe cases eliminated the association.
   Conclusions: This study suggested that low parental socioeconomic position is associated with self-harm in adolescence, predominantly among girls. The desertion of an association among severe cases may be explained by differences in suicidal intent and underlying psychiatric diagnosis. Efforts to prevent self-harm should consider children with low parental socioeconomic position as a potential target group.

TI Mortality, risk factors and causes of death in Swedish patients with
   open tibial fractures - a nationwide study of 3,777 patients

LA English
DT Article
DE Causes of death; Epidemiology; Mortality; Open fracture; Tibial fracture
ID DIAPHYSEAL FRACTURES; HIP FRACTURE; OUTCOMES; AMPUTATION; SURVIVAL; COST
AB Background: Open tibia1 fractures are serious, complicated injuries. Previous studies suggested an increased risk of death, however, this has not been studied in large population-based settings. We aimed to analyze mortality including causes of death in all patients with open tibial fractures in Sweden. Moreover, we wanted to compare mortality rates with the Swedish population and determine whether treatment-related or demographic variables were independently associated with death.
   Method: We searched the Swedish National Hospital Discharge Register for all patients with open tibial fracture between 1998 and 2010. We collected the following variabies: age, gender, length of stay, mechanism of injury and treatment rendered. We then cross referenced the Swedish Cause of Death Register to determine the cause of death, if applicable. We compared mortality in the study population with population based mortality data from Statistics Sweden and determined whether variables were independently associated with death using regression analysis.
   Results: Of the 3777 open tibial fractures, 425 (11.3%) patients died. The most common causes of death for elderly patients were cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Patients aged 15-39 years succumbed to external causes (accidents, suicides or poisoning). Increasing age (OR 25.7 (95% CI 11.8-64.8) p < 0.001), length of hospital stay (HR 1.01, (95% CI 1.01-1.02,) p< 0.001), limb amputation (OR 4.8 (95% CI 1.86-11.1) p < 0.001) and cause of the accident were independently associated with an increased mortality.
   Conclusion: Patients with open tibial fractures have an increased risk of death compared with the general population in all age- and gender-groups. External causes of death are over-represented and indicate a subgroup with a risky behaviour among younger males. Elderly patients have an increased risk of dying comparable to hip fracture patients. They are at risk for cardiovascular and respiratory failure and should be treated with urgency, emphasizing the need for specialized geriatric trauma units.

AB Background: An increasing number of women are evaluated for potential breast cancer and may experience mental distress during evaluation. We aim to assess the risks of psychiatric disorders and cardiovascular diseases during the diagnostic workup of potential breast cancer.
   Methods: All women with a new diagnosis of unspecified lump in breast (N = 15,714), benign tumor or breast cancer in situ (N = 4435), or breast cancer (N = 8512) during 2005-2014 in Skane, Sweden, were considered as exposed to a breast diagnostic workup. We used multivariable Poisson regression to compare rates of psychiatric disorders and cardiovascular diseases during the 6 weeks before the date of diagnosis of these women with the corresponding rates of women not undergoing such workup. The commonest waiting time for breast cancer patients was 6 weeks during the study period. A within-individual comparison was performed to control for potential unmeasured time-stationary confounders.
   Results: Compared to the reference, we found a higher rate of psychiatric disorders during the 6 weeks before diagnosis of benign tumor or breast cancer in situ (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 1.5) and breast cancer (IRR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.6). A higher rate was also noted for cardiovascular diseases (IRR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.6 for benign tumor or breast cancer in situ, and IRR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.8 to 2.0 for breast cancer). The rate increases for breast cancer were greater comparing a diagnostic workup due to symptoms to a workup due to screening. Little rate increase of neither psychiatric disorders nor cardiovascular diseases was noted during the 6 weeks before the diagnosis of unspecified lump in breast. The within-individual comparison largely confirmed these findings.
   Conclusions: Women with benign and malignant breast tumor had increased rates of psychiatric disorders and cardiovascular diseases during the waiting for a final diagnosis.

AB The worldwide financial crisis during recent years has raised concerns of negative public health effects. This is notably evident in southern Europe. In Greece, where the financial austerity has been especially pronounced, the prevalence of mental health problems including depression and suicide has increased, and outbreaks of infectious diseases have risen. The main objective in this study was to investigate whether different indicators of health and stress levels measured by a new biomarker based on cortisol in human hair were different amongst comparable Greek and Swedish young adults, considering that Sweden has been much less affected by the recent economic crises. In this cross-sectional comparative study, young adults from the city of Athens in Greece (n = 124) and from the city of Linkoping in Sweden (n = 112) participated. The data collection comprised answering a questionnaire with different health indicators and hair samples being analyzed for the stress hormone cortisol, a biomarker with the ability to retrospectively measure long-term cortisol exposure. The Greek young adults reported significantly higher perceived stress (p < 0.0001), had experienced more serious life events (p = 0.002), had lower hope for the future (p < 0.0001), and had significantly more widespread symptoms of depression (p < 0.0001) and anxiety (p < 0.0001) than the Swedes. But, the Greeks were found to have significantly lower cortisol levels (p < 0.0001) than the Swedes, and this difference was still significant in a multivariate regression (p < 0.0001), after adjustments for potential intervening variables. A variety of factors related to differences in the physical or sociocultural environment between the two sites, might possibly explain this finding. However, a potential biological mechanism is that long-term stress exposure could lead to a lowering of the cortisol levels. This study points out a possible hypothesis that the cortisol levels of the Greek young adults might have been suppressed and their HPA-axis down-regulated after living in a stressful environment with economic and social pressure.

AB Objectives We extended a cohort study of Swedish chimney sweeps and prolonged follow-up in order to increase power and study those first employed after 1950 when oil began to replace wood as a main fuel for heating in Sweden.
   Methods Male Swedish chimney sweeps who were members of the national trade union in 1981-2006 were identified (n=1087) and included to a previous cohort of those employed in 1918-1980 (n=5287). All employment histories were updated, and the total extended cohort (n=6374) was linked to the registers of Causes of Death and Total Population and followed for mortality from 1952 through 2006. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were estimated using the Swedish male population as reference.
   Results 1841 observed deaths resulted in an SMR for all causes of deaths of 1.29 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.36). Mortality was significantly increased for all malignant tumours, oesophageal cancer, bowel cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, alcoholism, ischaemic heart disease, non-malignant respiratory diseases, liver cirrhosis, external causes and suicides. The lung cancer SMR remained increased, although attenuated, after adjustment for group-level smoking data, SMR of 1.52 (95% CI 1.26 to 1.89). Duration of employment showed no consistent evidence of dose-response associations. Alcohol-related deaths (liver cirrhosis and alcoholism) were not increased among those employed >30 years. Mortality among those employed after 1950 was similar to that of the entire cohort.
   Conclusions Chimney sweeps are exposed to high levels of toxic substances in the occupation, but excess alcohol and smoking habits were also observed, and the results must be interpreted cautiously. However, group-level data on tobacco smoking indicated that the lung cancer excess only to some extent could be explained by smoking habits, and the increased mortality from oesophageal cancer and ischaemic heart disease among chimney sweeps employed >30 years is less likely to be caused by excess alcohol habits.

AB Objectives: To determine the incidence and risk factors of early post-traumatic seizures (PTS) in Nigerian subjects.
   Methods: Subjects were recruited consecutively, classified as mild, moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and followed for 168 hrs for development of seizures.
   Results: There were 266 subjects, 213 (80%) males and 53 (20%) females, with mean age 31 years (sd 18, range 1-80, median 30). Causes of TBI were motor traffic accident (MTA) related in 217 (82%), falls in 25 (9%), struck by objects in 15 (5%), firearms in 4 (2%), sports and recreation in 3 (1%), and failed suicide in 2 (1%). Cumulative incidence of early PTS was 119% (95% CI 80-156). Risk factors were age <= 12 years, severity of TBI, history of seizures, and TBI at weekend, but gender and GCS were not. Skeletomotor palsy was independently associated with early PTS.
   Conclusions: Incidence of early PTS is high in this population, probably due to the relatively high proportion of severe TBI. Risk factors are TBI severity, young age, history of seizures, and TBI at weekends. The best preventive strategy is reduction of MTA, which causes over 80% of TBI. Prophylactic anti-seizure therapy may benefit subjects with severe TBI and skeletomotor deficits.

SO FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE human trafficking; modern-day slavery; prostitution; melodrama; women's
   representation
AB The issue of human trafficking is frequently represented in visual images on television and in cinema. These narratives often focus on the selling of young women into the sex industry. One of the most prominent productions on the subject is the Swedish film Lilya 4-Ever (2002). Written and directed by Lukas Moodysson, the film tells the story of a tough adolescent, Lilya. Abandoned by her mother and left to fend for herself, Lilya turns to prostitution in order to survive. She is later trafficked to Sweden. She eventually commits suicide. Set in an unnamed post-Soviet city, the film reflects the reality of the increase in trafficked women from this region since the collapse of the USSR. The article analyzes Moodysson's film as an important model for depicting trafficking. Specific focus is given to the way the director defines Lilya and her milieu and engages seriously with issues of globalization, poverty, post-Soviet realities, and the very real issue of human trafficking. Most notably, Moodysson's film offers a depiction of trafficking that eschews any sexual objectification of the film's protagonist and combines progressive filmmaking with a melodramatic narrative to create a film that inspires extra-diegetic activism. Lilya 4-Ever is an emotionally impactful narrative, a modern-day melodrama for the twenty-first century.

TI Does Beck's Hopelessness Scale really measure several components?
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID WEIGHTED LEAST-SQUARES; MODEL
AB Background. Much of the interest in hopelessness stems from the key role it plays in the prediction of suicidal behaviour. To measure hopelessness, Beck et al. (1974) developed a 20-item scale (BHS), applied exploratory factor analysis and argued that the scale measures three specific components (affective, motivational and cognitive). Subsequent exploratory factor analyses identified two, three or more factors underlying the scale.
   Methods. several confirmatory factor analyses (LISREL) were run on data on 324 suicide attempters in Sweden in order to test the hypothesized factorial structures and to investigate the psychometric properties of the individual items.
   Results. Neither three- nor two-factor models fitted the data. A simpler structure was sufficient to account for the observed correlations between most of the items. This led to the development of several variants of a one-factor model, each a combination of affective, motivational and cognitive items. The number of items varied between four and 15.
   Conclusions. Our findings suggest that most of the items (15) of Beck's Hopelessness Scale measure one factor. They further suggest that the number of items could considerably be reduced. A four-item scale produced an excellent fit. It includes positive and negative items describing the perception of the future in terms of success, darkness, lack of opportunity and faith. It might even be possible to replace the total scale with one item only, "my future seems dark to me".

AB Previous findings have suggested that the loss of a family member is associated with mortality among bereaved family members. The least-studied familial relationship in the bereavement literature is that of siblings, although loss of a sibling may also involve health consequences. The authors conducted a follow-up study based on data from the Swedish total population register, covering the period 19812002. Using Cox regression, mortality risk ratios for bereaved and nonbereaved persons aged 1869 years were estimated. All-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality (unnatural causes, natural causes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, suicide, accidents, and all other causes) were examined. In men, the mortality risk for bereaved persons versus nonbereaved persons was 1.26 (95 confidence interval: 1.22, 1.30), and in women it was 1.33 (95 confidence interval: 1.28, 1.39). An elevated mortality risk associated with a siblings death was found in all age groups studied, but the association was generally stronger at younger ages and could be observed predominantly after more than 1 year of follow-up. There was also an increased mortality risk if the sibling had died from a discordant main cause, which may strengthen the possibility that the association observed is not due to confounding alone.

AB Objectives: To assess the association between fear of crime and/or psychological and/or physical abuse in relation to self-reported physical and psychological health, using a large representative sample of elderly women and men in Sweden.
   Study design: Cross-sectional national survey.
   Methods: Data were taken from a nationwide representative public health survey (2006). Men and women between the ages of 65 and 84 years were selected for the present analyses (4386 men and 4974 women). The response rate for this age group was 59% for men and 70% for women.
   Results: Psychological and physical abuse against elderly women and men led to higher odds ratios for negative health outcomes, independently of socio-economic status. Strong correlation was found between psychological abuse and negative health outcomes in both men and women, while the correlation was less strong for physical abuse, especially among women. The men had high odds ratios for suicidal thoughts and even for attempted suicide in connection with physical and psychological abuse and fear of crime.
   Conclusions: The study provides representative results addressing an extensive negative health outcome panorama caused by fear of crime and exposure to abuse. (C) 2012 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study uses data collected in 1996 by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. By means of interviews with 1980 foreign-born immigrants, an attempt was made to determine the impact of a) migration status (country of birth/ethnicity), b) exposure to violence, c) Antonovsky's sense of coherence, d) acculturation status (knowledge of Swedish), e) sense of control over one's life, f) economic difficulties, and g) education, both on psychological distress (using General Health Questionnaire 12) and psychosomatic complaints (daytime fatigue, sleeping difficulties, and headache/migraine). iranians and Chileans (age-adjusted) were at great risk for psychological distress as compared with Poles, whereas Turks and Kurds exhibited no such risk. When the independent factors were included in the model, the migration status effect decreased to insignificance (with the exception of Iranian men). A low sense of coherence, poor acculturation (men only), poor sense of control, and economic difficulties were strongly associated with the outcomes, generally accounting for a convincing link between migration status and psychological distress. Furthermore, a low sense of coherence, poor acculturation (men only), poor sense of control, and economic difficulties in exile seemed to be stronger risk factors for psychological distress in this group than exposure to violence before migration.

AB Aims: While past research has shown that school performance is associated with some specific health outcomes in adulthood, few studies have taken a general approach to the link between school performance and adult disease. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate sixth grade school performance in relation to disease-specific hospital care in adulthood and, moreover, to examine whether other conditions in childhood could account for any such associations. Methods: The data used was the Stockholm Birth Cohort, consisting of 14,294 individuals born in 1953. Associations between school performance and disease-specific hospital care were analysed by means of Cox regression. Results: Poor school performance was shown to be linked to a variety of diseases in adulthood, e.g. drug dependence, stomach ulcer, cerebrovascular diseases, and accidents. Some differences according to gender were found. Most associations, but not all, were explained by the simultaneous inclusion of various family-related and individual factors (e.g. social class, cognitive ability, and behavioural problems). Conclusions: In sum, the results of this study suggest that poor school performance may be an essential part of risk clustering in childhood with important implications for the individual's health career.

AB In a prospective hospital-based cohort study, we addressed the question of severity and outcome of antidepressant poisonings in patients who attended the Loghman-Hakim Hospital Poison Center, the only national center in Tehran dedicated for detoxification. The aim of the study was to find out if tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) intoxications require more therapeutic efforts than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) intoxications. The study was applied over a 7-week period (28 March-20 May 2006). From 3578 intoxications, 334 patients with antidepressant or lithium self-poisoning were identified (9.3% of all poisoning cases; 233 females, 101 males; median age 24 years, min 13, max 70). Compared to SSRI single-substance intoxications (n = 17), TCA single-substance intoxications (n = 73) were associated with: (1) a significantly lower level of consciousness (P = 0.005); (2) a significantly higher admission frequency (80.8 vs. 35.3%; P < 0.001); and (3) a higher intubation frequency (13.7 vs. 0%; P = ns). SSRI multiple-substance intoxications were associated with a significantly lower level of consciousness than SSRI single-substance intoxications (P = 0.042), while there was no significant difference between TCA multiple-and single-substance intoxications. This study suggests that an overdose with SSRIs results in a more favourable clinical outcome than an overdose with TCAs.

AB A divergence in earlier multiple sclerosis (MS) mortality rates observed within Europe, prompted us to determine the MS mortality rate in Austria and several European countries. Our aim was to examine the temporal and geographical variations within Austria and to determine future MS mortality rates based on a projection model. MS mortality data set, differentiated by age groups, sex, and region at death for the period 1970-2001 were obtained. Prognostic MS mortality trends for the period 2002-2020 were estimated using the simultaneous multiple cause-delay (SIMCAD) method. Our findings indicate a decline (47%) in the MS mortality rate from 1.41 (1970-79) to 0.96 (1980-89) and 0.70 (1990-2001) per 100 000 in Austria during the 32-year period observed. Conversely, the scenarios of our projection for the period 2002-2020, reveal an increasing MS mortality rate. The median age at death because of MS increased with 0.7 years for men and 2.9 years for women during the observed period (1970-2001). Austria, like many other European countries, has experienced a decreasing MS mortality rate over the last three decades. An increased MS mortality rate is however expected over the next decades in Austria. This increase will be most prominent in the elderly population cohorts because of demographic shifts.

AB Continuous deep sedation (CDS) is sometimes used to treat refractory symptoms in terminally ill patients. The aim of this paper was to estimate the frequency and characteristics of CDS in six European countries: Belgium, Denmark, Italy, The Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. Deaths reported to death registries were sampled and the reporting doctors received a mailed questionnaire about the medical decision making that preceded the death of the patient. The total number of deaths studied was 20,480. The response rate ranged between 44 % (Italy) and 75 % (The Netherlands). Of all deaths, CDS was applied in 2.5 % in Denmark and up to 8.5 % in Italy. Of all patients receiving CDS, 35 % (Italy) and up to 64 % (Denmark and The Netherlands) did not receive artificial nutrition or hydration. Patients who received CDS were more often male, younger than 80 years old, more likely to have had cancer, and died more often in a hospital compared to nonsudden deaths without CDS. The high variability of frequency and characteristics of CDS in the studied European countries points out the importance of medical education and scientific debate on this issue.

AB Previous studies have lacked sufficient power to assess associations between early-life socioeconomic position and adult cause-specific mortality. The authors examined associations of parental social class at age 0-16 years with mortality among 1,824,064 Swedes born in 1944-1960. Females and males from manual compared with nonmanual childhood social classes were more likely to die from smoking-related cancers, stomach cancer, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Males from manual compared with nonmanual social classes were more likely to die from unintentional injury, homicide, and alcoholic cirrhosis. The association with stomach cancer was little affected by adjustment for parental later-life and own adult social class or education. For other outcomes, educational attainment resulted in greater attenuation of associations than did adjustment for adult social class. Early-life social class was not related to suicide or to melanoma, colon, breast, brain, or lymphatic cancers or to leukemia. With the exception of stomach cancer, caused by Helicobacter pylori infection acquired in childhood, poorer social class in early life was associated with diseases largely caused by behavioral risk factors such as smoking, physical inactivity, and an unhealthy diet. Educational attainment may be important in reducing the health inequalities associated with early-life disadvantage.

AB Background: The safe community initiative was developed by the world health organization following the increasing trend in the frequency of injuries. Similar to most countries, it was implemented in Iran to improve community safety. The aim of this study was to quantitatively analyze the Iranian designated safe communities.
   Methods: Using a descriptive design, this study analyzed the reports by Iranian designated safe communities (n, 33) in 2016. Data were extracted from the website of WHO collaborating centre on community safety promotion in Sweden, using an objective-based questionnaire. Microsoft Access 2010 was used for data management, and SPSS version 21 was utilized for data analysis.
   Results: The Iranian designated safe communities were all located in 3 out of 31 provinces of Iran, namely Tehran, Fars, and Khorasan Razavi. All the safe communities had covered traffic safety. In total, 69.7% of the safe communities reported the incorporation of occupational and sport safetyactivities, as well as violence and suicide prevention interventions. No significant difference was found among provinces in the frequency distribution of improved safety issues (P > 0.05). Moreover, 26 (78.8%) communities reported having an injury surveillance system.
   Conclusions: Iranian safe communities used a set of strategies to improve community safety. Accordingly, the neglected areas must be acknowledged by other interested communities. Moreover, rigorous scientific studies are required to assess the effectiveness of interventions.

AB Aim: To investigate risks of placements in out-of-home care for non-European adoptees.
   Methods: Intercountry adoptees born outside Europe 1973-1984 (n = 16 522) were compared with same age peers from the majority population (n = 1 026 523) using national demographic and child welfare registers. Multivariate analyses were performed using logistic regression models, and odds ratios (OR) for different forms of out-of-home care placements were calculated.
   Results: After adjustments for socio-demographic background variables, the OR:s for placements of intercountry adoptees in residential care from age 10 were 5.1 (95% CI 4.6-5.8) and 3.0 (95% CI 2.6-3.6) for placements in foster care from age 10. For placements in all forms of out-of home care up to age 10, the odds were on par with the majority population. Higher child age at adoption, origin from Latin America, single parent adoption and maternal age above 35 at birth of the child were identified as significant predictors of out-of-home care from age 10.
   Conclusion: Intercountry adoptees emerge as a risk group for placements in out-of home care during adolescence, especially for entries into residential care (in Sweden usually triggered by persistent behaviour problems).

DT Article
ID MOTOR
AB In 1997 the Swedish Parliament decided, in accordance with the so-called Vision Zero, that one official goal for the national traffic safety effort is that the number of traffic fatalities in the year 2007 must not exceed 270. In order to monitor efforts toward this hard-won goal, it is of course of utmost importance that official statistics on traffic deaths are reliable.
   In a meticulous analysis of all 580 officially registered traffic deaths in Sweden in 1999, we found that 490 were true accidental deaths, while 18 were suicides, 12 were deaths due to indeterminate causes, 59 were natural deaths and 1 case was not possible to evaluate due to missing data. Thus, only 84% of the officially registered >>accidental traffic deaths<< were bona fide accidents. In order to enhance the reliability of the official statistics, we suggest that
   - regulations concerning police investigation and medicolegal autopsy of all unnatural deaths be adhered to
   - all deaths reported to the Swedish National Road Administration should be checked in the database of autopsied cases in the National Board of Forensic Medicine in order to exclude natural deaths
   - the time delay (1.5 years) to complete the official Cause-of-Death Register be shortened
   - criteria for the classification of manner of death in "borderline" cases be suggested for international acceptance.

AB Context: Mental disorders have been associated with increased mortality, but the evidence is primarily based on hospital admissions for psychoses. The underlying mechanisms are unclear.
   Objectives: To investigate whether the risks of death associated with mental disorders diagnosed in young men are similar to those associated with admission for these disorders and to examine the role of confounding or mediating factors.
   Design: Prospective cohort study in which mental disorders were assessed by psychiatric interview during a medical examination on conscription for military service at a mean age of 18.3 years and data on psychiatric hospital admissions and mortality during a mean 22.6 years of follow-up were obtained from national registers.
   Setting: Sweden.
   Participants: A total of 1 095 338 men conscripted between 1969 and 1994.
   Main Outcome Measure: All-cause mortality according to diagnoses of schizophrenia, other nonaffective psychoses, bipolar or depressive disorders, neurotic and adjustment disorders, personality disorders, and alcohol-related or other substance use disorders at conscription and on hospital admission.
   Results: Diagnosis of mental disorder at conscription or on hospital admission was associated with increased mortality. Age-adjusted hazard ratios according to diagnoses at conscription ranged from 1.81 (95% CI, 1.54-2.10) (depressive disorders) to 5.55 (95% CI, 1.79-17.2) (bipolar disorders). The equivalent figures according to hospital diagnoses ranged from 5.46 (95% CI, 5.06-5.89) (neurotic and adjustment disorders) to 11.2 (95% CI, 10.412.0) (other substance use disorders) in men born from 1951 to 1958 and increased in men born later. Adjustment for early-life socioeconomic status, body mass index, and blood pressure had little effect on these associations, but they were partially attenuated by adjustment for smoking, alcohol intake, intelligence, educational level, and late-life socioeconomic status. These associations were not primarily due to deaths from suicide.
   Conclusion: The increased risk of premature death associated with mental disorder is not confined to those whose illness is severe enough for hospitalization or those with psychotic or substance use disorders.

TI Physicians' practices when frustrating patients' needs: a comparative
   study of restrictiveness in offering abortion and sedation therapy
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID DEATH; SUICIDE; ETHICS
AB In this paper it is argued that physicians' restrictive attitudes in offering abortions during 1946-1965 in Sweden were due to their private values. The values, however, were rarely presented openly. Instead physicians' values influenced their assessment of the facts presented-that is, the women's' trustworthiness. In this manner the physicians were able to conceal their private values and impede the women from getting what they wanted and needed. The practice was concealed from both patients and physicians and never publicly discussed. It is also argued that a similar tacit practice could currently be applied by palliative care physicians. Such practice might allow palliative care physicians to be restrictive when offering sedation therapy without appearing paternalistic or declaring conscientious objections. However, the practice runs counter to patients' right to participate in making decisions. The women seeking abortion began to oppose the situation and eventually a new abortion law was introduced 1975. Patients at the end of life will never be able to protest against palliative care physicians' restrictive attitudes. This is a vulnerable and weak group, unable to lodge complaints after the treatment. In order to respect patients' autonomy, even suffering patients at the end of their lives, it is suggested that physicians should openly declare their values when it comes to providing treatments that might shorten life. Such transparency might facilitate more genuine shared decision-making and accordingly less suboptimal end-of-life care.

AB Objective The aim of this study was to investigate outcomes of child psychiatric outpatient treatment as usual and to identify outcome predictors, with special regard to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mood disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and conduct disorder. Method Routinely collected data from 12613 outpatients between July 2006 and January 2010 in Stockholm, Sweden were analysed. The outcome measure was change in Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) ratings between first visit and case closure (CGAS). Results CGAS improved during the course of treatment across all diagnostic groups, ranging from a mean change of 4 (mental retardation) to 16 (suicide attempts). CGAS was two times higher in the mood disorder group compared with the ADHD group. In the mood disorder group, several psychotherapies were associated with better outcome but not medication. In the ADHD group, psychotherapeutic interventions were also associated with better outcome, but those who received treatment with central stimulants received less non-medical interventions. Conclusion Whereas the functional impairment and the level of improvement in mood disorder corresponded to previous efficacy studies, the ADHD patients were more impaired and improved less after treatment. This should prompt a critical discussion as to whether ADHD patients receive the best available treatment in CAMHS in Stockholm and elsewhere.

AB Migrant studies in the United States (US) have rarely covered the Middle Eastern population (ME), and have never distinguished the first and second generations born in the US. This study aims to describe the mortality patterns of ME immigrants by origin, acculturation, and generation. Death certificates issued from 1997 through 2004 were used to calculate, for Middle Eastern immigrants, the proportional odds ratios (POR) for major causes of death, with comparison to non-Hispanic Whites born in the US to US-born parents. First generation immigrants had higher odds for colorectal cancers, diabetes, and diseases of the heart, while their odds for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and suicide were lower. Men had higher odds for all cancers combined, cancers of the lymphatics, and pancreas. Women had lower odds for lung cancer, and dementia, and higher odds for breast cancer. The second generation men had higher odds for all cancers combined, and diseases of the heart, whereas women had lower odds for lung cancer and cerebrovascular accidents. Higher odds for colorectal cancers and lower odds for COPD were noted in both sexes. Some of the observed differences may be based on ethnic characteristics, including genetic makeup, early exposures, and culturally determined values. Time since immigration is associated with convergence of most odds to that of the native population.

AB Objectives. We examined the relationship between unemployment and mortality in Germany, a coordinated market economy, and the United States, a liberal market economy.
   Methods. We followed 2 working-age cohorts from the German Socioeconomic Panel and the US Panel Study of Income Dynamics from 1984 to 2005. We defined unemployment as unemployed at the time of survey. We used discrete-time survival analysis, adjusting for potential confounders.
   Results. There was an unemployment mortality association among Americans (relative risk [RR] = 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.7, 3.4), but not among Germans (RR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.0, 2.0). In education-stratified models, there was an association among minimum-skilled (RR = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.4, 4.7) and medium-skilled (RR =2.4; 95% CI = 1.5, 3.8) Americans, but not among minimum- and medium-skilled Germans. There was no association among high-skilled Americans, but an association among high-skilled Germans (RR = 3.0; 95% CI = 1.3, 7.0), although this was limited to those educated in East Germany. Minimum- and medium-skilled unemployed Americans had the highest absolute risks of dying.
   Conclusions. The higher risk of dying for minimum- and medium-skilled unemployed Americans, not found among Germans, suggests that the unemployment mortality relationship may be mediated by the institutional and economic environment.

AB The potential role of psychological stress in pancreatic cancer has rarely been investigated in epidemiologic studies. During 1991-2009, we conducted a nested case-control study based on Swedish national population and health registers to investigate whether severe psychological stress induced by the death of a child was associated with subsequent risk of pancreatic cancer. The study included 16,522 cases and 82,107 controls who were matched to the cases on sex and year of birth. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Overall, loss of a child was associated with an odds ratio of 1.09 for pancreatic cancer (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 1.17). The risk elevation was mainly seen during the first 5 years after the loss (odds ratio (OR) = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.45) and for loss of a child due to suicide (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.46). The association was statistically significant among women but not among men, and it appeared stronger for early-onset pancreatic cancer. Persons with a history of psychiatric illness had the greatest risk increase after child loss (OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.17, 1.76). Although other explanations are possible, our findings provide some evidence that psychological stress may be associated with pancreatic cancer.

AB The objective of the study was to analyse 10-year mortality among persons with schizophrenia from an epidemiological perspective. This cohort study included all persons with schizophrenia ( n = 255) living in the northern catchment area in Uppsala in 1991, and 1275 subjects from the national population register matched for sex, age and living area. The prevalence of schizophrenia was 0.37% and the mortality rate for individuals with schizophrenia was higher than for referents: 23.0% vs. 11.2%. The higher mortality among those with schizophrenia was mainly the result of unnatural causes and cardiovascular disease, especially in men. Excess mortality from cardiovascular disease was more pronounced in middle age, irrespective of gender. Multivariate analysis revealed higher mortality among individuals with schizophrenia living in the city than among those living in less urbanized areas. People with schizophrenia die more often than those without schizophrenia from unnatural causes or circulatory diseases. Individuals with schizophrenia die sooner from circulatory diseases than those without schizophrenia. Having schizophrenia and living in the city also results in higher mortality than having schizophrenia and living in other areas. The risk of early death from circulatory disease needs to be studied in more detail to reveal the potential respective contributions of intrinsic patient vulnerability, lifestyle factors and side-effects from psychotropic drugs.

   SUICIDE; GENDER; CLASSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; RISK; MENS
AB Background: Many minority group patients who attend primary health care are depressed. To identify a depressive state when GPs see patients from other cultures than their own can be difficult because of cultural and gender differences in expressions and problems of communication. The aim of this study was to explore and analyse how GPs think and deliberate when seeing and treating patients from foreign countries who display potential depressive features.
   Methods: The data were collected in focus groups and through individual interviews with GPs in northern Sweden and analysed by qualitative content analysis.
   Results: In the analysis three themes, based on various categories, emerged; "Realizing the background", "Struggling for clarity" and "Optimizing management". Patients' early life events of importance were often unknown which blurred the accuracy. Reactions to trauma, cultural frictions and conflicts between the new and old gender norms made the diagnostic process difficult. The patient-doctor encounter comprised misconceptions, and social roles in the meetings were sometimes confused. GPs based their judgement mainly on clinical intuition and the established classification of depressive disorders was discussed. Tools for management and adequate action were diffuse.
   Conclusion: Dialogue about patients' illness narratives and social context are crucial. There is a need for tools for multicultural, general practice care in the depressive spectrum. It is also essential to be aware of GPs' own conceptions in order to avoid stereotypes and not to under- or overestimate the occurrence of depressive symptoms

AB Background The death of a young child is so devastating that it can increase the risk of mortality in the grieving parent. Little is known about the impact of an adult child's death on the health of parents.
   Methods The authors conducted a follow-up study between 1980 and 2002 based on a linked-registers database that contains the total Swedish population. The authors examined mortality from all causes, natural causes and unnatural causes among parents following the death of children aged 10-49 years.
   Results An increased mortality risk (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.68) in mothers following the death of a minor child (10-17 years) was found and especially following unnatural deaths (primarily accidents and suicides). Mothers also experienced elevated mortality following the death of an adult child aged 18-25 years (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.29). Bereavement effects among fathers were more attenuated and chiefly found after >8 years of follow-up. From a short-term perspective (1-3 years), the death of an adult child (>25 years) was somewhat protective for parents. However, over longer follow-up periods, it approached (4-8 years) and exceeded (>8 years) the death risk of the general population.
   Conclusions These findings corroborate and extend earlier findings suggesting elevated mortality risks also following the death of an adult child.

DT Article
ID MUSIC PREFERENCES; RAP MUSIC; ADOLESCENTS; PERSONALITY; REGRESSION;
   IDENTITY; SUICIDE; ISSUES; GRADES; MEDIA
AB Objectives
   Cultural behaviors are theoretically linked to future life chances but empirical literature is scant. We use heavy metal as an example of cultural identities due to its high salience. We first assess the social morphology of metal preferences in terms of socio-economic and socio-structural positions, and then asses the short term outcomes of being a heavy metal fan on education and health behaviors.
   Methods
   The analysis was based on a representative random stratified sample of 23-year-olds of native Swedish, Iranian, and Yugoslavian background in contemporary Sweden (n = 2,232). Linear probability models with multiple imputation were used to calculate preferences for metal music and the association of metal preferences with subsequent outcomes.
   Results
   In contrast to many prior studies, we find that the preference for heavy metal is not structured by social background or neighborhood context in Swedish adolescents. Poor school grades tend to make them more prone to like metal, but net of previous grades, social background, personality, personal network, and neighborhood characteristics, metal fans have substantially lower transition rates into higher education.
   Discussion
   The study suggest that metal preferences appears rather unsystematically with few important predictors, and is linked to lower education attainments in the short run. While these findings are specific to heavy metal as a certain type of culture and to Swedish adolescents, we suggest that they are indicative of how cultural consumption may play a role for life-chances.

LA English

ID INJURY MORTALITY; AREA ANALYSIS; HEALTH; INCOME; RISK
AB Study objective: To describe the contribution of social conditions for the main causes of injury deaths in Swedish children and youth aged 5-25 years.
   Design: Cohort study. All children below 15 years of age that resided in Sweden 1985 were followed up during 1991-1995. Injury deaths were recorded from The National Cause of Death Register. Information on parental social determinants were collected from various national registers. Connections between the social determinants and an injury death outcome were analysed in multivariate, Cox regression models.
   Main results: In total 1474 injury deaths were recorded during approximately 8 million person years. In a regression model, with control for sex, year of birth, and residency (urban/rural), the aetiological fraction for parental SES, maternal country of birth, family situation, parental risk factors, and all these factors combined were 13%, 6%, 1.4%, 1.3%, and 19%, respectively. Similar regression models were studied separately for each of the main causes of injury death. The parental social determinants explained 58% of all homicides, 47% of all motor traffic injuries, and 30% of all other traffic injuries while the suicide rate was not affected by these determinants. Parental socioeconomic status was the single most important parental determinant for all major causes of injury.
   Conclusions: There was a wide variation of the aetiological fractions of parental social determinants for different causes of injury death. This variation might be used to further investigate the social aetiology of injuries.

AB Background High mortality rates have been reported in people released from prison compared with the general population. However, few studies have investigated potential risk factors associated with these high rates, especially psychiatric determinants. We aimed to investigate the association between psychiatric disorders and mortality in people released from prison in Sweden.
   Methods We studied all people who were imprisoned since Jan 1, 2000, and released before Dec 31, 2009, in Sweden for risks of all-cause and external-cause (accidents, suicide, homicide) mortality after prison release. We obtained data for substance use disorders and other psychiatric disorders, and criminological and sociodemographic factors from population-based registers. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) by Cox regression, and then used them to calculate population attributable fractions for post-release mortality. To control for potential familial confounding, we compared individuals in the study with siblings who were also released from prison, but without psychiatric disorders. We tested whether any independent risk factors improved the prediction of mortality beyond age, sex, and criminal history.
   Findings We identified 47326 individuals who were imprisoned. During a median follow-up time of 5.1 years (IQR 2.6-7.5), we recorded 2874 (6%) deaths after release from prison. The overall all-cause mortality rate was 1205 deaths per 100 000 person-years. Substance use disorders significantly increased the rate of all-cause mortality (alcohol use: adjusted HR 1. 62, 95% CI 1.48-1.77; drug use: 1. 67, 1.53-1.83), and the association was independent of sociodemographic, criminological, and familial factors. We identified no strong evidence that other psychiatric disorders increased mortality after we controlled for potential confounders. In people released from prison, 925 (34%) of all-cause deaths in men and 85 (50%) in women were potentially attributable to substance use disorders. Substance use disorders were also an independent determinant of external-cause mortality, with population attributable fraction estimates at 42% in men and 70% in women. Substance use disorders significantly improved the prediction of external-cause mortality, in addition to sociodemographic and criminological factors.
   Interpretation Interventions to address substance use disorders could substantially decrease the burden of excess mortality in people released from prison, but might need to be provided beyond the immediate period after release.

AB IMPORTANCE Preterm birth is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. However, previous studies have been unable to rigorously examine whether confounding factors cause these associations rather than the harmful effects of being born preterm.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate the extent to which the associations between early gestational age and offspring mortality and morbidity are the result of confounding factors by using a quasi-experimental design, the sibling-comparison approach, and by controlling for statistical covariates that varied within families.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A population-based cohort study, combining Swedish registries to identify all individuals born in Sweden from 1973 to 2008 (3 300 708 offspring of 1 736 735 mothers) and link them with multiple outcomes.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Offspring mortality (during infancy and throughout young adulthood) and psychiatric (psychotic or bipolar disorder, autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, suicide attempts, substance use, and criminality), academic (failing grades and educational attainment), and social (partnering, parenthood, low income, and social welfare benefits) outcomes through 2009.
   RESULTS In the population, there was a dose-response relationship between early gestation and the outcome measures. For example, extreme preterm birth (23-27 weeks of gestation) was associated with infant mortality (odds ratio, 288.1; 95% CI, 271.7-305.5), autism (hazard ratio [HR], 3.2; 95% CI, 2.6-4.0), low educational attainment (HR, 1.7; 1.5-2.0), and social welfare benefits (HR, 1.3; 1.2-1.5) compared with offspring born at term. The associations between early gestation and mortality and psychiatric morbidity generally were robust when comparing differentially exposed siblings and controlling for statistical covariates, whereas the associations with academic and some social problems were greatly or completely attenuated in the fixed-effects models.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The mechanisms responsible for the associations between preterm birth and mortality and morbidity are outcome-specific. Associations between preterm birth and mortality and psychiatric morbidity are largely independent of shared familial confounds and measured covariates, consistent with a causal inference. However, some associations, particularly predicting suicide attempt, educational attainment, and social welfare benefits, are the result of confounding factors. The findings emphasize the importance of both reducing preterm birth and providing wraparound services to all siblings in families with an offspring born preterm.

AB IMPORTANCE A previous register-based study reported elevated all-cause mortality in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but cause-specific risks and the potential associations of psychiatric comorbidities remain unknown.
   OBJECTIVES To investigate the all-cause and cause-specific mortality risks in ADHD and to explore the potential role of psychiatric comorbidities.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study used Swedish national registers to identify 2 675 615 individuals born in Sweden from January 1, 1983, through December 31, 2009, as the study population, among whom 86 670 individuals (3.2%) received a diagnosis of ADHD during follow-up. Follow-up was completed December 31, 2013, and data were analyzed from October 2018 through March 2019.
   EXPOSURES Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder identified by first clinical diagnosis or first prescription of ADHD medications as recorded in Swedish registers. Clinical diagnosis of psychiatric comorbidity was available in the National Patient Register.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All-cause and cause-specific mortalities and hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox proportional hazards regression models.
   RESULTS In the overall cohort of 2 675 615 individuals, 1 374 790 (51.4%) were male (57 919 with an ADHD diagnosis) and 1 300 825 (48.6%) were female (28 751 with an ADHD diagnosis). Mean (SD) age at study entry was 6.4 (5.6) years. During follow-up, 424 individuals with ADHD and 6231 without ADHD died, resulting in mortality rates of 11.57 and 2.16 per 10 000 person-years, respectively. The association was stronger in adulthood (HR, 4.64; 95% CI, 4.11-5.25) compared with childhood (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.97-2.04) and increased substantially with the number of psychiatric comorbidities with ADHD (HR for individuals with only ADHD, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.01-1.97]; HR for those with >= 4 comorbidities, 25.22 [95% CI, 19.60-32.46]). In adulthood, when adjusting for early-onset psychiatric comorbidity, the association between ADHD and risk of death due to natural causes was attenuated substantially and was no longer statistically significant (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.94-1.85). When adjusting for later-onset psychiatric disorders, the association was attenuated to statistical nonsignificance for death due to suicide (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.88-1.45) but remained statistically significant for death caused by unintentional injury (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.71-2.68) or other external causes (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.23-2.48).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Psychiatric comorbidity appears to play an important role in all-cause and cause-specific mortality risks in ADHD. In adulthood, early-onset psychiatric comorbidity contributed primarily to the association with death due to natural causes, whereas later-onset psychiatric comorbidity mainly influenced death due to unnatural causes, including suicide and unintentional injury. These findings suggest that health care professionals should closely monitor specific psychiatric comorbidities in individuals with ADHD to identify high-risk groups for prevention efforts.

AB The development of forensic psychiatric risk assessments is discussed from a clinical point of view using the example of Sweden. A central task in forensic psychiatry has traditionally been to identify dangerous, mentally disordered subjects considered to be prone to commit violent acts. Over time, "dangerousness" has been reworded into "risk". Nevertheless, such assessments have generally been based on the psychiatric factors characterising the individual patient, while group interaction, situational factors, or social and cultural circumstances, such as the availability of alcohol and drugs, have been largely overlooked. That risk assessments have a focused on people with a diagnosis of "mental disorder" and been used as grounds for coercive measures and integrity violations has somehow been accepted as a matter of course in the public and political debate. Even the basic question whether offenders with a mental disorder are really more prone to criminal recidivism than other offenders seems to have been treated light-handedly and dealt with merely by epidemiological comparisons between groups of persons with broad ranges of psychosocial vulnerability and the general population. Legal texts, instructions and guidelines from the authorities in charge are often vague and general, while actors in the judicial system seem to put their trust in psychiatric opinions. The exchange of professional opinions, general public expectations, and judicial decision processes poses a huge risk for misunderstandings based on divergent expectations and uses of terminology.

ID INTENSIVE-CARE UNITS; EUTHANASIA; ATTITUDES; DEATH
AB Background: In this study we investigated (a) to what extent physicians have experience with performing a range of end-of-life decisions (ELDs), (b) if they have no experience with performing an ELD, would they be willing to do so under certain conditions and (c) which background characteristics are associated with having experience with/or being willing to make such ELDs.
   Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was sent to 16,486 physicians from specialities in which death is common: Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland.
   Results: The response rate differed between countries (39-68%). The experience of foregoing life-sustaining treatment ranged between 37% and 86%: intensifying the alleviation of pain or other symptoms while taking into account possible hastening of death between 57% and 95%, and experience with deep sedation until death between 12% and 46%. Receiving a request for hastening death differed between 34% and 71%, and intentionally hastening death on the explicit request of a patient between 1% and 56%.
   Conclusion: There are differences between countries in experiences with ELDs, in willingness to perform ELDs and in receiving requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. Foregoing treatment and intensifying alleviation of pain and symptoms are practiced and accepted by most physicians in all countries. Physicians with training in palliative care are more inclined to perform ELDs, as are those who attend to higher numbers of terminal patients. Thus, this seems not to be only a matter of opportunity, but also a matter of attitude.

AB Background and objectives: Previous research on the toxicology of homicide has shown that about half of offenders and victims have psychoactive substances in their blood. The purpose of this study was to examine this topic in a Swedish setting.
   Methods: Toxicological data were sought in a database for all victims (n = 273) and perpetrators (n = 257) of homicide in Sweden from 2007 to 2009. Sufficient tests were identified for 97.1% of all victims (n = 265) and 46.7% of all offenders (n = 120). Additional information was obtained from court records and police reports.
   Results: A majority of individuals involved in homicides displayed positive toxicology (57.0% of victims and 62.5% of offenders). The most commonly detected substances, in both victims and offenders, were ethanol (44.9% vs. 40.8%) and benzodiazepines (8.3% vs. 19.2%). The difference between offenders and victims concerning benzodiazepines was statistically significant (OR 2.6; p = 0.002). Perpetrators of homicide-suicide had a lower prevalence of positive toxicology (30.8%) than other homicide offenders (66.4%; p = 0.04) and victims in unsolved cases more often exhibited positive drug toxicology compared to victims in solved cases (36.1% vs. 8.3%; p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The results of the study support the notion that substance abuse is firmly linked to committing homicide and to becoming a victim thereof. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This exploratory study looks at mortality after care among 13,100 former Swedish foster children, placed before their teens. Sources used are two national databases, on child welfare interventions and causes of death. Risk ratios of death for foster children are compared with those of their peers in the general population and with a comparison group, consisting of 10,668 young adults from adverse home backgrounds, who never entered foster family care before their teens. Both ex-foster children and the comparison group were young adults (19-26 years old) at time of follow-up. Results show a moderately elevated risk ratio for both groups compared with peers in the general population, mainly due to more frequent unnatural deaths, especially suicides. Time at first placement was not related to mortality among men, but there was a weak tendency of a higher risk ratio for girls placed at age 7-12. Information on time spent in care is used with caution, due to possible problems with reliability. Almost all comparisons between the foster care and the comparison group fell short of statistical significance. For foster children who had spent more than five years in care, the risk ratio tended to be higher than for foster children with shorter care experience, and similar to that of the comparison group. Foster children who had been in care for less then six years thus tended to have a lower risk ratio than the comparison group.

AB Background: The objective of this paper was to analyse whether different groups of foreign-born individuals have a higher risk of self-reported, long-standing, psychiatric illness or an increased intake of benzodiazepines when compared to native Swedes. Methods: The present cross-sectional study is based on eight simple random samples of people aged 25-74 years who participated in the Swedish Survey of Living Conditions. It was analysed by unconditional logistic regression in order to estimate odds ratios of psychiatric illness, based on 36,890 persons interviewed in 1986-1993 and intake of benzodiazepines, based on 9,352 persons interviewed in 1988-1989. Furthermore, the population prevalences were also calculated. Results: Migrants from Southern European countries and men from Eastern Europe and non-Westernized countries outside Europe showed an increased risk of self-reported, long-standing, psychiatric illness. Moreover, female migrants from Eastern Europe and non-Westernized countries outside of Europe and Finnish-born men demonstrated an increased risk of intake of benzodiazepines when compared to native Swedes. Conclusions: Our hypothesis that socioeconomic factors (low educational level, living alone, poor social network and poor economic resources) could explain the relation between the migrants' country of birth and psychiatric illness proved to be wrong. Country of birth, which is closely related to the migration process and acculturation stress, is an independent factor on its own associated with an increased risk of long-standing, psychiatric illness.

SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article
ID EMPLOYMENT STATUS; HEALTH; INEQUALITIES
AB Background An increasing number of lone mothers are experiencing financial and health disadvantages. Our aim was to assess mortality among lone mothers compared with mothers with partners.
   Methods In this population-based study, overall and cause-specific mortality, between 1991 and 1995, was estimated for 90 111 lone mothers and 622 368 mothers with partners from data collected in the Swedish Population and Housing Census 1990. We estimated relative risks by Poisson regression, adjusted for socioeconomic status, and, to handle health-selection effects, we adjusted for previous inpatient history from 1987 to 1990.
   Findings Lone mothers showed an almost 70% higher premature risk of death than mothers with partners. The excess risk remained significantly increased (relative risk 1.2 [95% CI 1.1-1.4]) after adjustments for socioeconomic status and previous severe somatic and psychiatric inpatient history. Increased mortality was especially pronounced for suicides (2.2 [1.5-3.1]), violence (3.0 [0.9-10.6]), and alcohol-related mortality (2.4 [1.4-4.1]) among mothers who were without a partner in 1985 and in 1990.
   Interpretation The increase of lone mothers in society shows financial, social, and health disadvantages. Nevertheless, the increased mortality risk of lone mothers seems to be partly independent of socioeconomic status and health selection into lone motherhood. For long-term lone mothers the risks may be underestimated when adjusting for selection bias by taking hospital discharge history into account, since these events may be part of the consequences of the stress of lone motherhood.

AB Background Depression increases the risk of a range of adverse outcomes including suicide, premature mortality, and self-harm, but associations with violent crime remain uncertain. We aimed to determine the risks of violent crime in patients with depression and to investigate the association between depressive symptoms and violent crime in a cohort of twins.
   Methods We conducted two studies. The first was a total population study in Sweden of patients with outpatient diagnoses of depressive disorders (n=47 158) between 2001 and 2009 and no lifetime inpatient episodes. Patients were age and sex matched to general population controls (n=898 454) and risk of violent crime was calculated. Additionally, we compared the odds of violent crime in unaffected half-siblings (n=15 534) and full siblings (n=33 516) of patients with the general population controls. In sensitivity analyses, we examined the contribution of substance abuse, sociodemographic factors, and previous criminality. In the second study, we studied a general population sample of twins (n=23 020) with continuous measures of depressive symptoms for risk of violent crime.
   Findings During a mean follow-up period of 3.2 years, 641 (3.7%) of the depressed men and 152 (0.5%) of the depressed women violently offended after diagnosis. After adjustment for sociodemographic confounders, the odds ratio of violent crime was 3.0 (95% CI 2.8-3.3) compared with the general population controls. The odds of violent crime in half-siblings (adjusted odds ratio 1.2 [95% CI 1.1-1.4]) and full siblings (1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.6) were significantly increased, showing some familial confounding of the association between depression and violence. However, the odds increase remained significant in individuals with depression after adjustment for familial confounding, and in those without substance abuse comorbidity or a previous violent conviction (all p < 0.0001). In the twin study, during the mean follow-up time of 5.4 years, 88 violent crimes were recorded. Depressive symptoms were associated with increased risk of violent crime and a sensitivity analysis identified little difference in risk estimate when all crimes (violent and non-violent) was the outcome.
   Interpretation Risk of violent crime was increased in individuals with depression after adjustment for familial, sociodemographic and individual factors in two longitudinal studies. Clinical guidelines should consider recommending violence risk assessment in certain subgroups with depression. Copyright (C) Fazel et al. Open Access article distributed under the terms of CC BY.

AB Introduction: The main recipients of lithium, people diagnosed with bipolar disorder, show an increased mortality in both natural and unnatural causes of death. Based on international data persons diagnosed with bipolar disorder comprise 2.3-9.6% of all suicidal deaths. In cases of suicide among those suffering from bipolar disorder, 17-53% are due to fatal intoxications. Diagnosing fatal intoxications is often challenging, particularly when the reference information needed to interpret the concentration of a drug is lacking or scarce.
   Aim: The aim of this study was to establish postmortem femoral blood reference concentrations of lithium, providing both fatal and "normal" postmortem concentrations, as well as to investigate the impact of the mode of intoxication and to study the co-detection of lithium and antidepressant drugs in intoxications and controls.
   Method: In Sweden, forensic autopsies are performed in unnatural and obscure deaths. This study included all autopsies in which lithium was found during the study period (1992-2010). Lithium was not included in the regular drug screen, but analysed upon request using flame photometry, ion-selective electrode detection or atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Each case was evaluated according to an established strategy, with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria followed by a multi-observer manual review (Fig. 1, Table 1). The cases included were classified as single intoxications (group A), multi-drug intoxications (group B) or controls (group C). The control group only included cases where death by intoxication and antemortem incapacitation by drugs could be ruled out.
   Results and discussion: During the study period, lithium was found in 124 cases. After application of inclusion and exclusion criteria and the subsequent manual review, 21 cases were classified as group A (n = 4), group B, (n = 7) and group C (n = 10). The femoral blood lithium concentrations in group A (median 2.69 mmol/l) and group B (median 2.10 mmol/l) were significantly different (p = 0.01) compared to group C (median 0.2 mmol/l). There were however no statistically significant difference between the concentrations in groups A and B. The most common mode of death in intoxications was acute-onchronic (n = 10), but the impact of chronic use on the fatal blood concentrations could not be evaluated since there was just one case without previous use. There was no difference in the proportion of codetections of lithium and antidepressants between intoxication cases and controls. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aims People who have schizophrenia die earlier from somatic diseases than do people in the general population, but information about cardiovascular deaths in people who have schizophrenia is limited. We analysed mortality in all age groups of people with schizophrenia by specific cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), focusing on five CVD diagnoses: coronary heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. We also compared hospital admissions for CVDs in people who had schizophrenia with hospital admissions for CVDs in the general population.
   Methods This national register study of 10 631 817 people in Sweden included 46 911 people who were admitted to the hospital for schizophrenia between 1 January 1987 and 31 December 2010. Information from national registers was used to identify people who had schizophrenia and obtain data about mortality, causes of death, medical diagnoses and hospitalisations.
   Results CVDs were the leading cause of death in people who had schizophrenia (5245 deaths), and CVDs caused more excess deaths than suicide. The mean age of CVD death was 10 years lower for people who had schizophrenia (70.5 years) than the general population (80.7 years). The mortality rate ratio (MRR) for CVDs in all people who had schizophrenia was 2.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.73-2.88). In people aged 15-59 years who had schizophrenia, the MRR for CVDs was 6.16 (95% CI 5.79-6.54). In all people who had schizophrenia, the MRR for coronary heart disease was 2.83 (95% CI 2.73-2.94); acute myocardial infarction, 2.62 (95% CI 2.49-2.75); cerebrovascular disease, 2.4 (95% CI 2.25-2.55); heart failure, 3.25 (95% CI 2.94-3.6); and cardiac arrhythmias, 2.06 (95% CI 1.75-2.43). Hospital admissions for coronary heart disease were less frequent in people who had schizophrenia than in the general population (admission rate ratio, 0.88 (95% CI 0.83-0.94). In all age groups, survival after hospital admission for CVD was lower in people who had schizophrenia than in the general population.
   Conclusions People who had schizophrenia died 10 years earlier from CVDs than did people in the general population. For all five CVD diagnoses, mortality risk was higher for those with schizophrenia than those in the general population. Survival after hospitalisation for CVDs in people who had schizophrenia was comparable with that of people in the general population who were several decades older.

AB Over a 10-year period (1998-2007) all deaths in Sweden classified by forensic pathologists as fatal drug poisonings (N = 6894) were retrieved from a toxicology database (TOXBASE) belonging to the National Board of Forensic Medicine. The deaths were further classified as suicides N = 2288 (33%), undetermined N = 2260 (33%) and accidental N = 2346 (34%). The average age (+/- SD) of all victims was 49.1 +/- 15.9 years and men 47.4 +/- 15.6 years were 5-year younger than women 52.2 +/- 15.8 years (p < 0.01). Most of the deceased (78%) were poly-drug users although a single drug (mono-intoxications) was found in 22% of all poisoning deaths (p < 0.001). The number of drugs in blood samples varied from 1 to 12 with a median of 3-4 per case. Mono-intoxication deaths were mostly ethanol-related (N = 976) and the mean and median blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) was 3.06 g/L and 3.10 g/L, respectively. The BAC decreased as the number of additional drugs in blood increased from 2.15 g/L with one drug to 1.25 g/L with 6 or more drugs. The mean (median) concentrations of non-alcohol drugs in mono-intoxication deaths were morphine (N = 93) 0.5 mg/L (0.2 mg/L), amphetamine (N = 39) 2.0 mg/L (1.2 mg/L), dextropropoxyphene (N = 33) 3.9 mg/L (2.9 mg/L), dihydro-propiomazine (N = 32) 1.6 mg/L (1.0 mg/L) and 7-amino-flunitrazepam (N = 28), 0.4 mg/L (0.3 mg/ L). Elevated blood morphine in these poisoning deaths mostly reflected abuse of heroin as verified by finding 6-monoacetyl morphine (6-MAM) in the blood samples. When investigating drug poisoning deaths a comprehensive toxicological analysis is essential although the results do not reveal the extent of prior exposure to drugs or the development of pharmacological tolerance. The concentrations of drugs determined in post-mortem blood are one element in the case. The autopsy report, the police investigation, the findings at the scene and eye-witness statements should all be carefully considered when the cause and manner of death are determined.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore whether young adults who had a parent in prison while growing up in Sweden are disadvantaged in terms of parental support, school well-being and functioning, and socioemotional and/or behavioral problems, compared to young adults whose parents were not in prison when they were a child.
   Design/methodology/approach Retrospective self-report information about parental imprisonment and childhood and adulthood welfare was collected from 2,500 Swedish young adults as part of the RESUME project. Of these, 52 who had had a parent in prison during their childhood were compared to the young adults who had not had a parent in prison, by measuring differences concerning their family relations, school well-being, and well-being as adults, and the risk of some events occurring later in life.
   Findings Having had a parent in prison was significantly related to feeling less loved during childhood, and having less contact and support from both parents during adulthood, in comparison with other young adults. In school they experienced lower well-being and were more often placed in special education than other children. They were at greater risk of not attending higher education, of planning or attempting suicide, and of being hospitalized for mental health problems than the rest of the young adults.
   Research limitations/implications Taking into consideration the complexity of childhood conditions and the limitations of retrospective data, prison, and social-services, professionals should pay special attention to the fact that a child has a parent in prison.
   Originality/value This is a unique study of young adults' experiences of a childhood with parent in prison.

AB Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine whether personality i.e. temperament and character interacts with age of onset in bipolar disorder.
   Methods: Bipolar patients were recruited among in- and outpatients from lithium dispensaries of northern Sweden. Patients were diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder type I and II. Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) was used for measuring personality. TCI was administered to 100 lithium treated bipolar patients and 100 controls.
   Results: Treatment response was significantly lower (p = 0.005) in patients with early onset compared with late onset. Family history (p = 0.013) and suicide attempts (p = 0.001) were also significantly more common in patients with early onset. Further, patients with early onset were significantly higher (p = 0.045) in the temperament factor harm avoidance (HA) than patients with late onset, but the difference was weak. Patients with early onset had more fear of uncertainty (HA2; p = 0.022) and were more shy (HA3; p = 0.030). Bipolar I patients showed similar results as those in the total bipolar group (I and II), with significantly higher HA (p = 0.019, moderate difference), HA2 (p = 0.015) and HA3 (p = 0.043) in patients with early onset compared with late onset. Bipolar II patients showed no differences between early and late age of onset but the groups are small and the results are therefore uncertain.
   Conclusions: Early age of onset in bipolar disorder was correlated to an increase in severity, family history, poorer treatment response and poorer prognosis. Early onset was also correlated to personality.

   ASSOCIATIONS; AGGRESSION; SUICIDE; IMPACT
AB Background: Childhood adversity (CA) is a risk indicator for psychiatric morbidity. Although CA has been linked to violent offending, limited research has considered adolescent psychiatric disorder as a mediating factor. The current study examined whether adolescent psychiatric disorder mediates the association between CA and violent offending. Methods: We used a cohort of 476 103 individuals born in 1984-1988 in Sweden. Register-based CAs included parental death, substance abuse and psychiatric disorder, parental criminal offending, parental separation, public assistance, child welfare intervention and residential instability. Adolescent psychiatric disorder was defined as being treated with a psychiatric diagnosis prior to age 20. Estimates of risk of violent offending after age 20 were calculated as incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Mediation was tested with the bootstrap method. Results: Exposure to CA was positively associated with violent offending, especially when accumulated. Individuals exposed to 4+ CAs who were also treated for psychiatric disorder had a 12-fold elevated risk for violent offending (adjusted IRR 12.2, 95% CI 10.6-14.0). Corresponding IRR among 4+ CA youth with no psychiatric disorder was 5.1 (95% CI 4.5-5.6). Psychiatric disorder mediated the association between CA and violent offending. Conclusion: CA is associated with elevated risk for violent offending in early adulthood, and the association is partly mediated by adolescent psychiatric disorder. Individuals exposed to cumulative CA who also develop adolescent psychopathology should be regarded as a high-risk group for violent offending, by professionals in social and health services that come into contact with this group.

AB Background: We wanted to examine how the acceptance of euthanasia among the general public in Western Europe has changed in the last decades, and we wanted to look for possible explanations. Methods: We analysed data from the European Values Surveys, held in 1981, 1990, and 1999-2000 in 12 West European countries. In each country, representative samples of the general public were interviewed using the same structured questionnaire in all countries. Euthanasia was explained in the questionnaires as 'terminating the life of the incurably sick'. Results: A total of 46 199 respondents participated in the surveys. A significant increase in acceptance of euthanasia could be observed in all countries except (West) Germany. While the average increase in euthanasia acceptance was 22%, the increase was particularly obvious in Belgium, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. Although changes in several characteristics of respondents, such as decrease in religious beliefs, rising belief in the right to self-determination, and (to a lesser extent) rise in levels of education, were associated with growing acceptance of euthanasia, they could only partly explain the increase of euthanasia acceptance over the years. Conclusions: An increase of euthanasia acceptance among the general public took place over the last two decades in almost all West European countries, possibly indicating a growing support for personal autonomy regarding medical end-of-life decisions. If this trend continues, it is likely to increase the public and political debate about the (legal) regulation of euthanasia under certain conditions of careful medical practice in several West European countries.

AB Objective: Hospital discharge registers (HDRs) are frequently used in epidemiological research. However, the validity of several important psychiatric diagnostic entities, including bipolar disorder, remains uncertain. Hence, we aimed to develop an optimal algorithm for register-based identification of DSM-IV-TR bipolar disorder.
   Method: We identified potential cases in the Swedish national HDR using two separate discharge diagnoses of bipolar disorder according to ICD versions 8-10 during January 1, 1973 to December 31, 2004. In a randomly selected subsample of 135 cases from the county of Sormland, two senior psychiatrists reassessed the diagnostic status based on patients' medical records. We scrutinized false-positive cases and modified the initial algorithm to improve positive predictive value while minimizing false negatives. Finally, we externally validated resulting caseness algorithms by linking HDR diagnostic data with best-estimate clinical diagnoses from the National Quality Assurance Register for Bipolar Disorder (BipolaR), dispensed lithium prescriptions from the National Prescribed Drug Register, and the ICD-10 diagnoses from the National Outpatient Register respectively.
   Results: The algorithm with two discharge diagnoses of bipolar disorder yielded a positive predictive value of 0.81. Modification by excluding individuals diagnosed with ICD-8 296.20 (manic-depressive psychosis, depressed type), and/or ICD-9 296.B (unipolar affective psychosis, melancholic form), gave a positive positive predictive value of 0.92. The modified algorithm also had statistically superior external validity compared with the original algorithm.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that DSM-IV-TR bipolar disorder caseness based on two inpatient episodes with a bipolar disorder diagnosis is sufficiently sensitive and specific to be used in further epidemiological study of bipolar disorder.

AB Purpose: Although childhood traumatic experiences are recognized as important determinants for adolescent psychiatric health in general, our objective was to explore the specific influence of childhood bereavement on the stress resilience development trajectory.
   Methods: In this national register-based cohort study, we identified 407,639 men born in Sweden between 1973 and 1983, who underwent compulsory military enlistment examinations in late adolescence, including measures of psychological stress resilience. We defined exposure as loss of a first-degree family member in childhood, and estimated relative risk ratios (RRRs) for reduced (moderate or low), compared with high, stress resilience with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multinomial logistic regression.
   Results: Loss of a parent or sibling in childhood conferred a 49% increased risk of subsequent low stress resilience (RRR, 1.49, 95% CI, 1.41-1.57) and an 8% increased risk of moderate stress resilience (RRR, 1.08, 95% CI, 1.03-1.13) in late adolescence. There was also a graded increase in risk with increasing age at loss; teenagers were at higher risk for low resilience (RRR, 1.64, 95% CI, 1.52-1.77) than children aged 7-12 (RRR, 1.47, 95% CI, 1.34-1.61) and <= 6 years (RRR, 1.16 95% CI, 1.02-1.32). The excess risk was observed for all causes of death, including suicide and unexpected deaths as well as deaths due to other illnesses. The associations remained after exclusion of parents with a history of hospitalization for psychiatric diagnoses.
   Conclusions: The long-term consequences of childhood bereavement may include lower stress resilience in late adolescence. (c) 2018 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Between 1995 and 2004, 293 passenger car occupants died in collisions with other vehicles in northern Sweden (annual incidence: 3.3 per 100,000 inhabitants, 6.9 per 100,000 cars, or 4.8 per 109 km driven); half of these deaths involved heavy vehicles. The annual number of passenger car occupant deaths per 100,000 cars in car-truck/bus collisions has remained unchanged since the 1980s, but in car-car collisions it has decreased to one third of its former level. As crash objects, trucks and buses killed five times as many car occupants per truck/bus kilometer driven as did cars.
   The collisions were characterized by crashes in the oncoming vehicle's lane, under icy, snowy, or wet conditions; crashes into heavy vehicles generally occurred in daylight, on workdays, in winter, and on 90 and 70 km/h two-lane roads.
   Head and chest injuries accounted for most of the fatal injuries. Multiple fatal injuries and critical and deadly head injuries characterized the deaths in collisions with heavy vehicles.
   An indication of suicide was present in 4% of the deaths; for those who crashed into trucks, this percentage was doubled. Among the driver victims, 4% had blood alcohol levels above the legal limit of 0.2 g/L.
   Frontal collision risks might be reduced by a mid-barrier, by building less injurious fronts on trucks and buses, by efficient skid prevention, and by use of flexible speed limits varying with road and light conditions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The influence of gender on bipolar disorder is controversial and it is unclear if inpatient care differs between men and women. Here, we investigate for gender differences in the inpatient length of stay for Swedes admitted for bipolar disorder and explore other factors that could explain any observed association.
   Methods: Admission data were extracted from the Swedish National Patient Register and included all patients first admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit with a bipolar disorder diagnosis, circa 2005-2014. Patients were then retrospectively followed for subsequent hospitalizations. Diagnostic subtypes were categorized by ICD-10 clusters: depressive, depressive with psychotic features, manic, manic with psychotic features, mixed, and other. Psychotropic therapies preceding the corresponding admissions were attained from the Prescribed Drug Register. Mixed-effects zero-truncated negative binomial regressions were employed to model the length of stay per admission.
   Results: Analysis included 39,653 admissions by 16,271 inpatients (60.0% women). Overall, when compared to men, women spent 7.5% (95% CI: 4.2-11.0%, p < 0.001) extra days hospitalized per admission. However, upon adjusting for candidate confounders, including the bipolar subtype, and selected comorbidities and psychotropics, the association weakened wherein women then spent 3.7% (95% CI: 0.1-6.9%, p = 0.028) extra days hospitalized per admission.
   Limitations: The integrity of register data can be variable and the adherence to outpatient dispensed psychotropics could not be validated.
   Conclusion: Although the influence of gender on the bipolar disorder inpatient length of stay is evident, other factors attenuate and better explain this crude observation.

AB Women treated for alcohol addiction have mortality rates three to five times those of women from the general population (GP). However, these figures may be inflated because socially disadvantaged women with advanced drinking careers are over-represented in previous studies. Our aim was to study the long-term mortality of socially relatively well-functioning patients coming to their first treatment, compared to matched GP controls.
   The mortality rates and causes of death were compared between patients and their matched GP controls, using data from the Causes of Death Register throughout the follow-up period (0-25 years).
   A specialized treatment programme for women only, called 'Early treatment for Women with Alcohol Addiction' (EWA) at the Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.
   Subjects (n = 420) receiving their first treatment at the EWA programme, compared to a group of matched GP women (n = 2037).
   The women patients had significantly higher mortality than matched GP controls throughout the whole follow-up period, with a relative risk of 2.4. However, the younger women had four times higher mortality than their matched controls. The peak of deaths occurred during the first 5 years, and alcohol-related causes of death were highly over-represented, as were uncertain suicides and accidents.
   First-time-treated women with alcohol addiction have a substantially lower mortality than reported previously from clinical samples, except for the youngest group. Our figures were corrected for confounding factors such as socio-demographic status. We believe our results could apply to broader groups of heavy drinking women, inside or outside specialized treatment settings.

AB Background and Purpose - Depression after stroke is often described as underdiagnosed and undertreated. However, there are few data on self-reported depression and use of antidepressants in stroke patients at large. Materials and
   Methods - In the Swedish national quality assessment register, Riks-Stroke, 15 747 stroke survivors are recorded. They were asked about depressive mood and antidepressant treatment 3 months after stroke. Age-specific prevalence of antidepressant use after stroke was calculated.
   Results - At 3 months after stroke, 12.4% of male and 16.4% of female stroke survivors reported that they always or often felt depressed. In a multiple logistic regression model, female sex, age younger than 65 years, living alone, having had a recurrent stroke, being dependent on others, and institutional living 3 months after stroke were independent predictors of self-reported depression. Antidepressant medication was used by 22.5% of men and 28.1% of women who had had a stroke. Of patients using antidepressant drugs, 67.5% did not report depressive mood. However, 8.4% of the entire cohort reported depressive mood but no treatment with antidepressants. When compared with the general population, approximately twice as many of the stroke patients were using antidepressant treatment.
   Conclusions - In this national survey, 1 in 7 patients reported that they felt depressed and the use of antidepressant drugs after stroke was common. The widespread use of antidepressants challenges the contention that antidepressants are generally underused after stroke. However, the substantial proportion reporting depressive mood but not using treatment with antidepressants suggests that patient selection for treatment should be more precise.

AB Objective: To investigate factors associated with homicide after discharge from hospital in patients with schizophrenia and other psychoses.
   Design: All homicides committed by patients with psychosis within 6 months of hospital discharge were identified in Sweden from 1988-2001 and compared with patients with psychoses discharged over the same time period who did not subsequently commit any violent offences. Medical records were then collected, and data extracted using a validated protocol. Interrater reliability tests were performed on a subsample, and variables with poor reliability excluded from subsequent analyses.
   Results: We identified 47 cases who committed a homicide within 6 months of discharge, and 105 controls who did not commit any violent offence after discharge. On univariate analyses, clinical factors on admission associated with homicide included evidence of poor self-care, substance misuse, and being previously hospitalized for a violent episode. Inpatient characteristics included having a severe mental illness for one year prior to admission. Aftercare factors associated with homicide were evidence of medication non-compliance and substance misuse. The predictive validity of combining two or three of these factors was not high. Depression appeared to be inversely associated with homicide, and there was no relationship with the presence of delusions or hallucinations.
   Conclusions: There are a number of potentially treatable factors that are associated with homicide in schizophrenia and other psychoses. Associations with substance misuse and treatment compliance could be the focus of therapeutic interventions if validated in other samples. However, their clinical utility in violence risk assessment remains uncertain. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Several investigators have reported an increased frequency of attention/hyperactivity symptoms in international adoptees, though population-based studies are lacking. In this national cohort study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of ADHD medication in international adoptees in Sweden, in comparison to the general population. A further purpose was to study gender, age at adoption and region of origin as predictors of ADHD medication in international adoptees. The study population consisted of all Swedish residents born in 1985-2000 with Swedish-born parents, divided into 16,134 adoptees, and a comparison population of 1,326,090. ADHD medications were identified in the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register during 2006. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios. The rates of ADHD medication were higher in international adoptees than in the comparison population for both boys (5.3 vs. 1.5% for 10-15-year olds) and girls (2.1 vs. 0.3% for 10-15-year olds). International adoptees from all regions of birth more often consumed ADHD medication compared with the majority population, but the age and sex adjusted odds ratios were particularly high for adoptees from Eastern Europe, Middle East/Africa and Latin America. Adjusting for maternal education and single parenthood increased the odds ratios even further. The risk also increased with higher age at adoption. Adoptees from Eastern Europe have a very high risk for ADHD medication. A structured identification and support programme should be tailored for this group. Adoptees from other regions have a more moderately increased risk, which should be communicated to adoptive parents and to professionals who care for adoptees in their clinical practice.

AB Background Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a global health concern. To further understand FASD in adulthood is a major public health interest.
   Objective To describe the clinical characteristics of young adults with FASD adopted from orphanages to a socially more favourable and stable rearing environment as children.
   Design Prospective observational cohort study
   Setting Western Sweden
   Participants A population-based cohort of 37 adoptees diagnosed with FASD in childhood.
   Outcome measures Assessment consisted of clinical evaluations of social, medical, psychiatric, neuropsychological, adaptive and ophthalmological status by a physician, ophthalmologist, orthoptist and psychologist.
   Results Out of 37 adoptees with FASD, 36 (15 females) were evaluated at a median age of 22 years (range 18-28) and a mean follow-up time of 15.5 years (range 13-17). Twenty (56%) were dependent on social support. Sexual victimisation was reported by nine (26%). In 21 individuals with fetal alcohol syndrome, growth restriction in height and head circumference of approximately-1.8 SD persisted into adulthood. Of 32 examined, 22 (69%) had gross motor coordination abnormalities. High blood pressure was measured in nine (28%). Ophthalmological abnormalities were found in 29 of 30 (97%). A median IQ of 86 in childhood had declined significantly to 71 by adulthood (mean difference: 15.5; 95% CI 9.5-21.4). Psychiatric disorders were diagnosed in 88%, most commonly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (70%). Three or more disorders were diagnosed in 48%, and 21% had attempted suicide. The median Clinical Global Impression-Severity score was 6 = 'severely ill'.
   Conclusion Major cognitive impairments, psychiatric morbidity, facial dysmorphology, growth restriction and ophthalmological abnormalities accompanies FASD in adulthood. Recognition of FASD in childhood warrants habilitation across the lifespan.

TI Car Crash Fatalities Associated With Fire in Sweden

LA English
DT Article
DE vehicle fire; fatality; death rate; burns; smoke inhalation
ID ACCIDENTS
AB Objective: To study the epidemiology and causes of death in fatal car crashes on Swedish roads in which the victim's vehicle caught fire.
   Methods: The data set is from the Swedish Transport Administrations in-depth studies of fatal crashes 1998-2008. Autopsies from all cases provided data on injuries, toxicological analyses, and cause of death.
   Results: In total, 181 people died in 133 burning cars, accounting for 5 percent of all deaths in passenger cars, sport utility vehicles, vans, and minibuses during 1998 to 2008. The cause of death for a third of the victims was fire related, as burns and/or smoke inhalation injuries, with no fatal trauma injuries. Twenty-five of these 55 deaths were persons 19 years or younger and included 15 of 18 rear seat deaths.
   Over half of the 181 deaths were in vehicles that had collided with another vehicle and, of these cases, half were killed in collisions with heavy vehicles. The percentage of drivers with illegal blood alcohol concentrations (27%) and suicides (5.5%) were not higher than in other fatal crashes on Swedish roads. The ignition point of the fire was indicated in only half of the cases and, of those, half started in the engine compartment and one fourth started around the fuel tank or lines.
   Conclusions: Car fires are a deadly postcrash problem. Reducing this risk would be primarily a responsibility for the automotive industry. A multifactor approach could be considered as follows: risk-reducing design, insulation, reduced flammability in motor compartment fluids and plastics, and automatic fire extinguishing equipment. Inspiration could be found in how, for example, the auto racing and aviation industries handle this problem.

DT Article
ID CHILDHOOD SOCIOECONOMIC POSITION; CAUSE-SPECIFIC MORTALITY;
   MENTAL-DISORDERS; HEALTH; PREVALENCE; INEQUALITIES; COMORBIDITY;
   ANXIETY; HEART; LIFE
AB Background: Children have a social status position of their own, apart from that of the family, that may have an impact on short-term and long-term health. The aim of the present study was to analyse the associations between childhood social status in school (ie, peer status) and disease-specific morbidity in adulthood.
   Methods: Data were derived from a longitudinal study using a 1953 cohort born in Stockholm, Sweden: The Stockholm Birth Cohort Study (1953-2003). Peer status was sociometrically assessed in sixth grade (1966). Hazard ratios for adult disease-specific morbidity based on information on inpatient care (1973-2003) were calculated by peer status category for men and women separately, using Cox regression.
   Results: The results indicate that the lower the childhood peer status, the higher the overall adult disease risk. There were, however, differences in the degree and magnitude to which disease-specific inpatient care varied with peer status. Some of the steepest gradients were found for mental and behavioural disorders (eg, alcohol abuse and drug dependence), external causes (eg, suicide) and various lifestyle-related diseases (eg, ischaemic heart disease and diabetes). The results were not explained by childhood social class.
   Conclusion: The present study underlines the importance of recognising children's social position, apart from that of their family, for later health. Not only psychologically related diseases but also those related to behavioural risk factors demonstrate some of the largest relative differences by peer status, suggesting that health-related behaviour may be one important mechanism in the association between peer status and morbidity.

AB Background. Prior studies suggest parental and perinatal risk factors are associated with later offending. It remains uncertain, however, if such risk factors are similarly related to sexual offending.
   Method. We linked socio-demographic, family relations, and perinatal (obtained at birth) data from the nationwide Swedish registers from 1973 to 2009 with information on criminal convictions of cases and control subjects. Male sex offenders (n = 13 773) were matched 1: 5 on birth year and county of birth in Sweden to male controls without sexual or non-sexual violent convictions. To examine risk-factor specificity for sexual offending, we also compared male violent, non-sexual offenders (n = 135 953) to controls without sexual or non-sexual violent convictions. Predictors included parental (young maternal or paternal age at son's birth, educational attainment, violent crime, psychiatric disorder, substance misuse, suicide attempt) and perinatal (number of older brothers, low Apgar score, low birth weight, being small for gestational age, congenital malformations, small head size) variables.
   Results. Conditional logistic regression models found consistent patterns of statistically significant, small to moderate independent associations of parental risk factors with sons' sexual offending and non-sexual violent offending. For perinatal risk factors, patterns varied more; small for gestational age and small head size exhibited similar risk effects for both offence types whereas a higher number of older biological brothers and any congenital malformation were small, independent risk factors only for non-sexual violence.
   Conclusions. This nationwide study suggests substantial commonalities in parental and perinatal risk factors for the onset of sexual and non-sexual violent offending.

AB We studied the incidence of fatal adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in a tertiary hospital to find out which drugs were involved. The secondary objective was to compare the data from the same hospital published 12 years earlier. All 1708 death cases in the Helsinki University Central Hospital during the year 2012 were retrospectively evaluated. All suspected drug-related deaths, excluding suicides, were scrutinized by an expert panel using the WHO ADR probability classification. Of all cases, 52 (3.0%) were classified as certainly or probably drug related and 24 (1.4%) as possibly drug related. Together, these corresponded to 0.02% of all hospital admissions. The most commonly involved drugs in certain or probable cases were cytostatics (18 cases, 1.1% of all cases) and antithrombotics (17, 1.0%). Twelve years earlier, these caused 27 (1.8%) and 22 (1.5%) cases, respectively. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and glucocorticoids caused less (2 and 0 cases) fatal ADRs than earlier (12 and 4 cases, p = 0.048 and p = 0.005, respectively). Most of the ADRs leading to death were present already in admission and affected seriously ill or elderly patients. Hospital-born fatal ADRs occurred in 0.003% of patients. In conclusion, cytostatics and antithrombotics are still the leading causes of fatal ADRs, but NSAIDs and glucocorticoids seem to cause fatal ADRs less often than previously. The incidence of fatal ADRs in 2012 was 3.0% of all deaths, suggesting a decline compared to the 2000 value (5.0%). Improved awareness, prevention and treatment of ADRs and safer medicines may explain these declining trends.

AB Background: Patients who deliberately harm themselves often repeat their self-destructive acts. The objective of this study was to assess whether a follow-up visit within 10 clays to a psychiatric consultant could reduce the frequency of repeated deliberate self harm (DSH).
   Methods: A cohort of 325 consecutive DSH patients attending two large emergency departments in Stockholm. Sweden, were included and followed for 6 months. Any visit to a psychiatric consultant within 10 days was registered as an early follow-up. Repeated DSH episode within 6 months among the 325 patients was detected via nationwide registers.
   Main outcome measure: Repeated DSH within 6 months.
   Results: At 6 months follow-up 22 (24%) of 92 patients with an early follow-up had repeated their DSH acts compared to 58 (25%) of 233 patients without an early follow-up (OR 1.06 (95% Cl : 0.60-1.85) p-value 0.85). After adjustment for possible confounders, multivariable analysis showed an OR of 122 (95% Cl. 0.62-2.38, p-value 0.56).
   Limitations: Early follow-up was registered as any visit to a psychiatric consultant and no information regarding actions taken at the visit were obtained.
   Conclusion: After adjusting for other factors associated with repetition there was an association of patients who were offered and thereafter attended an early follow-up visit and a decreased risk of repeated DSH. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Studies on a national level concerning domestic violence (DV) among both men and women are few. DV and its relation to other social and health outcomes within the framework of the Swedish Public Health Survey have remained unexplored. Aim: To compare women and men regarding their social situation and health status in relation to self-reported exposure to physical DV as measured in the Swedish National Public Health Survey. Methods: This study used cross-sectional data from the Swedish Public Health Survey, years 2004-09 with a total sample of 50 350 respondents, of which 205 women and 93 men reported DV exposure. Logistic regression analyses stratified by sex with physical DV exposure as the outcome measure were conducted, and the multivariate models were fitted using the likelihood ratio test. Results: Being foreign-born [women odds ratio (OR) = 1.52, men OR= 1.92] and lack of social support (women OR= 2.81, men OR= 1.92) were associated with DV exposure among both sexes. Higher psychological distress (women OR= 2.81, men OR= 1.92) and hazardous drinking (women OR = 1.61, men OR = 2.33) were also associated with DV exposure. Among women, financial problems were associated with DV exposure (OR = 1.83), whereas among men, sum of medicines used and higher odds of DV were associated (OR = 1.17). Further, suicidal attempts were associated with DV exposure among both women (OR = 5.59) and men (OR = 8.34). Conclusions: In this national survey, prevalence rates of violence exposure were lower than in other studies, but despite this, both women and men exposed to physical DV reported increased odds of having attempted suicide.

AB Background: Assessing factors associated with non-fatal overdose is important as these could be useful to identify individuals with substance use disorders at high risk of adverse outcomes and consequences. Depression may play an important role in terms of overdose risk. We aimed to test if drug users suffering from a depressive disorder might have significantly higher risk of non-fatal overdose as compared with drug users without depression.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, Embase and Web of Knowledge were searched. The pooled analyses were based on prevalence rates, risk difference (RD) and odds ratio (OR), reporting 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The combined estimates were obtained weighting each study according to random effects model for meta-analysis.
   Results: Seven articles, involving 12,019 individuals, and run in the US, Canada, Sweden, Norway, and Australia, were included. Pooled analyses comparing depressed with not depressed individuals highlighted a RD (95% CIs) for non-fatal overdose of 7.3% (4.8-9.7%) and an OR (95% CIs) of 1.45 (1.17-1.79). The subgroups analyses based on specific characteristics of included studies confirmed the association between depression and overdose.
   Conclusions: Depressive disorders seem to be important factors associated to the risk of-non-fatal overdose. Longitudinal studies might appropriately clarify causal inference issues. Future research should address the role of depressive disorders as predictors of subsequent non-fatal overdoses. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background Studying drugged drivers gives complementary information about mortality of drug users, which mainly has been studied among opioid abusers. The aim of this study was to analyse mortality rates and causes of death among drivers under the influence of drugs (DUID) in Finland and compare them with the general Finnish population during 1993-2006.
   Methods Register data from 5832 DUID suspects apprehended by the police were studied, with a reference group (n = 74 809) drawn from the general Finnish population. Deaths were traced from the National Death Register. Survival and differences in mortality hazards were estimated using Kaplane-Meier plots and Cox regression models.
   Results The hazard of death was higher among male (HR 9.6, CI 8.7 to 10.6) and female (HR 9.1, CI 6.4 to 12.8) DUID suspects compared to the reference population. Among male DUID suspects, cause-specific hazards were highest for poisoning/overdose, violence and suicide. 24% of DUID suspects and 8% of reference subjects were under the influence of drugs/alcohol at the time of death. Poly-drug findings indicated excess in mortality among drugged drivers. Hazard of death was higher among male DUID suspects who had findings for benzodiazepines only (HR 10.0, CI 8.4 to 11.9) or benzodiazepines with alcohol (HR 9.6, CI 8.2 to 11.2), than with findings for amphetamines (HR 4.6, CI 2.7 to 7.6).
   Conclusion DUID suspects had an increased risk of death in all observed causes of death. Findings for benzodiazepines indicated excessive mortality over findings for amphetamines. Preventive actions should be aimed especially at DUID subgroups using benzodiazepines.

AB Background: We aimed at describing the trends in antidepressants use (AD) by age and sex, during 2007-2011, in 5 European settings (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Catalonia and Veneto), and to assess whether the differences found across settings could be related to economic, social and cultural determinants.
   Methods: We collected data of AD use expressed in defined daily doses (DDD). Data were retrieved from population-based databases. We calculated DDD/1000 inhabitants/day. We analysed which economic, social, and cultural covariates determined between-settings differences in AD consumption.
   Results: The use of AD showed an increasing trend during the study period, being Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors the most consumed, followed "others AD". Women and the elderly showed the highest AD consumption. Between-settings variability in AD consumption showed a positive correlation with pharmaceutical expenditure and a negative one with general practitioner's rate. After adjusting by pharmaceutical expenditure and general practitioners rate Masculinity, Long-Term Orientation and Individualism cultural dimensions were associated with AD use by using the Hofstede's cultural dimensions model.
   Limitations: This study has been conducted in administrative databases, with no information on AD use by indication; differences among AD use could be related to their prescription for other disorders. Analyses were based on a small dataset and none of the results reached statistical significance.
   Conclusions: AD use increased through 2007-2011. Pharmaceutical expenditure and General Practitioners rate, Masculinity, Long-Term Orientation and Individualism explained the differences in AD use between countries. People's attitude should be considered when designing national campaigns to improve antidepressant use.

AB Aims: To assess to what extent alcohol-related mortality has changed by age, sex and education in Finland in 19872003, a period which saw two periods of economic growth, separated by a severe depression (19911995). Methods: A register-based follow-up study of all over 15-year-old Finnish men and women. Age, sex and education of the participants were measured at the time of the 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000 censuses. Follow-up for mortality was for 1987--2003. The outcome measure was alcohol-related mortality, which was defined using information on the underlying and contributory causes of death. Results: Among men and women aged 45 years and over, the trends in alcohol-related mortality were associated with economic cycles. Among those aged less than 45 years, alcohol-related mortality decreased from the early 1990s, but intoxication-related accidents and violence still contributed largely to premature mortality. The unfavourable trend for older men resulted from an increase in mortality due to directly alcohol-attributable diseases, alcohol-related diseases of the circulatory system and accidents and violence, and for older women from an increase due to intoxication-related accidents and violence, and alcohol-attributable diseases. Alcohol-related mortality was higher in lower educational groups, and among women the educational gap widened towards the end of the study period. Conclusion: This study shows that trends in both economic conditions and per capita consumption of alcohol are not associated with trends in alcohol-related mortality in all population subgroups. In health policy more attention should be paid to divergent trends in gender, age and education specific alcohol-related mortality.

AB Background Substantial mental health disparities between lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals compared with heterosexuals have been identified. The aim was to examine potential sexual orientation-based disparities in mental health treatment in a prospectively analysed population-based sample in Sweden and to explore potential moderators and mediators.
   Method 30 730 individuals from the Stockholm Public Health Cohort were followed up with questionnaires and registry-based health record data on psychiatric healthcare visits and prescription drug use between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2011.
   Results In adjusted analyses, gay and lesbian individuals were more likely to receive treatment for anxiety disorders (adjusted ORs (AOR) = 3.80; 95% CI 2.54 to 5.69) and to use antidepressant medication (AOR= 2.13; 95% CI 1.62 to 2.79); and bisexuals were more likely to receive treatment for mood disorders (AOR = 1.58; 95% CI 1.00 to 2.48), anxiety disorders (AOR = 3.23; 95% CI 2.22 to 4.72) and substance use disorders (AOR = 1.91; 95% CI 1.12 to 3.25), and to use antidepressant medication (AOR = 1.91; 95% CI 1.12 to 3.25) when compared with heterosexuals. The largest mental health treatment disparities based on sexual orientation were found among bisexual women, gay men and younger lesbian women. More frequent experiences of victimisation/threat of violence and lack of social support could partially explain these disparities.
   Conclusions This study shows a substantially elevated risk of poor mental health among LGB individuals as compared with heterosexuals. Findings support several factors outlined in the minority stress theory in explaining the mechanisms behind these disparities.

AB Purpose Several studies indicate that the medical burden of fatal adverse drug reactions (FADRs) is significant, but the preventability of FADRs in the general population is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of preventable FADRs and preventable fatal drug poisonings (FDPs) in a Swedish population.
   Methods Previously, a population-based sample of 1574 deceased subjects was scrutinised for FADRs and FDPs using relevant case records, including death certificates, medical charts and medico-legal files. Forty-nine cases (3%) of FADRs and nine cases (0.6%) of FDPs were identified in 57 subjects. In this study, the preventability of all these identified FADRs and FDPs was evaluated by clinical experts in a stepwise manner, applying a set of predefined and well established preventability criteria. Only cases for which consensus was achieved were included in the study.
   Results Of 49 FADRs, 14% (seven fatalities) was considered definitely or possibly preventable and four of these were due to the presence of a contraindication for the drug. All nine FDPs were considered possibly preventable. As one subject had a combination of an FADR and an FDP, a total of 15 persons (26%) were considered having a definitely or possibly preventable FADR or FDP, corresponding to 0.95% of all deceased subjects in Sweden.
   Conclusions The results of this study indicate that approximately one fourth of FADRs and FDPs could be prevented. Therefore, an increased awareness of the possibility to reduce the risk of fatal events due to pharmaceutical drugs is warranted. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Objectives: Several studies have reported an association between cigarette smoking and psychiatric illness. A common finding is that the prevalence of psychiatric illness among former smokers is much lower than among current smokers and is often similar to that among never-smokers. There are two alternative causal explanations for this association: either improved mental well-being results from smoking cessation; or those with poorer mental well-being are less successful at smoking cessation. The objective was to analyse a unique longitudinal data set to shed light on the direction of causality and to distinguish between these alternative explanations. Methods: Information on smoking status and indicators of poor mental well-being from childhood and adolescence was collected at age 18 in 1969 from 49321 men at compulsory conscription for military service. Follow-up data on smoking status were collected among a random subset (n = 694) who participated in one or more annual national Swedish Surveys of Living Conditions in 1981-2001. Results: Approximately half of the smokers at age 18 in 1969 had quit by the time they were resurveyed (1981-2002). Those who had not quit and who reported smoking more than 10 cigarettes/day at age 18 (called persistent heavy smokers), were more likely to have had childhood and adolescent indicators of poor mental health measured at age 18 in 1969 than non-smokers or quitters. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that men who would subsequently be successful at smoking cessation reported better mental health and a lower prevalence of childhood mental health indicators at age 18 than persistent heavy smokers.

AB Objective: To examine the comorbidity of severe mental illness with sexual offending in men.
   Method: A case-control design was used to investigate psychiatric hospitalization and sexual offending. Data were obtained from Swedish national registers for crime, hospital discharge diagnoses (based on International Classification of Diseases revisions 9 and 10), demographic, and socioeconomic factors for the years 1988 through 2000. All male sexual offenders (N = 8495) in Sweden were included and compared with a random sample of male controls taken from the general population (N = 19,935). The population attributable risk fraction (the proportion of all sexual crimes throughout the study period that were committed by patients with a history of psychiatric hospitalization) was also estimated.
   Results: After adjustment for demographic and socioeconomic confounders, sexual offenders were 6 times more likely to have a history of psychiatric hospitalization compared with the general population (OR = 6.3, 95% Cl = 5.7 to 6.9). Sexual offenders were significantly more likely to have a severe mental illness than the general population, whether this was schizophrenia (OR = 4.8, 95% CI = 3.4 to 6.7), other psychoses (OR = 5.2, 95% CI = 3.9 to 6.8), or bipolar affective disorder (OR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.8 to 6.4). The proportion of all sexual crimes committed by hospitalized psychiatric patients (the population attributable risk fraction) was 20.1%.
   Conclusion: The increased relative risk of psychiatric hospitalization and severe mental illness in sexual offenders is contrary to much expert opinion in the field. If these findings are replicated in other settings, policies in the criminal justice system regarding the assessment, management, and treatment of sexual offenders may need review.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to describe the frequency and characteristics of cardiac arrest patients of 35 years and under attended by the London Ambulance Service NHS Trust between April 2003 and March 2007. Few large studies have described the occurrence, mechanism, resuscitation viability and outcome of this Substantial Subset of the cardiac arrest population. By documenting over 3000 cardiac arrests in young people we sought to improve understanding, awareness and ultimately Survival of a condition notorious for high mortality rates.
   Methods and results: Data were analysed for 3084 young cardiac arrest patients and reported retrospectively. Patients were categorised by age, gender, aetiology and whether or not resuscitation attempts were made.
   Over 75% of patients were aged 18-35 years. There were significantly more males in this age group (p<0.001) compared to those aged 17 years or less. The most common cause of cardiac arrest was,an underlying cardiac cause (44.9%). Overdoses, hanging and other suicides were found to be major causes of cardiac arrests of non-cardiac origin in young adult males. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) was the most common known cause of death in infants aged less than I year. This age group received bystander CPR most often. 5.6% of young cardiac arrest patients who were taken to hospital survived to hospital discharge.
   Conclusions: Mortality in young cardiac arrest patients remains high. Focus should be placed on tackling social and psychological causes of cardiac arrest as well as cardiac aetiologies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To compare the characteristics of dextropropoxyphene (DXP) poisoning victims with those of victims of poisonings by antidepressants and sedatives, we examined all fatal poisonings due to DXP, antidepressants or sedatives among autopsies performed at one department of forensic medicine in Sweden during the six-year period from 1992 to 1997.
   In 202 cases, death was classified as fatal poisonings by DXP, antidepressants or sedatives. DXP caused death in 78 cases (39%), antidepressants in 49 (24%), and sedatives in 75 (37%). DXP as a single preparation was predominant in causing death. The second compound, flunitrazepam, caused death in 30 cases (15%).
   The victims of poisonings by DXP, antidepressants, or sedatives shared a similar history of alcohol/drug abuse, depression and somatic illness. They were mostly living alone at the time of death (>60%), the majority died at home (81%), and suicide was the most frequent manner of death (73%).
   Age seemed to be an important characteristic regarding the choice of drug. Younger people predominantly died of DXP (mean age 43 years, 95% confidence interval, CI 39-47), and elderly people of sedatives (mean age 59 years, CI 55-63). Antidepressants were found mainly in middle-aged victims (mean age 51 years, CI 48-54).
   The predominance of sedatives among the elderly might be explained by a very high prescription rate of such drugs in older age groups, but prescription rate could not explain the DXP predominance among younger people. We hypothesize that younger people are more prone to abuse therapeutic drugs for euphoric reasons than elderly people, and that because of its high toxicity, DXP leads to accidental deaths more often than sedatives.

AB IMPORTANCE Advancing paternal age is associated with increased genetic mutations during spermatogenesis, which research suggests may cause psychiatric morbidity in the offspring. The effects of advancing paternal age at childbearing on offspring morbidity remain unclear, however, because of inconsistent epidemiologic findings and the inability of previous studies to rigorously rule out confounding factors.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the associations between advancing paternal age at childbearing and numerous indexes of offspring morbidity.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We performed a population-based cohort study of all individuals born in Sweden in 1973-2001 (N = 2 615 081), with subsets of the data used to predict childhood or adolescent morbidity. We estimated the risk of psychiatric and academic morbidity associated with advancing paternal age using several quasi-experimental designs, including the comparison of differentially exposed siblings, cousins, and first-born cousins.
   EXPOSURE Paternal age at childbearing.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Psychiatric (autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, psychosis, bipolar disorder, suicide attempt, and substance use problem) and academic (failing grades and low educational attainment) morbidity.
   RESULTS In the study population, advancing paternal age was associated with increased risk of some psychiatric disorders (eg, autism, psychosis, and bipolar disorders) but decreased risk of the other indexes of morbidity. In contrast, the sibling-comparison analyses indicated that advancing paternal age had a dose-response relationship with every index of morbidity, with the magnitude of the associations being as large or larger than the estimates in the entire population. Compared with offspring born to fathers 20 to 24 years old, offspring of fathers 45 years and older were at heightened risk of autism (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.45; 95% CI, 1.62-7.33), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (HR = 13.13; 95% CI, 6.85-25.16), psychosis (HR = 2.07; 95% CI, 1.35-3.20), bipolar disorder (HR = 24.70; 95% CI, 12.12-50.31), suicide attempts (HR = 2.72; 95% CI, 2.08-3.56), substance use problems (HR = 2.44; 95% CI, 1.98-2.99), failing a grade (odds ratio [OR] = 1.59; 95% CI, 1.37-1.85), and low educational attainment (OR = 1.70; 95% CI, 1.50-1.93) in within-sibling comparisons. Additional analyses using several quasi-experimental designs obtained commensurate results, further strengthening the internal and external validity of the findings.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Advancing paternal age is associated with increased risk of psychiatric and academic morbidity, with the magnitude of the risks being as large or larger than previous estimates. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that new genetic mutations that occur during spermatogenesis are causally related to offspring morbidity.

AB Assertive community treatment programmes are increasingly common worldwide but without much knowledge of their long-term effect. We investigated whether the implementation of such a programme would improve symptomatic and functional outcome 5 years later.
   Naturalistic cohort study between 1995 and 2000 of all first-episode psychosis patients (n = 144) in Uppsala County, Sweden. We compared a 3-year period before (non-mACT) and after the introduction of a modified assertive community treatment (mACT) programme in 1998. Five-year outcome was assessed for symptoms and functioning and the two co-primary outcome measures were positive and negative symptoms. Regression models were adjusted for a propensity score based on multiple baseline variables and use of antipsychotics at 5-year follow-up.
   Contrary to our hypothesis, patients in the mACT group, compared to those in the non-mACT group, had a borderline significant increased risk of having a poor 5-year outcome regarding positive psychotic symptoms [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-10.63]. There was no difference at the 5-year follow-up between the mACT and non-mACT group regarding negative symptoms (adjusted OR 1.65, 95% CI 0.48-5.66), or any of the secondary outcome measures: global assessment of functioning, hazardous alcohol use, use of illicit drugs, working or being in education, independent living, subjective satisfaction with life or suicide. Results were similar in subgroup analyses.
   The implementation of a modified assertive community treatment was not followed by subsequent improvements of 5-year outcome on a group level for patients with first-episode psychosis.

AB OBJECTIVE To assess the exposure to different stressors and the prevalence of depression among medical students at different levels of education, taking gender differences into account.
   DESIGN Students were asked to complete a new stress inventory called the Higher Education Stress Inventory (HESI), the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), slightly modified, and questions on suicidal ideation developed by Meehan.
   SETTING The study was carried out at the Karolinska Institute Medical University, Stockholm, Sweden. Matched controls from the general population were used.
   PARTICIPANTS All registered students in Years 1, 3 and 6 were enrolled in the study (n = 342). The response rate was 90.4%.
   RESULTS Year 1 students gave high ratings to the workload and lack of feedback stressors. Year 3 students gave high ratings to 'Worries about future endurance/competence' and 'Pedagogical shortcomings'. In Year 6, both the latter factors were rated highly, but Year 6 students also gave higher ratings than the 2 other groups to 'Non-supportive climate'. In all 3 cohorts students complained of lack of feedback. Female students gave higher ratings than males to 4 out of 7 factors. Several stress factors were identified as being associated with depression. The prevalence of depressive symptoms among students was 12.9%, significantly higher than in the general population, and was 16.1% among female students versus 8.1% among males. A total of 2.7% of students had made suicide attempts, but none during the previous year.
   CONCLUSION Year 1 students indicated experiencing the highest degree of pressure from studies. A gender difference regarding stress levels was also seen, where women reported higher levels of stress than men. Medical students had higher depression rates than the general population, and women students had higher rates than men.

AB Background We examined whether childhood conduct problems predicted a wide range of adverse outcomes in emerging adulthood and whether the association with internalizing problems remained after adjusting for general comorbidity and externalizing problems. Methods Participants were 18,649 twins from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden. At age 9/12, parents rated their children on eight conduct problems. Adverse outcomes were retrieved from national registers in emerging adulthood (median follow-up time = 9.2 years), including diagnoses of six psychiatric disorders, prescriptions of antidepressants, suicide attempts, criminality, high school ineligibility, and social welfare recipiency. We estimated risk for the separate outcomes and examined if conduct problems predicted an internalizing factor above and beyond a general comorbidity and an externalizing factor. We used twin analyses to estimate genetic and environmental contributions to these associations. Results On the average, each additional conduct symptom in childhood was associated with a 32% increased risk of the adverse outcomes in emerging adulthood (mean hazard ratio = 1.32; range = 1.16, 1.56). A latent childhood conduct problems factor predicted the internalizing factor in emerging adulthood (beta(boys) = .24, standard error, SE = 0.03; beta(girls) = .17, SE = 0.03), above and beyond its association with the externalizing (beta(boys) = 0.21, SE = 0.04; beta(girls) = 0.17, SE = 0.05) and general factors (beta(boys) = 0.45, SE = 0.03; beta(girls) = 0.34, SE = 0.04). These associations were differentially influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Conclusions It is important to monitor boys and girls with conduct problems not only for future externalizing problems, but also for future internalizing problems. Prevention of specific outcomes, however, might require interventions at different levels.

AB Background There is inconsistent evidence regarding the presence of a socioeconomic differential in adolescent all-cause and cause-specific mortality. This study examines possible socioeconomic mortality differentials in Korean adolescents.
   Method A total of 330 321 boys and 311830 girls aged 10-19, who are health insurance beneficiaries for civil servants and private school teachers of Korean Health Insurance Cooperation, were followed for 9 years (1995-2003). Parental income information was linked to national death certificate data.
   Results For boys, all-cause mortality showed a graded inverse relationship with income level in both 10-14 year Olds (RR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.40-1.91) and 15-19 year Olds (RR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.40-1.91). The major contributor was mortality differentials from external causes, with differentials of transport accident death the most important. Mortality from circulatory disease was higher in the lowest income groups in 15-19 year Olds (RR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.09-4.50). A significant socioeconomic gradient of non-external cause mortality was found in 15-19 year olds. For girls, socioeconomic differentials were less evident than boys. The all-cause mortality gradient for girls was smaller than for boys and only significant between the lowest and the highest tertile in both 10-14 year Olds and 15-19 year Olds (RR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.02-1.72, RR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.11-1.72, respectively). There were significant socioeconomic mortality differentials in all external causes and transport accidents and a marginally significant difference in suicide mortality for 10-19 year olds. Mortality from non-external causes showed no social gradient in girls.
   Conclusions Socioeconomic differentials in all-cause mortality were observed in adolescents, even in early youth. This pattern might also apply to mortality from non-external causes, especially cardiovascular disease in 15-19 year old males.

DT Article
AB The correspondence between Helmi Maelo (1898-1978) and Ulo Koit (1925-1996) is deposited in the Helmi and Bernhard Math) collections at the Estonian Cultural History Archives (EKLA, collection 226, m. 17:15 (Maelo to Koit) and EKLA, collection 226, m 24:11 (Koit to Melo)). Their correspondence began in 1956, meaning practically immediately after contacts became possible between Soviet Estonia and the world abroad after the CPSU 20th Congress, which is surprising since the persons involved were not at all so close to each other to restore contact at the first opportunity.
   Helmi Maelo was a nationalist with conservative views who had been active primarily in the field of journalism in the Republic of Estonia, editing several women's and children's periodicals. She had also started her work in fictional literature. She was active in the temperance movement and supported other idealistic undertakings. She had escaped to Germany with her family in 1944 and from there onward to Sweden. She earned a living in Sweden as an office clerk at a publishing house, directing most of her energy to her own literary activity. Maelo has penned over ten novels, a number of stories for young people, several works of memoirs and numerous brochures on temperance and education. It was at her initiative that Mothers' Day started being observed in Estonia beginning in 1923.
   Ulo Koit, who was born in the Republic of Estonia, was evacuated at the age of 16 with his mother to the rear area in the Soviet Union when the war broke out. There he studied at courses for Party employees and began his career as a KGB agent after the war upon returning to Estonia, and later as a confidant while working at the same time as the editor of the Valgamaalane newspaper (1944-1950). He served as deputy chairman of the Estonian SSR Television and Radio Committee (1950-1975). His dead body was found in September of 1996 in the Lielupe River in Latvia and to this day it is not known if it was an accident, suicide or murder. Their correspondence began when Maelo wrote to Koit's mother, whom she knew from the period of Estonian independence. Since the latter had died during the war, her son answered the letter. The correspondence continued until Helmi Maelo's death and later continued to a lesser extent between Ulo Koit and Bernhard Maelo. They exchanged information about cultural events and their personal lives, but also about politics. The correspondence gave Maelo an overview of life in her occupied homeland. Koit, on the other hand, acquired information about the moods and fears of expatriate circles and helped him gain contacts among expatriate Estonians abroad. This could help readers of the publication to understand those barriers that had arisen between Estonians in the homeland and expatriate Estonians abroad during the post-war decades, to see the different ways that contacts were established but also to see the hidden reefs in this intercommunication.

AB Although pharmacological treatments can help alleviate mood symptoms in youth with paediatric bipolar disorder (PBD), residual symptoms still commonly persist. In many cases, these symptoms seriously affect the social and psychological development of children and adolescents suffering from PBD. Complementary interventions, such as psychosocial and psychoeducational treatments, can help children and their families manage mood regulation and other challenges throughout childhood and adolescence. However, most research on such interventions has focused on children, single-family psychoeducation, and individual cognitive behavioural therapy. The present study, conducted in Sweden, used a case-series design to explore whether child-and family-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (CFF-CBT) for PBD, adapted from children (8-12 years) to adolescents (13-18 years) and applied in a multi-family format, could help reduce symptoms, improve psychosocial functioning, increase parents' knowledge of and skills for coping with the disorder, and improve family expressed emotion for adolescents with PBD. Furthermore, we aimed to assess whether the effects of such CFF-CBT are maintained at a one-year follow-up. Seven adolescents and 11 parents in two multi-family groups received twelve sessions of CFF-CBT. Self-rating questionnaires and clinical observations were used to evaluate clinically significant changes for individual cases. The results suggest that CFF-CBT is feasible to deliver in an outpatient psychiatric setting and may be effective for developing parents' skills and knowledge for coping with PBD, increasing adolescents' psychosocial functioning, and improving family climate. The results are in line with previous findings on CFF-CBT for children with PBD, suggesting that CFF-CBT is a valuable adjunctive treatment for adolescents with PBD.

AB In many European countries, the last decade has been marked by an increasing debate about the acceptability and regulation'of euthanasia and other end-of-life decisions in medical practice. Growing public sensibility to a 'right to die' for terminally ill patients has been one of the main constituents of these debates. Within this context. we sought to describe and compare acceptance of euthanasia among the general public in 33 European countries. We used the European Values Study data of 1999-2000 with a total of 41 125 respondents (63% response rate) in 33 European countries. The main outcome measure concerned the acceptance of euthanasia (defined as 'terminating the life of the incurably sick', rated on a scale from I to 10).
   Results showed that the acceptance of euthanasia tended to be high in some Countries (e.g. the Netherlands, Denmark, France, Sweden), while a markedly low acceptance was found in others (e.g. Romania. Malta and Turkey). A multivariate ordinal regression showed that weaker religious belief was the most important factor associated with a higher acceptance: however, there were also socio-demographic differences: younger cohorts. people from non-manual social classes, and people with a higher educational level tended to have a higher acceptance of euthanasia. While religious belief. sociodemographic factors, and also moral values (i.e. the belief in the right to self-determination) could largely explain the differences between countries, our findings suggest that perceptions regarding euthanasia are probably also influenced by national traditions and history (e.g. Germany). Thus, we demonstrated clear cross-national differences with regard to the acceptance of euthanasia, which can serve as an important basis for further debate and research in the specific countries.

AB The objective of this paper is to introduce the epidemiology of injuries in China, and then consider the development of safe communities in regard to injury prevention and safety promotion. The disease spectrum has changed in recent decades in the People's Republic of China. Both in cities and rural areas, injury has become the fifth leading cause of death. At least 800 000 people die from injury each year, and 50 million non-fatal injuries occur, of which 2.3 million lead to disability of varying degrees of severity. The average injury-related death rate in China from 1990 to 1997 was 66 per 100 000, which accounts for 11% of total deaths. The potential years of life lost (PYLL) of injury accounts for 24% of the total, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) account for 17%. Main injury causes of death, in descending order, are: suicide, traffic accident, drowning, falling, poisoning, homicide, burn and scald, and iatrogenic injury. Considering China's current injury status and its rapid societal change, injury prevention and safety promotion need to be strengthened further, and there is a special need for the development of Safe Communities programmes. The prevention of injuries through safety promotion has been increasingly focussed on over recent decades. The WHO Safe Community model is recognized as representing an effective and long-term approach to the prevention of injuries at a local level, and has been beneficially applied all over the world. A programme may cover several aspects of injury prevention and safety promotion simultaneously, or only include one or two aspects. In a Safe Community programme in China, children, the elderly, cyclists and their passengers, and farmers should be among the prioritized target populations. However, multi-focussed inter-sectoral programmes have been shown to have additional effects to distinct sectoral programmes.

AB Objectives: To test the hypothesis that manual workers are at higher risk of death than are non-manual employees when living in municipalities with higher income inequality. Design: Hierarchical regression was used for the analysis were individuals were nested within municipalities according to the 1990 Swedish census. The outcome was all-cause mortality 1992-1998. The income measure at the individual level was disposable family income weighted against composition of family; the income inequality measure used at the municipality level was the Gini coefficient. Participants: The study population consisted of 1 578 186 people aged 40-64 years in the 1990 Swedish census, who were being reported as unskilled or skilled manual workers, lower-, intermediate-, or high-level non-manual employees. Results: There was no significant association between income inequality at the municipality level and risk of death, but an expected gradient with unskilled manual workers having the highest risk and high-level non-manual employees having the lowest. However, in the interaction models the relative risk (RR) of death for high-level non-manual employees was decreasing with increasing income inequality (RR = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63-0.93), whereas the corresponding risk for unskilled manual workers increased with increasing income inequality (RR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06-1.46). The RRs for skilled manual, low- and medium- level non-manual employees were not significant. Controlling for income at the individual level did not substantially alter these findings, neither did potential confounders at the municipality level. Conclusions: The findings suggest that there could be a differential impact from income inequality on risk of death, dependent on individuals' social position.

AB BackgroundTwo major sets of criteria for the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) recently have been published, one from an International Working Group (IWG) and the other from working groups convened by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the Alzheimer's Association (AA) in the United States. These criteria both aim to support a clinical diagnosis with in vivo evidence of AD pathology, using imaging methods and detection of biofluid biomarkers, and emphasize an aetiological diagnosis even in the prodromal stages of the disorder. Nonetheless, there are substantial differences in these two sets of criteria.
   MethodsAn international group of investigators with experience in the clinical diagnosis of AD met at the Key Symposium in Stockholm, Sweden on 6 & 7 December 2012, to develop recommendations to harmonize these criteria. The group was led by individuals who were integral to the development of both the IWG and the NIA-AA criteria. The similarities and differences between the two sets of criteria were identified and open discussion focused on ways to resolve the differences and thus yield a harmonized set of criteria.
   ResultsBased on both published evidence as well as the group's collective clinical experience, the group was tasked with achieving consensus, if not unanimity, as it developed recommendations for harmonized clinical diagnostic criteria for AD.
   ConclusionThe recommendations are to: (i) define AD as a brain disorder, regardless of clinical status; (ii) refer to the clinically expressed disorder, including its prodromal stages, as symptomatic AD; (iii) after the successful completion of standardization efforts, consider incorporating biomarkers into diagnostic algorithms for AD; and (iv) allow nonamnestic, atypical presentations to be included as symptomatic AD, especially when there is supportive biomarker evidence.

AB We examined health and social outcomes among children related to parental disposable income and receipt of social assistance. Swedish national registry data were used in a longitudinal design. We estimated relative risks and odds ratios for health and social outcomes in Poisson and logistic regressions among 1.2 million children between 1993 and 2002, and adjusted for factors that might affect the associations. Children in families receiving long-term social assistance showed considerably less satisfactory future prospects regarding health-related outcomes-all-cause mortality, suicide attempt, alcohol and drug misuse. Also, and to an even greater extent, the children experienced low educational attainment and social assistance in young adulthood compared with the rest of the population, and also in comparison with other low-income families. Low income was also associated with risk increases, but to a lesser extent. After taking into account the greater proportion of social-assistance recipients in low-income groups, attenuated risk increases remained only regarding future prospects of low education and social assistance. Regarding both low income and months receiving social assistance there was a gradient, at least in the age-adjusted analyses; there were greater risk increases among long-term recipients and among those with low incomes, and lower risk increases among short-term recipients and among those with high incomes.
   The results indicate that growing up in a family on long-term social assistance is a robust risk marker for compromised long-term development. A policy whereby children and parents receiving long-term assistance are offered access to evidence-based prevention programs in the areas of health, education and skills training appears to be important.

AB This paper hypothesizes that the intensity of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) from the Sun predisposes humans to polygenic mutation fostering major mental illness (MMI) and other disorders of neurodevelopment. In addition, the variation in the intensity of this radiation acts to stress immune systems, possibly mediated by cytokines, resulting in variable clinical expressions of mental illness and autoimmune disorders. Organisms can adapt to chronic high-intensity UVR by producing melanin and by retaining various pigments. We found that 28% of 11-year solar cycles produce particularly severe solar flares during which UVR is 300% more intense and hence more damaging than normal. Out of a total of six severe cycles in the past 250 years, four have occurred in the past 55 years, possibly explaining the apparent increase in the incidence of MMI in recent decades. UVR is 10 times more mutagenic than ionizing radiation to nuclear DNA, and especially damaging to mitochondrial DNA. However, variable Light as manifested by seasons stresses adaptability to UVR, possibly through an immune mechanism. We show that the region of the Earth having the most UVR, relative to the most variation in that tight, is at 54+/-similar to10degrees (N or S) latitude. Therefore, the most potential damage from sunlight occurs between the Equator and the Poles, not at the Equator itself. The human brain, our most important organ of adaptability, must be able to survive environmental variation, with successful matching to the environment resulting in adaptation. Unsuccessful adaptation to UVR (and possibly other types of radiation) results in mutation, which can produce neuro-chemical abnormalities manifested by MMI. We postulate that the combination of intensity and variation in UVR serves as a global modulator of MMI. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The association between exposure to unemployment and increased risk of mortality is well established. Yet migrants and their children often experience a number of stressors in the country of residence which could exacerbate the negative effects of job loss or unemployment. This study examined the extent to which region of origin and generational status modified associations between employment status and risk of all-cause mortality. Methods: Using population-based registers, an open cohort of 2 178 321 individuals aged 25-64 years was followed from 1993 to 2008. Hazard ratios for mortality were calculated using Cox regression. Employment status and socio-demographic covariates were included as time-varying variables in all models. Results: Relative to employed native-origin Swedes, excess risk of mortality was found among most groups of unemployed persons. The excess risk of mortality found among African women exposed to long-term unemployment (HR = 3.26, 95% CI: 2.30-4.63), Finnish men exposed to short-and long-term unemployment (HR = 2.74, 95% CI: 2.32-3.24 and HR = 2.39, 95% CI: 2.12-2.69), and second generation Swedish men exposed to short-term unemployment (HR = 2.34, 95% CI: 2.06-2.64) was significantly greater (P < 0.05) than that found among their unemployed native-origin counterparts. Excess risk of mortality among the unemployed in other foreign-origin groups was of a similar or lower magnitude to that found in unemployed native-origin Swedes. A decreased risk of mortality was observed among the employed in nearly all foreign-origin groups. Conclusions: With some exceptions, mortality risk in foreign-origin individuals across all categories of employment status was generally similar to or lower than the risk observed in native-origin Swedes.

TI Associations of Maternal Antidepressant Use During the First Trimester

   Offspring
SO OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY

DT Editorial Material
AB While antidepressant use during pregnancy has been associated with adverse birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes, these associations may be attributed to confounding factors, such as genetic influences, maternal stress, or poor health practices during pregnancy. This study used 4 observational designs to investigate these associations, including sibling and paternal information.
   The study used multiple national Swedish registries. First-trimester exposures, defined as at least 1 dispensation between 90 days before estimated conceptions and 90 days after estimated conception, to any antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, reported through either maternal self-report or dispensation records, were the main exposures evaluated. The main outcomes were small for gestational age, defined as birth weight less than 2 SDs below the mean for gestational age; preterm birth, defined as less than 37 gestational weeks; and diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Maternal and paternal covariates included age of childbearing, highest level of completed education, history of criminal conviction, history of psychiatric illnesses, history of suicide attempts, and country of origin (Sweden or outside Sweden). Parity and year of birth were pregnancy covariates. Population-wide baseline models were assessed adjusting only for pregnancy covariates. Then, population-wide associations were adjusted for maternal and paternal covariates as well. A third model compared exposure-and outcome-discordant offspring within families.
   After exclusion of multiple births, missing father identifiers, or other missing information, a final cohort of 1,580,629 offspring born to 943,776 was used. Of these, 26,477 offspring had first-trimester maternal antidepressant dispensations, 22,125 of which were selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor dispensations. Preterm births accounted for 6.98% of exposed and 4.78% of unexposed offspring. In the baseline models, first-trimester exposure was associated with all 4 outcomes (preterm birth odds ratio [OR], 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.40-1.55]; small for gestational age OR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.06-1.25]; ADHD HR, 2.21 [95% CI, 2.04-2.39]). After adjusting for pregnancy and maternal and paternal traits and comparing sibling data, first-trimester antidepressant exposure was associated with only a small increased risk of preterm birth (OR, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.18-1.52]) and was not associated with small for gestational age (OR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.81-1.25]), ADHD (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.79-1.25]), or autism spectrum disorder (HR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.62-1.13]).
   Unexposed and exposed siblings were found to be at equal risk of small for gestational age, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorder as one another, whereas exposed siblings had a slightly increased risk of preterm birth. Both autism spectrum disorder and ADHD were associated with paternal first-trimester antidepressant dispensations, supporting the idea that familial confounding may explain associations between exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB Objective Emotion regulation group therapy (ERGT) has shown promising results in several efficacy trials. However, it has not been evaluated outside a research setting. In order to increase the availability of empirically supported treatments for individuals with borderline personality disorder and deliberate self-harm, an evaluation of ERGT in routine clinical care was conducted with therapists of different professional backgrounds who had received brief intensive training in ERGT prior to trial onset.
   Design Multi-site evaluation, using an uncontrolled open trial design with assessments at pretreatment, post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. &&Setting 14 adult outpatient psychiatric clinics across Sweden.
   Participants Ninety-five women (mean age=25.1 years) with borderline personality disorder (both threshold and subthreshold) and repeated self-harm were enrolled in the study. Ninety-three per cent of participants completed the post-treatment assessment and 88% completed the follow-up assessment.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures Primary outcome was self-harm frequency as measured with the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory. Secondary outcomes included self-harm versatility, emotion dysregulation, other self-destructive behaviours, depression, anxiety, stress symptoms and interpersonal and vocational difficulties.
   Intervention ERGT is an adjunctive, 14-week, acceptance-based behavioural group treatment that directly targets both self-harm and its proposed underlying mechanism of emotion dysregulation.
   Results At post-treatment, intent-to-treat analyses revealed a significant improvement associated with a moderate effect size on the primary outcome of self-harm frequency (51%, reduction; Cohen's d=0.52, p<0.001) as well as significant improvements in the secondary outcomes of self-harm versatility, emotion dysregulation, other self-destructive behaviours and general psychiatric symptomatology. These results were either maintained or further improved on at 6-month follow-up.
   Conclusions ERGT appears to be a feasible, transportable and useful treatment for deliberate self-harm and other self-destructive behaviours, emotion dysregulation and psychiatric symptoms when delivered by clinicians in the community.

Included were all 4,760,987 individuals who were living in Sweden December 31, 2005, aged 20 to 64 years, and not on disability or old-age pension. Those sickness absent in 2005 because of musculoskeletal diagnoses were compared to those sickness absent because of non-musculoskeletal diagnoses and to those with no sickness absence. Musculoskeletal diagnoses were categorized as follows: 1) artropathies/systemic connective tissue disorders; 2) dorsopathies; and 3) soft tissue disorders/osteopathies/chondropathies/other musculoskeletal disorders. All-cause mortality was followed from 2006 to 2009 and cause-specific mortality was followed from 2006 to 2008. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox regression. In models adjusted for socio-demographic factors, and morbidity, sickness absence because of all 3 categories of musculoskeletal diagnoses was associated with 1.3- to 1.5-fold increased risks of all-cause mortality (adjusted model, category 1 diagnoses, HR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.38-1.63). Similar associations were observed among both women and men. Moreover, increased mortality risks due to tumors (HR = 1.6-1.7), circulatory diseases (HR = 1.2-1.5), mental disorders (HR = 1.2-3.2), and suicide (HR = 1.5-1.9) were observed among persons sickness absent because of musculoskeletal diagnoses. This nationwide cohort study reveals, for the first time, an increased risk of premature death among both women and men sickness absent because of musculoskeletal diagnoses after adjustment for several potential confounders.

AB The concentration of free-morphine was determined in peripheral (femoral) blood from heroin-related deaths and compared with the concentration in venous blood from impaired drivers. The presence of 6-MAM in blood or urine served as a biomarker for recent use of heroin. Males dominated over females (p < 0.001) in both the autopsy cases (88%) and the drivers (91%), although their mean age was about the same 33-35 y (p > 0.05). Concentrations of free-morphine in blood were not associated with age of heroin users in Sweden (p > 0.05). The median concentration of free-morphine was higher in autopsy cases (0.24 mg/L, N = 766) compared with apprehended drivers with 6-MAM in blood (0.15 mg/L, N = 124, p < 0.05), and appreciably higher than in drivers with 6-MAM in urine but not in blood (0.03 mg/L, N = 1823, p < 0.001). The free-morphine concentration was above 0.20 mg/L in 65% of autopsy cases, 36% of drivers with 6-MAM in blood but only 1.4% of drivers with 6-MAM in urine. Poly-drug deaths had about the same concentrations of free-morphine in blood (0.24 mg/L, N = 703) as heroin-only deaths (0.25 mg/L, N = 63). The concentration of morphine in drug overdose deaths (median 0.25 mg/L, N = 669) was about the same as in traumatic deaths among heroin users (0.23 mg/L, N = 97). However, the concentration of morphine was lower when the deceased had consumed alcohol (0.18 mg/L, N = 104) compared with taking a benzodiazepine (0.32 mg/L, N = 94). The concentration distributions of free-morphine in blood in heroin-related deaths overlapped with the concentrations in impaired drivers, which makes the interpretation of toxicology results difficult without knowledge about tolerance to opiates in any individual case.

AB Background: Community cohort studies and meta-analyses of randomized trials have shown a relation between low or lowered cholesterol and death by violence (homicide, suicide, accident); in primates, cholesterol reduction has been linked to increased behavioral acts of aggression (Kaplan J, Manuck S. The effects of fat and cholesterol on aggressive behaviour in monkeys. Psychosom. Med 1990;52:226-7; Kaplan J, Shivery C, Fontenot D, Morgan T, Howell S, Manuck S et al. Demonstration of an association among dietary cholesterol, central serotonergic activity, and social behaviour in monkeys. Psychosom. Med 1994;56:479-84.). In this study we test for the first time whether cholesterol level is related to commission of violent crimes against others in a large community cohort.
   Methods: We merged one-time cholesterol measurements on 79,777 subjects enrolled in a health screening project in Varmland, Sweden with subsequent police records for arrests for violent crimes in men and women aged 24-70 at enrollment; and with information on covariates. We performed a nested case control comparison of cholesterol in violent criminals - defined as those with two or more crimes of violence against others - to cholesterol in nonoffenders matched on age, enrollment year, sex, education and alcohol, using variable-ratio matching, with a nonparametric sign test.
   Results: One hundred individuals met criteria for criminal violence. Low cholesterol (below the median) was strongly associated with criminal violence in unadjusted analysis (Men: risk ratio 1.94, P = 0.002; all subjects risk ratio 2.32, P < 0.001). Age emerged as a strong confounder. Adjusting for covariates using a matching procedure, violent criminals had significantly lower cholesterol than others identical in age, sex, alcohol indices and education, using a nonparametric sign test (P = 0.012 all subjects; P = 0.035 men).
   Conclusions: Adjusting for other factors, low cholesterol is associated with increased subsequent criminal violence. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd, All rights reserved.

AB Cancer of the esophagus is often diagnosed at a late stage and is related to severe morbidity and a low 5-year survival rate. Previous studies have reported low health-related quality of life and high suicide rates for these patients. The occurrence of psychiatric morbidity and thus the potential need for psychological support may vary over time after diagnosis. This has not been adequately studied in patients with newly diagnosed cancer of the esophagus or gastro-esophageal junction. The present study therefore aimed to prospectively evaluate the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in 94 consecutive patients (median age 66, range 45-88 years) with all stages of disease. Psychiatric morbidity was evaluated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire at inclusion and 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months later. At inclusion, 42% of the patients had HADS scores indicating possible or probable anxiety disorder and/or depression. At all follow-ups except at 3 months, proportions of patients with possible/probable anxiety disorder were significantly lower than at inclusion. Among patients with a duration of tumor-specific symptoms exceeding 6 months pre-diagnosis, larger proportions of patients with a possible/probable anxiety disorder were found at the 1- and 6-month follow ups. The prevalence of possible/probable depression was greater among patients treated with a palliative intent than among those with a curative intent at inclusion. Patients who died during the study period scored worse for depression compared to the survivors. Apart from this, the proportion of patients with possible/probable psychiatric morbidity (anxiety and/or depression) was relatively stable over time and was unrelated to patient characteristics or clinical background, including the treatment regime. In conclusion, psychiatric morbidity is common among esophageal cancer patients, both at inclusion and over time, regardless of the cancer therapy given. The findings stress the importance of monitoring the patients' mental health and of offering adequate psychological care when needed.

   SUICIDE; RISK; STRESS; ABUSE; HOSPITALIZATION; CONSEQUENCES
AB Background: Bereavement by spousal death and child death in adulthood has been shown to lead to an increased risk of mortality. Maternal death in infancy or parental death in early childhood may have an impact on mortality but evidence has been limited to short-term or selected causes of death. Little is known about long-term or cause-specific mortality after parental death in childhood.
   Methods and Findings: This cohort study included all persons born in Denmark from 1968 to 2008 (n = 2,789,807) and in Sweden from 1973 to 2006 (n = 3,380,301), and a random sample of 89.3% of all born in Finland from 1987 to 2007 (n = 1,131,905). A total of 189,094 persons were included in the exposed cohort when they lost a parent before 18 years old. Log-linear Poisson regression was used to estimate mortality rate ratio (MRR). Parental death was associated with a 50% increased all-cause mortality (MRR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.43-1.58). The risks were increased for most specific cause groups and the highest MRRs were observed when the cause of child death and the cause of parental death were in the same category. Parental unnatural death was associated with a higher mortality risk (MRR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.71-2.00) than parental natural death (MRR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.24-1.41). The magnitude of the associations varied according to type of death and age at bereavement over different follow-up periods. The main limitation of the study is the lack of data on post-bereavement information on the quality of the parent-child relationship, lifestyles, and common physical environment.
   Conclusions: Parental death in childhood or adolescence is associated with increased all-cause mortality into early adulthood. Since an increased mortality reflects both genetic susceptibility and long-term impacts of parental death on health and social well-being, our findings have implications in clinical responses and public health strategies.

AB Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning either accidental or as suicide, is a common cause of death encountered in routine medicolegal autopsies. It is less well known that CO can also be formed from the resin in wood fibers. Wood pellets emit the highest amount of CO in the weeks following production. Insufficient ventilation, particularly during storage of freshly made wood pellets in storage bunkers for heating devices, therefore leads to accumulation of dangerous concentrations of CO.
   This article aims to alert the readership to the dangers of CO poisoning resulting from inappropriate storage of wood pellets.
   The dangers are exemplified by the case of a 43-year-old man who was found dead in a storage room for wood pellets. The cause of death was CO poisoning due to a blood carboxyhemoglobin concentration of 75 %. The findings were compared with 14 further fatal cases of asphyxia involving wood pellets and wood products published in the literature for the time period 2002-2014. The first scientific investigations on this phenomenon were carried out particularly in the USA, Canada, Sweden and China as large-scale producers of wood pellets and were included in the assessment of the literature.
   The evaluation of the currently available literature showed that the dangers associated with the storage of wood pellets as a purportedly harmless source of energy are to a large extent unappreciated and have already led to fatal accidents. Under this aspect it is conspicuous that due to the expansion of the market into private dwellings, private users have also suffered fatal accidents so that an official risk assessment with a clear and uniform identification of hazards appears to be necessary.
   The public awareness of the dangers resulting from the storage of wood pellets must be increased. Official, uniform danger markings and recommendations for handling (e.g. only entering a pellet bunker with a CO detection warning device and/or breathing mask) should be made public in order to avoid fatal accidents by CO poisoning.

TI Injuries before and after diagnosis of cancer: nationwide register based
   study
SO BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; SUICIDE; DEATH; STRESS
AB OBJECTIVE
   To examine the relative risks of iatrogenic and non-iatrogenic injuries during the period shortly before and after a diagnosis of cancer.
   DESIGN
   Nationwide register based study.
   SETTING
   Swedish national population and health registers.
   PARTICIPANTS
   720 901 patients with diagnosis of cancer, 1991-2009, in Sweden.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
   All hospital admissions in patients with cancer with a main discharge diagnosis of iatrogenic (from medical complications) or non-iatrogenic injuries in 1990-2010 identified from the Swedish patient register. Conditional Poisson regression was used to compare the incidence rate of injuries during the "diagnostic period" (16 weeks before to 16 weeks after diagnosis) with the incidence rate during a "pre-diagnostic period" (the same 32 weeks one year before diagnosis) among the same patients.
   RESULTS
   During the diagnostic period, there were 7306 iatrogenic (incidence rate 0.60 per 1000 person months) and 8331 non-iatrogenic injuries (incidence rate 0.69 per 1000 person months). For iatrogenic injuries, the incidence rate ratio was 7.0 (95% confidence interval 6.6 to 7.4) during the diagnostic period compared with the pre-diagnostic period. The increase in risk started two weeks before cancer diagnosis and peaked during the two weeks after diagnosis (48.6, 37.3 to 63.5). For non-iatrogenic injuries, the incidence rate ratio was 1.9 (1.8 to 2.0) during the diagnostic period compared with the pre-diagnostic period. The increase in risk began four weeks before diagnosis and peaked during the two weeks before diagnosis (5.3, 4.6 to 6.1). There were increased risks of both types of injury during the diagnostic period for all common cancers, with the smallest risk increase noted for non-melanoma skin cancer.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Patients with cancer have highly increased risks of both iatrogenic and non-iatrogenic injuries requiring inpatient care shortly before and after their diagnosis. These findings shed further light on the total burden of medical complications and call for prevention of intentional and unintentional injuries during the diagnostic process of cancer.

AB OBJECTIVES:Parental death during childhood has been linked to increased mortality and mental health problems in adulthood. School failure may be an important mediator in this trajectory. We investigated the association between parental death before age 15 years and school performance at age 15 to 16 years, taking into account potentially contributing factors such as family socioeconomic position (SEP) and parental substance abuse, mental health problems, and criminality.METHODS:This was a register-based national cohort study of 772117 subjects born in Sweden between 1973 and 1981. Linear and logistic regression models were used to analyze school performance as mean grades (scale: 1-5; SD: 0.70) and school failure (finished school with incomplete grades). Results are presented as -coefficients and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).RESULTS:Parental death was associated with lower grades (ORs: -0.21 [95% CI: -0.23 to -0.20] and -0.17 [95% CI: -0.19 to -0.15]) for paternal and maternal deaths, respectively. Adjustment for SEP and parental psychosocial factors weakened the associations, but the results remained statistically significant. Unadjusted ORs of school failure were 2.04 (95% CI: 1.92 to 2.17) and 1.51 (95% CI: 1.35 to 1.69) for paternal and maternal deaths. In fully adjusted models, ORs were 1.40 (95% CI: 1.31 to 1.49) and 1.18 (95% CI: 1.05 to 1.32). The higher crude impact of death due to external causes (ie, accident, violence, suicide) (OR: -0.27 [90% CI: -0.28 to -0.26]), compared with natural deaths (OR: -0.16 [95% CI: -0.17 to -0.15]), was not seen after adjustment for SEP and psychosocial situation of the family.CONCLUSIONS:Parental death during childhood was associated with lower grades and school failure. Much of the effect, especially for deaths by external causes, was associated with socially adverse childhood exposures.

AB Internationally and nationally adopted young men were recently reported to have lower than average scores on intelligence tests at military conscription, compared with non-adopted conscripts in Sweden. In this study we used the Swedish national registers to analyse how this lower cognitive competence influences the educational attainment of adoptees. Intelligence test scores at conscription were analysed in relation to educational attainment at follow-up at 25-34 years in male international (n = 2.314) and national (n = 1.153) adoptees, compared with the general population in the same birth cohorts.
   Korean adoptees more often had obtained a post-secondary education compared with the general population while Non-Korean and national adoptees less often had such an education at follow-up. The international adoptees had a better chance than the general population to complete a post-secondary level and a lower risk to remain at a basic level when their cognitive competence, as measured by intelligence test scores, had been accounted for. This effect was quite similar in biological children in families of international adoptees who had the best test scores, in the Korean adoptees who had slightly better test scores than the general population, and in the Non-Korean adoptees who had considerably lower test scores. National adoptees had similar outcomes in these respects as the general population when test scores had been accounted for. Higher age at adoption was associated with a lower educational attainment in the Non-Korean but not in the Korean adoptees, an effect that was attenuated when test scores were accounted for.
   We conclude that a lower than average cognitive competence did influence the educational attainment of the Non-Korean international and the Swedish-born adoptees in this study. international but not national adoptees had attained a higher educational level than predicted from their scores on intelligence tests. This education promoting effect was similar in the Korean adoptees, who had high test scores in comparison with the general population, and the Non-Korean adoptees who had comparatively low test scores.

AB Background: Air pollution is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Experimental studies, and a few epidemiological studies, suggest that air pollution may cause acute exacerbation of psychiatric disorders, and even increase the rate of suicide attempts, but epidemiological studies on air pollution in association with psychiatric disorders are still few. Our aim was to investigate associations between daily fluctuations in air pollution concentrations and the daily number of visits to a psychiatric emergency unit.
   Methods: Data from Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden, on the daily number of visits to the Psychiatric emergency unit were combined with daily data on monitored concentrations of respirable particulate matter(PM10), ozone(O-3), nitrogen dioxides(NO2) and temperature between 1st July 2012 and 31st December 2016. We used a case-crossover design to analyze data with conditional Poisson regression models allowing for over-dispersion. We stratified data on season.
   Results: Visits increased with increasing PM10 levels during the warmer season (April to September) in both single-pollutant and two-pollutant models. For example, an increase of 3.6% (95% Confidence Interval, CI, 0.4-7.0%) was observed with a 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM10 adjusted for NO2. In the three-pollutant models (adjusting for NO2 and O-3 simultaneously) the increase was 3.3% (95% CI, -0.2-6.9). There were no clear associations between the outcome and NO2, O-3, or PM10 during the colder season (October to March).
   Conclusions: Ambient air particle concentrations were associated with the number of visits to the Psychiatric emergency unit in the warm season. The results were only borderline statistically significant in the fully adjusted (three-pollutant) models in this small study. The observation could be interpreted as indicative of air pollution as either exacerbating an underlying psychiatric disorder, or increasing mental distress, even in areas with comparatively low levels of air pollution. In combination with the severe impact of psychiatric disorders and mental distress on society and individuals, our results are a strong warrant for future research in this area.

AB Background: Mental health problems and risk behaviours among young people are of great public health concern. Consequently, within the VII Framework Programme, the European Commission funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in eleven European countries, with Sweden as the coordinating centre, and was designed to identify an effective way to promote mental health and reduce suicidality and risk taking behaviours among adolescents.
   Objective: To describe the methodological and field procedures in the SEYLE RCT among adolescents, as well as to present the main characteristics of the recruited sample.
   Methods: Analyses were conducted to determine: 1) representativeness of study sites compared to respective national data; 2) response rate of schools and pupils, drop-out rates from baseline to 3 and 12 month follow-up, 3) comparability of samples among the four Intervention Arms; 4) properties of the standard scales employed: Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (Z-SAS), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), World Health Organization Well-Being Scale (WHO-5).
   Results: Participants at baseline comprised 12,395 adolescents (M/F: 5,529/6,799; mean age=14.9 +/- 0.9) from Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain. At the 3 and 12 months follow up, participation rates were 87.3% and 79.4%, respectively. Demographic characteristics of participating sites were found to be reasonably representative of their respective national population. Overall response rate of schools was 67.8%. All scales utilised in the study had good to very good internal reliability, as measured by Cronbach's alpha (BDI-II: 0.864; Z-SAS: 0.805; SDQ: 0.740; WHO-5: 0.799).
   Conclusions: SEYLE achieved its objective of recruiting a large representative sample of adolescents within participating European countries. Analysis of SEYLE data will shed light on the effectiveness of important interventions aimed at improving adolescent mental health and well-being, reducing risk-taking and self-destructive behaviour and preventing suicidality.

AB IMPORTANCE Psychiatric comorbidities are common among patients with cancer. However, whether or not there is increased risk of mental disorders during the diagnostic workup leading to a cancer diagnosis was unknown.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the relative risks of depression, anxiety, substance abuse, somatoform/conversion disorder, and stress reaction/adjustment disorder during the periods before and after cancer diagnosis compared with individuals without cancer.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Nationwide matched cohort study from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2010, in a Swedish population and health registers.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We estimated the time-varying hazard ratios (HRs) of the first clinical diagnosis of the studied mental disorders from 2 years before cancer diagnosis, through the time of diagnosis, and until 10 years after diagnosis, adjusting for age, sex, calendar period, and educational level. To assess milder mental conditions and symptoms, we further assessed the use of related psychiatric medications for patients with cancer diagnosed during 2008-2009.
   RESULTS The study included 304 118 patients with cancer and 3 041 174 cancer-free individuals who were randomly selected from the Swedish population and individually matched to the patients with cancer on year of birth and sex. The median age at diagnosis for the patients with cancer was 69 years, and 46.9% of the patients were female. The relative rate for all studied mental disorders started to increase from 10 months before cancer diagnosis (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.1-1.2), peaked during the first week after diagnosis (HR, 6.7; 95% CI, 6.1-7.4), and decreased rapidly thereafter but remained elevated 10 years after diagnosis (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.1-1.2). The rate elevation was clear for all main cancers except nonmelanoma skin cancer and was stronger for cancers of poorer prognosis. Compared with cancer-free individuals, increased use of psychiatric medications was noted from 1 month before cancer diagnosis and peaked around 3 months after diagnosis among patients with cancer.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients diagnosed as having cancer had increased risks of several common mental disorders from the year before diagnosis. These findings support the existing guidelines of integrating psychological management into cancer care and further call for extended vigilance for multiple mental disorders starting from the time of the cancer diagnostic workup.

AB Background The media attention received by homicides committed by patients with mental illness is thought to increase stigma. However, people with mental illness can also be victims of violence. We aimed to assess how often victims of homicide are current mental health patients and their relationship to the perpetrators.
   Methods In a national consecutive case-series study, we obtained data for victims and perpetrators of all confirmed homicides between Jan 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2005, in England and Wales. We requested information about contact with mental health services in the 12 months before the homicide for all victims and perpetrators. For victims and perpetrators who had contact with mental health services in the 12 months before homicide, we sent questionnaires to the clinician responsible for the patient's care.
   Findings 1496 victims of confirmed homicide died between Jan 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2005, in England and Wales. Patients with mental illness were more likely to die by homicide than were people in the general population (incidence rate ratio 2.6, 95% CI 1.9-3.4). 90 homicide victims (6%) had contact with mental health services in the 12 months before their death. 213 patients with mental illness were convicted of homicide in the same 3 year period. 29 of 90 patient victims were killed by another patient with mental illness. In 23 of these 29 cases, the victim and perpetrator were known to each other, and in 21 of these cases, the victims and perpetrators were undergoing treatment at the same National Health Service Trust. In these 29 cases in which patient victims were killed by another patient with mental illness, alcohol and drug misuse (19 victims [66%], 27 perpetrators [93%]) and previous violence (7 victims [24%], 7 perpetrators [24%]) were common in both victims and, particularly, perpetrators. In seven of the 29 cases in which the victim was killed by another patient with mental illness, both victim and perpetrator were diagnosed with schizophrenia.
   Interpretation The high risk of patients with mental illness being victims of homicide is an important antistigma message, although this risk partly comes from other patients with mental illness; overall, the risk of patients committing homicide is greater than the risk of being a victim of homicide. Identification and safeguarding of patients at risk of violence should be prominent in clinical risk assessment.

AB IMPORTANCE Absolute and relative risks of violence are increased in patients with psychotic disorders, but the contribution of triggers for violent acts to these risks is uncertain.
   OBJECTIVE To examine whether a range of triggers for violent acts are associated with risks of violence in patients diagnosed with psychotic disorders and in individuals without a psychiatric diagnosis.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using a sample of all individuals born in Sweden between 1958 and 1988 (N = 3 123 724), we identified patients in the National Patient Register who were diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (n = 34 903) and bipolar disorder (n = 29 692), as well as unaffected controls (n = 2 763 012). We then identified, within each subsample, persons who had experienced any of the following triggers for violent acts between January 1, 2001, and December 15, 2013: exposure to violence, parental bereavement, self-harm, traumatic brain injury, unintentional injuries, and substance intoxication. By using within-individual models, we conducted conditional logistic regression to compare the risk of the individual engaging in violent acts in the week following the exposure to a trigger with the risk during earlier periods of equivalent length. All time-invariant confounders (eg, genetic and early environmental influences) were controlled for by this research design and we further adjusted for time-varying sociodemographic factors.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of violent crime occurring in the week following the exposure to a trigger event compared with earlier periods.
   RESULTS Among the sample of 2 827 607 individuals (1 492 186 male and 1 335 421 female), all of the examined trigger events were associated with increased risk of violent crime in the week following exposure. The largest 1-week absolute risk of violent crime was observed following exposure to violence (70-177 violent crimes per 10 000 persons). For most triggers, the relative risks did not vary significantly by diagnosis, including unintentional injuries (aOR range, 3.5-4.8), self-harm (aOR range, 3.9-4.2), and substance intoxication (aOR range, 3.0-4.0). Differences by diagnosis included parental bereavement, which was significantly higher in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (aOR, 5.0; 95% CI, 3.0-8.1) compared with controls (aOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.2).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In addition to identifying risk factors for violence, clarifying the timing of the triggers may provide opportunities to improve risk assessment and management in individuals with psychotic disorders.

AB Background: One of the most important aims of pharmacovigilance is to detect signals of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as early as possible. However, some ADRs are difficult to detect, one example being so called 'type C' reactions. These are effects that present as seemingly 'spontaneous' diseases occurring during treatment with a drug, such as the occurrence of a cardiovascular event while the patient is taking rofecoxib. As this type of ADR is often mistaken for a spontaneous disease, the causative agent may appear as an innocent bystander.
   Objective: The primary aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of using data mining approaches to detect signals of 'type C' reactions. We hypothesized that by including concomitant, and not only suspected medications in the calculations of disproportionality analyses, we would be able to identify such reactions.
   Study design: We used data from the Swedish Drug Information System, SWEDIS, which contains spontaneous reports submitted by Swedish physicians to the Swedish Medical Products Agency, and applied Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) methodology to calculate the information component (IC) value for drug-event combinations for drugs belonging to the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classes cardiovascular system, musculoskeletal system and nervous system (number of reports = 51 270) where only the suspected drug was considered, and also where both concomitant and suspected drugs were considered. We then classified drug-event combinations that were signalled by a statistically significantly raised IC value as labelled or Unlabelled based on the approved summary of product characteristics (SPC) in Sweden as of November 2007, and further classified them as 'type C' reactions or not 'type C.
   Main outcome measure: The proportion of 'type C' reactions signalled when considering both concomitant and suspected drugs compared with suspected drugs only.
   Results: The proportion of labelled drug-event combinations when considering suspected drugs was 78.6%. Drug-event combinations classified as 'type C' reactions were more likely to be found when considering both concomitant and suspected drugs compared with suspected drugs only; 18/449 versus 0/248 when considering drug-event combinations that were signalled exclusively by one of the approaches. Such drug-event combinations included, for example, sudden death and celecoxib, myocardial infarction and diclofenac, suicide-related events and several antidepressants.
   Conclusion: Including both concomitant and suspected drugs in data mining practices may be a way of detecting 'type C' reactions earlier. This could constitute an advance in data mining for pharmacovigilance practices.

AB Background High body mass index (BMI) is associated with mortality, but the pervasive problem of confounding and reverse causality in observational studies limits inference about the direction and magnitude of causal effects. We aimed to obtain estimates of the causal association of BMI with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Methods and findings In a record-linked, intergenerational prospective study from the general population of Sweden, we used two-sample instrumental variable (IV) analysis with data from 996,898 fathers (282,407 deaths) and 1,013,083 mothers (153,043 deaths) and their sons followed up from January 1, 1961, until December 31, 2004. Sons' BMI was used as the instrument for parents' BMI to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for risk of mortality per standard deviation (SD) higher parents' BMI. Using offspring exposure as an instrument for parents' exposure is unlikely to be affected by reverse causality (an important source of bias in this context) and reduces confounding. IV analyses supported causal associations between higher BMI and greater risk of all-cause mortality (HR [95% confidence interval (CI)] per SD higher fathers' BMI: 1.29 [1.26-1.31] and mothers' BMI: 1.39 [1.35-1.42]) and overall cancer mortality (HR per SD higher fathers' BMI: 1.20 [1.16-1.24] and mothers' BMI: 1.29 [1.24-1.34]), including 9 site-specific cancers in men (bladder, colorectum, gallbladder, kidney, liver, lung, lymphatic system, pancreas, and stomach) and 11 site-specific cancers in women (gallbladder, kidney, liver, lung, lymphatic system, ovaries, pancreas, stomach, uterus, cervix, and endometrium). There was evidence supporting causal associations between higher BMI in mothers and greater risk of mortality from kidney disease (HR: 2.17 [1.68-2.81]) and lower risk of mortality from suicide (HR: 0.77 [0.65-0.90]). In both sexes, there was evidence supporting causal associations between higher BMI and mortality from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), stroke, diabetes, and respiratory diseases. We were unable to test the association between sons' and mothers' BMIs (as mothers' data were unavailable) or whether the instrument was independent of unmeasured or residual confounding; however, the associations between parents' mortality and sons' BMI were negligibly influenced by adjustment for available confounders. Conclusions Consistent with previous large-scale meta-analyses and reviews, results supported the causal role of higher BMI in increasing the risk of several common causes of death, including cancers with increasing global incidence. We also found positive effects of BMI on mortality from respiratory disease, prostate cancer, and lung cancer, which has been inconsistently reported in the literature, suggesting that the causal role of higher BMI in mortality from these diseases may be underestimated. Furthermore, we expect different patterns of bias in the current observational and IV analyses; therefore, the similarities between our findings from both methods increases confidence in the results. These findings support efforts to understand the mechanisms underpinning these effects to inform targeted interventions and develop population-based strategies to reduce rising obesity levels for disease prevention.
   Author summaryWhy was this study done? Whilst high body mass index (BMI) clearly increases the risk of mortality, there have been inconsistencies in the literature, which mainly rely on observational epidemiological studies that are limited in their ability to draw causal inferences. To overcome the pervasive problem of confounding and reverse causation in such studies, we aimed to obtain more reliable causal estimates of the association of BMI and both all-cause and cause-specific mortality using two-sample instrumental variable (IV) analyses. What did the researchers do and find? In a large, record-linked, intergenerational prospective study comprising data from the general population of Sweden from 996,898 fathers (282,407 deaths) and 1,013,082 mothers (153,043 deaths) and their sons, we used sons' BMI as an instrument for parents' BMI to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of mortality per standard deviation (SD) higher parents' BMI. IV analyses supported the causal role of higher BMI and greater risk of all-cause mortality and mortality from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), stroke, diabetes, respiratory diseases, and cancer, the latter including 9 site-specific cancers in men (bladder, colorectum, gallbladder, kidney, liver, lung, lymphatic system, pancreas, and stomach) and 11 site-specific cancers in women (gallbladder, kidney, liver, lung, lymphatic system, ovaries, pancreas, stomach, uterus, cervix, and endometrium). There was also evidence supporting a causal association between higher BMI in mothers and greater risk of mortality from kidney disease and lower risk of mortality from suicide. What do these findings mean? For cancer-specific mortality, many IV-derived effect estimates were in the same direction and of greater magnitude as those derived from previous large-scale meta-analyses and reviews focusing on both mortality outcomes and the development of specific cancers. Results also implied a positive effect of BMI on mortality from respiratory disease, prostate cancer, and lung cancer, which has been inconsistently reported in the literature, suggesting that the causal role of higher BMI in mortality from these diseases may be underestimated. These results support efforts to reduce obesity levels for disease prevention, particularly cancer.

AB Background: The mental health of the offspring of immigrants is a major public health concern. In this study, we examined associations of multicultural status and parental country of birth with adolescent mental health in South Korea, and assessed the effect of socioeconomic position (SEP) on these associations.
   Methods: We used four waves of the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBS) between 2011 and 2014, including 294,324 participants (149,219 boys and 145,105 girls aged 13-18 years) as study subjects. KYRBS is a cross-sectional survey conducted annually by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The participants in the KYRBS were drawn as stratified multistage clustered samples from Korean middle schools and high schools. We calculated the age-adjusted 12-month prevalence of depressive mood and suicidal behaviors by parental country of birth, and estimated the effects of SEP indicators on the relationship.
   Results: The age-standardized prevalence of suicidality (suicide ideation, plans, and attempts) was significantly different between multicultural and non-multicultural boys. The impact of multicultural status on mental health varied with parental foreign-born status and maternal country of birth. Compared with non-multicultural counterparts, boys with Japan-born mothers showed lower prevalence ratios (PRs) of suicidal plans (PR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.16-0.70). Girls with Japan-born mothers also showed lower PRs of depressive mood (PR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.63-0.95) and suicidal ideation (PR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.41-0.83), while adolescents with Korean-Chinese mothers showed similar PRs. Boys with foreign-born fathers as well as boys with two foreign-born parents were at a greater risk of suicidality than non-multicultural boys. The magnitude of the relationship between multicultural status and mental health outcomes was generally attenuated after adjusting for SEP indicators.
   Conclusions: In general, adolescents with Japan-born mothers showed lower PRs of depressive mood and suicidality than non-multicultural adolescents, while those with Korean-Chinese mothers showed similar PRs. Boys who had foreign-born fathers generally showed greater PRs of depressive mood and suicidality than non-multicultural boys. To ensure the effective implementation of policies to reduce mental health problems among multicultural adolescents in South Korea, detailed information should be considered regarding the cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds of families, such as parental country of birth and SEP.

TI Association of Mortality With the Death of a Sibling in Childhood

   PARENT; GRIEF
AB IMPORTANCE The death of a close relative is associated with an increased mortality risk among the bereaved, but much less is known about the potential association of the death of a sibling in childhood with mortality in this population.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the association between sibling death in childhood and subsequent mortality risk.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based cohort study of 5 005 029 participants evaluated linked national registers in Denmark (January 1, 1973, through December 31, 2009) and Sweden (January 1, 1973, through December 31, 2008). A total of 2 060 354 Danish and 2 944 675 Swedish children who survived the first 6 months of their life were included. We excluded 14 children who died of the same external cause as their siblings within 30 days. Data were analyzed from November 2, 2015, through October 14, 2016.
   EXPOSURES Participants were classified as exposed if a sibling died in childhood (age <18 years).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Poisson regression was used to estimate mortality rate ratio (MRR) with the exposure as a time-varying variable.
   RESULTS Among the 55 818 participants who experienced sibling death in childhood (51.5% male and 48.5% female; median age at loss, 7.0 [interquartile range, 3.3-12.1] years), all-cause mortality risk was increased by 71%(MRR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.57-1.87) during the follow-up of 37 years. The excess mortality risk was observed for groups with specific causes of death, and the higher MRRs were found when the sibling pairs died of the same cause (death due to disease [MRR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.87-2.49]; death due to external cause [MRR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.54-2.37]). The increased mortality risk after sibling death was seen across the follow-up period, regardless of the age at bereavement and the type of death among bereaved siblings, but the magnitude of association was stronger during the first year after sibling death (MRR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.79-3.54). Higher MRRs were found among sibling pairs with the same sex (MRR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.70-2.18) and close age (MRR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.58-2.37).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Bereavement in childhood because of the death of a sibling was associated with an increased risk for mortality in the short and long term. Health care professionals should be aware of individuals' vulnerability due to sibling death, especially for sibling pairs of close age or the same sex. Social and health care support may help to minimize the potential adverse effects on the bereaved sibling.

AB Objectives, To analyse the effects on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in a population-based sample, invited to an intervention programme incorporating a baseline screening examination and treatment programmes for subjects with cardiovascular risk factors, high alcohol intake and, in women, suspicion of breast cancer on mammography.
   Setting. Section of Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine, University Hospital, Malmo, Sweden.
   Subjects. Birth cohorts (aged 32-51 years) invited to screening examination (men = 9.923; women = 4.422) were compared to birth cohorts not invited (men = 6.655; women = 4.290). Mean participation rate in the invited cohorts was 71% (range 64-78%).
   Screening examination, Between 1974 and 1992 a baseline screening including a physical examination, blood pressure, a questionnaire regarding, e.g. family history, lifestyle, and socio-economic factors, laboratory tests of serum cholesterol, triglycerides, gamma-glutamyl-transferase, brood glucose before and after an oral glucose load, as well as a mammography examination in women, was performed.
   Interventions, Subjects with hypertension; hyperlipidaemia; diabetes or glucose intolerance; high alcohol intake; or, in women, suspicion of breast cancer were referred to special outpatient clinics.
   Main outcome measures, Total and cause-specific mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke, from the screening examination until the end of 1995, was followed in both the intervention and control groups, using national and/or local registries.
   Results. Total mortality did not differ significantly between the intervention group and control group. Cause-specific deaths were also similar except for 'other' deaths amongst men being significantly lower in the intervention group, mainly due to a lower mortality from 'other' causes (suicide, alcohol related deaths) in men under 40 years of age at baseline. Women under 40 years of age had a significantly lower mortality from cancer in the intervention group than in the control group. Nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke did not differ between intervention and control group in either sex, Within the invited birth cohorts, nonparticipants had a higher total and cause-specific mortality.
   Conclusions. Risk factor screening for major diseases such as cardiovascular disease, alcohol abuse, diabetes mellitus and breast cancer, and subsequent treatment of the detected risk factors/diseases - The Malmo Preventive Project - did not reduce total mortality in the intervention group as a whole. In subjects under 40 years of age at entry, total mortality was lower in the intervention group than in the control group. In men, this seemed to be due to a reduction of alcohol-related deaths, whilst in women death from cancer was reduced.

TI Messages from the "Edge of the World": Aksel Valgma's Letters to Artur
   Adson
SO TUNA-AJALOOKULTUURI AJAKIRI
LA Estonian
DT Article
AB Aksel Valgma was born in Estonia in 1910 and died in Australia in 1966. In 1933 he became a professional journalist. lie worked for several newspapers in Tallinn and, in addition to this, he published humorous stories and children's books. During the Second World War, Valgma fled to Germany and emigrated from there to Sydney - to the "edge of the world", as he himself called his new domicile. He worked at a felt factory, managed a chicken farm, and was editor of the Australian Estonians' weekly Meie Kodu (Our Home).
   While he was working as a journalist in Tallinn, he became acquainted with Artur Adson (1889-1977), a poet, writer and theatre critic, who fled to Sweden from the Soviet occupation. They never met again, yet for a short while their old acquaintance was renewed through correspondence. Artur Adson and Marie Under's collection at the Estonian Cultural History Archives contains thirteen letters written by Valgma to Adson in the period from 3 February 1964 to 25 May 1966. The addressee on the envelopes is Artur Adson, yet in several letters he turns to Adson and his wife, the poetess Marie Under, with news for both of them. Some of the letters are in aerogram format, whereas others are in ordinary envelopes, as they contained photographs and banknotes, which could not be enclosed in the aerogram. The collection of letters is complete, without gaps in content, so it could be assumed that Adson preserved all of Valgma's letters. The last letter by Valgma is dated three months before he committed suicide. Its content suggests that life goes on and the correspondence continues; there is no indication of its being the last letter, which it actually was.
   When Valgma started correspondence with Adson, twenty years had passed since their last meeting. The letters indicate several reasons for renewing their acquaintance. Valgma was looking for contributions to the newspaper and wished it to come from Europe; he had a strong province complex and considered Australia to be a cultureless country. On the other hand, Valgma was looking for someone to whom he could confess the pain he felt from losing his homeland. The first letters focus on reminiscences, the later ones discuss more topics from the present. Valgma suggests collaboration to Adson, hoping that his articles would enhance the prestige of Meie Kodu among the readership and would have a considerable impact on the editor's unstable self-esteem.
   The topic most often discussed by Valgma and Adson is trends in refugee literature. Adson is disturbed by the depictions of intimate life in the works of younger authors, and in his reply Valgma agrees with him, although this topic is not very important for him. Valgma is worried about the writers' divergence from the refugees who constitute the only target group of exile literature. In Valgma's opinion, the interest of the refugees in Estonian-language literature was approaching the critical line. Valgma thinks that exile literature should refrain from "philosophical sophistry" and use, above all, refugees' everyday life as a source of inspiration. During the years of correspondence, Valgma wrote his novel Elu uksiklinnud (The Solitary Birds of Life, Lund 1966), which precisely follows the requirements for exile literature that he had explained to Adson. As Valgma wrote the novel and letters in parallel, they overlap remarkably in terms of sentiments and their general mood, which in places is rather depressive. The book reviews and obituaries dedicated to the author have emphasised the biographical side of the novel.
   In his fourth letter to Adson, Valgma writes that his mother-in-law, Mrs. Moolmann, who stayed in Estonia during the war, has been granted a permit to settle in Australia. The seventh letter evidences that Adson has asked Mrs. Moolmann, through Valgma, to help him find out about the destiny of his former neighbours. The tenth letter reveals an interesting fact: mediation of news from their homeland developed into a correspondence between Moolmann and Under. Together with Adson's letters addressed to Valgma, Under's letters to Moolmann reached Australia. Valgma enclosed his mother-in-law's answers in the envelopes addressed to Adson, and this is how news from Soviet Estonia moved through Australia to Sweden.
   The sub-section "Selected letters" presents complete texts of three letters which provide an insight into the problems that creative intellectuals focused on in their discussions in the first decades of exile. The letters also refer to the reasons that inhibited Estonian refugees' adaptation to life in Australia.

AB IMPORTANCE It has remained unclear whether there are clinically meaningful differences between antipsychotic treatments with regard to preventing relapse of schizophrenia, owing to the impossibility of including large unselected patient populations in randomized clinical trials, as well as residual confounding from selection biases in observational studies.
   OBJECTIVE To study the comparative real-world effectiveness of antipsychotic treatments for patients with schizophrenia.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospectively gathered nationwide databases were linked to study the risk of rehospitalization and treatment failure from July 1, 2006, to December 31, 2013, among all patients in Sweden with a schizophrenia diagnosis who were 16 to 64 years of age in 2006 (29 823 patients in the total prevalent cohort; 4603 in the incident cohort of newly diagnosed patients). Within-individual analyses were used for primary analyses, in which each individual was used as his or her own control to eliminate selection bias. Traditional Cox proportional hazards multivariate regression was used for secondary analyses.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Risk of rehospitalization and treatment failure (defined as psychiatric rehospitalization, suicide attempt, discontinuation or switch to other medication, or death).
   RESULTS There were 29 823 patients (12 822 women and 17 001 men; mean [SD] age, 44.9 [12.0] years). During follow-up, 13 042 of 29 823 patients (43.7%) were rehospitalized, and 20 225 of 28 189 patients (71.7%) experienced treatment failure. The risk of psychiatric rehospitalization was the lowest during monotherapy with once-monthly long-acting injectable paliperidone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.41-0.64), long-acting injectable zuclopenthixol (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.48-0.57), clozapine (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.48-0.58), long-acting injectable perphenazine (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.52-0.65), and long-acting injectable olanzapine (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.44-0.77) compared with no use of antipsychotic medication. Oral flupentixol (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.74-1.14), quetiapine (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83-1.00), and oral perphenazine (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-0.97) were associated with the highest risk of rehospitalization. Long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications were associated with substantially lower risk of rehospitalization compared with equivalent oral formulations (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.72-0.84 in the total cohort; HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53-0.86 in the incident cohort). Clozapine (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.53-0.63) and all long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications (HRs 0.65-0.80) were associated with the lowest rates of treatment failure compared with the most widely used medication, oral olanzapine. The results of several sensitivity analyses were consistent with those of the primary analyses.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Clozapine and long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications were the pharmacologic treatments with the highest rates of prevention of relapse in schizophrenia. The risk of rehospitalization is about 20% to 30% lower during long-acting injectable treatments compared with equivalent oral formulations.
