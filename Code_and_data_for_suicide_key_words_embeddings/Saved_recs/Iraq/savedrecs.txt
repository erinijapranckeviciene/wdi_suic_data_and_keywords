TI Suicide terrorism in Iraq: A preliminary assessment of the quantitative
   data and documentary evidence
SO STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM
LA English
DT Article
AB This preliminary assessment of suicide terrorism in Iraq sheds light on why some groups in the insurgency employ suicide attacks although others do not. The unequal utilization of suicide bombings corresponds to divergent strategies in the insurgency. Some groups fight to achieve system reintegration, whereas others send suicide bombers to collapse the emerging political order. Quantitative data and documentary evidence substantiate the finding that suicide terrorism is carried out by groups that cannot compete in any future political and institutional alignments in Iraq's new coalition politics. Suicide terrorism is intended to produce system collapse, sectarian warfare, and a failed state.

AB This article is about the impact of human bombs on the political process in Iraq, which between 2003 and 2006 was the global centre of suicide terrorism. The profile of perpetrators is designed and the main characteristics of the missions are analyzed. The author argues that no single explanation on individual level can be found; the motivation behind the attacks is rather a mix of fanaticism, nationalism, personal trauma and religious fervour. The conclusion is made that suicide bombing is one of the main challenges to the political stability of the country.

AB Hanna VN, Ahmad A. Corrected and republished: Suicide in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, state of the art. Nord J Psychiatry 2013; 67: 140-144. In recent years the, incidence of suicide in Kurdistan has been increasing, especially among females, to a degree it cannot be neglected. Consequently, attention was given to this phenomena and the aggressive method of suicide used by young peoples, especially females, in Kurdistan. In attempt to obtain an objective picture of the frequently media-reported suicide among youths and women in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The responsible authorities and medical service units in the region were visited to collect information, and the available data were explored to produce a state-of-the-art overview on the subject. Because of insufficient documentation and lack of systematic registration, the data on suicide were scattered and difficult to evaluate. However, the findings did confirm that suicide exists as a serious problem in the society in Kurdistan, particularly among females. Urgent attention is demanded from the responsible authorities and organizations concerned in the region. Further research is needed to investigate the exact extent of suicide and its correlates in the society in Kurdistan, in order to plan for effective preventive measures.

AB Iraq and Afghanistan War veterans diagnosed with psychiatric disorders commit suicide at a higher rate than the general population (Kang & Bullman, 2008). Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been identified as a risk factor for suicide in veterans (Bullman & Kang, 1994) and is the most common mental disorder among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans presenting for treatment at Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities (Kang, 2009). Therefore, it is critical for health providers to identify veterans with PTSD who are at high risk for suicide in order to more effectively intervene to promote safety, stabilization, and reduce psychiatric symptoms. In the following paper; we discuss risk for suicide in veterans with PTSD and application of cognitive behavioral therapies to reduce suicidality in high-risk patients. We also discuss pertinent clinical issues common to treating Iraq and Afghanistan War veterans with PTSD.

AB The objective of the present study was to use retrospective data to test the hypothesis that cannabis dependence would be associated with an increased rate of post-deployment suicide attempts. Participants included 319 veterans who had deployed to either Iraq or Afghanistan. Study procedures involved completion of a structured clinical interview and a battery of self-report questionnaires. As expected, lifetime cannabis dependence was significantly associated with post-deployment suicide attempts, AOR = 7.963, p = .014, even after controlling for the effects of pre-deployment suicide attempts, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, pain, non-cannabis substance use disorder, and gender. Although preliminary, our findings provide the first evidence to date that heavy cannabis use may be a unique risk factor for post-deployment suicide attempts among veterans.

AB Background: Very little is known regarding the epidemiology of suicides in Iraq, given the lack of a national surveillance system. Therefore, the government initiated this project "The Iraqi National Study of Suicide
   Methods: The study covered 13 (out of 18) provinces in Iraq. A data collection form was designed by the researchers. The forms were completed by police stations in the 13 provinces. Data were extracted from the legal investigation (which include police investigation, family reports and postmortem reports) of cases of when there was no clear cause of death and where there was final verdict of suicide made by judge after examining these reports.
   Results: There were 647 cases of suicide. The crude rate of suicide per 100 000 population was 1.09 (1.21 for males, 0.97 for females) in 2015 and 1.31 (1.54 for males and 1.07 for females) in 2016. The majority of cases (67.9%) were aged 29 years or below. The most common method was hanging (41%) followed by firearms (31.4%) and self-burning (19.2%). 24.1% of cases were reported to have psychiatric disorders, of which the most common diagnosis was depression (53.9%). In the majority of cases (82.1%) there were no previous attempts. Only a small minority were reported to have had psychological trauma (15.5%), financial problems (12.4%) or childhood abuse (2.2%).
   Limitations: The study covered only 13 provinces in Iraq. We were able to calculate age- standardized rates for year 2016 only. Data are based on official police records and under- reporting and under- recognition of psychiatric disorders are possible.
   Conclusion: On the basis of data available to this study, the suicide rate in Iraq is lower than the global rate. Suicide is more common in young people, where the gender distribution is almost equal. Social and cultural factors might have played a role in these patterns. The findings underscore the need of a national registry with a comprehensive and multipronged surveillance approach to correctly identify suicide events. This study aims to be the first step in this process.

DT Article
ID MORTALITY; CHILDREN; WEAPONS; DEATH
AB Background Suicide bombs in Iraq are a major public health problem. We aimed to describe documented casualties from suicide bombs in Iraq during 2003-10 in Iraqi civilians and coalition soldiers.
   Methods In this descriptive study, we analysed and compared suicide bomb casualties in Iraq that were documented in two datasets covering March 20, 2003, to Dec 31, 2010 one reporting coalition-soldier deaths from suicide bombs, the other reporting deaths and injuries of Iraqi civilians from armed violence. We analysed deaths and injuries over time, by bomb subtype and victim demographics.
   Findings In 2003-10, 1003 documented suicide bomb events caused 19% (42 928 of 225 789) of all Iraqi civilian casualties in our dataset, 26% (30 644 of 117 165) of injured civilians, and 11% (12 284 of 108 624) of civilian deaths. The injured-to-killed ratio for civilians was 2.5 people injured to one person killed from suicide bombs. Suicide bombers on foot caused 43% (5314 of 12 284) of documented suicide bomb deaths. Suicide bombers who used cars caused 40% (12 224 of 30 644) of civilian injuries. Of 3963 demographically identifiable suicide bomb fatalities, 2981 (75%) were men, 428 (11%) were women, and 554 (14%) were children. Children made up a higher proportion of demographically identifiable deaths from suicide bombings than from general armed violence (9%, 3669 of 40 276 deaths; p<0.0001). The injured-to-killed ratio for all suicide bombings was slightly higher for women than it was for men (p=0.02), but the ratio for children was lower than it was for both women (p<0.0001) and men (p=0.0002). 200 coalition soldiers were killed in 79 suicide bomb events during 2003-10. More Iraqi civilians per lethal event were killed than were coalition soldiers (12 vs 3; p=0.004).
   Interpretation Suicide bombers in Iraq kill significantly more Iraqi civilians than coalition soldiers. Among civilians, children are more likely to die than adults when injured by suicide bombs.

AB In recent years the, incidence of suicide in Kurdistan has been increasing, especially among females, to a degree it cannot be neglected. Consequently, attention was given to this phenomena and the aggressive method of suicide used by young peoples, especially females, in Kurdistan. In attempt to obtain an objective picture of the frequently media-reported suicide among youths and women in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The responsible authorities and medical service units in the region were visited to collect information, and the available data were explored to produce a state-of-the-art overview on the subject. Because of insufficient documentation and lack of systematic registration, the data on suicide were scattered and difficult to evaluate. However, the findings did confirm that suicide exists as a serious problem in the society in Kurdistan, particularly among females. Urgent attention is demanded from the responsible authorities and organizations concerned in the region. Further research is needed to investigate the exact extent of suicide and its correlates in the society in Kurdistan, in order to plan for effective preventive measures.

AB The objective of the present research was to examine the association between lifetime cannabis use disorder (CUD), current suicidal ideation, and lifetime history of suicide attempts in a large and diverse sample of Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans (N = 3233) using a battery of well-validated instruments. As expected, CUD was associated with both current suicidal ideation (OR = 1.683, p = 0.008) and lifetime suicide attempts (OR = 2.306, p < 0.0001), even after accounting for the effects of sex, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, alcohol use disorder, non-cannabis drug use disorder, history of childhood sexual abuse, and combat exposure. Thus, the findings from the present study suggest that CUD may be a unique predictor of suicide attempts among Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans; however, a significant limitation of the present study was its cross-sectional design. Prospective research aimed at understanding the complex relationship between CUD, mental health problems, and suicidal behavior among veterans is clearly needed at the present time.

TI Ghost Martyrs in Iraq: An assessment of the applicability of rationalist
   models to explain suicide attacks in Iraq
SO STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM
LA English
DT Article
ID TERRORISM
AB Scholars have developed several rationalist explanations for the use of suicide attacks by terrorist organizations. Using evidence from Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Chechnya, and Turkey, these authors have created plausible and rational models for attacks, which many consider to be irrational. Although the conflict in Iraq has, by most accounts, experienced more suicide bombings than any other struggle, its contemporary nature has made research and analysis on the subject difficult. This article analyzes four of these models and their implications with respect to the events in Iraq. Although the evidence is not conclusive, the data suggests that organizations are not using suicide attacks to (1) gain nationalist objectives, (2) signal strength to a foreign government, or (3)outbid rival organizations, as many scholars suggest. Instead, the evidence suggests that these attacks are used for (1) tactical advantages and (2) to aid the global recruiting effort of Al Qaeda-linked organizations.

AB This study assessed the risk of suicide by time since separation from the military for US veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan. Suicide risk was assessed by comparing the number of suicides among veterans, when stratified by active vs. reserve/National Guard status to the expected number based on rates of suicide in the US general population. Hazard rates were used to assess suicide risk since the time each veteran separated/deactivated from active duty service. Compared to the US general population, active duty veterans had a 56% increased risk of suicide and reserve/National Guard veterans had a 29% increased risk. Suicide risk decreased as time since separation/deactivation increased for both groups. The risk of suicide for both groups was greatest during the first year of follow-up.

AB Extending data reported by Mohammed Hafez in 2007, we compiled a database of 1,779 suicide bombers who attempted or completed attacks in Iraq from 2003 through 2010. From 2003 through 2006, monthly totals of suicide bombers show a pattern different from the pattern of non-suicide insurgent attacks, but from 2007 through 2010 the two patterns were similar. This biphasic pattern indicates that suicide attacks sometimes warrant separate analysis but sometimes are just one tactic in a larger envelope of insurgent violence. We also show that only 13 percent of suicide bombers targeted coalition forces and international civilians, primarily during the early years of the conflict, whereas 83 percent of suicide bombers targeted Iraqis (civilians, members of the Anbar Awakening Movement, Iraqi security forces, and government entities) in attacks that extended throughout the duration of the insurgency. These results challenge the idea that suicide attacks are primarily a nationalist response to foreign occupation, and caution that smart bombs may be more often sent against soft targets than hard targets. More generally, our results indicate that suicide attacks must be disaggregated by target in order to understand these attacks as the expression of different insurgent priorities at different times.

AB Purpose: We conducted a retrospective cohort mortality study to determine the postservice suicide risk of recent wartime veterans comparing them with the US general population as well as comparing deployed veterans to nondeployed veterans.
   Methods: Veterans were identified from the Defense Manpower Data Center records, and deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan war zone was determined from the Contingency Tracking System. Vital status of 317,581 deployed and 964,493 nondeployed veterans was followed from the time of discharge to December 31, 2009. Underlying causes of death were obtained from the National Death Index Plus.
   Results: Based on 9353 deaths (deployed, 1650; nondeployed, 7703), of which 1868 were suicide deaths (351; 1517), both veteran cohorts had 24% to 25% lower mortality risk from all causes combined but had 41% to 61% higher risk of suicide relative to the US general population. However, the suicide risk was not associated with a history of deployment to the war zone. After controlling for age, sex, race, marital status, branch of service, and rank, deployed veterans showed a lower risk of suicide compared with nondeployed veterans (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.75-0.95). Multiple deployments were not associated with the excess suicide risk among deployed veterans (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.79-1.28).
   Conclusions: Veterans exhibit significantly higher suicide risk compared with the US general population. However, deployment to the Iraq or Afghanistan war, by itself, was not associated with the excess suicide risk. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The present research examined how incarceration, suicide attempts, suicidality, and difficulty controlling violence relate to the underlying factor structure of psychiatric comorbidity among a large sample of Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans (N=1897). Diagnostic interviews established psychiatric diagnoses; self-report measures assessed history of incarceration, difficulty controlling violence, suicide attempts, and suicidality. A 3-factor measurement model characterized by latent factors for externalizing-substance-use disorders (SUD), distress, and fear provided excellent fit to the data. Alcohol-use disorder, drug-use disorder, and nicotine dependence were indicators on the externalizing-SUD factor. Posttraumatic stress disorder and depression were indicators on the distress factor. Panic disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder were indicators on the fear factor. Incarceration was exclusively predicted by the externalizing-SUD factor. Difficulty controlling violence, suicidality, and suicide attempts were exclusively predicted by the distress factor. Contrary to hypotheses, the path from the externalizing/SUB factor to difficulty controlling violence was not significant. Taken together, these findings suggest that the distress factor of psychiatric comorbidity is a significant risk factor for suicidality, suicide attempts, and difficulty controlling violence and could help to explain the frequent co-occurrence of these critical outcomes among returning Iraq/Afghanistan veterans.

AB It was hypothesized that one of the reasons for the U.S. invasion of Iraq was to stop the payments being made by Saddam Hussein to the families of suicide (homicide) bombers in Israel. The consequences of suicide (homicide) bombing attacks against Israel between March 2001 and August 2004 were evaluated as related to the time of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. On average per month during this period, there were fewer overall casualties after the invasion than before it. As many as nearly 1,100 casualties may have been prevented in Israel as a consequence of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, suggesting that at least one possible goal of the U.S. invasion may have been achieved, at least as averaged over the first 17 months after the invasion.

In this commentary. I suggest reasons why the archives contain so few traces of combat-related disorders despite the massive trauma experienced by soldiers in the Civil War, and I draw implications for military personnel returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

AB Rising suicide rates are an increasing concern among military personnel. The interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide proposes that three necessary factors are needed to die by suicide: feelings that one does not belong with other people, feelings that one is a burden on others or society, and an acquired capability to overcome the fear and pain associated with suicide. The current study tests the theory's proposal that acquired capability may be particularly influenced by military experience, because combat exposure may cause habituation to fear of painful experiences such as suicide. Utilizing clinical and nonclinical samples of military personnel deployed to Iraq, results of the current study indicate that a greater range of combat experiences predicts acquired capability above and beyond depression and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, previous suicidality, and other common risk factors for suicide. Combat experiences did not, however, predict perceived burdensomeness or thwarted belongingness. The authors discuss how combat experiences might serve as a mechanism for elevating suicide risk and implications for clinical interventions and suicide prevention efforts.

AB Little is known about suicide variables in women Veterans. The authors reviewed numerous applicable health care and military literary sources regarding suicide in this population. The current article describes the surrounding circumstances, military war/conflict culture, and potential effects on women Veterans, including major collection problems with current Veteran data. Women Veterans are increasingly reporting more behavioral health issues (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder) and attempting suicide upon civilian reintegration. Outcomes from this literature review suggest the importance of nursing advocacy to create better rapport and communication with women Veterans from Vietnam, Gulf I, Iraq, and Afghanistan wars seeking care at civilian health facilities, as some may present with suicidal ideologies.

AB This article aims to describe and analyze the training that foreign jihadis in Iraq have received, how this may impact on the future of the insurgency in Iraq, and the potential spillover effect from the Iraqi jihad scene. The nature of the training in Iraq has been influenced by the difficult conditions the jihadis were operating under, and much has consisted of on-the-job training inside safe houses. The foreign jihadis were dependent on the support of the local Iraqis in order to conduct training, but the increasing use of suicide attacks has turned their erstwhile allies against them.

AB There have been studies about the impact of a suicide on family members and friends, but none to date on a military unit in a combat zone. This is the first description, to my knowledge, of the effects of the suicide of a U.S. Army soldier deployed to Iraq. A narrative from the treating psychiatrist's perspective describes both the acute and longer-term (four months) effects of the suicide on members of the soldier's unit, other soldiers at the same base, members of the medical team who attempted to resuscitate him, and mental health care providers. This account describes how the suicide affected at least thirteen other soldiers on the base. The effects of the soldier's suicide showed a few similarities to those described in the literature, including stigmatization of the survivors and the stress experienced by the mental health providers. There were additional repercussions that have not been previously described, including the impact on the soldier's peers within his unit and other soldiers on the base, the need for medical evacuation from Iraq of soldiers following the event, and the reported stress on the medical staff due to the attempted resuscitation of someone known to them. Future research is needed to understand the impact of a suicide on the survivors in a deployed military setting and to establish best practices for postvention strategies.

AB Objective: This study examined posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a potential moderating variable in the relationship between social support and elevated suicide risk in a sample of treatment-seeking Iraq and Afghanistan War Veterans. Method: As part of routine care, self-reported marital status, satisfaction with social networks, PTSD, and recent suicidality were assessed in Veterans (N = 431) referred for mental health services at a large Veteran Affairs Medical Center. Logistic regression analyses were conducted using this cross-sectional data sample to test predictions of diminished influence of social support on suicide risk in Veterans reporting PTSD. Results: Thirteen percent of Veterans were classified as being at elevated risk for suicide. Married Veterans were less likely to be at elevated suicide risk relative to unmarried Veterans and Veterans reporting greater satisfaction with their social networks were less likely to be at elevated risk relative to Veterans reporting lower satisfaction. Satisfaction with social networks was protective for suicide risk in PTSD and non-PTSD cases, but was significantly less protective for veterans reporting PTSD. Conclusions: Veterans who are married and Veterans who report greater satisfaction with social networks are less likely to endorse suicidal thoughts or behaviors suggestive of elevated suicide risk. However, the presence of PTSD may diminish the protective influence of social networks among treatment-seeking Veterans. Depression and Anxiety 27:1001-1005, 2010. Published 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

DE suicide bombings; suicide bombers; martyrdom; Jihadi Salafism
AB Suicide attacks by radical Islamists mainly target and harm their co-religionists. Whether in Iraq, Afghanistan or Pakistan, suicide bombers are increasingly directing their blows against Muslims, including non-combatants, they label apostates, infidels or collaborators with foreign powers. The culprits for this indiscriminate carnage are primarily radical Sunnis known as Jihadi Salafists. How could these Sunni radicals square their Islamic legitimacy with three clearly established prohibitions in Islam: Do not kill yourself, do not killing non-combatants, and do not kill fellow Muslims? Jihadi Salafists circumvent these commands by redefining the meaning of piety in Islam to frame their co-religionists as apostates and heretics outside the protective umbrella of Islam. They also give primacy to human intentionality in warfare to frame self-immolation as martyrdom, not suicide. Finally, they unearth rulings by medieval scholars that permit indiscriminate tactics during warfare to protect the collective interests of Muslims. The case of Al-Qaeda in Iraq and its indiscriminate suicide bombings illustrate these justifications.

AB The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that sleep quality mediates the association between traumatic brain injury (TBI) history and current suicidal ideation. Measures of TBI history, sleep quality, and suicidal ideation were administered to 130 Iraq/Afghanistan veterans. As expected, sleep qualitymediated the effect of TBI history on current suicidal ideation (indirect effect, 0.0082; 95% confidence interval, 0.0019-0.0196), such that history of TBI was associated with worse sleep quality, which was, in turn, associated with increased suicidal ideation. These findings highlight the importance of assessing TBI history and sleep quality during suicide risk assessments for veterans.

AB Objectives. We sought to examine rates of suicide among individuals receiving health care services in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities over an 8-year period.
   Methods. We included annual cohorts of all individuals who received VHA health care services from fiscal year (FY) 2000 through FY 2007 (October 1, 1999 September 30,2007; N = 8 855 655). Vital status and cause of death were obtained from the National Death Index.
   Results. Suicide was more common among VHA patients than members of the general US population. The overall rates of suicide among VHA patients decreased slightly but significantly from 2000 to 2007 (P < .001). Male veterans between the ages of 30 and 64 years were at the highest risk of suicide.
   Conclusions. VHA health care system patients are at elevated risk for suicide and are appropriate for suicide reduction services, although the rate of suicide has decreased in recent years for this group. Comprehensive approaches to suicide prevention in the VHA focus not only on recent returnees from Iraq and Afghanistan but also on middle-aged and older Veterans.

AB We examined hopelessness and suicidal ideation in association with subthreshold and threshold posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a sample of Iraq and Afghanistan War Veterans (U.S., N = 275) assessed within a specialty VA postdeployment health clinic. Veterans completed paper-and-pencil questionnaires at intake. The military version of the PTSD Checklist was used to determine PTSD levels (No PTSD; subthreshold PTSD; PTSD), and endorsement of hopelessness or suicidal ideation were used as markers of elevated suicide risk. Veterans were also asked if they received mental health treatment in the prior 6 months. Veterans reporting subthreshold PTSD were 3 times more likely to endorse these markers of elevated suicide risk relative to the Veterans without PTSD. We found no significant differences in likelihood of endorsing hopelessness or suicidal ideation comparing subthreshold and threshold PTSD groups, although the subthreshold PTSD group was less likely to report prior mental health treatment. Clinicians should be attentive to suicide risk in returned Veterans reporting both subthreshold and threshold PTSD.

AB The present study examined the association between history of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and history of suicide attempts (SA) among 292 Iraq/Afghanistan veterans, half of whom carried a lifetime diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Consistent with hypotheses, veterans who reported a history of NSSI were significantly more likely to report a history of SA than veterans without a history of NSSI. In addition, logistic regression demonstrated that NSSI remained a significant predictor of SA even after a wide range of covariates (i.e., combat exposure, traumatic brain injury, PTSD, depression, alcohol dependence) were considered. Taken together, these findings suggest that clinicians working with veterans should include NSSI history as part of their standard risk assessment battery. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

These culturally astute jihadists know well the themes that resonate with the wider Muslim public, and hare done an extraordinary job in harnessing three narratives to mobilize for martyrdom: humiliation of Muslims (it the hands of foreigners, impotence of official Muslim governments in the face of hegemonic powers, and redemption through faithful sacrifice. This study explores how jihadists weare together these three narratives to suggest a deleterious condition that requires an immediate action, offer an explanation of the causes of this persistent condition, and present the necessary solution to overcome the problem.

AB Suicide is a prevalent problem among veterans deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and psychiatric conditions, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are potentially important risk factors for suicide in this population, but the literature is limited by a dearth of research on female veterans and imprecise assessment of TBI and suicidal behavior. This study examined 824 male and 825 female U.S. veterans who were enrolled in the baseline assessment of the Veterans After-Discharge Longitudinal Registry (Project VALOR), an observational registry of veterans with and without PTSD who deployed in support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and were enrolled in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system. Results indicated that current depressive symptoms, PTSD, and history of prior TBI were all significantly associated with current suicidal ideation (Cohen's d = 0.91, Cramers' Vs = .19 and .08, respectively). After adding a number of variables to the model, including psychiatric comorbidity, TBI history was associated with increased risk of current suicidal ideation among male veterans only (RR = 1.55). TBI is an important variable to consider in future research on suicide among veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, particularly among male veterans.

AB The present study used validated clinical interviews to assess the effect of comorbid PTSD-depression on suicidal behavior over the course of 12 months in 309 Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans. Logistic regression models demonstrated that comorbid PTSD-depression was a statistically significant predictor of suicide attempts at the 12-month follow-up in both the total sample and in the subset of veterans with PTSD/depression (n=98). In contrast, gender, age, race, sexual orientation, and baseline history of suicide attempts did not have significant effects. These findings suggest that comorbid PTSD-depression may be a significant risk factor for future suicidal behavior in veterans. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Many experts claim that religious cleavages are one of the major reasons for suicide attacks. To test this hypothesis, we investigate whether the total number of suicide attacks per violent conflict and the annual number of suicide attacks per country are associated with simmering religious conflicts. We distinguish between two kinds of religious cleavages: cleavages at the macro level between the groups engaged in violent conflicts and cleavages at the micro or battlefield level between the actual perpetrators and victims of suicide attacks. Our results do not indicate that religious cleavages are an important precondition for the incidence of suicide attacks over the period 1981-2010.

ID TERRORISM; IRAQ; MECHANISMS; MARTYRDOM; AUTHORITY; JIHADISM; LOGIC
AB Over the last 25 years, suicide attacks have become an alarming threat. They are a political tool which has been adopted by several organizations in Sri Lanka, Palestine and the Occupied Territories, Turkey, Chechnya, Afghanistan, Pakistan and, in particular, by the Al-Qaeda-led insurgency in Iraq in its struggle against the US and its allies. Recent analyses have traced back the use of suicide terrorism to its 'strategic logic': organizations and their militants resort to suicide attacks mainly because they view this form of violence as an efficient weapon for their revolutionary and nationalist campaigns. An explanation based on the paradigm of rational choice theory or instrumental rationality alone is, however, insufficient. This article suggests the importance of combining the paradigm of instrumental rationality with that of axiological rationality. Only this kind of explanation is able to clarify the crucial role played by those cultural and symbolic elements which justify and encourage the martyrdom of suicide attackers. Moreover, by adopting a multi-causal analysis of the armed organizations, their constituencies and the attackers, as well as of their interaction, the article outlines a theoretical model of the most important social mechanisms underlying the use of suicide tactics.

AB Female suicide bombers are increasingly seen in conflicts throughout the world; in recent years, they have become much more prevalent in religious-fundamentalist conflict. Specifically, global jihadist groups are increasingly incorporating female suicide bombers into their operations, a significant ideological and operational shift for most of these groups. Jihadist groups are using women to fill a recruiting void, to achieve tactical surprise, and for strategic purposes. Female suicide bombers are likely to emerge in jihadist conflicts throughout the world, from Nigeria to Pakistan and beyond.

AB The United States military began to experience a steady increase in suicide rates across all service branches at the inception of the wars in Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003). As the number of suicide deaths increased, so did the number of affected survivors who seek postvention support. Unique issues that accompany suicide death may expose survivors to a more distressing and complicated grief process. Peer support has clinically been observed to be widely utilized by suicide loss survivors. This article explores unique issues accompanying military suicide loss, potential benefits of postvention peer-based support, clinical considerations, and future directions.

AB Military personnel and veterans have important suicide risk factors. After a systematic review of the literature on suicide prevention, seven (five in the U.S.) studies of military personnel were identified containing interventions that may reduce the risk of suicide. The effectiveness of the individual components was not assessed, and problems in methodology or reporting of data were common. Overall, multifaceted interventions for active duty military personnel are supported by consistent evidence, although of very mixed quality, and in some cases during intervals of declines in suicide rates in the general population. There were insufficient studies of U.S. Veterans to reach conclusions.

AB Many deployed women Veterans, as described in a previous article, have experienced similar combat exposure as their male counterparts in wars since 1990. Upon reintegration, many Veterans visit civilian health facilities with behavioral health issues, sometimes voicing and/or attempting suicide. Effective nursing assessment and actions are needed to specifically care for this unique population. Any suicide variables (e.g., ideation, attempts, completed) are concerning; therefore, all women Veterans from the Vietnam, Gulf I, Iraq, and Afghanistan wars should be assessed. The first priority is always patient safety. Timely and frequent screening for a variety of risk factors, documented for both men and women Veterans, and women specifically, are important. Symptomology may not become evident for 3 to 15 months into reintegration. Applicable dialogue can recognize changing thoughts, judgment, and behavior patterns. Health promotion efforts, interventions, and resourceful referrals are provided.

AB Suicide attacks are the targeted use of self-destructing humans against a perceived enemy for political ends. After reviewing terrorism and suicide terrorism trends between 1980 and 2003 the paper shows that suicide attacks have increased dramatically between 2004 and 2005 and have become a global phenomenon. Three main sites of suicide terrorism namely, Iraq, Israel and Sri Lanka are examined in some derail including information about the main terrorist groups responsible for sponsoring suicide attacks and some profiles of individuals involved. The paper then examines the main sociological explanations of suicide attacks, including a description of the strategic logic behind these atrocities, and the notion of life being a weapon. It concludes with an overview of the recommendations emerging from studies that seek to prevent suicide terrorism.

AB Little is known about post-combat psychological reactions of warriors prior to the Twentieth Century. We estimated rates of suicide, alcohol abuse, and probable psychiatric illness among Union Forces during the U.S. Civil War via examination of data compiled by the Union Army. White active-duty military personnel suicide rates ranged from 8.74 to 14.54 per 100,000 during the war, and surged to 30.4 the year after the war. For blacks, rates ranged from 17.7 in the first year of their entry into the war (1863), to 0 in their second year, and 1.8 in the year after the war. Rates for most other relevant domains, including chronic alcoholism, "nostalgia," and insanity, were extremely low (<1.0%) by modern day standards. Data provide contextual information on suicide and psychiatric variables for combatants during the U.S. Civil War, a brutal modern war with vastly higher casualty rates than recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

ID IRAQ
AB Using indirect evidence, Wortzel and his colleagues raise the likelihood that the rates of suicide will increase among incarcerated veterans, given past trends and current information about veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Although it might be argued that the data are inadequate for the formulation of public policy, there is sufficient information to begin creating programs for veterans now. Wortzel and colleagues suggest screening in jails to identify veterans at risk, with increased monitoring in the first weeks of incarceration, and use of the Critical Time Intervention during important transitions. While these recommendations are worthy, a better understanding of the factors associated with suicidality may help policy-makers to support programs for returning veterans before they develop the serious problems that can lead to suicide. Also promising is the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration's recent funding of six jail diversion programs with a focus on veterans.

In this study, Soldiers presenting for health reassessment completed two questionnaires on suicide risk factors: one linked to the health assessment and one anonymous. About 5.1% of respondents reported suicide ideation on the anonymous questionnaire, 3.0% on the linked questionnaire, and 0.9% on the health reassessment. About 56.4% who reported suicide ideation anonymously told nobody of their thoughts. Current screening procedures identify only one in seven Soldiers experiencing suicide ideation and highlight the need for alternative risk-detection strategies.

AB The authors examine the effect of educational attainment and income on support for suicide bombing among Muslim publics in six predominantly Muslim countries that have experienced suicide bombings: Indonesia, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan, and Turkey. The authors make two contributions. First, they present a conceptual model, which has been lacking in the literature. Second, they consider attitudes toward two different targets of suicide bombings: civilians within the respondent's country and Western military and political personnel in Iraq. The authors find that the effect of educational attainment and income on support for suicide bombings varies across countries and targets.The findings therefore draw attention to the difficulties of making generalizations about Muslim countries and the importance of distinguishing between targets of suicide bombings.

AB Prevalence and risk factors associated with soldiers' suicides 2001-2009 (N = 874) were examined. Army suicide rates increased from 9 per 100,000 in 2001 to 22 per 100,000 in 2009. Soldier suicides were lower than civilians from 2001 to 2007, but higher than civilians after 2007. Army suicides were disproportionately higher for men, deployment experience, and a history of a mental health diagnosis/treatment; and lower for African Americans. Many involved planning (38%), communication (21%), alcohol (19%), or drugs (8%). Many had legal problems (31%), high stress loads (90%), a history of self-injury (10%), and other contributing factors prior to entry into the Army (31%). Implications for understanding suicide among military personnel are discussed.

AB Background:Veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who receive care in the Veterans Health Administration (VA) have high disease burden. Distinct comorbidity patterns have been shown to be differentially associated with adverse outcomes, including death. This study determined correlates of 5-year mortality.Materials and Methods:VA demographic, military, homelessness, and clinical measures informed this retrospective analysis. Previously constructed comorbidity classifications over 3 years of care were entered into a Cox proportional hazards model of death.Results:There were 164,933 veterans in the cohort, including African Americans (16%), Hispanics (11%), and whites (65%). Most were in their 20s at baseline (60%); 12% were women; 4% had attempted suicide; 4% had been homeless. Having clustered disorders of pain, posttraumatic stress disorder, and traumatic brain injury was associated with death [hazard ratio (HR)=2.0]. Mental disorders including substance abuse were similarly associated (HR=2.1). Prior suicide attempt (HR=2.2) or drug overdose (HR=3.0) considerably increased risk of death over 5 years.Conclusions:As congressional actions such as Veterans Choice Act offer more avenues to seek care outside of VA, coordination of care, and suicide prevention outreach for recent veterans may require innovative approaches to preserve life.

AB Suicides in the military have increased over the last ten years. Much effort has been focused on suicide prevention and treatment, as well as understanding the reasons for the sharp increase in military suicides. Despite this effort, the definitive causes of military suicides remain elusive. Further, highly effective suicide prevention and treatment approaches have not yet been developed. The purpose of this article is to present a short review of the current state of suicide prevention interventions within the context of the military. The root causes of suicidal behavior and the role of combat in the military are each discussed. Interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide and the military transition theory are introduced as guiding frameworks for understanding suicides and suicidal behavior amongst active military personnel and military veterans. The article concludes with a set of recommendations for moving forward in understanding and addressing suicides in the military.

AB Suicide in the US Army is a high-profile public health problem that is complex and poorly understood. Adding to the confusion surrounding Army suicide is the challenge of defining and understanding individuals/populations dying by suicide: Data from recent studies have led to a better understanding of risk factors for suicide that may be specifically associated with military service, including the impact of combat and deployment on increased rates of psychiatric illness in military personnel. The next steps involve applying these results to the development of empirically supported suicide prevention approaches specific to the military population. This special article provides an overview of suicide in the Army by synthesizing new information and providing clinical pearls based on research evidence.

AB Military suicide has escalated in recent years, however almost no research has used military surveillance data to examine suicide risk factors. The aims of the current study were to compare suicide risk factors among US Soldiers who died by suicide, attempted suicide, and controls using a prospective case-control design. Controls were 247 Soldiers completing standard post-deployment assessment procedures. Cases were 276 suicide decedents (n=85) or suicide attempters (n=191), drawn from the Department of Defense Suicide Event Report.
   Compared to controls, suicide attempters and decedents had greater odds of failed intimate relationships, legal problems, and substance abuse problems in the past 90 days. Suicide attempters and decedents also had greater odds of a history of a mood disorder and prior suicide attempt compared to controls. Suicide decedents had greater odds of exposure to legal problems in the past 90 days and lower odds of ever having an anxiety disorder, compared to suicide attempters. Vigilance toward early detection of modifiable suicide risk factors such as relationship dissolution, mood disorders, substance abuse, and legal problems may help reduce suicide risk among US Soldiers.

AB Suicide, PTSD, and obesity co-occur at high rates among returning veterans, yet limited research exists regarding the relationship among these variables. Self-report and diagnostic interview data from a longitudinal study of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans (N=130) enrolled in VA healthcare examined these inter-relations. As hypothesized, body mass index (BMI) significantly moderated the association between PTSD and suicidal ideation such that the association between PTSD and suicidal ideation was strongest among individuals with a high BMI. Programs that focus on health promotion, trauma treatment, and weight management should continue to monitor suicide risk. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB In this article, we systematically reviewed 116 veterans' medical records to explore the mitigating factors in sleep disturbance, polytrauma clinical triad (PCT), and suicide. We discovered that a particular nonaction (i.e., no standardized completion of sleep-disturbance screenings) had strong implications for resulting suicides among veterans with reported sleep disturbances, PCT, and suicidal ideations. This study provides strong propositions for the further study of this veteran cohort-Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF), Iraqi Freedom (OIF), and New Dawn (OND)-with regard to the impact of sleep disturbance on PCT and its relationship with suicide symptoms, ideation, and completion. The purpose of this study was to examine the outcomes of sleep disturbances on complex relationships among the three primary diagnoses- posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and chronic pain-that establish the PCT cluster. We identified that those diagnosed with sleep disturbances had increased suicidal ideations and rates of completed suicides. We analyzed these factors in veterans returning from the current wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. We hypothesized that (a) clinicians were not completing sleep-disturbance screenings as a standard practice for the OEF/OIF/OND veterans diagnosed with PCT who reported sleep disturbance concerns within the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs; (b) if no sleep-disturbance screening instruments were used by clinicians, veterans would be at a greater risk of suicide completion.

AB Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects about 20% of US military veterans and is a major cause of mortality in these men and women. The incidence of PTSD has persisted over the last decade with the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, yet treatment and adherence remain inadequate in part due to clinician lack of knowledge about cognitive processing therapy and prolonged exposure, the proven gold standards in treatment. This article reviews the most current and successful PTSD treatment options and identifies risk factors for patient nonadherence in hopes of reducing the rate of veteran suicide related to PTSD.

AB Objective: The U.S. Army suicide rate increased sharply during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. There is limited information about medically documented, nonfatal suicidal behaviors among soldiers in the Army's Reserve Component (RC), which is composed of the Army National Guard and Army Reserve. Here we examine trends and sociodemographic correlates of suicide attempts, suspicious injuries, and suicide ideation among activated RC soldiers. Methods: Data come from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) Historical Administrative Data Study (HADS), which integrates administrative records for all soldiers on active duty for the years 2004 through 2009 (n=1.66 million). Results: We identified 2,937 unique RC soldiers on active duty with a nonfatal suicidal event documented at some point during the HADS study period. There were increases in the annual incidence rates of suicide attempts (71 to 204/100,000 person-years) and suicide ideation (326 to 425/100,000 person-years). Incidence rates for suspicious injuries also generally increased but were more variable. Using hierarchical classification rules, we identified the first instance of each soldier's most severe behavior (suicide attempt versus suspicious injury versus suicide ideation). For each of those suicide- or injury-related outcomes, we found increased risk among those who were female, younger, non-Hispanic White, less educated, never married, and lower-ranking enlisted. These sociodemographic associations significantly differed across outcomes, although the patterns were similar. Conclusion: Results provide a broad overview of nonfatal suicidal trends in the RC during the period 2004 through 2009. They also demonstrate that integration of multiple administrative data systems enriches analysis of the predictors of such events.

AB We conducted a retrospective study of 473,964 U.S. Army soldiers deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan through December 2004 using deployment and admission records. We categorized mental disorder diagnoses using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) and identified attempted suicide/self-inflicted injuries using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes E950-E959. We estimated and evaluated relative risks (RR) using Poisson regression models. Analysis found 1,948 psychiatric hospitalizations of deployed soldiers. The most common mental problems were mood, adjustment, and anxiety disorders (including post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]). RR of mental disorders ranged from 1.6 to 3 for females and 2 to 6 for enlisted soldiers compared to their counterparts. Younger soldiers had 30-60% higher substance abuse disorders. Combat units in Iraq demonstrated higher risk of any mental disorder and anxiety problems compared to combat support units. Younger women had the highest incidence of attempted suicide/self-inflicted injuries. Further mental disorders surveillance is recommended.

AB The recent increased suicide rate in the U.S. military has received widespread academic and media attention (Nock et al., 2013). "Big data" has been defined as large, complex, and linkable information (Khoury & Ioannidis, 2014) that can be used to investigate such changes in incidence at a population level. "Big health data" can revolutionize the future of epidemiological research, and this commentary discusses a specific example of how it can be used to progress suicide research.

AB Background: The U.S. Army suicide attempt rate increased sharply during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Risk may vary according to occupation, which significantly influences the stressors that soldiers experience.
   Methods: Using administrative data from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS), we identified person-month records for all active duty Regular Army enlisted soldiers who had a medically documented suicide attempt from 2004 through 2009 (n = 9650) and an equal-probability sample of control person-months (n = 153,528). Logistic regression analyses examined the association of combat occupation (combat arms [CA], special forces [SF], combat medic [CM]) with suicide attempt, adjusting for socio-demographics, service-related characteristics, and prior mental health diagnosis.
   Results: In adjusted models, the odds of attempting suicide were higher in CA (OR = 1.2 [95% CI: 1.1-1.2]) and CM (OR = 1.4 [95% CI: 1.3-1.5]), but lower in SF (OR = 0.3 [95% CI: 0.2-0.5]) compared to all other occupations. CA and CM had higher odds of suicide attempt than other occupations if never deployed (ORs = 1.1-1.5) or previously deployed (ORs = 1.2-1.3), but not when currently deployed. Occupation was associated with suicide attempt in the first ten years of service, but not beyond. In the first year of service, primarily a time of training, CM had higher odds of suicide attempt than both CA (OR = 1.4 [95% CI: 1.2-1.6]) and other occupations (OR = 1.5 [95% CI: 1.3-1.7]). Discrete-time hazard functions revealed that these occupations had distinct patterns of monthly risk during the first year of service.
   Conclusions: Military occupation can inform the understanding suicide attempt risk among soldiers.

AB Suicide and violence are significant problems in a subset of Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans. This study investigates how posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and resilience in veterans are associated with suicidal ideation and violent impulses while controlling for known covariates of both adverse outcomes. Structured clinical interviews were conducted of N = 2,543 Iraq/Afghanistan-era U.S. veterans. Compared with veterans denying suicidal ideation or violent impulses (n = 1,927), veterans endorsing both (n = 171) were more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD, report childhood abuse, combat exposure, physical pain symptoms, and drug misuse, and less likely to endorse self-direction/life purpose. Veterans reporting concurrent suicidal ideation and violent impulses had higher odds of misusing drugs and reporting pain symptoms relative to veterans reporting suicidal ideation only (n = 186) and had lower odds of endorsing self-direction/life purpose compared with veterans reporting violent impulses only (n = 259). The findings underscore the importance of examining drug abuse, physical pain symptoms, and self-direction/life purpose, as well as PTSD and history of trauma, in the context of clinical assessment and empirical research aimed at optimizing risk management of suicide and violence in military veterans.

AB Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among U.S. Army soldiers. Suicide-related ideation, which is associated with suicide attempts and suicide, can cause considerable distress. In a sample of 1,663 recently redeployed soldiers, we used factor analysis and structural equation modeling to test the associations between combat exposure, unit cohesion, and their interaction in predicting suicide-related ideation. We found that combat exposure was a significant risk factor for suicide-related ideation, while unit cohesion was a significant protective factor. The significant interaction between the two factors indicated that soldiers who experienced greater combat exposure but also had higher levels of unit cohesion had relatively lower levels of suicide-related ideation. In addition, those who had higher levels of combat exposure and lower unit cohesion were most at risk for suicide-related ideation. Our findings indicate the importance of unit cohesion in protecting soldiers from suicide-related ideation and suggest a higher risk group of soldiers who should be targeted for interventions.

AB Background: Researchers have theorized that increased rates of suicide in the military are associated with combat exposure; however, this hypothesis has received inconsistent support in the literature, potentially because combat exposure may be indirectly related to suicide risk through its influence on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms. The current study tested the hypothesis that combat exposure has a significant indirect effect on suicidal behavior among Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans through its effects on PTSD-depressive symptomatology.
   Methods: Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans (N=3,238) participated in a cross-sectional, multi-site study of post deployment mental health consisting of clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine direct and indirect relationships between three latent variables: combat exposure, PTSD-depression, and suicidal behavior (past attempts and current ideation, intent, and preparation).
   Results: A partial mediation model was the best-fitting model for the data. Combat exposure was significantly associated with PTSD-depression (beta=0.50, p<.001), which was in turn associated with suicidal behavior(beta=0.62, p<.001). As expected, the indirect effect between combat exposure and suicidal behavior was statistically significant, beta=0.31, p<.001.
   Limitations: Data were cross-sectional, and suicidal behavior was measured via self-report.
   Conclusions: Results indicated that combat exposure was indirectly related to suicidal behavior via PTSD-depressive symptomatology. Findings lend support for a higher-order combined PTSD-depression latent factor and suggest that Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans with high levels of PTSD-depressive symptoms are at increased risk for suicidal behavior.

AB Objective: Military suicide and parasuicidal behaviors have been increasing over the last several years, with rates highest in the deployed environment. This article presents a deployment cycle-specific suicide prevention plan utilized during one U.S. Army division's 15-month deployment to Iraq. Methods: Education, identification, and intervention programs were implemented at each phase of the deployment cycle based on the specific unit activities and predicted stressors. Results: During the deployment, there was an annual suicide rate of 16/100,000 within the trial cohort, compared to a theater rate of 24/100,000. Peaks in suicidal ideation and behaviors occurred during months two, six, and twelve of deployment. Conclusions: A deployment cycle prevention program may decrease rates of suicide in the combat environment. This program may serve as a model for other suicide prevention programs.

AB We have little understanding of the increased active duty military suicide rates found in the United States, and little understanding of what is historically normative for combatants. Therefore, we examined historical records on suicides among the British Army during the Crimean War for the years 1854-1856. There were 18 documented suicides in the British Army during this period. Calculating an accurate annual suicide rate per 100,000 is impossible because it is unclear how many of the 111,313 military personnel were in country for each of the 2 years of the war. However, the range is conservatively estimated between 8 and 16 per 100,000, with the likely answer somewhere near the middle. This suggests the possibility that increasing suicide rates among active duty military may be a modern U.S. phenomenon.

ID RISK
AB Suicide is an important emerging problem among active duty personnel and veterans of recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Suicide rates among veterans treated in the VA System are about 50% higher than in the general population, and the rate of suicide among active duty service personnel has recently exceeded the rate in the general population. Preventing suicides and providing services is a high priority for the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Administration (VA). The VA electronic medical record system stores a very large corpus of clinical notes. Application of search engine technology to a subset of this corpus demonstrated that text search confers an 8-to 10-fold improvement in the ability to identify individuals who have made prior suicide attempts. This technology is highly relevant to health care institutions that have adopted electronic medical record systems.

AB The association between suicide and combat injuries sustained during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was examined. A retrospective population-based cohort design was conducted using official military records to identify combat injuries (October 7, 2001, to December 31, 2007). Those who were injured during combat had higher crude suicide rates than those who deployed and were not injured (incidence rate ratio [IRR]=1.50; confidence interval [CI]=1.06, 2.12), or never deployed (IRR=1.46; CI=1.04, 2.06). After adjusting for demographics, these findings were no longer statistically significant. Although our data did not support an elevated suicide risk among wounded service members, additional research is needed to examine the impact of injury severity.

AB Despite well-documented postdeployment readjustment problems affecting veterans of Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Iraqi Freedom (OIF), few studies have explored the possible relationship of readjustment stressors to the recent increase in military suicide. This study examined associations between suicidal ideation and postdeployment readjustment problems using cross-sectional population-based survey data from 1665 National Guard members who recently returned from Iraq. The findings suggested that readjustment problems are widespread, with 45% of veterans endorsing one or more financial or family problems 3 months postdeployment. After adjusting for mental health and combat exposure, veterans with the highest number of readjustment stressors were at 52 times greater risk of suicidal ideation than those with no stressors. In a psychiatrically impaired subsample, the high stressor group experienced a fourfold risk of suicide ideation compared with those with no stressors. The findings argue for suicide prevention efforts that more directly target readjustment problems in returning OEF/OIF veterans.

AB Research suggests that combat exposure might increase risk for suicide. The interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide (IPTS) proposes that exposure to painful and provocative experiences such as combat contribute to fearlessness about death and increased pain tolerance, which serve to enhance the individual's capability to attempt suicide. Violent and aggressive combat experiences, in particular, should demonstrate relatively stronger associations to this capability. The current study tests this proposition in a sample of deployed active duty combatants. Results indicate that all types of combat exposure independently contribute to capability for suicide. Consistent with the IPTS, when considering all types of combat simultaneously, combat characterized by violence and high levels of injury and death are associated with relatively stronger associations to this capability.

AB Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and Suicide Bombing have become the headline news for every other day. It is a growing global phenomenon that is happening from Iraq to Afghanistan, Syria to United Kingdom and Spain to Pakistan. An average US soldier in Iraq receives 6 to 23 blast wave shocks over his/her tenure in Iraq. Pakistan has witnessed 120 suicide bombing attacks in last six years. While various attempts have been made to assess the impact of blast overpressure on buildings and animals, little has been done on crowd formation, crowd density and underlying geometry to mitigate the effects. This paper is set to make geometrical recommendations to reduce the casualties in case of such an incident for high value targets, like mosques and army facilities in the frontline countries fighting the global war on terrorism. A virtual simulation tool has been developed which is capable of assessing the impact of crowd formation patterns and their densities on the magnitude of injury and number of casualties during a suicide bombing attack. Results indicated that the worst crowd formation is street (Zig-Zag) where 30% crowd can be dead and 45% can be injured, given typical explosive carrying capacity of a single suicide bomber. Row wise crowd formations was found to be the best for reducing the effectiveness of an attack with 18% crowd in lethal zone and 38% in injury zones. For a typical suicide bombing attack, we can reduce the number of fatalities by 12%, and the number of injuries by 7%. Simulation results were compared and validated by the real-life incidents and found to he in good agreement. Line-of-sight with the attacker, rushing towards the exit, and stampede were found to be the most lethal choices both during and after the attack. These findings, although preliminary, may have implications for emergency response and counter terrorism.

AB As a result of scientific publications indicating that the last two decades have seen an increase in the number of suicides in the US Armed Forces, the topic of suicide in the military of other countries, such as Germany, has also received a lot of attention in media and science alike. Risk factors for suicidal behaviour and suicide were identified in several research projects in the US, Canada, the UK, and Germany. Until now, German suicide research among military service personnel has mainly focused on epidemiological aspects of suicides and suicidality, individual risk factors, sub-groups at risk for suicide, suicides and deployment abroad, and associations of suicide and suicide attempts with acute mental disorders. The key findings are summarized in this review article. Efforts should be made to develop and evaluate risk group-focused and occupation-focused prevention and intervention programs. Future multinational studies should address potential differences between risk groups for fatal and non-fatal suicidal behaviour.

AB History of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been found to increase risk of suicidal behavior. The association between suicide attempt history among veterans with PTSD and/or TBI was explored. Cases (N = 81) and 2: 1 matched controls (N = 160) were randomly selected from a Veterans Affairs Medical Center clinical database. PTSD history was associated with an increased risk for a suicide attempt (OR = 2.8; 95% CI: 1.5, 5.1). This increased risk was present for those with and without a history of TBI. Results support incorporating PTSD history when assessing suicide risk among veterans with and without TBI.

AB This article, covering the period 2003-2010, is concerned with those Iraqis whose asylum claims in the UK have been rejected in recent years and who have found 'nowhere to run'. A deterrence-based UK immigration regime has undermined many of their basic rights since the start of the war. And despite wide public knowledge about the dangers of return to Iraq, failed Iraqi asylum seekers are being made destitute, detained and even forcibly deported back to Iraq. From 2007 onwards, deportations on commercial and military flights increased, with deportees facing torture, disappearance and threats of violence upon their return. 'Deterrence' claims casualties in the UK, too, with Iraqis dying from homelessness, suicide, medical neglect and despair. Iraqi refugee organisations, the UNHCR and the European Court all call for an end to deportations to Iraq, yet the UK government refuses to listen.

ID TERRORISM
AB This article analyzes the suicide campaign conducted by the Iraqi insurgency since the 2003 US-led invasion. It offers a theoretical framework to identify the factors that explain why only certain armed organizations - in particular Al-Qaeda and its allies - have mounted (even if not exclusively) a specific terrorist campaign against Iraqi civilians (instead of attacking occupying forces), in which they have targeted the Shiite population by perpetrating suicide attacks instead of using other tactics. This issue requires identifying a complex set of preconditions for organizing an armed struggle such as that of the Iraqi insurgency, the two most important being, on one hand, the Sunni insurgents' common capacity for exploiting contingent political and social opportunities after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, and, on the other, a regular flow of militants, including volunteers to recruit as suicide bombers. At the same time, in accounting for the specificities of Al-Qaeda's armed struggle within the Iraqi insurgency this paper explores three crucial factors underlying its elite members' decision-making: the radical opposition of Al-Qaeda and its allies to the new political regime determined by the Anglo-American occupation, combined with the highly asymmetric nature of the fighting between Al-Qaeda and the occupying forces; Al-Qaeda's vigilantism against the Shiites; and, finally, the presumed efficacy of suicide attacks in terms of their military, emotional, and symbolic impacts.

Grim news, but there are reasons why this particular mission may attract more than its share of hostile attention. Military experts have understated the significance of the disparity between American and British approaches to counter insurgency in Iraq and also failed to anticipate the unfortunate ramifications for the troops on the ground of recent media attention at home.

   DURKHEIM; TROUBLES; PARADOX; HEALTH; SENSE
AB Durkheim's idea that war reduces suicide through greater social and political integration has been used to explain suicide trends during the Northern Ireland conflict and in the period of peace. In this article the applicability of Durkheim is critically evaluated through a case study of suicide trends by age, gender and cause of death over a 40-year period. The key finding is that the cohort of children and young people who grew up in the worst years of violence, during the 1970s, have the highest and most rapidly increasing suicide rates, and account for the steep upward trend in suicide following the 1998 Agreement. Contrary to Durkheim, the recent rise in suicide involves a complex of social and psychological factors. These include the growth in social isolation, poor mental health arising from the experience of conflict, and the greater political stability of the past decade. The transition to peace means that externalized aggression is no longer socially approved. It becomes internalized instead.

ID BRIGADE COMBAT TEAM; ARMY; MORTALITY; FREEDOM; CARE
AB In Operation Iraqi Freedom, which ended in August 2010, nearly 3500 hostile deaths occurred among US military personnel and 32,000 more were wounded in action (WIA). More than 1800 hostile deaths occurred during Operation Enduring Freedom (in and around Afghanistan) through 2014 and about 20,000 were WIA. A larger proportion of wounded personnel survived in Iraq and Afghanistan than during the Vietnam War, but the increased survival rates were not as high as some studies have asserted. The survival rates were 90.2% in Iraq and 91.6% in Afghanistan, compared with 86.5% in Vietnam. The casualty rates varied between the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and before, during, and after the respective surges. Amputation rates are difficult to measure consistently, but I estimate that 2.6% of all WIA and 9.0% of medically evacuated WIA from the Iraq and Afghanistan theaters combined resulted in the major loss of a limb. Elevated non-hostile death rates (including deaths due to accidents, illnesses, homicides, or suicides) resulted in about 220 more deaths in Iraq and about 200 more deaths in Afghanistan than would have been expected in peacetime among populations of the size deployed to those two conflicts.

AB In the past, women in the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) were known to serve as homemakers (i.e., wives, mothers). However, in recent times there has been a shift in their roles, as more women are starting to emerge on the front lines as suicide bombers, recruiters, or a part of ISIS's official women police brigade. This article investigates this phenomenon by performing a thematic analysis on open-source material, namely research reports, media reports, and propaganda material produced by ISIS. In doing so, it presents the evolution of the roles of women in ISIS from past to present and highlights key reasons that motivate women to join ISIS, which include ideology, alienation, romance, peer influence, and a sense of security. Implications for research on women in terrorism have also been identified.

AB Suicide rates among U.S. military personnel and veterans are a public health concern, and those with mental health conditions are at particular risk. We examined demographic, military, temporal, and diagnostic associations with suicidality in veterans. We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study of all Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans who screened positive for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or depression, received a suicide risk assessment, and endorsed hopelessness about the present or future after their last deployment and between January 1, 2010 and June 29, 2014 (N = 45,741). We used bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to examine variables associated with having endorsed suicidal thoughts and a plan. Multiple factors were associated with suicidality outcomes, including longer time from last deployment to screening (proxy for time to seeking VA care), an alcohol use disorder diagnosis, further distance from VA (rurality), and being active duty during military service. Hispanic veterans were at decreased risk of having suicidal ideation and a plan, compared to their white counterparts. In high-risk veterans, some of the strongest associations with suicidality were with modifiable risk factors, including time to VA care and alcohol use disorder diagnoses. Promising avenues for suicide prevention efforts can include early engagement/intervention strategies with a focus on amelioration of high-risk drinking. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Purpose: This study examined the number of suicides in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Armed Forces and compared the relative suicide risk of military personnel with that in the general population.
   Methods: Age-, sex-, and calendar year-adjusted standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to compare the number of suicides between the ROK Armed Forces and the general population.
   Results: Between 2011 and 2016, there were 405 suicides by ROK Armed Forces Personnel. The ROK Armed Forces had significantly fewer suicides than expected compared with the general population (SMR = 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.41 similar to 0.50, based on 405 deaths). This was evident for both rank groups (soldiers and officers). In addition, a significant decrease was observed in the soldier group when comparing the SMR in 2016 with the previous 5-year average.
   Conclusions: Overall, during the period 2011-2016, the ROK Armed Forces had fewer suicides than expected when compared with the general population. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Self-burning and self-immolation are forms of self-harm found across the Eastern Mediterranean region and South and Central Asia. The majority of those choosing these methods of self-harm are young women. Using data from 100 young female survivors of suicidal attempts in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, this article analyses the phenomenon in the context of a life-course progression arguing that the period around first marriage is a time of particular trauma to women. We suggest that self-burning should be understood as a communicative act with an indigenous semiology which functions as an expression of subordinated agency within a male-dominated society, in which marriage is a major source of conflict between generations and genders.

AB The current study explored psychological symptoms, symptom severity, and suicide risk in a national sample (N = 628) of student veterans. We hypothesized that the rates, types, and severity of problems experienced by student veterans on campus would in many ways mirror those reported by active duty service members as well as the Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom veteran population. Almost 35% of the sample experienced "severe anxiety," 24% experienced "severe depression," and almost 46% experienced significant symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. Of particular concern, there were significant numbers of participants thinking about suicide (46%), with 20% having a plan, 10.4% thinking about suicide "often or very often," 7.7% making an attempt, and 3.8% believing that suicide is either "likely" or "very likely." Implications of the findings are discussed, with a particular focus on college and university campuses.

TI 'Coalition-In-Iraq' countries 'internal' civil violent deaths compared
   to the USA 'external' violence of September 11th 2001
SO MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR
LA English
DT Article
DE suicide; homicide; road deaths; terrorism; perception
ID SUICIDE; FEAR
AB Background: The atrocity of 9/11 exemplified 'external' caused civil violent deaths, which have major policy implications for the countries contributing armed forces to the 'Coalition-In-Iraq' [C.I.I]. C.I.I Government's resources for perennial 'internal' violent deaths (suicide, homicide and road), are likely to be threatened by alternative priorities. C.I.I 'internal' deaths are compared with those of 9/11 to provide information to determine relative risks.
   Material/Methods: To uniformly compare mortality between countries we utilise the most recent WHO mortality data, taking the latest three years 1997-1999 and calculating an average annual number and rate of 'internal' deaths in each country, these are compared with the 9/11 fatalities, calculating a proportional ratio, as an indicator of differential damage to families and society.
   Results: USA 'external' deaths were 3,074 people and annual average suicides were 30,966. Total 'internal' deaths exceeded 'external' more than 30 times. Every fortnight there are more USA 'internal' violent deaths than on 9/11. Except Australia and Bulgaria, every country had more suicides than died on 9/11. Apart from Bulgaria, total 'internal' deaths exceeded the 'external' toll in all other CAI countries- by 14 times in Japan; 6 in Republic of Korea, 4 in Italy, 3 in Spain and the UK, twice in Canada and 1.5 times in Australia.
   Conclusions: The extent of 'internal' civil violent deaths, such as suicide, highlight the perennial pressures upon psychiatric services and the need to defend resources at a time of competing priorities.

ID SCALE; MODEL
AB Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was examined as a risk factor for suicidal ideation in Iraq and Afghanistan War veterans (N = 407) referred to Veterans Affairs mental health care. The authors also examined if risk for suicidal ideation was increased by the presence of comorbid mental disorders in veterans with PTSD. Veterans who screened positive for PTSD were more than 4 times as likely to endorse suicidal ideation relative to non-PTSD veterans. Among veterans who screened positive for PTSD (n = 202), the risk for suicidal ideation was 5.7 times greater in veterans who screened positive for two or more comorbid disorders relative to veterans with PTSD only. Findings are relevant to identifying risk for suicide behaviors in Iraq and Afghanistan War veterans.

DE alexithymia; suicide; post traumatic stress disorder; PTSD
ID PTSD; AFGHANISTAN; IDEATION; IRAQ
AB Background: To investigate the possibility if alexithymia could be used as a predictor of attempted suicide among patients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.
   Subjects and methods: The study was based on 127 veterans from the 1991-1995 war in Croatia. All the patients involved in this study were previously diagnosed with PTSD. The questionnaires (socio-demographic questionnaire, Mississippi scale for combat related PTSD questionnaire, and 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale questionnaire) were administered by investigators.
   Results: The results suggest that alexithymia was significantly associated with attempted suicide (P=0.020). Furthermore, alexithymia remained a significant predictor of an attempted suicide even in the multivariate regression model, which yielded an odds ratio (OR) of 2.87 (95% confidence intervals 1.18-7.00).
   Conclusions: These results point out that alexithymia can be considered as a potential risk factor for suicide in this population, suggesting that it may also be used as an indicator of worsening psychological status and attempted suicide in other population groups with higher alexithymia prevalence.

AB Objective: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with increased risk for suicide and appear to occur in disproportionately high rates among men who served in the U.S. military. However, research has yet to examine a comprehensive range of ACEs among Iraq/Afghanistan veterans with combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or whether these premilitary stressors may contribute to suicidal behavior in this highly vulnerable population.
   Method: A sample of 217 men entering a residential program for combat-related PTSD completed measures for ACEs, combat exposure, and lifetime suicidal ideation and attempts.
   Results: The majority of patients had experienced multiple types of adversity or traumas during childhood/adolescence. In particular, 83.4% endorsed at least 1 ACE category and 41.5% reported experiencing 4 or more ACEs. When accounting for effects of deployment-related stressors, we further found that accumulation of ACEs was uniquely linked with thoughts of suicide or attempts among these patients. Namely, for every 1-point increase on the ACE Questionnaire, veterans' risk of suicidal ideation and attempts increased by 23% and 24%, respectively.
   Conclusion: This brief report provides initial evidence that veterans seeking treatment for combat-related PTSD often have extensive histories of premilitary stressors that may increase suicide risk beyond probable deployment-related traumas.

AB This paper presents the science of suicide bombing under the framework of agent based simulation. It also explains the physics, explosive models, mathematics and the assumptions we need to create such a simulation. The work also describes human shields available in the crowd with partial and full coverage in both two dimensional and three dimensional environments. A virtual simulation tool has been developed which is capable of assessing the impact of crowd formation patterns and their densities on the magnitude of injury and number of casualties during a suicide bombing attack. Results indicated that the worst crowd formation is street (Zig-Zag) where 30% crowd can be dead and 45% can be injured, given typical explosive carrying capacity of a single suicide bomber. Row wise crowd formations was found to be the best for reducing the effectiveness of an attack with 18% crowd in lethal zone and 38% in injury zones. For atypical suicide bombing attack, we can reduce the number of fatalities by 12%, and the number of injuries by 7% by simply following the recommendations in this paper. Simulation results were compared and validated by the real-life incidents in Iraq and found to be in good agreement. Line-of-sight with the attacker, rushing towards the exit, and stampede were,found to be the most lethal choices both during and after the attack. These findings, although preliminary, may have implications for emergency response and counter terrorism.

NSSI was positively associated with passive, active, and concurrent active-passive suicidal ideation at the bivariate level. NSSI remained a predictor of active, OR=5.15, and concurrent active-passive suicidal ideation, OR=7.01, when other risk factors were considered.

AB This study explores differences in perpetrators of suicide attacks and non-suicide attacks in the United States. The study uses data on far-right and Al Qaeda and affiliated/inspired terrorists between 1990 and 2013 from the United States Extremist Crime Database. Our analysis estimates logistic regression models to test whether suicide attackers were more likely to have exhibited specific risk factors for suicidality, while examining other prominent claims regarding patterns of suicide terrorism. Suicide attackers were no more likely than non-suicide attackers to have previously attempted suicide or to have been diagnosed as mentally ill. Suicide attackers were more likely, though, to have a history of substance abuse, to be loners, have served in the military, participated in paramilitary training, and be more ideologically committed to the cause. We found that Al Qaeda affiliated/inspired attackers were more likely than far-right attackers to have engaged in a suicide mission. With the current focus on Americans traveling to Syria and Iraq to receive training and fight for jihadist movements (e.g., the Islamic State), our findings appear relevant. Observers have expressed concern that these fighters may return and then commit attacks in their homeland. Law enforcement could make use of this study's findings.

AB Objective: During the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, suicidal behaviors increased among U.S. Army soldiers. Although Reserve Component (RC) soldiers (National Guard and Army Reserve) comprise approximately one third of those deployed in support of the wars, few studies have examined suicidal behaviors among these "citizen-soldiers". The objective of this study is to examine suicide attempt risk factors and timing among RC enlisted soldiers. Methods: This longitudinal, retrospective cohort study used individual-level person-month records from Army and Department of Defense administrative data systems to examine socio-demographic, service-related, and mental health predictors of medically documented suicide attempts among enlisted RC soldiers during deployment from 2004-2009. Data were analyzed using discrete-time survival models. Results: A total of 230 enlisted RC soldiers attempted suicide. Overall, the in-theater suicide attempt rate among RC soldiers was 81/100,000 person-years. Risk was highest in the fifth month of deployment (13.8 per 100,000 person-months). Suicide attempts were more likely among soldiers who were women (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 2.5 [95% CI: 1.8-3.5]), less than high school educated (aOR = 1.8 [95% CI: 1.3-2.5]), in their first 2 years of service (aOR = 2.0 [95% CI: 1.2-3.4]), were currently married (aOR = 2.0 [95% CI: 1.5-2.7]), and had received a mental health diagnosis in the previous month (aOR = 24.7 [95% CI: 17.4-35.0]). Conclusions: Being female, early in service and currently married are associated with increased odds of suicide attempt in RC soldiers. Risk of suicide attempt was greatest at mid deployment. These predictors and the timing of suicide attempt for RC soldiers in-theater are largely consistent with those of deployed Active Component (Regular) soldiers. Results also reinforce and replicate the findings among Active Component soldiers related to the importance of a recent mental health diagnosis and the mid-deployment as a period of enhanced risk.

AB Objective: Suicide is one of the ten leading causes of death in United States and the suicide rate in the military population has increased since the start of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. However, few biomarkers for current suicidal ideation (CSI) have been identified. The current study examined the association of four candidate genes with CSI in active duty US Army Special Operations Command and National Guard units (n = 3,889) who served in Iraq and Afghanistan between November 2009 and July 2014.
   Methods: Current PTSD symptoms and CSI were assessed using the PTSD Checklist (PCL) and PHQ-9, respectively. Traumatic events were assessed using items from the Life Events Checklist (LEC) that met the DSM-IV PTSD criteria of a traumatic stressor. All genotypes of saliva DNA were discriminated using the TaqMan 5'-exonuclease assay.
   Results: The associations between CSI and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), FK506 binding protein (FKBP5), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), or S100A10 (p11) were examined. We found CSI was associated with BDNF (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.5-1.8, P = 0.0002), but not FKBP5, COMT and p11. Female soldiers reported CSI more often than males (chi(2) = 7.403, p = 0.0065), although gender did not affect CSI severity. In addition, associations were found between CSI and depression, PTSD, and BDNF, but not traumatic events. The BDNF Val66Met contributed to the severity of CSI even after adjusting to PTSD, depression and LEC.
   Conclusions: The associations of BDNF with CSI and its severity suggest that BDNF may be a predictor of suicidal risk and present an opportunity to develop laboratory tools with clinical implications in suicide prevention and treatment.

AB Nightmares are intensive dreams with negative emotional tone. Frequent nightmares can pose a serious clinical problem and in 2001, Tanskanen et al. found that nightmares increase the risk of suicide. However, the dataset used by these authors included war veterans in whom nightmare frequency -and possibly also suicide risk -is elevated. Therefore, re-examination of the association between nightmares and suicide in these data is warranted. We investigated the relationship between nightmares and suicide both in the general population and war veterans in Finnish National FINRISK Study from the years 1972 to 2012, a dataset overlapping with the one used in the study by Tanskanen et al. Our data comprise 71,068 participants of whom 3139 are war veterans. Participants were followed from their survey participation until the end of 2014 or death. Suicides (N = 398) were identified from the National Causes of Death Register. Frequent nightmares increase the risk of suicide: The result of Tanskanen et al. holds even when war experiences are controlled for. Actually nightmares are not significantly associated with suicides among war veterans. These results support the role of nightmares as an independent risk factor for suicide instead of just being proxy for history of traumatic experiences.

SO SECURITY DIALOGUE
LA English
DT Article
DE Iraq; psychiatry; medicalization; sovereignty; governance
ID GOVERNMENTALITY; BIOPOLITICS
AB This article examines how psychiatry has been used as a technology of security in post-'liberation' Iraq. Drawing on Foucault and Foucauldian work on the history and sociology of medicine, it begins by tracing how, from the 19th century onwards, psychiatry has instantiated its authority through a claim to provide social security within national spaces, both through methods of sovereign confinement and through liberation and governance. Arguing that the various 'psy' disciplines - and medicine more generally - are increasingly used as technologies of security internationally, the article examines psychiatric practice in Iraq, where patients in the Al Rashad psychiatric institution were accidentally liberated from their confinement by US Marines in 2003. Iraq's 'mentally ill' were initially considered a manageable security threat and thus subject to liberal community governance efforts. Yet, after the so-called suicide bombing of two pet markets in 2008, reportedly by former Al Rashad patients, those deemed 'mentally ill' and others associated with them were once again made subject to sovereign confinement, marking a failure in liberal governance. Thus, this article seeks to explore some of the complex lines connecting sovereignty, security and psychiatry in post-'liberation' Iraq, and in global politics more generally.

AB PURPOSE: The purpose of this case study is to present the complex contribution of combat-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to suicide and international standards of treatment among veterans deployed to the Middle East.
   CONCLUSIONS: PTSD carries increased physical and psychological health risk in combat soldiers. Internationally, guidelines for PTSD promote cognitive behavior therapies, specifically exposure therapy, as first line treatment; however, implementation varies among countries.
   PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Evidence supports the benefit of exposure- based psychotherapy for combat- related PTSD. Commonly prescribed antidepressants and other psychotherapy treatments may not be as beneficial.

AB Objectives: To assess possession of household firearms among veterans receiving mental health care and the frequency of their discussions with clinicians about firearms. Methods: We surveyed random samples of veterans receiving mental health care in each of five purposively chosen, geographically diverse VA facilities; 677 (50% of recipients) responded. Results: 45.3% (95% CI 41.2, 49.3) of veteran respondents reported household firearms; 46.9% of those with suicidal thoughts and 55.6% with a suicide plan had household firearms. Only 27.5% of all veteran respondents and 44% of those with recent suicidal ideation and household firearms had had a firearm-related discussion with a clinician. Discussion: Many veterans receiving mental health care can readily access firearms, a highly lethal means for suicide. Increasing clinician-patient discussions and health system efforts to reduce firearm access might reduce suicide in this clinical population.

ID WOMEN; WAR; TERRORISTS; GENDER; MEDIA; LOGIC
AB The growing number of female suicide bombers in the Muslim world has recently received a lot of attention by academics and journalists in the West. This developing literature has tended to understand these women as victims or pawns of Islamic patriarchy. This article offers critical review of the causal accounts of female suicide bombing in order to show how these discourses of victimization reify a masculinist justification for American empire. This narrative of empire produces Islam as a religion/culture of patriarchy and, thus, reads Muslim women as needing rescue from their religion and their men in order to validate military intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan. Working from the post-colonial insights of Gayatri Spivak, this article argues that female suicide bombers reflect a subaltern status in the war on terror. As such, these conceptualizations of the causes of female suicide bombing proffer a narrative of masculine rescue against the barbaric force of Islamic patriarchy, rendering the war on terror as a homoterritorial war over masculine dominance in the region.

AB Objective: Research shows that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) independently increase suicide risk; however, scant research has investigated whether mTBI increases suicide risk above and beyond the risk associated with PTSD alone. Design: The current research compared suicide risk factors among a matched sample of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) military personnel and veterans with PTSD alone or PTSD and a history of an mTBI. Results: Differences in the assessed risk factors were small and suggest that if PTSD and mTBI are associated with elevations in suicide risk relative to PTSD alone, the added risk is likely mediated or confounded by PTSD symptom severity. Conclusion: This finding highlights the importance of screening and treating military personnel and veterans for PTSD. Future explication of the impact of TBI-related impairments on suicide risk will be critical as we strive to ensure safety and optimize care for our military personnel and veterans.

AB The present study examined the timing of suicide and its associated soldier background and postinvestigative events among deployed Army National Guard (ARNG) soldiers from calendar years 2007 through 2014. Suicide deaths were nearly equally distributed between soldiers who had been deployed and those who had not. Among those deployed, however, suicides occurred mostly 1 year or more after having returned from deployment. Soldier background and postsuicide investigative events were associated with the timing of suicide. Having more years of military service, more previous deployments, and being married were associated with in-theater suicides. Soldiers younger in age (17-24 years), single, nonprior service, and lower in rank, in addition to having parent-family conflicts, full-time employment problems, and military transition problems were associated with suicides that had occurred 1-120 days and 120-365 days since return from deployment. Soldiers aged (24-29 years), married, and higher in rank, along with more reported problems including past behavioral health conditions, postdeployment behavior health referrals, criminal behaviors, and military performance were associated with suicides that had occurred 1 year or more after return. Findings likely represent time periods of suicide vulnerability for identifiable groups of soldiers, based on soldier background and events surrounding the suicide. Practical and theoretical implications of the findings are discussed.

SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
ID VIETNAM VETERANS; CRISIS; HEALTH
AB Suicide rates among military personnel had a significant drop in 2013, but there is no evidence of a drop among veterans. The problem of suicide among combat veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains a source of concern. The Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs are now calling for innovative treatment approaches to the problem. A short-term psychodynamic therapy presented here may be able to fill that need by dissipating the guilt from veterans' combat-related actions that leads to suicidal behavior. The treatment showed promise of success with veterans of the war in Vietnam. Preliminary work with combat veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan indicates that it may be equally successful in treating them. Basic aspects of the psychodynamic approach could be incorporated into current therapies and should improve their ability to treat veterans with PTSD at risk for suicide.

   HUMANITY?
SO JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF RELIGIONS AND IDEOLOGIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Suicide attack; Muslim; Islam; Asia; Middle East; Culture
AB Suicide attack has become a dangerous trend in the contemporary history of some Asian societies. While it has been used by some people as a means of protest, it has been largely rejected by humanity for its severe debilitating effects. Instances of suicide attack can be found in the contexts of the Israel-Palestine conflict, September 11 attacks, Bali bombing, Sunni-Shiite disagreement, struggle of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, as well as the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan by foreign powers. The recent contours of suicide attacks are basically largely related to various groups or organizations. The paper therefore examines the meaning, brief history, and the causes of suicide attack, and analyzes these within the purview of contemporary Islamic thought which is based on the textual arguments of the Qur'an and Sunnah. The paper concludes that though a tiny fraction of the whole Muslim spectrum tries to justify the suicide attack as a "weapon of the weak", the majority of the Muslim scholars has viewed it as a crime against humanity and therefore vehemently rejects this practice in any form.

AB The risk of suicide among US military personnel deployed for peacekeeping missions is unknown. We compared the risk of suicide through December 2014 among 70,608 veterans who deployed as peacekeepers to Bosnia and Kosovo between 1996 and 2002 with that of 141,715 veterans who served in the military between 1996 and 2002 but were not deployed to Bosnia and Kosovo. Both cohorts also were compared after removing those who had other conflict deployments. Suicide risk among Bosnia- and Kosovo-deployed veterans (BKDVs) relative to non-BKDVs was assessed using a hazard ratio. Among all veterans, without excluding those with other conflict deployments, deployment to Bosnia and Kosovo was not associated with an increased risk of suicide (hazard ratio = 0.83, 95%, confidence interval: 0.72, 0.96). Removing those with other conflict deployments, BKDVs again had a decreased risk of suicide compared to non-BKDVs (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% confidence interval: 0.72, 0.99). The rates of suicide among all 4 groups were higher than expected based on the US population. The risk of suicide based on US population comparison was greater among non-BKDVs than BKDVs. The absence of an increased risk of suicide associated with Bosnia and Kosovo deployment may be due to predeployment psychological and behavioral characteristics that affect fitness for deployment.

AB Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common injury sustained by soldiers in war, with rates ranging from 14 to 20% among wounded veterans from both 20(th) and 21(st) century conflicts. To date little is known about the frequency of lethal and nonlethal suicidal behaviours among these veterans. In the only suicide prevalence estimate to date, World War 2 veterans with TB! from Finland had a suicide rate ranging between 70-80 per 100,000, double the rate for the general Finnish population. Turning to suicide risk factors, research to date suggests that factors including sex, injury severity, post-injury psychiatric morbidity and occupational status may modulate the level of suicide risk among veterans with TBI. Suicide prevention efforts can be organised hierarchically, to focus at three levels: Universal interventions (such as suicide screening) that target all veterans with TBI; Selected interventions (such as pharmacotherapy) that target veterans in at-risk groups (e.g., depressed veterans); and Indicated interventions (such as crisis intervention) that target veterans who have displayed suicidal behaviour. The future challenge is to combine research and clinical practice efforts to reduce the overall levels of suicide.

AB The Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) is a dominant insurgent group operating in Iraq and Syria that rose to prominence when it took over Mosul in June, 2014. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach to analyzing this group using a dataset consisting of 2200 incidents of military activity surrounding ISIS and the forces that oppose it (including Iraqi, Syrian, and the American-led coalition). We combine ideas from logic programming and causal reasoning to mine for association rules for which we present evidence of causality. We present relationships that link ISIS vehicle-bourne improvised explosive device (VBIED) activity in Syria with military operations in Iraq, coalition air strikes, and ISIS IED activity, as well as rules that may serve as indicators of spikes in indirect fire, suicide attacks, and arrests.

AB Meaning made of stress has been shown to be a unique predictor of mental and physical health. In this study, we examined the unique associations between two facets of meaning made of stress (comprehensibility and footing in the world) and suicide risk and life-threatening behavior among military veterans who have transitioned to college were examined, controlling for demographic factors, religiousness, combat-related physical injury, combat exposure, depressive symptoms, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Findings suggest that comprehensibility (having "made sense" of a stressor) is uniquely associated with lower suicide risk and a lower likelihood of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol and engaging in self-mutilating behaviors.

AB Over the past 50 years, suicide bombings have become an increasingly common tactic of politically motivated violence, and a rising number of these attacks feature women perpetrators. Prior literature suggested that female-perpetrated suicide bombings occurring between 1985 through 2008 inflicted greater casualties, which may account in part for their increased use by terror groups. The current research project ascertains whether sex continues to predict the lethality of suicide bombing attacks perpetrated by terror groups over the decade leading up to 2016. The study utilizes secondary data sampled from the Global Terrorism Database (N = 881) and the Chicago Project on Security and Threats (N = 1,722). A negative binomial model regressing lethality against perpetrator and conflict covariates did not observe a statistically significant relationship between sex and lethality. Male and female suicide bombers demonstrated similar lethality in suicide bombing events between 2005 and 2016, although scatterplots suggest some aberration during the years 2009, 2010, and 2016. Pairwise comparisons of perpetrator sex by conflict observed some variation in the lethality of attacks, with female suicide bombers from Al Qaeda, the Islamic State of Iraq, and Iraqi rebel groups found more lethal than male suicide bombers from Boko Haram and the Nigerian rebels. The current research project contributes to the literature by demonstrating the evolving nature of terrorism and tactics relevant to the lethality of politically motivated violent attacks.

AB While it is recognized that veterans have increased rates of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suicide, and substance use disorders, rates of homicide and unintentional injury deaths in veterans have been minimally investigated. We evaluated all non-natural deaths in New Mexico veterans between 2002 and 2011 in comparison with non-natural deaths among non-veterans. We reviewed all decedents in New Mexico with a history of military service and investigated by the medical examiner, excluding natural deaths and deaths due to fall from standing height. The most common manner of death was unintentional injury (62%), most of these deaths due to motor vehicle accidents (29%) followed by unintentional overdose (26%). Suicide rates among veterans were consistently higher than the general population. The most common mechanism of suicide in men was gunshot wound (72%), and intentional overdose in women (49%). Services are needed for veterans that are tailored to all ages and both sexes.

ID INTERPERSONAL-PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY; ACQUIRED CAPABILITY; BEHAVIOR; TESTS
AB The interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide posits that the interaction of three elements is required for lethal suicidal behaviors: the perception that one is a burden on others, the perception that one does not belong, and fearlessness about death combined with high pain tolerance (termed "acquired capability" for suicide). Although an ever expanding research base supports the theory, very limited data exist supporting the theory among military personnel, a group that has experienced a rapid increase in suicides during the past several years. The current study tests the interpersonal-psychological theory in two clinical samples of military personnel while deployed to Iraq: those seeking treatment for mild traumatic brain injury, and those seeking outpatient mental health treatment. In both samples, perceived burdensomeness and acquired capability were significantly associated with suicidality, as was their interaction term. Results partially support the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide, and indicate that perceptions of burdensomeness combined with fearlessness about death are associated with increased suicidality among deployed military personnel.

AB Death by suicide and suicidal behavior are major concerns among U.S. military veterans; however, no genome-wide association studies (GWAS) studies of suicidal behavior have been conducted among U.S. military veterans to date, despite the elevated rate of suicidal behavior observed within this population. Accordingly, the primary objective of the present research was to conduct the first GWAS of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation in a large and well-characterized sample of U.S. military veterans. The gene most significantly associated (p = 9.28 x 10(-7)) with suicide attempts was the Potassium Calcium-Activated Channel Subfamily M Regulatory Beta Subunit 2 (KCNMB2) gene, which plays a key role in neuronal excitability. In addition, replication analyses provided additional support for the potential role of the ABI Family Member 3 Binding Protein (ABI3BP) gene in the pathogenesis of suicidal behavior, as numerous nominal associations were found between this gene and both suicide attempts and suicidal ideation. Additional work aimed at replicating and extending these findings is needed.

AB Background: The Veterans Health Administration has made concerted efforts to increase mental health services offered in primary care. However, few studies have evaluated correlates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in veterans in primary care-mental health integration (PCMHI). The purpose of the present study is to examine associations between suicidal ideation and suicide attempts as dependent variables and demographic and clinical factors as the independent variables.
   Methods: Veterans (n=3004) referred from primary care to PCMHI were contacted for further assessment, which included past-year severity of suicidal thoughts (none, low, high) and attempts using the Paykel Suicide Scale, mental health disorders, and illicit drug use. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to identify correlates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.
   Results: Thoughts of taking one's life was endorsed by 24% of participants and suicide attempts were reported in 2%. In adjusted models, depression, psychosis, mania, PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder were associated with high severity suicidal ideation, but not suicide attempt. Illicit drug use was not associated with suicidal ideation, but was the only variable associated with suicide attempt.
   Limitations: The study was cross-sectional, focused on one clinical setting, and the suicide attempt analyses had limited power.
   Conclusions: PCMHI is a critical setting to assess suicidal ideation and suicide attempt and researchers and clinicians should be aware that the differential correlates of these suicide-related factors. Future research is needed to identify prospective risk factors and assess the utility of follow-up care in preventing suicide. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Many U.S. Veterans have experienced the burdens of mental illness and suicide. The current article focuses on Veterans who served from 2001-2015. Although combat exposure and suicidal ideation are linked, approximately one half of all suicides among Active Duty service members (who have served since 2001) occurred among those who never deployed. Researchers who sought additional risks for suicide found that Veterans have greater odds of adversities in childhood than the general population. Adverse childhood experiences are stressful and traumatic experiences, including abuse and neglect, as well as witnessing household dysfunction, or growing up with individuals with mental illness or substance abuse. Further, childhood physical abuse has been shown to be a significant predictor for posttraumatic stress disorder and suicide. Adverse childhood experiences confer additional risk for the mental health of service members. Psychiatric nursing implications include the importance of assessing early childhood adversity during psychosocial assessments. Providing trauma-informed strategies for treatment is an essential element of psychiatric nursing care.

AB Psychosocial screening tools are routinely used by adolescent medicine providers to evaluate risk-taking behaviors and resiliency. A large number of U.S. military service members are adolescents, and many engage in behaviors that cause morbidity and death, such as tobacco use and binge drinking. Health care providers should consider the regular use of a psychosocial screening method to evaluate risk-taking behavior. The Home, Education, Activity, Drugs, Sex, Suicide, and Safety method is used to evaluate the home environment, educational and employment situations, activities, drug use, sexual activity, suicide, and safety during health care visits. This technique, originally created for a civilian adolescent population, can be used with minimal adjustments to evaluate behaviors of military service members.

ID SUICIDE TERRORISM
AB Over the last few years, Moroccans have been disproportionately involved in jihadist terrorism. Morocco has been increasingly identified as one of the largest producers of terrorists and insurgents in Afghanistan, Iraq, and throughout Europe. This article examines the factors behind the emergence of jihadist terrorism in Morocco, and how this terrorist threat has gone beyond this country's borders. Three factors have contributed to this development: the influence of global jihad on potential Moroccan jihadists; the growing Islamization of the country; and deteriorating socioeconomic conditions. In analyzing these variables, special attention will be paid to the Casablanca terrorist attacks on May 16, 2003, marking the debut of suicide terrorism in Morocco. The article will also examine the principal counterterrorist initiatives Morocco has implemented in response to this threat.

AB Little is known about over 125,000 veterans who received non-honorable military discharges since 2001, even though these veterans face substantial barriers to obtaining services and are likely to be at high risk for negative mental and behavioral health outcomes including suicide. Seven-hundred twenty-two veterans living the in the San Francisco Bay Area participated in the study. The sample comprised honorably discharged (n = 508) and non-honorably discharged veterans (n = 214). T-tests were used to compare means on predictors of suicide risk including Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, alcohol use, somatic symptoms, and physical disability. A series of regression models tested relationships between predictors, discharge status, and suicide risk. Non-honorably discharged veterans demonstrated higher mean scores than honorably discharged veterans on all predictors. In regression models, somatic symptoms (beta = 0.22, p < 0.001), physical disability (beta = 0.16, p < 0.05), and discharge status (beta = 0.33, p < 0.001) were associated with suicide risk. The final model showed an interaction effect for discharge status on the relationship between somatic symptoms and suicide risk (beta = 0.16, p < 0.05). Non-honorably discharged veterans showed higher rates of mental and physical health problems and suicide risk compared to honorably discharged veterans. The magnitude of the relationship between somatic symptoms and suicide risk was significantly greater in non-honorably discharged veterans.

AB In this study, we investigated the Personality Assessment Inventory's (PAI; Morey, 1991, 2007) Suicide Potential Index (SPI) and Suicide Ideation scale (SUI) as predictors of suicidal behavior (SB) in military Veterans with traumatic brain injury (TBI; N = 154). We analyzed electronic medical records were searched for SB in the 2 years post-PAI administration and data via logistic regressions. We obtained statistical support for the SPI and SUI as predictors of SB. Analyses we performed using receiver operating characteristics suggested an optimal SPI cutoff of epsilon 15 for this sample. Findings suggest that SPI and SUI scores may assist in assessing suicide risk in those with TBI, particularly when population-based cutoffs are considered.

AB Citizen soldiers (National Guard and Reserves) represent approximately 40% of the two million armed forces deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. Twenty-five to forty percent of them develop PTSD, clinical depression, sleep disturbances, or suicidal thoughts. Upon returning home, many encounter additional stresses and hurdles to obtaining care: specifically, many civilian communities lack military medical/psychiatric facilities; financial, job, home, and relationship stresses have evolved or have been exacerbated during deployment; uncertainty has increased related to future deployment; there is loss of contact with military peers; and there is reluctance to recognize and acknowledge mental health needs that interfere with treatment entry and adherence. Approximately half of those needing help are not receiving it. To address this constellation of issues, a private public partnership was formed under the auspices of the Welcome Back Veterans Initiative. In Michigan, the Army National Guard teamed with the University of Michigan and Michigan State University to develop innovative peer-to-peer programs for soldiers (Buddy-to-Buddy) and augmented programs for military families. Goals are to improve treatment entry, adherence, clinical outcomes, and to reduce suicides. This manuscript describes training approaches, preliminary results, and explores future national dissemination.

AB Context: Although numerous studies have documented the clear link between psychiatric conditions and suicide, few have allowed for the comparison between the strength of association between different psychiatric diagnoses and suicide.
   Objective: To examine the strength of association between different types of psychiatric diagnoses and the risk of suicide in patients receiving health care services from the Department of Veterans Affairs in fiscal year (FY) 1999.
   Design: This project examined National Death Index data and Veterans Health Administration patient treatment records.
   Setting: Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration.
   Participants: All veterans who used Veterans Health Administration services during FY 1999 (N=3 291 891) who were alive at the start of FY 2000.
   Main Outcome Measures: Psychiatric diagnoses were obtained from patient treatment records in FY 1998 and 1999 and used to predict subsequent death by suicide during the following 7 years in sex-stratified survival analyses controlling for age.
   Results: In the 7 years after FY 1999, 7684 veterans died by suicide. In diagnosis-specific analyses, patients with bipolar disorder had the greatest estimated risk of suicide among men (hazard ratio, 2.98; 95% confidence interval, 2.73-3.25), and patients with substance use disorders had the greatest risk among women (6.62; 4.72-9.29).
   Conclusions: Although all the examined psychiatric diagnoses were associated with elevated risk of suicide in veterans, results indicate that men with bipolar disorder and women with substance use disorders are at particularly elevated risk for suicide.

TI Assessing the Unique Role of Religious Coping in Suicidal Behavior Among

AB In this study we examined relations of positive and negative religious coping with risk for suicidal behavior in a sample of Iraq and/or Afghanistan Veterans. Participants completed self-report instruments assessing risk for suicidal behavior, religious coping, general combat exposure, morally injurious experiences, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Frequency analyses revealed that half of all participants endorsed being religious, and adaptively drawing on religion to cope was more common than maladaptive coping. However, positive religious coping was not associated with suicidal behavior at the time of the study. In contrast, negative religious coping was uniquely associated with the risk for suicide when we controlled for demographic risk factors, war-zone experiences, depression, and PTSD. Although we expect adaptive reliance on religion to be beneficial for mental health, veterans who experience internal and/or external conflicts in the spiritual domain may be at increased risk for engaging in suicidal behavior following their war-zone service.

AB We report on associations of retrospectively reported temporally prior mental disorders and Army career characteristics with subsequent first onset of suicidal behaviors in a large, representative sample of US Army soldiers who participated in the Consolidated All-Army Survey of the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (N=29,982). Results reveal that among men and women, all self-reported lifetime disorders measured (some assessed with screening scales) are associated with subsequent onset of suicide ideation. Among men, three disorders characterized by agitation and impulsiveness (intermittent explosive disorder, panic disorder, and substance disorders) predict the transition from suicide ideation to attempt. For both men and women, being in the Regular Army (vs. National Guard or Army Reserve) predicts suicide attempts in the total sample. For men, a history of deployment and junior rank are predictors of suicide attempts after adjusting for preenlistment disorders but not accounting for pre- and postenlistment disorders, suggesting that postenlistment disorders account for some of the increased suicide risk among these career characteristics. Overall, these results highlight associations between mental disorders and suicidal behaviors, but underscore limitations predicting which people with ideation attempt suicide.

AB ISIS (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) has become a key political and military actor in the Middle East and in North Africa. This essay aims at outlining ISIS warfare through an analysis of its operations in the frame of hybrid warfare theory proposed by Frank Hoffman. Therefore, the paper deals with: the role of terrorist tactics in ISIS warfare and the relationship between terrorism and insurgency; ISIS use of technology, mainly with regard to suicide attacks and to drones; and the relevance of urban warfare. Finally, the paper highlights how ISIS operates and the most threatening features of its warfare.

SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Review
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; RISK; WAR
AB While suicide among recently returned veterans is of great concern, it is a relatively rare occurrence within individual hospitals and clinics. Root cause analysis (RCA) generates a detailed case report that can be used to identify system-based vulnerabilities following an adverse event. Review of a national database of RCA reports may identify common vulnerabilities and assist in the development of more robust prevention strategies. Our objective was to identify and compare common themes among reports of suicide among veterans of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) in the Veterans Affairs system. Common themes among root causes of suicide as identified in RCA reports were collected and compared as the primary outcome systematic vulnerabilities. Actions recommended within the reports were coded as the secondary outcome prevention strategies. Fifty-one RCA reports of OIF/OEF suicides were identified by our search. Coding generated 16 common categories among 132 root causes, and 13 categories among 108 recommended actions. Assessment of suicidal risk, coordination of care, timely access to care, and communication among providers were the most common root causes. Actions identified by RCA teams to reduce suicide included improving referral processes, staff education in suicide assessment, and follow-up with suicidal veterans. Review of multiple RCA reports can identify organizational vulnerabilities detected at the local level that may be applicable system wide. Attention to improving suicide assessment, coordination of care, and timely access may have the largest impact on reducing suicide among OIF/OEF veterans.

AB Background: Although research has identified numerous risk factors for military suicide, the contribution of combat exposure to suicide risk has not been clearly established. Previous studies finding no association of suicidality with combat exposure have employed overgeneral measures of exposure, which do not differentiate among the varieties of combat experiences. This study disaggregated the forms of combat exposure to assess the contribution of combat-related killing to morbid thoughts and suicidal ideation (MTSI) in National Guard troops deployed to Iraq. Methods: We conducted parallel analyses of two related samples: a cross-sectional sample (n = 1,665) having postdeployment interview data only and a longitudinal subsample (n = 922) having pre- and postdeployment data. We used multiple logistic regression to examine the role of killing-related exposures, after controlling for general combat and other suicide risks, and examined interactions between killing and other suicide vulnerability factors. Results: Killing-related exposure approximately doubled the risk of MTSI in the cross-sectional multivariate model (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 1.87; CI = 1.26-2.78) and the longitudinal model (AOR = 2.02; CI = 1.06-3.85), which also controlled for pre-deployment risks. Killing exposures further increased the MTSI risk associated with other suicide vulnerability factors, including depression (AOR = 14.89 for depression and killing vs. AOR = 9.92 for depression alone), alcohol dependence (AOR = 5.63 for alcohol and killing vs. 1.91 for alcohol alone), and readjustment stress (AOR = 4.90 for stress and killing vs. 1.48 for stress alone). General combat exposure had no comparable effects. Conclusions: The findings underscore a need for assessment and treatment protocols that address the psychological effects of killing-related and other potentially "morally injurious" experiences among combat soldiers.

AB The effects of war in Iraq are coupled with the susceptibility to natural hazards, which has exposed the people of Iraq to multiple man-made disasters. Despite the fact that terrorists did not have a hold on any part of Iraq before the US invasion, it is generally believed that Iraq contains many terrorists and terrorist organisations. As a result, violence in Iraq has become normalised, ranging from the Iraqi and US military assaults and sectarian militias, threat of suicide bombings, to violent street crime. Because response activities must operate in a constantly changing environment during a disaster, the response operation is complex and need more controlling efforts. Therefore, it is widely agreed that controlling the response to disaster stemming from war operations and terrorism is often considered a difficult stage within the four disaster response management stages: planning, organising, directing, and controlling.
   This paper is based on an ongoing PhD study. It aims to determine the challenges facing the controlling stage of disaster response management in Iraq with particular reference to war operations and terrorism. This paper adopts a single holistic case study approach, where disaster response management is the unit of analysis. In order to develop a rich and robust data set, a mixed methods approach is utilised based on semi-structured interviews, questionnaire surveys and document analysis. A conceptual content analysis is used to articulate the primary data and this is then analysed in the context of the secondary data. The findings show that disaster response controlling stage faced different challenges such as lack of modern technology and equipment, multiple sources for the decision at the scene, lack of public education, and failure in imposing a proper security cordon.

TI Patterns of Suicide in Kuwait: a retrospective descriptive study from
   2003-2009
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

ID STATES; RATES
AB Background: Prior to the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in 1990, suicides were almost unheard of in Kuwait. However, there has been a notable increase in the referrals of suicide cases to the forensic authorities since then. A review of suicide cases was performed to investigate the demographics of this phenomenon and the suicide modalities used and to uncover issues that can be addressed by the region's government.
   Methods: The sole source of data was the general department of criminal evidence (GDCE), where cases are referred by police authorities and by hospital investigators from the entire country. All cases signed out by forensic investigators as "suicide" during the time period 2003-2009 were retrieved. A full review of the data from the case files was made. This included demographic data, scene examination, radiographic investigations, autopsies with histo-pathological examination findings and toxicological screening results in each case.
   Results: A total of 347 cases were retrieved and studied. Hanging was found to be the most common suicide modality used by subjects (60 %). Non-citizens constituted 87 % of cases, and no significant difference was found between married and single subjects or between Muslims and non-Muslims. Regions that were more populated with an expatriate labour force had the highest suicide prevalence.
   Conclusion: The government of Kuwait needs to investigate the dire conditions in which some expatriates live and to improve their situation. More control over the dispensing of certain medications needs to be enforced. Finally, strict firearm control could help reduce the suicide rates in Kuwait.

AB Background. The US Army suicide rate has increased sharply in recent years. Identifying significant predictors of Army suicides in Army and Department of Defense (DoD) administrative records might help focus prevention efforts and guide intervention content. Previous studies of administrative data, although documenting significant predictors, were based on limited samples and models. A career history perspective is used here to develop more textured models.
   Method. The analysis was carried out as part of the Historical Administrative Data Study (HADS) of the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS). De-identified data were combined across numerous Army and DoD administrative data systems for all Regular Army soldiers on active duty in 2004-2009. Multivariate associations of sociodemographics and Army career variables with suicide were examined in subgroups defined by time in service, rank and deployment history.
   Results. Several novel results were found that could have intervention implications. The most notable of these were significantly elevated suicide rates (69.6-80.0 suicides per 100000 person-years compared with 18.5 suicides per 100000 person-years in the total Army) among enlisted soldiers deployed either during their first year of service or with less than expected (based on time in service) junior enlisted rank; a substantially greater rise in suicide among women than men during deployment; and a protective effect of marriage against suicide only during deployment.
   Conclusions. A career history approach produces several actionable insights missed in less textured analyses of administrative data predictors. Expansion of analyses to a richer set of predictors might help refine understanding of intervention implications.

AB Objective: Despite concerns regarding elevated psychiatric morbidity and suicide among veterans returning from Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF), little is known about the impact of psychiatric conditions on the risk of suicide in these veterans. To inform tailored suicide prevention efforts, it is important to assess interrelationships between OEF/OIF status, psychiatric morbidity, and suicide mortality. This study sought to examine potential associations between OEF/OIF status and suicide mortality among individuals receiving care in the Department of Veterans Affairs health system, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Analyses assessed potential interactions between OEF/OIF status and psychiatric conditions as predictors of suicide. Method: Analyses included data for all individuals who received VHA services during fiscal year (FY) 2007 or FY08 and were alive at the start of FY08 (N = 5,772,282). Results: For this cohort, there were 1,920 suicide deaths in FY08, including 96 among OEF/OIF veterans. Controlling for demographic factors, psychiatric conditions, OEF/OIF status, and the interaction between psychiatric conditions and OEF/OIF status, no main effects of OEF/OIF status were observed. However, a significant interaction was found between psychiatric conditions and OEF/OIF status. Specifically, having a diagnosed mental health condition was associated with a greater risk of suicide among OEF/OIF veterans (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.41; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.57, 7.55; p < .01) than among non-OEF/OIF veterans (HR = 2.48; 95% CI [2.27, 2.71]; p < .01). Conclusion: These findings highlight the importance of mental health screening and intervention for OEF/OIF veterans.

AB Objective: To identify clinical variables associated with suicidality in military personnel with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) while deployed to Iraq. Setting: Outpatient TBI clinic on a US military base in Iraq. Participants: Military personnel (N = 158) referred to an outpatient TBI clinic for a standardized intake evaluation, 135 (85.4%) who had a diagnosis of mTBI and 23 (14.6%) who did not meet criteria for TBI. Main Measures: Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised, Depression subscale of the Behavioral Health Measure-20, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Military Version, Insomnia Severity Index, self-report questionnaire, and clinical interview addressing TBI-related symptoms. Results: Among patients with mTBI, increased suicidality was significantly associated with depression and the interaction of depression with posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Longer duration of loss of consciousness was associated with decreased likelihood for any suicidality. Conclusion: Assessment after TBI in a combat zone may assist providers in identifying those at risk for suicidality and making treatment recommendations for service members with mTBI.

AB Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is frequently associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Suicide is an important cause of death in veterans, and the risk for intentional death continues to be high many years after service. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether there is a relationship between PTSD and suicidal behavior among veterans. We also discussed the risk factors of suicide among war veterans with PTSD. A systematic review was conducted focusing on war-related PTSD and suicidal behavior. A total of 80 articles from peer-reviewed journals were identified, 34 were assessed for eligibility, and 16 were included. Having a history of PTSD is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality and increased the risk for suicidal behavior. The association between PTSD and suicidal behavior was confirmed by the presence of other risk factors and high rates of comorbidity. Current suicidal behavior should be adequately assessed in war veterans.

AB BackgroundDepression among U.S. military personnel has received relatively little empirical attention compared to posttraumatic stress disorder, despite evidence that depression is associated with poor psychosocial outcomes and increased suicide risk. Even less is known about factors that protect against depression in military populations.
   MethodsA sample of 168 active duty Air Force convoy operators completed self-report measures of depression, posttraumatic stress, and sense of belonging before deploying to Iraq, and again at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following their return. Linear growth modeling was used to test the associations of the variables over time.
   ResultsMean depression scores remained low and stable across the deployment and 12-month follow-up period. Increased depression severity was significantly associated with low belonging (P < .001) and with posttraumatic stress symptoms (P < .001) at every time point.
   LimitationsRelatively small, predominantly male sample utilizing self-report methods.

AB ObjectiveA qualitative study among female Veterans from recent conflicts was conducted to explore the women's experiences and potential suicide risk factors according to the Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide, including burdensomeness, failed belongingness, and acquired ability.
   MethodsThe presented paper is an extension of published work by Brenner et al. (2008) regarding mostly male combat Veterans. The methodology employed was qualitative descriptive with hermeneutic hues (Sandelowski, 2000). Interviews were conducted with 19 women, aged 24-52 years, all of whom had been deployed to combat zones in Iraq and/or Afghanistan.
   ResultsTranscripts were reviewed and themes emerged regarding women being a minority within their environment and deployment-related stressors. These experiences seemed to influence participants' views of the world and ways of coping.
   ConclusionsAmong the interviewed female Veterans, preliminary support was provided for Joiner's concepts. Therapeutic strategies for applying themes to clinical practice (e.g., peer support, family therapy, interventions aimed at increasing distress tolerance) are provided.

   UNITED-STATES; ACTIVE-DUTY; SOLDIERS; PREVALENCE; COMBAT; RISK; IRAQ
AB Background: Preliminary evidence suggests military sexual trauma (MST) may be associated with increased risk for suicidal behaviors among active duty military personnel and veterans. Among National Guard personnel, a high-risk subgroup, MST and suicide risk have not received much empirical attention.
   Purpose: To examine the association of MST with suicide ideation and suicide attempts among National Guard personnel.
   Procedures: N = 997 National Guard personnel from Idaho and Utah participated in an anonymous online survey. Weighted analyses were conducted to minimize sampling bias.
   Main findings: 9% of participants had a history of MST (6% of men, 28% of women). Among participants reporting MST, 68% reported a service member perpetrator and 44% reported a civilian perpetrator (12% reported both). A history of MST was associated with significantly increased risk for lifetime suicide attempt. MST remained a significant predictor of lifetime suicide attempt even when restricting the sample to the subgroup with a history of suicidal thoughts (n = 257,27% of full sample). When adjusting for premilitary sexual victimization, MST was no longer significantly associated with lifetime suicide attempts, but premilitary sexual victimization was.
   Conclusions: The rate of MST among National Guard personnel is comparable to rates among active duty military personnel, although the perpetrators of MST are less likely to be service members. MST is a risk factor for suicide attempts, but premilitary sexual victimization is a relatively stronger risk factor. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have shown the importance of robotic technology as a force multiplier and a tool for moving soldiers out of harms way. Situations on the ground make soldiers performing checkpoint operations easy targets for snipers and suicide bombers. Robotics technology reduces risk to soldiers and other personnel at checkpoints. Early user involvement in innovative and aggressive development and acquisition strategies are the key to moving robotic and associated technology into the hands of the user. This paper updates activity associated with rapid development of the Omni-Directional Inspection System (ODIS) robot for under vehicle inspection and reports on our field experience with robotics in Iraq and Afghanistan. In February of 2004, two TARDEC Engineers departed for a mission to Iraq and Afghanistan with ten ODIS Robots. Six robots were deployed in the Green Zone in Baghdad. Two Robots were deployed at Kandahar Army Airfield and two were deployed at Bagram Army Airfield in Afghanistan. The TARDEC Engineers who performed this mission trained the soldiers and provided initial on site Support. They also trained Exponent employees assigned to the Rapid Equipping Force in ODIS repair. We will discuss our initial deployment, lessons learned and future plans.

AB Objective In light of increased suicidal behaviors among military personnel and veterans since the initiation of combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, questions have been raised about the potential causal role of combat. The objective of the current study was to identify any direct or indirect effects of combat exposure on suicide risk through depression symptom severity, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity, thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and fearlessness about death, consistent with the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide (Joiner, 2005). Method Structural equation modeling was utilized with two separate samples of deployed military personnel, 1 nonclinical (n = 348; 89.7% male, mean age = 24.50) and 1 clinical (n = 219; 91.8% male, mean age = 27.88), to test the effects of combat exposure on suicide risk. Results Greater combat exposure was directly associated with fearlessness about death and PTSD symptom severity in both samples, but failed to show either a direct or indirect effect on suicide risk. PTSD symptom severity was strongly associated with depression symptom severity, which in turn was related to suicide risk directly (in the nonclinical sample) or indirectly through low belongingness and perceived burdensomeness (in the clinical sample). Conclusions In both samples of deployed active duty military personnel, combat exposure was either unrelated to suicide risk or was too distally related to have a measurable effect. Results do not support the interpersonal-psychological theory's hypothesis that combat exposure should be indirectly related to suicide risk through acquired fearlessness of death.

AB Suicidal Ideation among Afghanistan/Iraq War Veterans remains a health concern. As young Veterans adjust to civilian life, new risk factors might emerge and manifest differently in this group versus those in the general population. We explored these differences. With 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, we examined differences in risk of past-year suicidal ideation between Veterans of the Afghanistan/Iraq War periods aged 18-34 years (N=328) and age-comparable civilians (N=23,222). We compared groups based on individual and socio-environmental risk factors as well as perceptions of unmet mental healthcare needs. We report adjusted rate ratios (aRRs); interaction terms tested for between-group differences. PY suicidal ideation rates for Veterans and civilians did not differ (52 versus 59 per 1,000, p=0.60) and both groups shared many risk factors. However, drug problems and perceived unmet mental health care needs were vastly stronger risk factors among Veterans versus civilians (interaction terms indicated that the aRRs were 3.8-8.0 times higher for Veterans versus civilians). Other differences were discovered as well. Past-year suicidal ideation rates did not differ by Veteran status among young adults. However, different risk factors per group were detected, which can inform Veteran suicide prevention efforts. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Objective: We describe Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care received by veterans with mental health symptoms in the year prior to suicide to identify opportunities to improve care.
   Method: Death certificate data from 11 states were linked to VA national patient care data for veterans who died by suicide in 2009 and had received VA care. We identified 118 age-, sex-and clinician-matched case-control pairs (suicide decedents and living controls) with mental health symptoms. Using McNemar's chi-square and paired t tests, we compare primary care follow-up received during the year prior to death.
   Results: Cases and controls received similar primary care clinician follow-up and treatment for mental health symptoms. Cases were less likely than controls to fill 90 or more total days of an antidepressant during the year (P=.02), despite no differences in prescription orders from clinicians (P=.05). Cases and controls were equally likely to fill 90 or more consecutive days of an antidepressant (P=.47). Across both groups, 48% (n=113) received assessment for suicidal ideation in primary care.
   Conclusion: We identified two areas to improve primary care for veterans at risk for suicide: monitoring antidepressant treatment adherence and improving suicidal ideation assessment and follow-up for veterans with mental health symptoms. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB National Guard (NG) soldiers returning from deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan were surveyed at 6 and 12 months following their return (N = 970). The overall prevalence of suicide risk at 6 and 12 months following their return was assessed, as were changes in suicide risk among soldiers initially at high or low risk. Factors associated with changes in risk were assessed. The percentage of NG soldiers with high suicide risk increased from 6.8% at 6 months to 9.2% at 12 months (odds ratio = 1.7, p=.02). In the 882 soldiers initially at low risk, 5.9% (52/882) became high risk at 12 months; in the 64 soldiers initially at high risk, 46.9% (30/64) became low risk at 12 months. Initial levels of depressive symptoms were predictive of changing to high risk; this association appeared to be partially explained by soldier reports of increased search in the meaning in life and higher levels of perceived stress. Because suicide risk increases over the first 12 months, continued risk assessments during this time period should be considered. Supporting soldiers to find meaning in their life after deployment and enhancing their capacity to cope with perceived stress may help prevent increases in suicide risk over time.

AB Objective: To examine associations between history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) diagnosis and death by suicide among individuals receiving care within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Method: Individuals who received care between fiscal years 2001 to 2006 were included in analyses. Cox proportional hazards survival models for time to suicide, with time-dependent covariates, were utilized. Covariance sandwich estimators were used to adjust for the clustered nature of the data, with patients nested within VHA facilities. Analyses included all patients with a history of TBI (n = 49 626) plus a 5% random sample of patients without TBI (n = 389 053). Of those with a history of TBI, 105 died by suicide. Models were adjusted for demographic and psychiatric covariates. Results: Veterans with a history of TBI were 1.55 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-1.92) times more likely to die by suicide than those without a history of TBI. Analyses by TBI severity were also conducted, and they suggested that in comparison to those without an injury history, those with (1) concussion/cranial fracture were 1.98 times more likely (95% CI, 1.39-2.82) to die by suicide and (2) cerebral contusion/traumatic intracranial hemorrhage were 1.34 times more likely (95% CI, 1.09-1.64) to die by suicide. This increased risk was not explained by the presence of psychiatric disorders or demographic factors. Conclusions: Among VHA users, those with a diagnosis of TBI were at greater risk for suicide than those without this diagnosis. Further research is indicated to identify evidence-based means of assessment and treatment for those with TBI and suicidal behavior.

AB Three particular tactics of communication of terrorism are examined in this study: social noise, the signature method, and the conduit metaphor. An important theoretical model, social noise refers to the art of being conspicuously or even obnoxiously noticeable through noisy or controversial acts. Examples are Propaganda by the Deed and martyrdom. The signature method refers to a repetitive tactic used by a terrorist group that becomes strongly linked to the operational activities of that group. Modern-day examples are suicide bombings, kidnappings, hijackings, and beheadings. The conduit metaphor refers to the terrorists' exploitation of mass media for conveying their messages.

AB Rates of psychological disorders and suicide have increased dramatically among military personnel since the onset of combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. To date, few studies have identified psychological factors that insulate service members from emotional distress and suicide risk following combat. The current study investigates the protective effects of psychological flexibility on emotional distress and suicidal ideation in 168 active duty Air Force convoy operators. Self -report data were collected before deployment and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postdeployment. Robust generalized estimating equations with repeated measurements indicated that, over time, service members with greater psychological flexibility reported less severe posttraumatic stress (B=-.039, SE=.011, p=.001) and depression (B=-.053, SE=.009, p <.001) than subjects with less psychological flexibility. Greater psychological flexibility was also associated with decreased suicide risk (B=-.035, SE=.010, p <.001), significantly moderating the effects of depression on suicidal ideation over time (B=.115, SE=.044, p=.008). Results suggest that psychological flexibility guards against emotional distress among service members and buffers the effects of depression on suicide risk.

AB We study the differential impacts of combat and humanitarian assistance/disaster relief (HA/DR) missions on the mental health of U.S. Marine Corps members. The deployment experiences of any individual Marine are plausibly random conditional on the observable characteristics which are used to assign Marines into units. Leveraging this exogenous variation, we compare the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicide deaths among Marines who deployed to either Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) or HA/DR missions between 2001 and 2011. We find that the hazard of PTSD is close to eight times higher among Marines returning from OEF/OIF compared to those never deployed, and just 1.33 times higher among those returning from HA/DR (and never participated in OEF/OIF). Those returning from OEF/OIF missions are 1.81 times more likely than those never deployed to die by suicide when they were still active duty, and the hazard increases to almost 3 after they have left the military. In contrast, we find no difference in the hazards of suicide death between those that deployed to only HA/DR missions and non-deployed Marines.

AB Eight years of war and repeated deployments have led to both physical and psychological wounds in the United States Army. This paper will discuss both old and new challenges, including suicide, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI) and pain management. While an array of behavioral health services has long been available to address the troubling effects on our Soldiers and Families, these services are clearly strained. These services include Combat and Operational Stress Control, routine behavioral health care, and suicide prevention. Pre-clinical services, such as Chaplains, Military One Source and Army Community Service also offer support. We have multiple other initiatives to provide outreach, education and training, including "Battlemind," Combat and Operational Stress Control, Warrior Adventure Quest and RESPECT-MIL. There continue to be major challenges that will face our service members, their Families and the United States.

TI 'Blowback' for Britain? Blair, Bush, and the war in Iraq
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID INTELLIGENCE
AB As debate continues over the conduct, the legality and the morality of the war in Iraq, this article addresses how and why Prime Minister Blair decided on the British road to war in Iraq. The article argues that Tony Blair was working within a mindset at both the domestic and international levels that meant he was predisposed to use military force against Iraq and indeed against other perceived threats to the West. His rnindset arose, we will argue, through fear rather than arrogance, through the experiences of the past two decades as much as contemporary events, and this meant that he systematically over-estimated the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. We postulate that Blair was not pressured into invading Iraq by President Bush. Rather, he believed that it was the right path for Britain to take, and that the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was actually the logical outcome of the 'Doctrine of the International Community' outlined in his Chicago speech in 1999. We go on to make the claim that by concentrating on Supporting the United States in its grand strategy, Tony Blair misunderstood the pattern of politics at home and perhaps more seriously of the 'threat' to the domestic security of the United Kingdom. This was not a danger from Iraqi WMD or even from 'foreign' terrorists as had happened on 9/11 but from home-grown suicide bombers, some of whom claimed to be inspired by opposition to Blair's wars. This was the blowback that mattered - and will continue to do so - for the UK.

AB This article focuses on some of the key political communication events of 2003. It examines the government's effort to shape public opinion prior to the invasion of Iraq. It looks at how the media covered the war and the public's viewing habits during this period. The article then focuses on the government's relationship with the news media, looking at the conflict between the government and the BBC over claims that Downing Street had 'sexed-up' the evidence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. It then examines the investigation into the suicide of Dr Kelly, the source of the allegation, by the Hutton Inquiry. It also outlines the changes to government communications implemented in the wake of the Hutton Inquiry. The article concludes by considering the extent to which trust in government communication has been undermined by these events.

ID SUICIDE
AB The moral wound, rendered symbolically in the form of the tiger in Life of Pi, is a complex trauma in which the victim, in order to survive in life-threatening circumstances, commits an ethical transgression against his or her deeply held values. Pi experiences such a trauma and deals with it by dissociating it in the form of the tiger and then has to simultaneously both preserve the tiger and wish it to disappear. Jonathan Shay's work relating the experiences of returning Vietnam veterans to Homer's Odyssey is used to further an understanding of both Life of Pi and American soldiers returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Reasons are considered for the possible delayed effect of trauma as a factor in the increased suicide rate of older veterans. Finally, the concept of the moral wound is discussed, with an eye to its treatment.

AB ObjectiveThis study examined trends and correlates of reported post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among young male Veteran suicide decedents, using data from the National Violent Death Reporting System from 2005-2014 on 1,362 male U.S. Veteran suicide decedents aged 18-34 years.
   MethodsPrevalence of reported PTSD (i.e., diagnosis/symptoms) was determined by mental health diagnostic fields and narratives and examined by year. Demographic, incident, and precipitating circumstance characteristics correlated with reported PTSD were identified.
   ResultsOne-hundred ninety-eight (15%) decedents had PTSD evidence. A 30-fold increase in reported PTSD prevalence occurred among decedents aged 25-34 years; however, no increase was observed among younger decedents. Reported PTSD was associated with past deployments (odds ratio (OR): 14.5, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 9.0-23.4); depression (OR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2-2.6); and divorce (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0-2.7). Recent crisis (OR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.3-0.9) was inversely associated with reported PTSD.
   ConclusionsReported PTSD prevalence substantially increased among Veteran suicide decedents aged 25-34 years suggesting it is beginning to play a larger role in suicide for this group. Few correlated suicide risk factors were found, suggesting that if symptoms of PTSD are present, heightened vigilance by providers for suicide risk might be warranted, irrespective of evidence of other risk factors.

The review is limited to those studies involving combat veterans and military families. This review discusses perplexing issues regarding the impact of combat on the mental health of service members such as risk and resilience factors of mental health, biomarkers of posttraumatic stress syndrome (PTSD), mental health training, psychological screening, psychological debriefing, third location decompression, combat and suicide, the usefulness of psychotherapy and drug therapy for treating PTSD, role of advanced technology, telemedicine and virtual reality, methods to reduce stigma and barriers to care, and best approaches to the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. The mental health research of special populations such as women, National Guardsmen and reservists, and military families is also presented. The review concludes by identifying future areas of research.

Data for this research were secondary analyses of interviews with Islamic martyrs, as well as their leaders' speeches. This investigation into the cultural-psychological explanations for Islamic martyrdom leads to a model explaining a person's decision to carry out the mission as resulting from a combination of four factors: the historical-cultural context, group processes, immediate and anticipated rewards, and mechanisms to eradicate possible doubts and guilt regarding this decision. Compared to existing models, this model is more integrative and focused on the psychological processes involved.

AB We exploit plausibly exogenous variation in overseas deployment assignment to estimate the effect of combat exposure on psychological well-being. Controlling for pre-deployment mental health, we find that active-duty soldiers deployed to combat zones are more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than their counterparts deployed outside the United States in non-combat zones. Among those deployed to combat zones, those deployed to locales where they engage in enemy firefight or witness allied or civilian deaths are at an increased risk for suicidal ideation and PTSD relative to their active-duty counterparts deployed to combat zones without enemy firefight.

AB This paper is divided into two parts. First I argue for the existence of a death-conscious culture in Iran, traceable in religious and literary texts, and manifested strongly in the discourse following the Iran-Iraq war. I then look at how this culture influences articulations and experiences of depression as felt by Iranian patients. Adopting a phenomenological perspective and drawing on empirical data, I show how death-consciousness, as a point of cultural divergence between the UK and Iran, can be used to account for some of the phenomenologically significant cultural variations in the experience of depression. These include attitudes towards suicide, the significance of feelings of hopelessness, and the existence of a sense of absurdity among Iranian patients.

AB ObjectivesVeterans are at particular risk for suicide due to psychopathological, emotional, and interpersonal risk factors. However, the presence of individual-level protective factors, such as self-compassion, may reduce risk, becoming more salient at increasing levels of distress and psychopathology, per theory. We examined the relation between self-compassion and suicide risk, and the moderating effects of depression, PTSD symptoms, anger, shame, and thwarted interpersonal needs.MethodsOur sample of US veterans (n = 541) in our cross-sectional study were mostly male (69.1%) with an average age of 49.90 (SD = 16.78), who completed online self-report measures: Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised, Multidimensional Health Profile-Psychosocial Functioning Screening Tool, PTSD Checklist-Military Version, Differential Emotions Scale-IV, and the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire.ResultsThe linkage between self-compassion and suicidal behavior in our veteran sample was moderated by distress-evoking risk factors, including depression, anger, shame, and thwarted interpersonal needs, such that, as level of risk severity increases, the inverse association between self-compassion and suicidal behavior is strengthened.ConclusionsOur findings highlight an emergent protective process that may prevent suicide in times of distress. Therapeutically bolstering the ability for self-compassion may provide a proactive coping strategy that can be brought to bear in times of crisis, reducing suicide risk for veterans.

AB This study aims to provide evidence for the problem of suicide by self-burning in Iraqi Kurdistan. Data were collected prospectively from all patients admitted to the burn center in the province of Sulaymaniyah and cases of self-burning were compared with cases of accidental burns. There were 197 cases with an annual incidence rate of 8.4 per 100,000 per year and female to male risk ratio of 13.1. Independent risk factors for self-burning were female sex (odds ratio 13.75, 95% CI 6.91-27.36, P < 0.001); young age of 11 to 18 years (OR 3.92, 95% CI 2.20-7.0, P < 0.001); poor education (OR 2.50, 95% CI 1.15-5.45, P = 0.02); spring season (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.3-4.41, P = 0.005); and small family size (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.44-5.15, P = 0.002). Suicide by self-burning is common in Iraqi Kurdistan especially among women. Urgent action is required to provide a better understanding of the situation, and identify partners, capacities, and opportunities for action.

AB Studies of the association between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and suicide attempt have yielded conflicting results. Furthermore, no studies have examined the possible mediating role of common comorbid psychiatric conditions in this association. This study used Veterans Affairs registry data to evaluate the associations between deployment-related TBI, psychiatric diagnoses, and attempted suicide among 273,591 veterans deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn, and who received care from the Department of Veterans Affairs during 2007-2012. We performed Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, adjusting for demographic characteristics. Mediation analyses were conducted to quantify the impact of psychiatric conditions (posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and substance abuse) on this association. The sample was predominantly male (84%); mean age = 28.7 years. Veterans with TBI (16%) were more likely to attempt suicide than those without (0.54% vs. 0.14%): adjusted hazards ratio = 3.76, 95% confidence interval: 3.15, 4.49. This association was attenuated in mediation analyses (adjusted hazards ratio = 1.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.07, 1.46), with 83% of the association of TBI with attempted suicide mediated by co-occurring psychiatric conditions and with posttraumatic stress disorder having the largest impact. These results suggest that veterans with these conditions should be closely monitored for suicidal behavior.

AB The present research investigated wall/object punching as a form of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) among 1,143 veterans seeking treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Wall/object punching was remarkably common in this sample (43%), and its inclusion in the definition of NSSI increased estimated prevalence of recent NSSI by 14%. As expected, wall/object punching was strongly associated with other traditional forms of NSSI, post-NSSI relief, and suicide ideation. Male veterans and veterans with PTSD were significantly more likely to engage in wall/object punching than female veterans and veterans without PTSD. More research on this important but under-recognized form of NSSI is needed.

AB Aggression and suicidality are two serious public health concerns among U.S. veterans that can co-occur and share many overlapping risk factors. The current study aims to elucidate the contribution of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom clusters defined by a five-factor model and alcohol misuse in predicting aggression and suicide attempts among veterans entering residential treatment for PTSD. Participants were 2570 U.S. veterans across 35 Veterans Health Administration sites. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to identify correlates of aggression only (n = 1471; 57.2%), suicide attempts only (n = 41; 1.6%), co-occurring aggression and suicide attempts (n = 202; 7.9%), and neither behavior (n = 856; 33.3%) over the past four months. When compared to veterans endorsing neither behavior, greater PTSD re-experiencing symptoms were related to suicide attempts (odds ratio [OR] = 1.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09-2.30), aggression (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.02-1.26), and co-occurring aggression and suicide (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.13-1.68), and higher PTSD dysphoric arousal symptoms and alcohol misuse symptoms were related to aggression (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.38-1.71; OR = 130, 95% CI = 1.18-1.44, respectively) and co-occurring aggression and suicide (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.35-2.04; OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.28-1.75, respectively). Our findings suggest that assessment of PTSD symptom clusters and alcohol misuse can potentially help to identify veterans who endorse suicide attempts, aggression, or both concurrently. These results have important implications for risk assessment and treatment planning with U.S. veterans seeking care for PTSD. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB IMPORTANCE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is believed to be one factor contributing to rising suicide rates among military personnel and veterans. This study investigated the association of cumulative TBIs with suicide risk in a clinical sample of deployed military personnel referred for a TBI evaluation.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether suicide risk is more frequent and heightened among military personnel with multiple lifetime TBIs than among those with no TBIs or a single TBI.
   DESIGN Patients completed standardized self-report measures of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidal thoughts and behaviors; clinical interview; and physical examination. Group comparisons of symptom scores according to number of lifetime TBIs were made, and generalized regression analyses were used to determine the association of cumulative TBIs with suicide risk.
   PARTICIPANTS Patients included 161 military personnel referred for evaluation and treatment of suspected head injury at a military hospital's TBI clinic in Iraq.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Behavioral Health Measure depression subscale, PTSD Checklist-Military Version, concussion symptoms, and Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised.
   RESULTS Depression, PTSD, and TBI symptom severity significantly increased with the number of TBIs. An increased incidence of lifetime suicidal thoughts or behaviors was associated with the number of TBIs (no TBIs, 0%; single TBI, 6.9%; and multiple TBIs, 21.7%; P = .009), as was suicidal ideation within the past year (0%, 3.4%, and 12.0%, respectively; P = .04). The number of TBIs was associated with greater suicide risk (beta [SE] = .214 [.098]; P = .03) when the effects of depression, PTSD, and TBI symptom severity were controlled for. A significant interaction between depression and cumulative TBIs was also found (beta = .580 [.283]; P = .04).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Suicide risk is higher among military personnel with more lifetime TBIs, even after controlling for clinical symptom severity. Results suggest that multiple TBIs, which are common among military personnel, may contribute to increased risk for suicide.

AB There have been considerable efforts to understand, predict, and reduce suicide among U.S. military veterans. Studies have shown that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depression (MDD), and traumatic brain injury (TBI) increase risk of suicidal behavior in veterans. Limited research has examined anger and social support as factors linked to suicidal ideation, which if demonstrated could lead to new, effective strategies for suicide risk assessment and prevention. Iraq/Afghanistan era veterans (N = 2467) were evaluated in the ongoing Veterans Affairs Mid-Atlantic Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center (MIRECC) multi-site Study of Post-Deployment Mental Health on demographic and psychological variables. Analyses revealed that suicidal ideation in veterans was positively associated with anger and negatively associated with social support. These results remained significant in multivariate logistic regression models controlling for relevant variables including PTSD, MDD, and TBI. Examining interrelationships among these variables, the analyses revealed that the association between PTSD and suicidal ideation was no longer statistically significant once anger was entered in the regression models. Further, it was found that TBI was associated with suicidal ideation in veterans with MDD but not in veterans without MDD. These findings provide preliminary evidence that suicide risk assessment in military veterans should include clinical consideration of the roles of anger and social support in addition to PTSD, MDD, and TBI. Further, the results suggest that suicide prevention may benefit from anger management interventions as well as interventions aimed at bolstering social and family support as treatment adjuncts to lower suicide risk in veterans.

AB Background The United States military has lost more troops to suicide than to combat for the second year in a row and better understanding combat-related risk factors for suicide is critical. We examined the association of killing and suicide among war veterans after accounting for PTSD, depression, and substance use disorders. Methods We utilized a cross-sectional, retrospective, nationally representative sample of Vietnam veterans from the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study (NVVRS). In order to perform a more in depth analysis, we utilized a subsample of these data, the NVVRS Clinical Interview Sample (CIS), which is representative of 1.3 million veterans who were eligible for the clinical interview by virtue of living in proximity to an interview site, located within 28 standard metropolitan regions throughout the United States. Results Veterans who had higher killing experiences had twice the odds of suicidal ideation, compared to those with lower or no killing experiences (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.073.67), even after adjusting for demographic variables, PTSD, depression, substance use disorders, and adjusted combat exposure. PTSD (OR = 3.42, 95% CI = 1.0910.73), depression (OR = 11.49, 95% CI = 2.1262.38), and substance use disorders (OR = 3.98, 95% CI = 1.0115.60) were each associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation. Endorsement of suicide attempts was most strongly associated with PTSD (OR = 5.52, 95% CI = 1.2125.29). Conclusions Killing experiences are not routinely examined when assessing suicide risk. Our findings have important implications for conducting suicide risk assessments in veterans of war. Depression and Anxiety 00:16, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Background: Veterans have a high prevalence of both post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorders (SUDs), which are related to suicide risk. Exploring gender-related differences in suicidal behavior risk among this subgroup of veterans is important to improve prevention and treatment strategies. To date, few studies have explored these differences.
   Methods: The sample included 352,476 men and women veterans from the Women Veterans Cohort Study with a diagnosis of PTSD. First, we conducted analyses to assess gender-related differences in sociodemographic and clinical variables at baseline, as well as by suicidal behavior. Then, we conducted a series of Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate the hazard ratios of engaging in self-directed violence (SDV) and dying by suicide by SUD status and gender, controlling for potential confounders.
   Results: Adjusted analyses showed that, among veterans with PTSD, the presence of a SUD significantly increased the risk of SDV and death by suicide. Women with PTSD had a decreased risk of dying by suicide compared with men. No gender-related difference was observed for SDV. SUD increased the risk of SDV behavior in both women and men but increased the risk of dying by suicide only among men.
   Conclusions: Our findings revealed gender-related differences in SDV and suicide among veterans with a PTSD diagnosis with or without a SUD. Our study, along with the increasing numbers of women serving in the military, stresses the need to conduct gender-based analyses to help improve prevention and treatment strategies.

AB Introduction: The aim of this study was to describe the most recent trends and epidemiologic patterns of fatal injuries resulting from explosions in Iraq, one of the countries most affected by violence from explosive devices.
   Methods: Iraqi Ministry of Health (MoH) routine prospective injury surveillance collects information on all fatal injuries recorded by coroners from physical examinations, police reports, and family members in eight governorates of Iraq: Baghdad, Al-Anbar, Basrah, Erbil, Kerbala, Maysan, Ninevah, and Al-Sulaimaniya. This study analyzed explosive-related fatal injuries that occurred from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2013.
   Results: Analysis included 2,803 fatal injuries. The number of fatal injuries declined from 2010 through 2012, followed by an increase in 2013. One-thousand one-hundred and one explosion-related fatalities were documented in 2013, more than twice as many as in 2012 or in 2011. Most fatalities were among men aged 20-39 years. Of all causalities, 194 (6.9%) were among females and 302 (10.8%) were among children aged less than 18 years. The majority of fatalities were caused by improvised explosive devices (IEDs): car bombs (15.3%), suicide bombs (4.0%), and other IEDs (29.6%). The highest number of fatalities occurred in streets and roads. Of all deaths, 95.6% occurred in three governorates: Baghdad, Ninevah, and Al-Anbar.
   Conclusions: Explosives continue to result in a high number of fatal injuries in Iraq. Following a period of declining violence from explosives, in 2013, fatalities increased. Most explosion-related injuries resulted from IEDs; males aged 20-39 years were at greatest risk.

AB Psychological inflexibility, or how individuals respond to distressing internal experiences, may be a modifiable risk factor for suicide in veterans. It was hypothesized that psychological inflexibility would predict suicidal ideation after accounting for established risk factors at baseline and 1 year later. Post-9/11 veterans (N = 309) completed clinical interview and self-report measures at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Results indicated that psychological inflexibility predicted severity of suicidal ideation at both baseline and 1 year later, after accounting for established risk factors. Psychological inflexibility is an important marker of risk for suicidal ideation, and could be a target for interventions aimed at reducing suicide.

AB Objective: This study described health care contacts at a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center in Oregon in the year before death of veterans who completed suicide. Methods: Oregon Violent Death Reporting System (OVDRS) data and VA administrative data were linked to identify the 112 veterans who completed suicide in Oregon between 2000 and 2005 and who had contact with a single VA medical center in the year before death. Medical records were reviewed to collect data on clinician assessment of suicide risk and reasons for the last contact. Results: In the year before death, 54 veterans (48%) had one or more mental health contacts and 71 (63%) had one or more primary care contacts. The mean age was 57; common diagnoses included mood disorders (38%) and cardiovascular disease (38%). The median number of days between the last contact and date of death was 42 (range=0-358). Thirty-six last contacts (32%) were patient initiated for new or exacerbated medical concerns, and 76 (68%) were follow-ups for ongoing problems. Clinicians noted that 41 patients (37%) were experiencing emotional distress at the last contact. Thirteen of the 18 patients (72%) who were assessed for suicidal ideation at their last contact denied such thoughts. Conclusions: During their last contact, most veterans were seen for routine medical care and few endorsed thoughts of suicide. Results underscore challenges that clinicians face in identifying and caring for veterans at risk of suicide in health care settings. Additional research is indicated to identify better ways to facilitate communication of suicidal thoughts when they are present. (Psychiatric Services 61:1192-1197, 2010)

AB Background: Suicide is a major public health concern in military and civilian contexts. Veteran populations are at increased risk for suicide, especially veterans with mental health disorders such as Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Suicidal ideation (SI) is a primary risk factor for suicide.
   Methods: We investigated changes in SI in a multi-site sample of treatment seeking veterans from three separate Veterans Health Administration (VA) medical centers (n = 289) who received Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy, an evidence-based treatment (EBT) for PTSD. SI and PTSD symptoms were assessed, using self-report instruments, throughout routine clinical care.
   Results: Both PTSD and SI symptoms reduced over the course of treatment (d-type effect sizes of 1.47 and 0.27, respectively). While SI was associated with PTSD symptoms at all time points, appropriately specified, time lagged models indicated that changes in PTSD symptoms were predictive of future declines in SI, while the converse was not true.
   Conclusions: Results indicate that treating PTSD symptoms with an EBT for PTSD can be an effective way to reduce SI, at least partially, and for some patients. These data are significant in light of the resources and programming devoted to addressing SI in the VA relative to available empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of developed strategies. The findings demonstrate the importance of facilitating EBT referrals for specific disorders as a component of broad-based suicide outreach and preventions strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A behavioral health concern for the US military has been suicide, largely due to its increased prevalence in the last several years during US involvement in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), the present study examined relationships among combat exposure, postdeployment stressors, social support, and unit cohesion. Survey data were obtained from 4,567 soldiers who were members of 50 company-sized units. At the individual level, combat exposure and postdeployment stressors were associated with suicidal thoughts. Postdeployment social support was associated with fewer suicidal thoughts. There was no evidence of the stress-buffering effect of social support. At the group level, reduced risk for suicidal thoughts was associated with units having higher than average cohesion. Reduced risk for suicidal thoughts in conjunction with combat experiences was observed in units having higher than average cohesion, though not reaching a traditional level of statistical significance.

AB A connection between suicidality and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been consistently demonstrated; however, the underlying relationship between suicidality and PTSD remains unclear. The aim of this study was to examine patterns of DSM-5 PTSD symptom endorsement that differentiated veteran participants with and without a history of suicide behaviors. We enrolled 95 veterans, 32 of whom reported no suicide ideation (SI) or suicide attempts (SA). The 63 remaining participants reported a history of SI, with 28 of the 63 also reporting a historical SA. Participants completed a standardized diagnostic interview (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR; First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, 2002), structured interview of suicidal behaviors (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale; Posner et al., 2011), and selected clinical measures. Veterans who reported SI and/or SA were more likely to meet criteria for PTSD on DSM-5 than were veterans who reported neither SI nor SA. Participants who reported SA were more likely to meet criteria for clusters C and D. Finally, at the symptom level, those who reported SI were more likely to report experiencing feelings of alienation. Those who reported a SA were more likely to report avoidance of thoughts and feelings, inability to recall an important aspect of their trauma, persistent negative beliefs, diminished interest, and feelings of alienation. These findings suggest that targeting specific symptoms of PTSD may aid in treatment of suicidal thoughts and behaviors associated with PTSD.

AB Awareness is considered the initial step in suicide prevention efforts in the United States and many nations around the world. Yet there is limited research to guide effective approaches to increasing awareness. A recent review by Dumesnil and Verger (2009) provides a helpful overview of international suicide prevention awareness efforts and called for expert consensus on approaches. An edited book by Hornik (2002) is another comprehensive summary of successful public health communication efforts across the world, with examples of efforts that were more or less successful. Using lessons learned from these reviews, this chapter considers some specific targeted campaign efforts in the United States. Included are efforts aimed at federal and state policy-makers; the news media and entertainment media; and two US demographic groups: high school youth and military veterans. It reviews the goals and intended outcomes for these awareness programmes and highlights opportunities for research for these particular target audiences. Safety issues unique to suicide prevention efforts are considered. With these conclusions in mind, the chapter considers some current research challenges: efficient means of assessing awareness needs in target groups; and how to work with cultural values within target groups, using an example that harnesses new media.

AB Background: Armed violence is a major public health and humanitarian problem in Iraq. In this descriptive statistical analysis we aimed to describe for the first time Iraqi civilian deaths caused by perpetrators of armed violence during the first 5 years of the Iraq war: over time; by weapon used; by region (governorate); and by victim demographics.
   Methods and Findings: We analyzed the Iraq Body Count database of 92,614 Iraqi civilian direct deaths from armed violence occurring from March 20, 2003 through March 19, 2008, of which Unknown perpetrators caused 74% of deaths (n = 68,396), Coalition forces 12% (n = 11,516), and Anti-Coalition forces 11% (n = 9,954). We analyzed the subset of 60,481 civilian deaths from 14,196 short-duration events of lethal violence to link individual civilian deaths to events involving perpetrators and their methods. One-third of civilian violent death was from extrajudicial executions by Unknown perpetrators; quadratic regression shows these deaths progressively and disproportionately increased as deaths from other forms of violence increased across Iraq's governorates. The highest average number of civilians killed per event in which a civilian died were in Unknown perpetrator suicide bombings targeting civilians (19 per lethal event) and Coalition aerial bombings (17 per lethal event). In temporal analysis, numbers of civilian deaths from Coalition air attacks, and woman and child deaths from Coalition forces, peaked during the invasion. We applied a Woman and Child "Dirty War Index" (DWI), measuring the proportion of women and children among civilian deaths of known demographic status, to the 22,066 civilian victims identified as men, women, or children to indicate relatively indiscriminate perpetrator effects. DWI findings suggest the most indiscriminate effects on women and children were from Unknown perpetrators using mortar fire (DWI = 79) and nonsuicide vehicle bombs (DWI = 54) and from Coalition air attacks (DWI = 69). Coalition forces had higher Woman and Child DWIs than Anti-Coalition forces, with no evidence of decrease over 2003-2008, for all weapons combined and for small arms gunfire, specifically.
   Conclusions: Most Iraqi civilian violent deaths during 2003-2008 of the Iraq war were inflicted by Unknown perpetrators, primarily through extrajudicial executions that disproportionately increased in regions with greater numbers of violent deaths. Unknown perpetrators using suicide bombs, vehicle bombs, and mortars had highly lethal and indiscriminate effects on the Iraqi civilians they targeted. Deaths caused by Coalition forces of Iraqi civilians, women, and children peaked during the invasion period, with relatively indiscriminate effects from aerial weapons.

AB Background: Suicide is a global public health problem. Recently in the U. S., much attention has been given to preventing suicide and other premature mortality in veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. A strong predictor of suicide is a past suicide attempt, and suicide attempters have multiple physical and mental comorbidities that put them at risk for additional causes of death. We examined mortality among U. S. military veterans after hospitalization for attempted suicide.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted with all military veterans receiving inpatient treatment during 1993-1998 at United States Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities following a suicide attempt. Deaths occurring during 1993-2002, the most recent available year at the time, were identified through VA Beneficiary and Records Locator System data and National Death Index data. Mortality data for the general U. S. adult population were also obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics. Comparisons within the veteran cohort, between genders, and against the U. S. population were conducted with descriptive statistics and standardized mortality ratios. The actuarial method was used estimate the proportion of veterans in the cohort we expect would have survived through 2002 had they experienced the same rate of death that occurred over the study period in the U. S. population having the age and sex characteristics.
   Results: During 1993-1998, 10,163 veterans were treated and discharged at a VA medical center after a suicide attempt (mean age = 44 years; 91% male). There was a high prevalence of diagnosed alcohol disorder or abuse (31.8%), drug dependence or abuse (21.8%), psychoses (21.2%), depression (18.5%), and hypertension (14.2%). A total of 1,836 (18.1%) veterans died during follow up (2,941.4/100,000 person years). The cumulative survival probability after 10 years was 78.0% (95% CI = 72.9, 83.1). Hence the 10-year cumulative mortality risk was 22.0%, which was 3.0 times greater than expected. The leading causes overall were heart disease (20.2%), suicide (13.1%), and unintentional injury (12.7%). Whereas suicide was the ninth leading cause of death in the U. S. population overall (1.8%) during the study period, suicide was the leading and second leading cause among women (25.0%) and men (12.7%) in the cohort, respectively.
   Conclusions: Veterans who have attempted suicide face elevated risks of all-cause mortality with suicide being prominent. This represents an important population for prevention activities.

AB Objective: Conceptual understandings of meaning-making suggest that it may have protective value in regard to alcohol misuse and suicidal behavior. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to examine whether meaning-making attenuated the relationship between alcohol misuse and suicide risk severity in a population of active-duty service members. Methods: The sample (N = 97) was recruited while presenting for emergency behavioral health services in circumstances indicative of high-risk suicidality: endorsing current suicidal ideation with intent to die. Those who reported ideation with a lifetime history of a past suicide attempt were conceptualized as being in a more severe category of suicide risk than ideation without a lifetime history of a past suicide attempt. Participants completed the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised, Meaning in Life Questionnaire, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test consumption questions, and items that assessed demographic variables. Data were analyzed using chi-squared test of independence, Fisher's exact test, Kendall rank correlation coefficient, and logistic regression modeling. Results: Regression analysis identified a statistically significant association between number of drinks consumed daily and reporting a lifetime history of a past suicide attempt, odds ratio (OR) = 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.11, 2.32], p = .01. Number of drinks consumed remained significant even after adjusting for both the search for and presence of meaning, OR = 1.70, 95% CI [1.16, 2.51], p = .01. These results remained unchanged even when adjusting for gender, race, ethnicity, and relationship status. No statistically significant interaction effects were noted between meaning-making and alcohol consumption. Conclusions: Meaning-making did not appear to attenuate the effect of alcohol misuse on suicide risk severity in a sample of service members at high-risk of suicidality. Additional research is needed to better understand the relationship among meaning-making, alcohol misuse, and suicidal behavior.

AB Objective: To examine primary care clinician actions following positive suicide risk assessments administered to Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) veterans.
   Methods: We identified OEF/OIF veterans with positive templated suicide risk assessments administered in primary care settings of three Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers. National VA datasets and manual record review were used to identify and code clinician discussions and actions following positive assessments. Bivariate analyses were used to examine relationships between patient characteristics and discussions of firearms access and alcohol/drug use.
   Results: Primary care clinicians documented awareness of suicide risk assessment results for 157 of 199 (79%) patients with positive assessments. Most patients were assessed for mental health conditions and referred for mental health follow-up. Clinicians documented discussions about firearms access for only 15% of patients. Among patients whose clinicians assessed for substance abuse, 34% received recommendations to reduce alcohol or drug use. Depression diagnoses and suicidal ideation/behavior severity were significantly associated with firearms access discussions, while patient sex, military service branch, and substance abuse diagnoses were significantly associated with recommendations to reduce substance use.
   Conclusion: Greater efforts are needed to understand barriers to clinicians' assessing, documenting and counseling once suicidal ideation is detected, and to develop training programs and systems changes to address these barriers. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB War, for whatever reason, can only mean massive social change. The human casualties of war due to these changes are not restricted to the soldiers who fight the war but the civilians on or near whose soil the war is conducted. The literature appears to associate a war-effect with suicide in various ways e.g. lowered suicide rate during a war but increased suicide using firearms by civilians, increased suicide in the army. However, most western researchers have concentrated on the returning soldiers from Vietnam, the Gulf, Afghanistan or Iraq. The literature suggests that the trauma of war for the soldiers (observing 'buddies' being gunned down/blown up and the trauma associated with modem warfare) is the cause of personality changes/depression and therefore the cause of suicide. By the same token, on the one hand not all returnees from active duty commit suicide and on the other such a trauma induced change due to war will also be prevalent in the civilian population; those, whose loved ones have been blown apart in front of them. In the context of suicide and war there are two main issues to consider. The first is understanding suicide, and the second is the provision of a health care service. Social and economic and environmental changes due to a decision to go to war will clearly cause changes at an individual level. As suggested elsewhere, it would be far too simplistic to associate the cause of change with the act of suicide. That is, out of those who are exposed to change, a small proportion will complete suicide, despite receiving medical help. In this chapter, it is argued that in spite of the large body of literature we are no further forward in understanding suicide. Furthermore, since macro-level changes are purely due to governments' actions it is their responsibility to protect their populations from suicide. But since we have little idea of the dynamics of suicide this responsibility must be focused towards improving the quality of life of those affected by war. It is unreasonable for the Army to promise more of the same suicide prevention programmes time and again given the year on year increase in the suicide rate. Furthermore, it is not sufficient to rely on the over stretched and ill-equipped health services to mop up the aftermath of massive social change due to a policy change or failed policies. Polices that are designed to affect social, political, economic or other changes must have public protection strategies built-in as standard, backed up with a unified database.

AB IMPORTANCE Mental health of soldiers is adversely affected by the death and injury of other unit members, but whether risk of suicide attempt is influenced by previous suicide attempts in a soldier's unit is unknown.
   OBJECTIVE To examine whether a soldier's risk of suicide attempt is influenced by previous suicide attempts in that soldier's unit.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using administrative data from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (STARRS), this study identified person-month records for all active-duty, regular US Army, enlisted soldiers who attempted suicide from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2009 (n = 9650), and an equal-probability sample of control person-months (n = 153 528). Data analysis was performed from August 8, 2016, to April 10, 2017.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Logistic regression analyses examined the number of past-year suicide attempts in a soldier's unit as a predictor of subsequent suicide attempt, controlling for sociodemographic features, service-related characteristics, prior mental health diagnosis, and other unit variables, including suicide-, combat-, and unintentional injury-related unit deaths. The study also examined whether the influence of previous unit suicide attempts varied by military occupational specialty (MOS) and unit size.
   RESULTS Of the final analytic sample of 9512 enlisted soldiers who attempted suicide and 151 526 control person-months, most were male (86.4%), 29 years or younger (68.4%), younger than 21 years when entering the army (62.2%), white (59.8%), high school educated (76.6%), and currently married (54.8%). In adjusted models, soldiers were more likely to attempt suicide if 1 or more suicide attempts occurred in their unit during the past year (odds ratios [ORs], 1.4-2.3; P<.001), with odds increasing as the number of unit attempts increased. The odds of suicide attempt among soldiers in a unit with 5 or more past-year attempts was more than twice that of soldiers in a unit with no previous attempts (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 2.1-2.6). The association of previous unit suicide attempts with subsequent risk was significant whether soldiers had a combat arms MOS or other MOS (ORs, 1.4-2.3; P<.001) and regardless of unit size, with the highest risk among those in smaller units (1-40 soldiers) (ORs, 2.1-5.9; P<.001). The population-attributable risk proportion for 1 or more unit suicide attempts in the past year indicated that, if this risk could be reduced to no unit attempts, 18.2% of attempts would not occur.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Risk of suicide attempt among soldiers increased as the number of past-year suicide attempts within their unit increased for combat arms and other MOSs and for units of any size but particularly for smaller units. Units with a history of suicide attempts may be important targets for preventive interventions.

AB Objectives: To assess the risk of mortality from suicide among male veteran participants in a large population-based health survey.
   Design and setting: A prospective follow-up study in the US. Data were obtained from the US National Health Interview Surveys 1986 - 94 and linked to the Multiple Cause of Death file ( 1986 - 97) through the National Death Index.
   Participants: The sample comprised 320 890 men, aged >= 18 years at baseline. The participants were followed up with respect to mortality for 12 years.
   Results: Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that veterans who were white, those with >= 12 years of education and those with activity limitations ( after adjusting for medical and psychiatric morbidity) were at a greater risk for completing suicide. Veterans were twice as likely ( adjusted hazard ratio 2.04, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.80) to die of suicide compared with non-veterans in the general population. The risk of death from "natural'' causes ( diseases) and the risk of death from "external'' causes did not differ between the veterans and the non-veterans. Interestingly, male veterans who were overweight had a significantly lower risk of completing suicide than those who were of normal weight.
   Conclusions: Veterans in the general US population, whether or not they are affiliated with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), are at an increased risk of suicide. With a projected rise in the incidence of functional impairment and psychiatric morbidity among veterans of the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, clinical and community interventions that are directed towards patients in both VA and non-VA healthcare facilities are needed.

AB Objective: Suicide is a significant public health problem. Suicidal ideation (SI) increases the risk for completed suicide. However, the brain basis of SI is unknown. The objective of this study was to examine the neural correlates of self-monitoring in individuals at risk for suicide. We hypothesized that combat veterans with a history of SI relative to those without such a history would show altered activation in the anterior cingulate cortex and related circuitry during self-monitoring. Methods: Two groups of combat-exposed war veterans (13 men with and 13 men without history of SI) were studied. Both the SI and non-SI participants had two or more of the following: a) current major depressive disorder, b) current posttraumatic stress disorder, and c) history of mild traumatic brain injury, and each subject performed a validated stop task during functional magnetic resonance imaging Error-related activation was compared between the Si and non-SI groups. Results: The SI group demonstrated more error-related activation of the anterior cingulate (8256 mm(3), t = 2.51) and prefrontal cortex (i.e., clusters >2048 mm(3), voxelwise p < .05). The SI and non-SI participants showed similar behavioral task performance (i.e., mean error rate, F values < 0.63, p values > .43; and mean reaction times, F = 0.27, p = .61). Conclusions: These findings suggest neural correlates of altered self-monitoring in individuals with a history of SI and may further suggest that functional magnetic resonance imaging could be used to identify individuals at risk for suicide before they engage in suicidal behavior.

AB Understanding and reducing mortality from suicide among veterans is a national priority, particularly for individuals receiving care from the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA). This report examines suicide rates among VHA patients and compares them with rates in the general population. Suicide mortality was assessed in fiscal year 2001 for patients alive at the start of that fiscal year and with VHA use in fiscal years 2000-2001 (n = 4,692,034). Deaths from suicide were identified by using National Death Index data. General population rates were identified by use of the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System. VHA rates were 43.13/100,000 person-years for men and 10.41/100,000 person-years for women. For male patients, the age-adjusted standardized mortality ratio was 1.66; for females, it was 1.87. Male patients aged 30-79 years had increased risks relative to men in the general population; standardized mortality ratios ranged from 2.56 (ages 30-39 years) to 1.33 (ages 70-79 years). Female patients aged 40-59 years had greater risks than did women in the general population, with standardized mortality ratios of 2.15 (ages 40-49 years) and 2.36 (ages 50-59 years). Findings offer heretofore unavailable comparison points for health systems. Prior to the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq and before recent VHA initiatives, rates were higher among VHA patients than in the general population. Female patients had particularly high relative risks.

AB Reducing mental health stigma and perceived barriers to care is a necessary strategy for addressing the public health problem of suicide among the United States Armed Forces. The purpose of this study was threefold: (a) to empirically evaluate the principal component structure of the Perceived Barriers to Care (PBTC) measure; (b) to gain an understanding of the perceived barriers to seeking mental health services among Marine Corps noncommissioned officers (NCOs) selected to participate in a primary suicide prevention training program, Never Leave a Marine Behind (NLMB); and (c) to explore the relationship among sex, education, prior exposure to suicide within one's military unit, and perceived barriers to seeking mental health services. The data for the PBTC (N = 1,758) were drawn from a previously performed pretest/posttest program evaluation study of the Marine Corp's NLMB program, which took place over 6 months in 2009 (April-October). The three highest perceptions of barriers to care reported by NCOs for their Marines were related to being embarrassed, having members of one's unit have less confidence in the Marine, and concerns about being treated differently by military unit leadership. Three principal components for PBTC were identified, accounting for approximately 59% of the total variance. Higher education and prior exposure to suicide within one's military unit significantly correlated with greater perceived barriers to care; sex was not significantly correlated with greater perceived barriers to care. Implications of these findings, in relation to future research, are further discussed.

AB The siege of Marawi City in 2017 by militants flying the black flag of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) was one of the most significant events in the development of militant Islamism in Southeast Asia. The devastation of the attack, however, was followed by a major breakthrough in the peace process in the Southern Philippines with the formation in early 2019 of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). The consequences of these two major events represent a critical juncture in the conflict in Mindanao in which the pattern of militant Islamism is highly fluid. Surveying the situation in Mindanao post-Marawi siege, this article argues that, in parallel to the decline of ISIS in the Middle East, the conflict in Mindanao is undergoing a transitional phase in which the dominant pattern of militant Islamism is shifting from one of insurgency to clandestine terrorism, characterized by a protean network of small but more ruthless groups. This development is marked by the emergence for the first time ever of suicide bombings in the Philippines. If suicide bombing becomes normalized in the Philippines as the most desperate tactic of a decentralized terrorist network, it will present a formidable new challenge to both the Philippine state and the nascent autonomous government in Muslim Mindanao.

AB Since 2002, hundreds of thousands of United States troops have returned from the Iraq and Afghanistan theaters, many after multiple deployments. The high suicide rate and high prevalence of mood disorders, substance use disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in this population have been widely reported. Many returning soldiers have had difficulty adjusting to civilian life, and some have incurred legal charges. In this article, I review the prevalence and legal implications of combat-related PTSD in this population, including how symptoms of PTSD may be relevant in criminal responsibility determinations in jurisdictions that use a M'Naughten standard or American Law Institute (ALI) Model Penal Code test for criminal responsibility. Finally, an actual case in which a criminal defendant was found to lack criminal responsibility in a M'Naughten jurisdiction because of PTSD symptoms at the time of the alleged offense will be presented.

AB Background: Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were a prominent and initially new threat in the Iraq and Afghanistan war which raised concerns and anticipatory fear in and out of theater. This study examined the association of monthly IED rates with risk of soldier suicide attempt among those deployed and nondeployed. Methods: Person-month records for all active duty Regular Army suicide attempters from 2004 through 2009 (n = 9,791) and an equal-probability sample of control person-months (n = 183,826) were identified. Logistic regression analyses examined soldiers' risk of attempting suicide as a function of monthly IED frequency, controlling for sociodemographics, service-related characteristics, rate of deployment/redeployment, and combat deaths and injuries. The association of IED frequency with suicide attempt was examined overall and by time in service and deployment status. Findings: Soldiers' risk of suicide attempt increased with increasing numbers of IEDs. Suicide attempt was 26% more likely for each 1,000 IED increase in monthly frequency (odds ratio [OR] = 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22-1.30). The association of IED frequency with suicide attempt was greater for soldiers in their first 2 years of service (OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.25-1.36) than for those with 3 or more years of service (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.12-1.24). Among soldiers in their first 2 years of service, the association was constant, regardless of deployment status (chi(2)(2) = 3.89, p = 0.14). Among soldiers with 3 or more years of service, the association was higher for those never deployed (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.01-1.24) and currently deployed (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.05-1.23) than for those previously deployed. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine and demonstrate an association between the aggregate frequency of IEDs and risk of suicide attempts among U.S. Army soldiers. This association was observed across deployment status and time in service, and for early-career soldiers in particular. The findings suggest that the threat of new weapons may increase stress burden among soldiers. Targeting risk perception and perceived preparedness, particularly early in a soldier's career, may improve psychological resilience and reduce suicide risk.

AB Rationale: Limited research has examined how combat veterans experience deaths of comrades to combat or suicide. We sought to investigate the process and identify factors that predict the level of grief among post-9/11 U.S. veterans.
   Methods: Using a mixed-methods study design during 2016-2017, U.S. combat veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts who lost comrades to both combat and suicide (N = 28) participated in semi-structured interviews, and veterans who lost a comrade in combat or to suicide (N = 178) completed online surveys that assessed grief, combat exposure, unit cohesion, anger, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and past diagnoses of PTSD and depression.
   Results: Text analyses of interview transcripts revealed seven themes: 1) Suicide death is unexpected and can make acceptance of loss harder; 2) Combat death is expected and can ease acceptance of loss; 3) Combat death is heroic and can make acceptance of loss easier; 4) Brotherhood forged in combat intensifies the emotional response; 5) Guilt over the inability to prevent a comrade's death makes acceptance harder; 6) Attribution of blame for a death creates anger; and 7) Detachment from the civilian world may make it more difficult to cope with comrades' deaths. Regression analyses of survey data indicated: 1) suicide loss predicted non-acceptance of the loss; 2) mode of death moderated the association between unit cohesion and grief; 3) combat exposure, anger, closeness to the deceased, and having a past diagnosis of depression predicted the level of grief; and 4) combat exposure is a similarly strong predictor of grief and PTSS. Results highlight how veterans' grief further delineates war's toll.
   Conclusion: The mixed-methods design tells a rich story about a previously unexplored consequence of war. These findings have important public health implications because outcomes impact not only veterans but also their families and communities.

AB Aims: Little has been reported on self-harm among the UK Armed Forces, partly due to the difficulties in recording self-harm, within an often-difficult-to-reach population. This study assesses the lifetime prevalence of attempted suicide and self-harm within currently serving and ex-service personnel of the UK Armed Forces.
   Methods: Telephone interviews were conducted with 821 personnel who had previously participated in the King's Centre for Military Health Research military health study. Within the telephone interview, participants were asked about attempted suicide and episodes of self-harm.
   Results: A lifetime prevalence of 5.6% for intentional self-harm (self-harm or attempted suicide) was reported. Intentional self-harm was associated with psychological morbidity (in particular, post-traumatic stress disorder) and adverse experiences in childhood. Ex-service personnel reported lifetime prevalence more than double that of serving personnel (10.5% vs 4.2%, respectively). Participants reporting intentional self-harm were younger (34.4 years vs 39.8 years).
   Conclusion: A lifetime prevalence of 5.6% for attempted suicide and self-harm is higher than previous research has suggested. Younger service personnel, those who have experienced adversity in childhood, those with other psychological morbidity, and ex-service personnel are more likely to report self-harm behaviours.

AB Purpose: To compare rates of external causes of mortality among individuals who served in the military (before and after separation from the military) to the U.S. population.
   Methods: This retrospective cohort study examined all 3.9 million service members who served from 2002 to 2007. External cause mortality data from 2002 to 2009 were used to calculate standardized mortality ratios. Negative binomial regression compared differences in the mortality rates for pre- and post-separation.
   Results: Accident and suicide mortality rates were highest among cohort members under 30 years of age, and most of the accident and suicide rates for these younger individuals exceeded expectation given the U.S. population mortality rates. Military suicide rates began below the expected U.S. rate in 2002 but exceeded the U.S. rate by 2009. Accident, homicide, and undetermined mortality rates remained below the U.S. rates throughout the study period. Mortality rates for all external causes were significantly higher among separated individuals compared with those who did not separate. Mortality rates for individuals after separation from service decreased over time but remained higher than the rates for those who had not separated from service.
   Conclusions: Higher rates of death for all external causes of mortality after separation suggest prevention opportunities. Future research should examine how preseparation characteristics and experiences may predict postseparation adverse outcomes to inform transition programs. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB According to the existing literature self-immolation especially among young married illiterate women occurs with a high rate in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and the Kurdish Regions of Iraq. Looking at the geographical map of the world highlights that these countries are all located within Asia and have common borders with each other. In this article I observe that in the current world we are facing a geographical belt of self-immolation and we should try exploring the social issues/phenomena causing this.

TI Risk and Protective Factors for Suicidal Ideation and Suicide Attempts
   Among Deployed Danish Soldiers From 1990 to 2009
SO MILITARY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID VETERANS; IRAQ
AB Objective: The study was undertaken to identify risk and protective factors for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among deployed Danish soldiers. Research on suicide among Danish veterans has only been conducted to a limited degree. Method: The method applied was a questionnaire survey administered to a population of 1,264 Danish soldiers deployed from 1990 to 2009. The data were analyzed using backward logistic regression modeling in SAS 9.2. Results: In the logistic regression analysis, the following were significant risk factors for suicidal ideation: drug abuse, a poor financial situation before deployment, a heavy workload and/or repatriation during deployment, and attending a poor athletic and recreation program after deployment. Significant protective factors against suicidal ideation were support from friends at home during deployment and appreciation by the general population after deployment. Significant risk factors for suicide attempts were an unhappy childhood and pointless tasks during deployment. No significant protective factors against suicide attempts were identified. Conclusion: On the basis of the results presented in this study, intervention against suicidal behavior would benefit from screening for certain childhood issues, drug abuse, and poor financial situation before deployment. During deployment, measures should be taken to minimize the amount of meaningless tasks and heavy workloads. At the same time, efficient ways of communicating with home should be ensured. After deployment, good athletic and recreation programs should be warranted for all military personnel-including repatriated soldiers. Finally, priority should be given to ensure public appreciation of what deployed soldiers accomplish.

AB IMPORTANCE The rate of suicide attempts in the US Army increased sharply during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Research on this important health outcome has been hampered by the lack of integration among Army administrative data systems.
   OBJECTIVE To identify risk factors for suicide attempts among active-duty members of the regular Army from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2009.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This longitudinal, retrospective cohort study, as part of the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Service members (STARRS), used individual-level person-month records from Army and Department of Defense administrative data systems to examine sociodemographic, service-related, and mental health predictors of medically documented suicide attempts among active-duty regular Army soldiers from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2009. We analyzed data from 9791 suicide attempters and an equal-probability sample of 183 826 control person-months using a discrete-time survival framework. Data analysis was performed from February 3 through November 12, 2014.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Suicide attempts identified using Department of Defense Suicide Event Report records and diagnostic codes E950 through E958 from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. Standardized estimates of suicide attempt risk for sociodemographic, service-related, and mental health predictor variables were constructed from Army personnel and medical records.
   RESULTS Enlisted soldiers accounted for 98.6% of all suicide attempts (9650 attempters; overall rate, 377.0 [95% CI, 369.7-384.7] per 100 000 person-years). In multivariate models, suicide attempts among enlisted soldiers were predicted (data reported as odds ratio [95% CI]) by female sex (2.4 [2.3-2.5]), entering Army service at 25 years or older (1.6 [1.5-1.8]), current age of 29 years or younger (<21 years, 5.6 [5.1-6.2]; 21-24 years, 2.9 [2.6-3.2]; 25-29 years, 1.6 [1.5-1.8]), white race (black, 0.7 [0.6-0.7]; Hispanic, 0.7 [0.7-0.8]; Asian, 0.7 [0.6-0.8]), an educational level of less than high school (2.0 [2.0-2.1]), being in the first 4 years of service (1-2 years, 2.4 [2.2-2.6]; 3-4 years, 1.5 [1.4-1.6]), having never (2.8 [2.6-3.0]) or previously (2.6 [2.4-2.8]) been deployed, and a mental health diagnosis during the previous month (18.2 [17.4-19.1]). Attempts among officers (overall rate, 27.9 per 100 000 person-years) were predicted by female sex (2.8 [2.0-4.1]), entering Army service at 25 years or older (2.0 [1.3-3.1]), current age of 40 years or older (0.5 [0.3-0.8]), and a mental health diagnosis during the previous month (90.2 [59.5-136.7]). Discrete-time hazard models indicated risk among enlisted soldiers was highest in the second month of service (102.7 per 100000 person-months) and declined substantially as length of service increased (mean during the second year of service, 56.0 per 100000 person-years; after 4 years of service, 29.4 per 100000 person-months), whereas risk among officers remained stable (overall mean, 6.1 per 100000 person-months).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our results represent, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive accounting to date of suicide attempts in the Army. The findings reveal unique risk profiles for enlisted soldiers and officers and highlight the importance of research and prevention focused on enlisted soldiers in their first Army tour.

AB BackgroundAlthough the majority of active duty U.S. Army soldiers are full-time personnel in the Active Component (AC), a substantial minority of soldiers on active duty are in the Reserve Components (RCs). These citizen-soldiers (Army National Guard and Army Reserve) represent a force available for rapid activation in times of national need. RC soldiers experience many of the same stressors as AC soldiers as well as stressors that are unique to their intermittent service. Despite the important role of RC soldiers, the vast majority of military mental health research focuses on AC soldiers. One important goal of the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) is to address this gap. Here we examine predictors of suicide attempts among activated RC soldiers.MethodsThis longitudinal, retrospective cohort study used individual-level person-month records from Army and Department of Defense administrative data systems to examine socio-demographic, service-related, and mental health predictors of medically documented suicide attempts among activated RC soldiers during 2004-2009. Data from all 1103 activated RC suicide attempters and an equal-probability sample of 69,867 control person-months were analyzed using a discrete-time survival framework.ResultsEnlisted soldiers comprised 84.3% of activated RC soldiers and accounted for 95.7% of all activated RC suicide attempts (overall rate=108/100,000 person-years, more than four times the rate among officers). Multivariable predictors of enlisted RC suicide attempts included being female, entering Army service at age25, current age<30, non-Hispanic white, less than high school education, currently married, having 1-2years of service, being previously deployed (vs. currently deployed), and history of mental health diagnosis (particularly when documented in the previous month). Predictors among RC officers (overall rate=26/100,000 person-years) included being female and receiving a mental health diagnosis in the previous month. Discrete-time hazard models showed suicide attempt risk among enlisted soldiers was inversely associated with time in service.ConclusionsRisk factors for suicide attempt in the RCs were similar to those previously observed in the AC, highlighting the importance of research and prevention focused on RC enlisted soldiers in the early phases of Army service and those with a recent mental health diagnosis.

TI A Historical Examination of Military Records of US Army Suicide, 1819 to
   2017
SO JAMA NETWORK OPEN

DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES-ARMY; UNION FORCES; PERSONNEL
AB IMPORTANCE Suicide rates among active-duty personnel in the US military have increased substantially since 2004, and numerous studies have attempted to contextualize and better understand this phenomenon. Placing contemporary examinations of suicides among active-duty personnel in the US Army in historical context provides opportunities for joint historical and epidemiological research to inform health care professionals and policy makers.
   OBJECTIVES To consolidate data on suicide rates among active-duty personnel in the US Army as far back as historical records allow and to identify historical trends to separate them from more acute causal factors.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study included all active-duty service members in the US Army from 1819 to 2017 as identified and detailed in US government publications, studies, and journal articles. Empirical data were extracted from US government publications and journal articles published from 1819 to 2017. Data collection and analysis were completed between July and August of 2019.
   EXPOSURE Suicide.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Suicide rates per 100 000 individuals.
   RESULTS Starting in 1843, the overall trend in annual suicide rates among active-duty service members in the US Army increased, with a peak rate of 118.3 per 100 000 in 1883. From that historical high point, the rate decreased in 3 successive waves, each corresponding to the end of the following wars: the Spanish-American War (1898), World War I (1914-1918), and World War II (19391945). The latter had the historically lowest rate of 5 per 100 000 in 1944 to 1945. During the Cold War (approximately 1945-1991), the rate generally stabilized in the low teens to midteens (ie, 10-15 per 100 000). The rate increased again during the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars, increasing to 29.7 per 100 000 in 2012. From 2008 to present, the annual rate has remained within the range of 20.2 to 29.7 per 100 000.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study represents the most extensive historical examination of suicides in the US Army to date. By taking a long-term historical approach to suicide among active-duty personnel in the US Army, this study affords future researchers a new analytical tool and an additional perspective from which to better differentiate long-term and historical trends from more short-term and temporary causal factors.

TI 45 minutes of infamy? Hutton, Blair and the invasion of Iraq
SO PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB In 2002 the Labour government joined the US government in invading Iraq. Central to the justification of war was the continuing refusal of the Iraq government to give up its weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The British government used two dossiers drawn from intelligence sources to explain or 'prove' the grounds for invasion.. both of which were criticised for their provenance. When a BBC journalist claimed some of the contents were deliberately included or exaggerated by political rather than intelligence sources, and then a source of that journalist committed suicide, the ensuing row led to an inquiry by Lord Hutton. The conclusion of the inquiry was that the dossiers' claims were genuine and that the BBC allegations were groundless. Nevertheless continuing concern over the use of intelligence material led to a further inquiry-the Butler inquiry-was much less supportive of the government's role in the preparation and publication of the dossiers but that no one individual or groups of individuals were to named (or blamed) for the dossiers. The findings of both inquiries are not dissimilar to those into other foreign policy actions by earlier governments, and this government's decision to invade. as wen as to continue to defend its decision to do so, should not be seen as surprising in view of what it considers to be in the interests of the state.

AB With the continued operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, studies of the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder and related symptoms are now common. However, lacking is how these symptoms relate to precipitating conditions and the mitigating effects of social support on these symptoms. This is particularly relevant for reserve military personnel, who have been shown to be greater at-risk for postdeployment problems. The present study examined questionnaire data obtained from Army National Guard (ARNG) units immediately after their return from deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan during 2010 (N=4329 soldiers in 50 units). Findings showed few soldiers displayed risk behaviors (i.e., daily alcohol use, use of illicit drugs, suicide thoughts, and physically threatening others) during and after deployment. Those most likely to have more postdeployment risk behaviors were also those who showed more risk behaviors during deployment. A substantial percentage of soldiers reported combat exposure, postdeployment negative emotions, and postdeployment loss of a personal relationship. These reported outcomes were all related to increased risk behaviors after deployment. The buffering effect of social support on postdeployment risk behaviors was equally evident when data were examined individually and when grouped by unit memberships. Implications of findings for future research, practice, and policies are discussed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Service members (SM) are at increased risk of psychiatric conditions, including suicide, yet research indicates SMs believe seeking mental health treatment may negatively impact their military careers, despite a paucity of research examining actual career impacts. This study examined the link between seeking outpatient mental health (MH) treatment and military career impacts within the United States Marine Corps. In Phase 1, a retrospective medical record review of outpatient MH treatment-seeking Marines (N = 38) was conducted. In Phase 2, a sample of outpatient MH treatment-seeking Marines (N = 40) was matched to a non-treatment-seeking sample of Marines (N = 138) to compare career-progression. In Phase 1, there were no significant links between demographic, military, and clinical characteristics and referral source or receipt of career-affecting treatment recommendations. In Phase 2, MH treatment-seeking Marines in outpatient settings were more likely than matched controls to be separated from the military (95.0% versus 63.0%, p = 0.002), but no more likely to experience involuntary separation. MH treatment-seeking Marines were more likely to have documented legal action (45.0% versus 23.9%, p = 0.008) and had a shorter time of military service following the index MH encounter than matched controls (p < 0.001). Clinical, anti-stigma, and suicide prevention policy implications are discussed.

AB Suicide attempt (SA) rates in the U.S. Army increased substantially during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. This study examined associations of family violence (FV) history with SA risk among soldiers. Using administrative data from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS), we identified person-month records of active duty, Regular Army, enlisted soldiers with medically documented SAs from 2004 to 2009 (n = 9650) and a sample of control person-months (n = 153,528). Logistic regression analyses examined associations of FV with SA, adjusting for socio-demographics, service-related characteristics, and prior mental health diagnosis. Odds of SA were higher in soldiers with a FV history and increased as the number of FV events increased. Soldiers experiencing past-month FV were almost five times as likely to attempt suicide as those with no FV history. Odds of SA were elevated for both perpetrators and those who were exclusively victims. Male perpetrators had higher odds of SA than male victims, whereas female perpetrators and female victims did not differ in SA risk. A discrete-time hazard function indicated that SA risk was highest in the initial months following the first FV event. FV is an important consideration in understanding risk of SA among soldiers.

AB Background Potential protective effects of nonpharmacological treatments (NPT) against long-term pain-related adverse outcomes have not been examined. Objective To compare active duty U.S. Army service members with chronic pain who did/did not receive NPT in the Military Health System (MHS) and describe the association between receiving NPT and adverse outcomes after transitioning to the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Design and Participants A longitudinal cohort study of active duty Army service members whose MHS healthcare records indicated presence of chronic pain after an index deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan in the years 2008-2014 (N = 142,539). Propensity score-weighted multivariable Cox proportional hazard models tested for differences in adverse outcomes between the NPT group and No-NPT group. Exposures NPT received in the MHS included acupuncture/dry needling, biofeedback, chiropractic care, massage, exercise therapy, cold laser therapy, osteopathic spinal manipulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and other electrical manipulation, ultrasonography, superficial heat treatment, traction, and lumbar supports. Main Measures Primary outcomes were propensity score-weighted proportional hazards for the following adverse outcomes: (a) diagnoses of alcohol and/or drug disorders; (b) poisoning with opioids, related narcotics, barbiturates, or sedatives; (c) suicide ideation; and (d) self-inflicted injuries including suicide attempts. Outcomes were determined based on ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnoses recorded in VHA healthcare records from the start of utilization until fiscal year 2018. Key Results The propensity score-weighted proportional hazards for the NPT group compared to the No-NPT group were 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.94, P < 0.001) for alcohol and/or drug use disorders; 0.65 (95% CI 0.51-0.83, P < 0.001) for accidental poisoning with opioids, related narcotics, barbiturates, or sedatives; 0.88 (95% CI 0.84-0.91, P < 0.001) for suicide ideation; and 0.83 (95% CI 0.77-0.90, P < 0.001) for self-inflicted injuries including suicide attempts. Conclusions NPT provided in the MHS to service members with chronic pain may reduce risk of long-term adverse outcomes.

AB Combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have resulted in up to 8.8% of combat-related casualties suffering burns. From World War I through Desert Storm, burns have been associated with approximately 4% of the combat-related deaths. Experiencing a blast injury and exposure to killing and death while deployed has been shown to increase suicide risk. Although several studies of military populations have investigated risk factors for death among burn patients during the acute phase, no studies have reported mortality rates, cause-of-death, or the prevalence of suicide after hospital discharge. This study examined the case fatality rate, causes of death, and the prevalence of suicide among 830 combat burn patients discharged from the sole burn center in the U.S. Department of Defense, between March 7, 2003 and March 6, 2013. Cause-of-death was determined through the Armed Forces Medical Examiner's Office and the Office of the Secretary of Defense's National Death Index. A total of 11 deaths occurred among the 830 burn survivors, for an overall case fatality rate of 1.3%. Of the 11 who died, five deaths were related to accidental poisoning by exposure to drugs; three were related to operations of war (two after returning to the war zone), and the remaining three died from other accidental causes (one explosion and two vehicle crashes). There was no indication of suicide or suspicion of suicide as a cause-of-death for the former patients included in this study, suggesting that combat burn injury did not appear to increase the risk of death by suicide in our study population. Further research is needed to understand the factors that contribute to the apparent resilience of combat burn survivors.

AB The suicide of David welly in the UK following revelations by the BBC of questionable treatment by the government with regard to information on Iraq and the killing of Pim Fortuyn in the Netherlands, after intensive TV election coverage was criticized for 'demonizing' the populist politician, have resulted in comparable public outcries and political indignation. Both cases led to a crisis in trust and in similar demands for new arrangements visa vis the responsibility and accountability of public broadcasting. The actual outcomes, however, differ considerably: a strong (self) regulatory reaction in the UK and a limited government response in the Netherlands.

AB Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may be defined as any extracranial mechanical force to the brain that results in any period of loss of consciousness, any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the event, or any alteration in mental status at the time of the event. The major causes are automobile accidents, falls, sporting injuries, and assaults. Many soldiers returning from combat in Afghanistan and Iraq have also experienced TBI. This article provides an overview of the neuropsychiatric complications of TBI, including impairment of consciousness, posttraumatic amnesia, cognitive disorders and dementia, posttraumatic epilepsy, aphasia, depression, mania, psychosis, anxiety disorders, personality changes, aggression, behavioral dyscontrol, fatigue/apathy, and increased risk of suicide. Discussion will focus primarily on issues affecting mental health clinicians. Because mental health providers are more involved in care of chronic issues related to TBI, these issues will be discussed in more detail, although acute neuropsychiatric complications of TBI will be briefly explained.

   OUTCOMES; IRAQ
AB IMPORTANCE Accessible and cost-effective interventions for suicidality are needed to address high rates of suicidal behavior among military service members. Caring Contacts are brief periodic messages that express unconditional care and concern and have been previously shown to prevent suicide deaths, attempts, ideation, and hospitalizations.
   OBJECTIVE To test the effectiveness of augmenting standard military health care with Caring Contacts delivered via text message to reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors over 12 months.
   DESIGN. SETTING. AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial was conducted at 3 military installations in the southern and western United States. Soldiers and Marines identified as being at risk of suicide were recruited between April 2013 and September 2016. The final follow-up was in September 2017.
   INTERVENTIONS Both groups received standard care, and the Caring Contacts group also received consisted of 11 text messages delivered on day 1, at week 1, at months 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, and on participants' birthdays.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were current suicidal ideation and suicide risk incidents (hospitalization or medical evacuation). Secondary outcomes were worst-point suicidal ideation, emergency department visits, and suicide attempts. Suicidal ideation was measured by the Scale for Suicide Ideation, suicide risk incidents, and emergency department visits by the Treatment History Interview; attempted suicide was measured by the Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Count.
   RESULTS Among 658 randomized participants (329 randomizely assigned to each group), data were analyzed for 657 individuals (mean [SD] age, 25.2 [6]] years; 539 men [82.0%]). All participants reported suicidal ideation at baseline, and 291(44.3%) had previously attempted suicide. Of the 657 participants, 461(70.2%) were assessed at 12 months. Primary outcomes were nonsignificant. There was no significant effect on likelihood or severity of current suicidal ideation or likelihood of a suicide risk incident; there was also no effect on emergency department visits. However, participants who received Caring Contacts (172 of 216 participants [79.6%]) had lower odds than those receiving standard care alone (179 of 204 participants [87.7%]) of experiencing any suicidal ideation between baseline and follow-up (odds ratio, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.33-0.95]; P =.03) and fewer had attempted suicide since baseline (21 of 233 [9.0%] in the group receiving Caring Contacts vs 34 of 228 [14.9%] in the standard-care group; odds ratio, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.29-0.92]; P =.03).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This trial provides inconsistent results on the effectiveness of caring text messages between primary and secondary outcomes, but this inexpensive and scalable intervention offers promise for preventing suicide attempts and ideation in military personnel. Additional research is needed.

AB Objective This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of cognitive processing therapy (CPT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when administered on a daily basis during a 2-week period of time. Method In an open-label, prospective cohort pilot trial, 20 U.S. military personnel and veterans diagnosed with PTSD or subthreshold PTSD participated in 12 daily sessions of CPT. Primary outcomes included Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 scores. Secondary outcomes included Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSSI) scores. Interviews and self-report scales were completed at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 6 months after the treatment. Results Relative to baseline, PTSD symptom severity and rates of PTSD diagnosis were significantly reduced at posttreatment and 6-month follow-up. Depression symptom severity did not significantly improve, but suicide ideation significantly decreased at 6-month follow-up. Conclusions Daily administration of CPT is associated with significant reductions in PTSD and suicide ideation.

AB Field combat stress clinics and research have identified the signature event that precedes thoughts of suicide and homicide in combat soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan: a distressing personal relationship event with a stateside partner. In response to this alarming information, we have identified critical factors and precipitating incidents as well as critical social skills that form the basis for changing communication between soldiers and their stateside partners. A pilot program is described that proved effective with small groups of soldiers who were led by a male female professional team and given structured reading and social skills training exercises based on Gottman and Silver's (1999) book The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work. Recommendations for future training are made based upon our assessment or the family issues facing the combat soldier in Iraq and Afghanistan. In conclusion, we describe the family fitness interventions and program elements of the skill building trainings within the family component of the Comprehensive Soldier Fitness program, which can be delivered via online interactive technology as well as face to face with families.

AB This exploratory netnographic study is among the first to investigate military video blogs (milvlogs) posted by Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who self-published stories on military-related trauma to YouTube. Studies have shown that self-published milvlogs provide benefits such as education, social support, and self-management of chronic physical and psychological illness. The aim of this study was to explore combat veterans' milvlogs and to determine themes that emerged across the videos. We transcribed and analyzed content from 17 milvlogs. Our analysis yielded seven themes: motivation, loss, managing symptoms, help-seeking, guilt and shame, suicide, and connecting to other veterans. We concluded that veterans were initially drawn to vlogging to connect to others. Vlogging also served as a medium for combat veterans to tell their stories, position these stories against others' experiences, and engage in outreach and advocacy. Finally, milvlogs may provide an easily accessible resource for developing preventive and/or mental health treatment/support links.

AB The basic structure of contemporary military biopolitics, in which military bodies and minds are kept alive and allowed to die, entails both an institutional problem of how to shore up life that is exposed to harm and a cultural problem of how to reckon with a routinized trade in life and death that happens not incidentally, but on purpose. Amidst this tension, the military psyche becomes both an inhabited, embodied site and an imaginative point of reference for the question of how to feel about war. This article takes stock of the contemporary landscape of war-related mental affliction via three relatively novel interventions: military suicide prevention, the framing post-traumatic stress as "moral injury," and resiliency training meant to inoculate soldiers against the stress of the battlefield. Drawing on a range of clinical and media sources and ethnographic research with post-9/11 military personnel, I show how each of these efforts constructs specific forms of war-related psychic destruction as objects of public and institutional concern, normalizes the institutional arrangements that produce it, and informs public perceptions of what war is by constructing figures of what it does to those who fight it.

AB War causes trauma that can undo a warrior's character. Sophocles' Ajax is a good example of a traumatized warrior and some Afghanistan and Iraq veterans see striking parallels between contemporary conflicts and the Trojan War. With the United States increasingly facing asymmetrical enemies, there are now many traumatized soldiers and vets, not only suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but also committing suicide. Combat stress, being central to warfare, has until now been incurable. Today, advanced military R&D projects aim to find a magic pill to forestall PTSD. Propranolol may be such a drug, as it could be used to prevent PTSD by erasing emotional memories. However, this attempt at pharmacoprevention raises many ethical questions. Most importantly, it threatens to instrumentalize away the existential element of war and to push warfare into a posthuman age. To better understand the challenges we are facing today, it is important not only to read Aldous Huxley's Brave New World but also to go back to the Greeks.

AB Individuals who carry bombs on their bodies and detonate those bombs in public places are a security problem. There is belief that suicide bombings currently used in the mid-east may spread to the United States if the organized terrorist groups operating in the United States are not identified and the cell members arrested. While bombs in vehicles are the primary method currently used to spread terror in Iraq, U. S. warfighters are starting to face suicide bombers. This may become more of the situation if a stand-off detection capability is developed for the vehicle bomb case.
   This paper presents a concept, that if developed and commercialized, could provide an inexpensive suicide bomber screening system that could be used to screen individuals approaching a checkpoint while the individual is still 500 to 1,000 feet from the checkpoint. The proposed system measures both the radar cross-section of the individual and the radar derived gait characteristics that are associated with individuals carrying a bomb on their body.
   GTRI researchers propose to use human gait characteristics, as detected by radar, to determine if a human subject who is carrying no visible load on the body is actually carrying a concealed load under their clothes. The use of radar gait as a metric for the detection (as opposed to a video system) of a suicide bomber is being proposed because detection of gait characteristics are thought to be less sensitive to where the bomb is located on the body, lighting conditions, and the fact that the legs may be shrouded in a robe. The detection of a bomb using radar gait analysis may also prove to be less sensitive to changing tactics regarding where the bomb is placed on the body.
   An inert suicide bomb vest was constructed using water pipes to simulate the explosive devices. Wiring was added to simulated detonators. The vest weighs approximately 35 pounds. Radar data was taken on the volunteer subject wearing the vest that simulated the suicide bomb. This paper discusses the findings after the data was analyzed. A Provisional Patent has been filed by Georgia Tech Research Corporation on the subject matter that is discussed in this paper.

AB Since September 11, 2001, 2.4 million military personnel have deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. To date, roughly 1.44 million have separated from the military and approximately 772,000 of these veterans have used VA health care. Combat deployments impact the physical, psychological, and social health of veterans. Given that many veterans are receiving care from non-VA providers, it is important that all community health care workers be familiar with the unique health care needs of this patient population, which include injuries associated with blast exposures (including mild traumatic brain injury), as well as a variety of mental health conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Other important health concerns are chronic musculoskeletal pain, medically unexplained symptoms, sequelae of environmental exposures, depression, suicide, substance abuse, sleep disturbances, and impairments in family, occupational and social functioning. Elevated rates of hypertension and tobacco use remind us that deployment may result not only in immediate impacts on health, but also increase risk for chronic disease, contributing to a growing public health burden. This paper provides a comprehensive review of these health concerns and offers practical management guidelines for primary care providers. In light of relationships between physical, psychological and psychosocial concerns in this population, we recommend an interdisciplinary approach to care directed toward mitigating the long-term health impacts of combat.

AB Background: The insurgency tactics that characterize modern warfare, such as suicide car bombs and roadside bombs, have the potential to significantly impact road traffic injuries in conflict affected-countries. As road traffic incidents are one of the top ten causes of death in Iraq, changes in incidence have important implications for the health system. We aimed to describe patterns of road traffic fatalities for all demographic groups and types of road users in Iraq during a period characterized by a resurgence in insurgency activity.
   Methods: Iraqi Ministry of Health routine prospective injury surveillance collects information on all fatal injuries in eight governorates of Iraq: Baghdad, Al-Anbar, Basrah, Erbil, Kerbala, Maysan, Ninevah, and Al-Sulaimaniya. From all injury fatalities documented at the coroner office, we analyzed only those attributed to road traffic that occurred between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2013. Coroners ascertain information from physical examinations, police reports and family members.
   Results: Analysis included 7,976 road traffic fatalities. Overall, 6,238 (78.2 %) fatalities were male and 2,272 (28.5 %) were children under 18 years of age. The highest numbers of road traffic fatalities were among males 15 to 34 years of age and children of both sexes under 5 years of age. 49.2 % of fatalities occurred among pedestrians. Among children and females, the majority of road traffic fatalities were pedestrians, 69.0 % and 56.6 %, respectively. Fatalities among motorcyclists (3.7 %) and bicyclists (0.4 %) were least common. Rates of road traffic fatalities ranged from 8.6 to 10.7 per 100,000 population.
   Conclusions: The injury surveillance system provides the first data from a conflict-affected country on road traffic fatalities disaggregated by type of road user. The highest numbers of fatalities were among children and young men. Nearly half of fatalities were pedestrians, a proportion nearly double that of any neighboring country. As insurgency activity increased in 2013, the number of road traffic fatalities declined.

AB Importance/Objective: Although the suicide rate in the U.S. Army has traditionally been below age-gender matched civilian rates, it has climbed steadily since the beginning of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts and since 2008 has exceeded the demographically matched civilian rate. The Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) is a multicomponent epidemiological and neurobiological study designed to generate actionable evidence-based recommendations to reduce Army suicides and increase knowledge about risk and resilience factors for suicidality and its psychopathological correlates. This paper presents an overview of the Army STARRS component study designs and of recent findings.
   Design/Setting/Participants/Intervention: Army STARRS includes six main component studies: (1) the Historical Administrative Data Study (HADS) of Army and Department of Defense (DoD) administrative data systems (including records of suicidal behaviors) for all soldiers on active duty 2004-2009 aimed at finding administrative record predictors of suicides; (2) retrospective case-control studies of fatal and nonfatal suicidal behaviors (each planned to have n = 150 cases and n = 300 controls); (3) a study of new soldiers (n = 50,765 completed surveys) assessed just before beginning basic combat training (BCT) with self-administered questionnaires (SAQ), neurocognitive tests, and blood samples; (4) a cross-sectional study of approximately 35,000 (completed SAQs) soldiers representative of all other (i.e., exclusive of BCT) active duty soldiers; (5) a pre-post deployment study (with blood samples) of soldiers in brigade combat teams about to deploy to Afghanistan (n = 9,421 completed baseline surveys), with sub-samples assessed again one, three, and nine months after returning from deployment; and (6) a pilot study to follow-up SAQ respondents transitioning to civilian life. Army/DoD administrative data are being linked prospectively to the large-scale survey samples to examine predictors of subsequent suicidality and related mental health outcomes.
   Main outcome measures: Measures (self-report and administratively recorded) of suicidal behaviors and their psychopathological correlates.
   Results: Component study cooperation rates are comparatively high. Sample biases are relatively small. Inefficiencies introduced into parameter estimates by using nonresponse adjustment weights and time-space clustering are small. Initial findings show that the suicide death rate, which rose over 2004-2009, increased for those deployed, those never deployed, and those previously deployed. Analyses of administrative records show that those deployed or previously deployed were at greater suicide risk. Receiving a waiver to enter the Army was not associated with increased risk. However, being demoted in the past two years was associated with increased risk. Time in current deployment, length of time since return from most recent deployment, total number of deployments, and time interval between most recent deployments (known as dwell time) were not associated with suicide risk. Initial analyses of survey data show that 13.9% of currently active non-deployed regular Army soldiers considered suicide at some point in their lifetime, while 5.3% had made a suicide plan, and 2.4% had attempted suicide. Importantly, 47-60% of these outcomes first occurred prior to enlistment. Prior mental disorders, in particular major depression and intermittent explosive disorder, were the strongest predictors of these self-reported suicidal behaviors. Most onsets of plans-attempts among ideators (58.3-63.3%) occurred within the year of onset of ideation. About 25.1% of non-deployed U.S. Army personnel met 30-day criteria for a DSM-IV anxiety, mood, disruptive behavior, or substance disorder (15.0% an internalizing disorder; 18.4% an externalizing disorder) and 11.1% for multiple disorders. Importantly, three-fourths of these disorders had pre-enlistment onsets.
   Conclusions: Integration across component studies creates strengths going well beyond those in conventional applications of the same individual study designs. These design features create a strong methodological foundation from which Army STARRS can pursue its substantive research goals. The early findings reported here illustrate the importance of the study and its approach as a model of studying rare events particularly of national security concern. Continuing analyses of the data will inform suicide prevention for the U.S. Army.

AB This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and determinants of mental disorders (MDs) among elderly people residing in nursing homes (NHs) and those living with their families (WF) in Baghdad, Iraq, 2017. A cross-sectional study was conducted on all elderly individuals residing in all NHs in Baghdad and an equal number of elderly people residing WF. MDs were defined based on Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). We used relevant World Health Organization-accredited tools to identify the types of MDs. The prevalence of MDs among elderly people was 38.7%, being statistically significantly (P < .01) higher among those in NH (55.8%) compared with those living WF (21.5%). The proportion of types of MDs among NH versus WF residents was as follows: depression (35.4% vs 16.6%), anxiety (32.6% vs 9.9%), dementia (19.3% vs 5%), and suicide thoughts (25.4% vs 4.4%). The multivariate analysis showed many factors that were associated with MD. Low income, dependency on others, and being neglected were stronger determinant of MD among elderly people living WF. However, chronic joint pain, visual impairment, auditory impairment, and economic status deterioration were stronger determinant among those in NHs. The prevalence of MDs in the NH is more than double the prevalence in the community. We recommended enhancing elderly mental health care services including curative, preventive, and promotive activities.

AB The present study conducted an exploratory examination of the relationship between self-reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and an expanded definition of risk-taking behaviors among 395 veterans at a large Midwestern Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms were associated with elevated rates of substance use, thrill seeking, aggression, risky sexual practices, and firearm possession. Results indicated that suicidal ideation and aggressive driving behavior were among the most frequently reported. The present findings hold significant public health implications and highlight the need to attend to risk-taking behaviors in treatment planning.

AB This review summarizes the epidemiology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related mental health problems among persons who served in the armed forces during the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, as reflected in the literature published between 2009 and 2014. One-hundred and sixteen research studies are reviewed, most of which are among non-treatment-seeking US service members or treatment-seeking US veterans. Evidence is provided for demographic, military, and deployment-related risk factors for PTSD, though most derive from cross-sectional studies and few control for combat exposure, which is a primary risk factor for mental health problems in this cohort. Evidence is also provided linking PTSD with outcomes in the following domains: physical health, suicide, housing and homelessness, employment and economic well-being, social well-being, and aggression, violence, and criminality. Also included is evidence about the prevalence of mental health service use in this cohort. In many instances, the current suite of studies replicates findings observed in civilian samples, but new findings emerge of relevance to both military and civilian populations, such as the link between PTSD and suicide. Future research should make effort to control for combat exposure and use longitudinal study designs; promising areas for investigation are in non-treatment-seeking samples of US veterans and the role of social support in preventing or mitigating mental health problems in this group.

AB IMPORTANCE Suicide attempts in the US Army have risen in the past decade. Understanding the association between suicide attempts and deployment, as well as method and timing of suicide attempts, can assist in developing interventions.
   OBJECTIVE To examine suicide attempt risk factors, methods, and timing among soldiers currently deployed, previously deployed, and never deployed at the time this study was conducted.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This longitudinal, retrospective cohort study of Regular Army-enlisted soldiers on active duty from 2004 through 2009 used individual-level person-month records to examine risk factors (sociodemographic, service related, and mental health), method, and time of suicide attempt by deployment status (never, currently, and previously deployed). Administrative data for the month before each of 9650 incident suicide attempts and an equal-probability sample of 153 528 control person-months for other soldiers were analyzed using a discrete-time survival framework.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Suicide attempts and career, mental health, and demographic predictors were obtained from administrative and medical records.
   RESULTS Of the 9650 enlisted soldiers who attempted suicide, 86.3% were male, 68.4% were younger than 30 years, 59.8% were non-Hispanic white, 76.5% were high school educated, and 54.7% were currently married. The 40.4% of enlisted soldiers who had never been deployed (n = 12 421 294 person-months) accounted for 61.1% of enlisted soldiers who attempted suicide (n = 5894 cases). Risk among those never deployed was highest in the second month of service (103 per 100 000 person-months). Risk among soldiers on their first deployment was highest in the sixth month of deployment (25 per 100 000 person-months). For those previously deployed, risk was highest at 5 months after return (40 per 100 000 person-months). Currently and previously deployed soldiers were more likely to attempt suicide with a firearm than those never deployed (currently deployed: OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 2.9-5.6; previously deployed: OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.8-3.9). Across deployment status, suicide attempts were more likely among soldiers who were women (currently deployed: OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 3.0-4.0; previously deployed: OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.4-1.7; and never deployed: OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 2.3-2.6), in their first 2 years of service (currently deployed: OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5-2.3; previously deployed: OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.9-2.7; and never deployed: OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.7-3.6), and had a recently received a mental health diagnosis in the previous month (currently deployed: OR, 29.8; 95% CI, 25.0-35.5; previously deployed: OR, 22.2; 95% CI, 20.1-24.4; and never deployed: OR, 15.0; 95% CI, 14.2-16.0). Among soldiers with 1 previous deployment, odds of a suicide attempt were higher for those who screened positive for depression or posttraumatic stress disorder after return from deployment and particularly at follow-up screening, about 4 to 6 months after deployment (depression: OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9; posttraumatic stress disorder: OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 2.1-2.8).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Identifying the timing and risk factors for suicide attempt in soldiers requires consideration of environmental context, individual characteristics, and mental health. These factors can inform prevention efforts.

AB Objectives. Military members are required to complete the Post-Deployment Health Assessment on return from deployment and the Post-Deployment Health Reassessment (PHDRA) 90 to 180 days later, and we assessed the PDHRA's sensitivity and specificity in identifying posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression after a military deployment among US Air Force personnel.
   Methods. We computed the PDHRA's sensitivity and specificity for depression and PTSD and developed a structural model to suggest possible improvements to it.
   Results. For depression, sensitivity and specificity were 0.704 and 0.651, respectively; for PTSD, they were 0.774 and 0.650, respectively. Several variables produced significant direct effects on depression and trauma, suggesting that modifications could increase its sensitivity and specificity.
   Conclusions. The PDHRA was moderately effective in identifying airmen with depression and PTSD. It identified behavioral health concerns in many airmen who did not develop a diagnostic mental health condition. Its low level of specificity may result in reduced barriers to care and increased support services, key components of a public health approach to suicide prevention, for airmen experiencing subacute levels of distress after deployment, which may, in part, account for lower suicide rates among airmen after deployment.

AB In 2015, suicide accounted for over 44,000 deaths and was the 10th leading cause of mortality in the US. Although Veterans, in general, are at a high risk for suicide, Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are at even greater risk. While evidence suggests that PTSD symptoms are reduced by Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), little is known about how this treatment impacts changes in suicidal ideation across residential treatment. Studies with active duty personnel have found reductions in suicidal ideation following CPT treatment; however, only one study to date has examined this question in a Veteran sample. The current study examined (a) changes in suicidal ideation across a residential CPT treatment program and (b) the influence of demographic variables on change in suicidal ideation across treatment. Participants (N = 303) were admitted to a residential PTSD treatment in a VA medical center and completed pre-, mid-, and post-treatment assessments. Multilevel modeling of archival data revealed that suicidal ideation significantly decreased over the course of CPT (B = -0.153, SE =0.028, 95%CI =[-0.21, -0.10], t= -5.40, p< .001); however, this change did not differ based on age, marital status, sex, or race/ethnicity. Clinical and research implications are discussed.

AB Military veteran status has been associated with a variety of criminal justice outcomes as well as higher rates of mental illness and suicide when compared to the general population. Although research has generally focused on why veterans become involved with the justice system, less is known about their experiences while incarcerated. In particular, studies of veterans in the community context indicate that they are unwilling to seek out mental health treatment due to potential stigmas, suggesting that this reluctance may extend into the prison environment. Using a sample of 14,278 veteran and nonveteran inmates, we find that veterans do not necessarily fare worse in prison and are actually more likely to obtain treatment. However, this effect is largely mediated by the greater history of mental disorders and suicidal behaviors among veterans. Our findings lend credence to recent efforts designed to screen and manage justice-involved veterans as a distinct, at-risk group.

   AGGRESSION; PREVALENCE; IRAQ; VIOLENCE; PTSD; DEPRESSION
AB Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with both aggressive and suicidal behavior. Recent research suggests that the diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder (IED), an impulse-control disorder characterized by repeated impulsive aggressive behavior, may help to identify individuals at risk for attempting suicide. Given the relationship between anger and PTSD, there is likely to be an increased prevalence of IED among individuals with PTSD; however, little is known about the overlap in these two disorders, including how individuals with comorbid IED and PTSD may differ from those with either disorder alone. The purpose of this study is to examine the clinical correlates of comorbid IED and PTSD and the contribution of these two disorders (among others) to lifetime suicide attempt and characteristics of suicidal behavior.
   Method: In a large sample of community research volunteers (N = 1460), we compared individuals with PTSD, IED, and comorbid PTSD and IED on measures of current mood, trait aggression, and trait impulsivity. We also examined the contributions of PTSD, IED, and other syndromal and personality disorders to the prediction of lifetime aggression and lifetime suicide attempt, and their relationship to characteristics of suicide attempts, including level of intent, use of violent versus non-violent means, and the medical seriousness of the attempt.
   Results: Comorbid PTSD and IED was associated with significantly elevated levels of depression, anxiety, anger, aggression, and impulsivity, as well as with high rates of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. IED (beta =.56, p <.001), but not PTSD, significantly and uniquely predicted lifetime aggressive behavior. Both IED and PTSD were associated with lifetime suicide attempt in multivariate analysis (ORs: 1.6 and 1.6, ps <.05). The results show that IED, when comorbid with PTSD, identifies a subgroup of individuals with particularly high levels of aggressive behavior and a high rate of suicide attempt (41.4% in this sample).
   Conclusion: These findings add support to the notion that the diagnosis of IED may aid in identifying individuals at risk for aggressive and suicidal behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Recent confrontations in Iraq between coalition forces and insurgents have caused much havoc in the way of economic and political reforms. Insurgents use a wide range of tactics, from suicide bombings to kidnappings, to cause tension between the local factions and the Iraqi populace, and between the locals and the coalition forces. The strength of the insurgent strategy emerges from the nature of their attacks: highly erratic, yet potent. All-outassault on these insurgents is impossible as they cloak themselves and exploit the advantages of guerrilla warfare tactics. In this paper, we will highlight the informational issues that the coalition forces must appreciate in order to curb and curtail these insurgent attacks. While we do not aim to propose any grand strategy to eradicate all insurgent attacks, we do believe that the true weapon that needs to used optimally (effectively and efficiently) against such attacks is information. Whether the insurgents or the coalition forces, the side that is more successful at managing and deploying information potently and with intent will ultimately prevail. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Introduction: Suicide prevention remains a national priority, especially among vulnerable populations. With increasing trends in suicide among Veterans, understanding the underlying factors associated with such an outcome is imperative. In this study, the association between unmet mental healthcare need and suicidal ideation among U.S. Veterans was evaluated.
   Methods: The National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2008-2013, was used to identify those with mental illness, resulting in a total sample of 2,015 Veterans. Data were analyzed in July 2015. Survey-weighted descriptive and logistic regression analyses were conducted with p<0.05 used to establish significance.
   Results: Sixteen percent of Veterans reported unmet mental healthcare need and 18% had past-year suicidal ideation. After adjusting for confounders, unmet mental healthcare need was associated with increased likelihood of suicidal ideation (AOR=4.11) in the study population. Other characteristics, such as participating in a governmental assistance program and alcohol dependency in the past year, demonstrated 66% and 103% increased odds of suicidal ideation, respectively.
   Conclusions: Unmet mental healthcare need is a critical aspect of suicidal ideation among Veterans. Improved access to care for such at-risk populations through means of integrated care is needed to ensure reduced burden of suicide among Veterans. (C) 2016 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

AB Objectives: The majority of VA patient suicides are completed with firearms. Interventions that delay patients' gun access during high-risk periods may reduce suicide, but may not be acceptable to VA stakeholders or may be challenging to implement. Using qualitative methods, stakeholders' perceptions about gun safety and interventions to delay gun access during high-risk periods were explored.
   Methods: Ten focus groups and four individual interviews were conducted with key stakeholders, including VA mental health patients, mental health clinicians, family members and VA facility leaders (N=60). Transcripts were consensus-coded by two independent coders, and structured summaries were developed and reviewed using a consensus process.
   Results: All stakeholder groups indicated that VA health system providers had a role in increasing patient safety and emphasized the need for providers to address gun access with their at-risk patients. However, VA mental health patients and clinicians reported limited discussion regarding gun access in VA mental health settings during routine care. Most, although not all, patients and clinicians indicated that routine screening for gun access was acceptable, with several noting that it was more acceptable for mental health patients. Most participants suggested that family and friends be involved in reducing gun access, but expressed concerns about potential family member safety. Participants generally found distribution of trigger locks acceptable, but were skeptical about its effectiveness. Involving Veteran Service Organizations or other individuals in temporarily holding guns during high-risk periods was acceptable to many participants but only with numerous caveats.
   Conclusions: Patients, clinicians and family members consider the VA health system to have a legitimate role in addressing gun safety. Several measures to delay gun access during high-risk periods for suicide were seen as acceptable and feasible if implemented thoughtfully. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This study explored the relationship between whole blood serotonin, irritability, anger, and aggression among military personnel deployed in support of combat operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. The participants were active duty military personnel with at least one deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan. After obtaining the prospective participant's consent, the investigators administered the Anger, Irritability, and Assault Questionnaire, the Post-Trauma Exposure Questionnaire, and drew the post-deployment whole blood serotonin specimen. For purposes of comparison, a pre-combat whole blood serotonin sample was obtained from an aliquot stored at the Department of Defense Serum Repository. Seventeen military subjects met the full inclusion criteria to participate in this pilot study. Participants with normal whole blood serotonin levels had significantly lower scores on the Anger, Irritability, and Assault Questionnaire than subjects who were considered to have either low or high whole blood serotonin. The findings from this study tentatively suggest that any abnormal whole blood serotonin level contributes to some form of behavioral irritability.

SO JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH

ID QUALITY-OF-LIFE; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; FOLLOW-UP
AB Background: An extensive literature addresses factors that influence outcome in patients with schizophrenia. However, the effect of these factors under national crisis remains unclear.
   Aims: The study explores the outcome of schizophrenia in a 15-year follow up in Iraq.
   Methods: A total of 298 patients with first-onset schizophrenia from 1985-1987 were recruited from all subjects who had consecutively visited the psychiatric service in Merjan Hospital in Al-Hilla city, Babylon Governorate, Iraq. Of these, 84 were excluded and did not have the research assessment.
   Results: The 150 males and 64 females had an average age at onset of the disorder of 24.8 years. Forty three subjects were untraceable, and 12 subjects committed suicide, I I subjects had alcohol dependence, 8 subjects had clear learning disability, 7 subjects had organic brain diseases, and 3 subjects had epilepsy. All of them were excluded in the analysis. The entire sample was of the same ethnic Iraqi origin, mostly unemployed 151 (70.6%) and all subjects were living with their families. More than 47% of subjects at final assessment had good or partial symptomatic and psychosocial outcomes and nearly 53% had a poor outcome. Thirty patients (20%) of the male group showed good prognosis versus 31.3% of the female group. Furthermore, 54.7% of the males were in the poor prognosis group versus 48.7% of the females.
   Conclusions: Despite Iraq being under siege and exposed to economic sanctions, with very limited resources including the deprivation of atypical antipsychotic medications, its schizophrenia outcome is similar to that in developing countries. The existence of large, supportive families and a strict, committed regimen for active follow-up treatment may be important contributory factors to better outcomes.

   Veterans With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID LONG-TERM; PTSD; IRAQ; PRESCRIPTIONS; DIAGNOSES
AB Objective: To evaluate the relationships between benzodiazepine use and (1) health care utilization and (2) suicide risk in veterans diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
   Methods: This propensity-matched retrospective cohort study included veterans diagnosed with 1 ICD-9 code for PTSD who were active users of the Veterans Affairs health care system between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2014. Exposure included at least 1 thirty-day prescription of a benzodiazepine within 1 year following PTSD diagnosis among patients with no recent history of benzodiazepine use. The primary outcomes were health care utilization and suicidal behavior.
   Results: A total of 242,493 of 1,134,201 eligible veterans were included in the propensity-matched cohort, 80,831 (7.13%) of whom were prescribed benzodiazepines. Veterans with PTSD who received benzodiazepines had significantly more hospitalizations (incident rate ratio [IRR] = 1.27; 95% CI, 1.10-1.47) and emergency department (IRR = 1.16; 95% CI, 1.13-1.20), general outpatient (IRR = 1.19; 95% CI, 1.16-1.21), outpatient mental health (IRR = 1.49; 95% CI, 1.41-1.57), and total mental health (IRR = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.34-1.40) visits. Benzodiazepine users had a significantly greater risk of death due to suicide (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.74; 95% CI, 2.40-3.13) and were significantly more likely to have medically documented suicide attempts (HR = 1.85; 95% CI, 1.65-2.08) and suicidal ideation (HR = 1.57; 95% CI, 1.48-1.67).
   Conclusions: Benzodiazepine users had higher rates of health care utilization and were more likely to attempt and complete suicide than patients without benzodiazepine exposure. This study strengthens the empirical evidence against the use of benzodiazepines in veterans with PTSD. Prescribers should weigh the benefits and risks-especially the almost 3-fold increase in suicide risk-when prescribing benzodiazepines in these patients.

AB Objective To investigate suicide and mortality risk in deployed military veterans versus non-deployed comparators who had gone through military conscription testing.
   Design Population-based matched cohort study.
   Setting Sweden.
   Participants Participants were identified from the Military Service Conscription Register and deployment status from the Swedish Military Information Personnel Register. Of 1.9 million conscripts, 21 721 had deployed at some time between 1990 and 2013 (deployed military veterans). Non-deployed comparators were matched to deployed military veterans in two ways: (1) by cognitive ability, psychological assessment, mental health, body mass index, sex, birth-year and conscription-year (carefully matched), with further adjustment for exercise capacity and suicide attempt history; and (2) by sex, birth-year and conscription-year (age-and sex-matched).
   Main outcome Suicide retrieved from the Swedish National Patient and Causes of Death Register until 31 December 2013.
   Results During a median follow-up of 12 years, 39 and 211 deaths by suicide occurred in deployed military veterans (n=21 627) and carefully matched non-deployed comparators (n=107 284), respectively (15 vs 16/100 000 person-years; adjusted HR (aHR) 1.07; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.52; p=0.72) and 329 in age-and sex-matched non-deployed comparators (n=108 140; 25/100 000 person-years; aHR 0.59; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.82; p=0.002). There were 284 and 1444 deaths by suicide or attempted suicides in deployed military veterans and carefully matched non-deployed comparators, respectively (109 vs 112; aHR 0.99; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.13; p=0.93) and 2061 in age-and sex-matched non-deployed comparators (158; aHR 0.69; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.79; p<0.001). The corresponding figures for all-cause mortality for carefully matched non-deployed comparators were 159 and 820 (61 vs 63/100 000 person-years; aHR 0.97; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.15; p=0.71) and 1289 for age-and sex-matched non-deployed comparators (98/100 000 person-years; aHR 0.62; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.73; p<0.001).
   Conclusion Deployed military veterans had similar suicide and mortality risk as non-deployed comparators after accounting for psychological, psychiatric and physical factors. Studies of mental health in deployed veterans need to adjust for more factors than age and sex for comparisons to be meaningful.

AB Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorders in the United States and has been linked to suicidal thoughts and behaviors, yet the role of a PTSD diagnosis on functional impairment among suicidal individuals remains unknown. This study examined the association between PTSD status and functional impairment among military psychiatric inpatients admitted for acute suicide risk (N = 166) with a lifetime history of at least one suicide attempt. Measures of functionality included: (1) alcohol use; (2) sleep quality; (3) social problem-solving; and (4) work and social adjustment. Thirty-eight percent of the sample met criteria for PTSD. Women were more likely than men to meet criteria for PTSD (p = 0.007), and participants who met PTSD criteria had significantly more psychiatric diagnoses (p < 0.001). Service members who met PTSD criteria reported more disturbed sleep (p = 0.003) and greater difficulties with work and social adjustment (p = 0.004) than those who did not meet PTSD criteria. However, functionality measures were not significantly associated with PTSD status after controlling for gender and psychiatric comorbidity. Gender and number of psychiatric comorbidities other than PTSD were significant predictors of PTSD in logistic regression models across four functionality measures. Future studies should assess the additive or mediating effect of psychiatric comorbidities in the association between impaired functioning and PTSD. Clinicians are encouraged to assess and address functionality during treatment with suicidal individuals, paying particular attention to individuals with multiple psychiatric diagnoses.

TI Exploring cross-lagged associations between spiritual struggles and risk

AB Background: There is consensus that struggles with religious faith and/or spirituality likely contribute to risk for suicidal behavior in military populations. However, a lack of longitudinal information has limited the ability to clarify the temporal associations between these variables.
   Methods: This study examined cross-lagged associations between key types of spiritual struggles ( divine, morality, ultimate meaning, interpersonal relations, and doubting) and indices of risk for suicidal behavior (suicidal ideation and probability of future attempt) in a community sample of veterans who completed assessments spaced apart by six months.
   Results: Greater severity of all forms of spiritual struggles was generally concurrently associated with indices of suicidal behavior at both time points. Of the possible models for predicting suicide risk, structural equation modeling analyses revealed that a cross-lagged option with spiritual struggles predicting risk provided the best-fitting solution for veterans' responses on study measures. In addition to PTSD and MDD symptomatology, issues with ultimate meaning at Time 1 were uniquely predictive of veterans' perceived likelihood of making a suicide attempt beyond the second assessment, after accounting for autoregressive effects and other variables in this model.
   Limitations: This sample was recruited from a single geographic region with disproportionate ties to Christian religious traditions. In addition, reliance on self-report instrumentation potentially limited the accuracy of gauging suicide risk in some cases.
   Conclusions: Findings highlight the prognostic value of spiritually integrated models for assessing suicide risk in military veterans that account for mental health conditions along with possible expressions of suffering in the spiritual domain.

AB The bystander intervention model is one approach utilized to reduce risky behaviors within the U.S. Army; however, it is unclear how frequently soldiers experience opportunities to intervene and whether they already intervene in such situations. The present analysis aims to ascertain frequencies for opportunities to intervene and the rates at which soldiers intervene when presented with such opportunities. Soldiers (N = 286) were asked whether they had witnessed particular risky behavior scenarios of interest to the Army (i.e., suicide-related behaviors, alcohol misuse, or sexual harassment/assault) during the previous 2 months and whether they had intervened in those scenarios. Prevalence rates within this sample were calculated to determine the frequency of such situations and subsequent interventions. Logistic regression was used to ascertain any differences in witnessing scenarios by demographic groups. Nearly half (46.8%) of the soldiers reported witnessing at least one scenario involving risky behaviors. Most soldiers who witnessed an event relating to suicide or alcohol misuse also reported consistently intervening (87.9% and 74.4%, respectively), whereas just half consistently intervened in response to scenarios relating to sexual harassment/assault (49.2%). Lower ranking soldiers were twice as likely as higher ranks to witness scenarios involving alcohol misuse (odds ratio = 2.18, 95% confidence interval [1.11, 4.26]) and sexual harassment/assault (odds ratio = 2.21, 95% confidence interval [1.05, 4.62]). These data indicate that soldiers regularly encounter opportunities to intervene in risky behaviors, and while a majority intervened in such scenarios, more training is warranted, particularly around sexual assault and harassment. This supports the notion that bystander intervention training is a worthwhile investment for the Army.

AB Objective: U.S. Army personnel experience a significant mental health burden, particularly during times of war and multiple deployments. This study identified rates of suicidality (seriously considering or attempting suicide) and types of mental health services used in the past 12 months by active duty Army soldiers. Methods: This study used the 2008 Department of Defense Survey of Health Related Behaviors Among Active Duty Military Personnel, which sampled 10,400 Army soldiers from a total population of 508,088 soldiers. Mental health service utilization included receiving counseling or therapy from a general medical doctor, receiving counseling or therapy from a mental health professional, and being prescribed medications for depression, anxiety, or sleep. Suicidally was assessed via self-report questions. Results: Thirteen percent had seriously considered or attempted suicide at some point in their lives, 7% since joining the military. One percent who reported suicidality since joining the Army reported having considered or attempted suicide in the past year. After the analyses adjusted for sociodemographic factors, soldiers who seriously considered or attempted suicide since joining the military versus those who did not were 1.71 times more likely to have used a mental health service, 2.33 times more likely to have used two or more types of services, 1.82 times more likely to have seen a mental health specialist, and 1.67 times more likely to have received medication in the past year. Conclusions: Understanding the relationship between suicidal thoughts and behaviors and the specific levels and types of mental health services received in this military population is important for health care provision and planning.

AB Background: The purpose of this project was to examine factors associated with suicidal ideation in returning Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans.
   Methods: A cross-sectional review of 1740 veterans' initial mental health screening evaluations. One-hundred and thirteen (6.5%) OEF/OIF veterans reported active suicidal ideation at the time of the interview.
   Results: Prior exposures of physical or sexual abuse and having a history of a prior suicide attempt(s) were associated with the presence of current suicidal ideation, as were having a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, a depressive disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Deployment concerns related to training (protective), the deployment environment, family concerns, deployment concerns, post-deployment support (protective), and postdeployment stressors were also associated with current suicidal ideation. Logistic regression analysis revealed the major risk factors were having a prior suicide attempt, female gender, and a depressive disorder diagnosis; while more perceived current social support was a protective factor. Logistic regression analysis also revealed having comorbid PTSD and depression carried a higher odds ratio for risk than did having either PTSD or depression alone; and that the PTSD avoidance symptom-cluster was associated with more risk than either the re-experiencing or hyper-arousal symptom clusters for current suicidal ideation.
   Limitations: As a cross-sectional retrospective medical chart review, limitations include limited generalizability and causal relationships cannot be evaluated.
   Conclusions: Further investigation of these risk factors is warranted to aid in suicide risk assessment and in the development of targeted interventions to mitigate the identified risk factors and bolster the identified protective factor. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This article examines the public safety rationale for a federal policy of prohibiting gun sales to veterans with psychiatric disabilities who are assigned a fiduciary to manage their benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs. The policy was evaluated using data on 3200 post-deployment veterans from the Iraq and Afghanistan war era. Three proxy measures of fiduciary need-based on intellectual disability, drug abuse, or acute psychopathology-were associated in bivariate analysis with interpersonal violence and suicidality. In multivariate analysis, statistical significance remained only for the measure based on acute psychopathology. Implications for reforms to the fiduciary firearm restriction policy are discussed.

Pertinent background information and potential best practices for assessing the risk of intentional self-injury in those with deployment-related TBI will be discussed. Conclusion: With the aim of comprehensively assessing risk, clinicians are encouraged to increase understanding regarding possible contributing factors (e.g., pre-existing vulnerabilities, TBI sequelae) in the context of military experiences. Using the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide Risk and The International Classification of Functioning as organizing frameworks in conjunction with literature regarding post-TBI functioning may facilitate this process.

AB Deployment sexual trauma is associated with post-deployment suicidal ideation. No studies have examined the role of social support in this association. The present study examined if perceived unit support and post-deployment support influenced the association between deployment sexual trauma and suicidal ideation. 824 post-9/11 veterans (480 men, 344 women) from the Survey of Experiences of Returning Veterans completed the Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory-2 and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Age, possible depression, posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, and lifetime suicide attempt were covaried. Among men, post deployment support moderated the association between deployment sexual trauma and suicidal ideation; deployment sexual trauma predicted suicidal ideation only for men reporting low post-deployment support. Among women, post-deployment support mediated the association between deployment sexual trauma and suicidal ideation. Unit support neither moderated nor mediated the association between deployment sexual trauma and suicidal ideation. Among men who experience deployment sexual trauma, those with low perceived post-deployment support may be at particularly elevated risk for suicidal ideation and may benefit from more intensive monitoring and interventions that bolster social support. Increasing perceived post-deployment support for women who experience deployment sexual trauma is also warranted. Determining optimal ways to strengthen post-deployment support for sexual trauma survivors is essential.

AB Rates of suicide are alarmingly high in military and veteran samples. Suicide rates are particularly elevated among those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, which share overlapping symptoms and frequently co-occur. Identifying and confirming factors that reduce, suicide risk among veterans with PTSD and depression is imperative. The proposed study evaluated, whether post-deployment social support moderated the influence of PTSD-depression symptoms on, suicidal ideation among Veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan using state of the art clinical, diagnostic interviews and self-report measures. Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Veterans (n=145) were invited to, participate in a study evaluating returning Veterans' experiences. As predicted, PTSD-depression, symptoms had almost no effect on suicidal ideation (SI) when post-deployment social support was high; however, when, post-deployment social support was low, PTSD-depression symptoms were positively associated with, SI. Thus, social support may be an important factor for clinicians to assess in the context of PTSD and, depressive symptoms. Future research is needed to prospectively examine the inter-relationship, between PTSD/depression and social support on suicidal risk, as well as whether interventions to, improve social support result in decreased suicidality.

AB There are currently 22.5 million living U.S. military veterans, and this number is expected to increase dramatically as military personnel return from Iraq and Afghanistan. Although honorably discharged veterans may qualify for health care through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), only about 25% of all veterans take advantage of this benefit; a majority seek services in non-VA settings. It's imperative for nurses in all civilian care settings to understand the impact that military service has on veterans' health. This article provides an overview of veterans' unique health care issues, focusing particularly on traumatic brain injury, polytrauma, hazardous exposures, chronic pain, posttraumatic stress disorder, military sexual trauma, substance use disorders, suicide, and homelessness. Evidence-based assessment tools and treatment guidelines for these health issues are discussed. A resource table provides telephone numbers and Web sites offering tools, educational materials, and veteran services. A second table provides detailed veteran-centered health assessment and screening questions.

AB Insomnia is a prevalent disorder that greatly impacts military personnel, especially those deployed in support of combat efforts. Deployment-related stressors like combat exposure, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) irregular sleep-wake schedules, and adjustment to the return home all contribute to insomnia. However, insomnia can also exacerbate the deployment experience and is a risk factor for traumatic stress reactions such as PTSD, depression, and suicide. Military personnel with mTBI are significantly impacted by insomnia; the majority experience sleep disruption and this can impede recovery and rehabilitation. As more service members return home from deployment, treatment is vital to reduce the impact of insomnia. Preliminary outcome data, showing positive results for reduction of sleep disruption, has been found with treatments such as combined cognitive behavioral treatment of insomnia (CBTI) and imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT), preference-based interventions, as well as efforts to broadly disseminate CBTI. The recent literature on the impact and treatment of deployment-related insomnia is reviewed.

ID CARE; GEOGRAPHIES; POLITICS; ETHICS
AB On July 19th, 2005, American Army Private First Class LaVena Johnson died in Balad, Iraq, just 8 days shy of her 20th birthday. On July 13th, 2015, almost 10 years later, 28-year-old Sandra Bland's life came to an abrupt end in a jail cell in Waller County, Texas. Both women's deaths were ruled suicides, and both women's families and friends reject these judgments. Instead, they insinuate foul play by the state, which directly governed the militarized spaces within which the women both died. At first glance, these women appear to have had very different life trajectories, one a United States soldier and the other a Black Lives Matter activist. However, in both of their cases, the ruling of the suspicious deaths as suicides illustrates the state's attempt to render their deaths banal, and thereby diminish the state's own culpability. In understanding the unremitting acts of violence, on women's bodies, especially women of color, this paper focuses on how a Black feminist praxis extends feminist notions of an ethics of care.

AB IMPORTANCE The US Army suicide attempt rate increased sharply during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Although soldiers with a prior mental health diagnosis (MH-Dx) are known to be at risk, little is known about risk among those with no history of diagnosis.
   OBJECTIVE To examine risk factors for suicide attempt among soldiers without a previous MH-Dx.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this retrospective longitudinal cohort study using administrative data from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Service-members (Army STARRS), person-month records were identified for all active-duty Regular Army enlisted soldiers who had a medically documented suicide attempt from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2009 (n = 9650), and an equal-probability sample of control person-months (n = 153 528). Data analysis in our study was from September 16, 2017, to June 6, 2018. In a stratified sample, it was examined whether risk factors for suicide attempt varied by history of MH-Dx.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Suicide attempts were identified using Department of Defense Suicide Event Report records and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification E95 x diagnostic codes. Mental health diagnoses and related codes, as well as sociodemographic, service-related, physical health care, injury, subjection to crime, crime perpetration, and family violence variables, were constructed from Army personnel, medical, legal, and family services records.
   RESULTS Among 9650 enlisted soldiers with a documented suicide attempt (74.8% male), 3507 (36.3%) did not have a previous MH-Dx. Among soldiers with no previous diagnosis, the highest adjusted odds of suicide attempt were for the following: female sex (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% CI, 2.4-2.8), less than high school education (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.8-2.0), first year of service (OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 4.7-7.7), previously deployed (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 2.1-2.8), promotion delayed 2 months or less (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.7-2.6), past-year demotion (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3-1.8), 8 or more outpatient physical health care visits in the past 2 months (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.9-3.8), past-month injury-related outpatient (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.8-3.3) and inpatient (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.3-6.3) health care visits, previous combat injury (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0-2.4), subjection to minor violent crime (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4), major violent crime perpetration (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-3.0), and family violence (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.9-4.4). Most of these variables were also associated with suicide attempts among soldiers with a previous MH-Dx, although the strength of associations differed.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Suicide attempt risk among soldiers with unrecognized mental health problems is a significant and important challenge. Administrative records from personnel, medical, legal, and family services systems can assist in identifying soldiers at risk.

AB Safety of suicidal veterans is a national issue. Veterans have a higher rate of depressive disorder than the general population, which puts them at higher risk for suicide. The staff in the emergency department (ED) of one Department of Veterans Affairs hospital developed and implemented an innovative process that increases the safety of suicidal veterans in the hospital setting. This process is called Code-51 and is similar to a military unit watch. This is one of the first unit watches implemented throughout an entire Veteran Affairs hospital, not only in the ED.

AB This study randomly sampled post -9/11 military veterans and reports on causes, predictors, and frequency of traumatic brain injury (TBI) (N=1,388). A total of 17.3% met criteria for TBI during military service, with about one-half reporting multiple head injuries, which were related to higher rates of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, back pain, and suicidal ideation. The most common mechanisms of TBI included blasts (33.1%), objects hitting head (31.7%), and fall (13.5%). TBI was associated with enlisted rank, male gender, high combat exposure, and sustaining TBI prior to military service. Clinical and research efforts in veterans should consider TBI mechanism, effects of cumulative TBI, and screening for premilitary TBI.

AB Previous research indicates that suicidal ideation is higher among military-connected youth than non military-connected youth. This study extends prior work by examining suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts in military-connected and non military-connected adolescents. Data were gathered from 390,028 9th and 11th grade students who completed the 2012-2013 California Healthy Kids Survey. Bivariate comparisons and multivariate logistic analyses were conducted to examine differences in suicidal ideation, plans, attempts, and attempts requiring medical attention between military and not military-connected youth. In multivariate logistic analyses, military-connected youth were at increased risk for suicidal ideation (OR = 1.43, 95 % CI = 1.37-1.49), making a plan to harm themselves (OR = 1.19, CI = 1.06-1.34), attempting suicide (OR = 1.67, CI = 1.43-1.95), and an attempted suicide which required medical treatment (OR = 1.71, CI = 1.34-2.16). These results indicate that military-connected youth statewide are at a higher risk for suicidal ideation, plans, attempts, and attempts requiring medical care because of suicidal behaviors. It is suggested that policies be implemented to increase awareness and screening among primary care providers, school personnel, and military organizations that serve military-connected youth.

TI Chronic Health Conditions Among US Veterans Discharged From Military
   Service for Misconduct
SO PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE
LA English
DT Article
ID SEPARATION
AB Veterans who are discharged from military service due to misconduct are vulnerable to negative health-related outcomes, including homelessness, incarceration, and suicide. We used national data from the Veterans Health Administration for 218,608 veterans of conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan that took place after the events of September 11, 2001, to compare clinical diagnoses between routinely-discharged (n = 203,174) and misconduct-discharged (n = 15,433) veterans. Misconduct-discharged veterans had significantly higher risk for all mental health conditions (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] range, 2.5-8.0) and several behaviorally linked chronic health conditions (AOR range, 1.2-5.9). Misconduct-discharged veterans have serious and complex health care needs; prevention efforts should focus on behavioral risk factors to prevent the development and exacerbation of chronic health conditions among this vulnerable population.

AB Theorists have long proposed that vulnerable people turn to zeal in the face of perceived self-threats because doing so somehow masks the threats. The present study supports this idea, and suggests that low implicit self-esteem may be a key vulnerability, that predisposes individualy toward defensive zeal. Undergraduate participants with low implicit self-esteem, as assessed by an Internet version of the Implicit Association Test, reacted to an experimentally manipulated academic threat with zeal about their opinions toward capital punishment, the US invasion of Iraq, and suicide bombing. Significant effects were found for two aspects of zealextremism and exaggerated estimates of social consensus for personal opinions. Results for each issue were independent of whether participants were in favor of, or against the issue.

AB To elucidate gaps in the preparedness of clergy and healthcare providers to care for service members (SM) with deployment-related mental health needs. Participants identified clinically relevant symptoms in a standardized video role play of a veteran with deployment-related mental health needs and discussed their preparedness to deal with SM. Clergy members identified suicide and depression most often, while providers identified difficulty sleeping, low energy, nightmares and irritability. Neither clergy nor providers felt prepared to minister to or treat SM with traumatic brain injury. Through a mixed methods approach, we identified gaps in preparedness of clergy and healthcare providers in dealing with the mental health needs of SM.

AB Purpose of review
   Our purpose is to illuminate health perspectives of adolescents in military service, who comprise the main bulk of military personnel.
   Recent findings
   Two views are emphasized: the soldier as a developing adolescent and the healthcare of adolescent soldiers. The capacity for abstract thinking and future planning, characteristic of late adolescence, oppose the military challenges of obedience, disengagement from the family, and potential threats for physical injury and mental stress, in addition to the requirement for responsibility beyond the individual's personal needs. On the other hand, at discharge from military service, the mature young adult faces questions of a 17-year-old adolescent. Health perspectives regarding adolescents in military service include physical and mental health screening before draft; recruiting adolescents with chronic illnesses; specific healthcare issues during service, including routine medical care, psychosocial problems of young people in service in service and approach to suicide and to risk behaviors; health aspects of adolescent women in military frameworks; and the dual commitment of physicians as military officers.
   Summary
   Professionals who care for the well-being of young people in their late teens and early 20s in military service period as an additional developmental stage with late adolescence that requires attention as part of the comprehensive healthcare.

AB We used GBD 2015 findings to measure the burden of intentional injuries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) between 1990 and 2015.
   The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study defines intentional injuries as a combination of self-harm (including suicide), interpersonal violence, collective violence (war), and legal intervention. We estimated number of deaths, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for each type of intentional injuries.
   In 2015, 28,695 individuals (95% UI: 25,474-37,832) died from self-harm, 35,626 (95% UI: 20,947-41,857) from interpersonal violence, and 143,858 (95% UI: 63,554-223,092) from collective violence and legal interventions. In 2015, collective violence and legal intervention was the fifth-leading cause of DALYs in the EMR and the leading cause in Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya; they account for 49.7% of total DALYs in Syria.
   Our findings call for increased efforts to stabilize the region and assist in rebuilding the health systems, as well as increasing transparency and employing preventive strategies to reduce self-harm and interpersonal injuries.

AB Background: Self-inflicted burn (SIB) is an important social and medical problem in the world. However, the evidence is limited to the reasons and experiences of women who committed SIB. Objective: To explore in-depth reasons and experiences of self-inflicted burn among women aged 15-45 years, in Baghdad city, Iraq. Methodology: The study was conducted among 30 participants, recruited from six different hospitals where the participants were treated. Maximum variation opportunistic sampling technique was used to select the participants, taking into account participants' variation in age, socioeconomic, and marital status. Data were collected through face to face semi-structured interviews. Each interview session was audio-recorded and supported by field notes. Content analysis was conducted using Max QDA 10 software. Results: We identified four major categories of problems leading to SIB. These were related to the personal, social, economic and family situation of the study subjects. Of these, the main factors mentioned by all participants' family pressure, unstable environment, and poor mental health. Conclusion: We found that SIB is linked to various socioeconomic problems. Meanwhile, comprehensive SIB prevention, care and support stands worthy of consideration to avert the problem as well as to save the lives of those who committed the problem.

TI The Homecomings: What Happens When Arab Foreign Fighters in Iraq and
   Syria Return?
SO STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM
LA English
DT Article
AB What threat do foreign Arab jihadists returning from the war in Syria and Iraq pose to their home states and the broader Arab world? Foreign fighters come back as hardened veterans, steady in the face of danger and skilled in the use of weapons and explosives. While in the conflict zone, they will form networks with other radicals, embrace techniques like suicide bombings and beheadings, and establish ties to jihadists around the world. Different countries have different mitigating factors that limit the danger. The presence or absence of strong and focused security services is particularly important. Returnees' ambition, regional focus, lack of discipline, and brutality often mean they create more enemies than they vanquish and anger local populations. Most terrorism will be locally and regionally focused, with international terrorism probably less of a priority. Area regimes can reduce the risk of bleedout by hindering the travel of volunteers and constraining their ability to organize, stressing the internecine nature of the violence in the Sunni Muslim community, and developing effective de-radicalization programs. Regional and international cooperation to monitor and disrupt travel is also valuable. Many regimes, however, are also likely to take advantage of the jihadists' presence to gain more support from the United States, delay democratic reforms, and crackdown on non-jihadist opposition. Improving intelligence sharing and offensive counterintelligence is important, and the United States can play an important facilitating role.

ID 3RD-PARTY INTERVENTIONS; CONFLICTS; DURATION; DATASET
AB This article evaluates the effects of terrorism on interventions into civil wars. Considering civil wars from 1970-1999, this study analyzes how the use of terrorism as a tactic affects external interventions on behalf of opposition groups, interventions on behalf of governments, and diplomatic interventions. While some authors would suggest that groups might utilize terrorism as a tactic to gain external support, this study finds little evidence that groups are actually successful in gaining such support. In fact, terrorism that targets civilians appears to actually decrease the likelihood of military interventions on behalf of opposition groups. Furthermore, in civil wars with high numbers of terrorist attacks there is a greater likelihood of economic intervention on behalf of governments, further weakening the potential benefit for groups in utilizing terrorism as a tactic. While this is certainly a welcome finding, a consideration of five case studies of suicide terrorism (Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Iraq, India, and Turkey) provides evidence that the use of suicide terrorism within civil wars may have decreased the likelihood of external interventions on behalf of the government and of diplomatic interventions. These results are more troubling and suggest potentially grave consequences for mediating many of these conflicts.

AB Suicide rates among recent veterans have led to interest in risk identification. Evidence of gender-and trauma-specific predictors of suicidal ideation necessitates the use of advanced computational methods capable of elucidating these important and complex associations. In this study, we used machine learning to examine gender-specific associations between predeployment and military factors, traumatic deployment experiences, and psychopathology and suicidal ideation (SI) in a national sample of veterans deployed during the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts (n = 2,244). Classification, regression tree analyses, and random forests were used to identify associations with SI and determine their classification accuracy. Findings converged on several associations for men that included depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and somatic complaints. Sexual harassment during deployment emerged as a key factor that interacted with PTSD and depression and demonstrated a stronger association with SI among women. Classification accuracy for SI presence or absence was good based on the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve, men = .91, women = .92. The risk for SI was classifiable with good accuracy, with associations that varied by gender. The use of machine learning analyses allowed for the discovery of rich, nuanced results that should be replicated in other samples and may eventually be a basis for the development of gender-specific actuarial tools to assess SI risk among veterans.

TI Retrospective analysis of forensic cases in refugees admitted to

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Forensic cases; Refugees; Emergency department
AB Introduction: The aim of this study was to compare the distribution and frequency of forensic medical events in a refugee group with that of the general population, and thus, extrapolate the problems encountered in the immigrant population.
   Methods: Those cases admitted to the emergency department (ED) for any reason that required a forensic examination between January 2016 and June 2018 were investigated retrospectively.
   Results: A total of 310 refugees were admitted to the ED for forensic medical events. The most common nations of origin of the refugees were Iraq (n = 167), Syria (n = 65), and Afghanistan (n = 28). The median age of the refugees was 24 years old (interquartile range = 17-33). With regard to forensics, the most common reasons for the refugees to present to the ED were motor vehicle accidents 27.4%, assaults 25.8%, employment and industrial accidents 16.1%, and suicide attempts 10.3%. Other than suicide attempts, all of the forensic presentations were more common in the males. The outcomes of the refugee group were as follows: 92.3% were discharged, 5.8% were admitted to the hospital, 1% were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 1% were transferred. Suicide attempts were the most common reasons for the ICU admissions, while the most common reasons for the hospital admissions were orthopedic injuries.
   Conclusion: In general, the forensic event frequency in the refugee group was lower (p = 0.001); however, this was a single center study, and there could have been unrecorded cases due to an inability to access healthcare assistance, so these results may not be reliable.

AB Background: Given the alarming rate of military suicides, it is critical to identify the factors that increase risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among active duty military personnel.
   Methods: This study examined a predictive model of suicidal ideation among 366 treatment-seeking active duty military personnel with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following deployments to or near Iraq or Afghanistan. Structural equation modeling was employed to examine the relative contribution of combat exposure, social support, PTSD severity, depressive symptoms, guilt, and trauma-related cognitions on suicidal ideation.
   Results: The final structural equation model had a highly satisfactory fit [chi(2) (2) =2.023, p=.364; RMSEA =.006; CFI =1; GFI =.998]. PTSD severity had an indirect effect on suicidal ideation via trauma-related cognitions. Depression had a direct positive effect on suicidal ideation; it also had an indirect effect via trauma-related cognitions and interpersonal support. Among participants who had made a previous suicide attempt, only depression symptom severity was significantly linked to suicidal ideation.
   Limitations: Data are cross-sectional, precluding causal interpretations. Findings may only generalize to treatment seeking active duty military personnel with PTSD reporting no more than moderate suicidal ideation.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that depression and trauma-related cognitions, particularly negative thoughts about the self, play an important role in suicidal ideation among active duty military personnel with PTSD. Negative cognitions about the self and interpersonal support may be important targets for intervention to decrease suicidal ideation.

AB Objectives. We examined the association of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury, and chronic pain-the polytrauma clinical triad (PCT)-independently and with other conditions, with suicide-related behavior (SRB) risk among Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF; Afghanistan) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) veterans.
   Methods. We used Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative data to identify OEF and OIF veterans receiving VA care in fiscal years 2009-2011; we used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes to characterize 211 652 cohort members. Descriptive statistics were followed by multinomial logistic regression analyses predicting SRB.
   Results. Co-occurrence of PCT conditions was associated with significant increase in suicide ideation risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5, 2.4) or attempt and ideation (OR = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.5, 4.6), but did not exceed increased risk with PTSD alone (ideation: OR = 2.3; 95% CI = 2.0, 2.6; attempt: OR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.4, 2.9; ideation and attempt: OR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.2, 2.8). Ideation risk was significantly elevated when PTSD was comorbid with depression (OR = 4.2; 95% CI = 3.6, 4.8) or substance abuse (OR = 4.7; 95% CI = 3.9, 5.6).
   Conclusions. Although PCT was a moderate SRB predictor, interactions among PCT conditions, particularly PTSD, and depression or substance abuse had larger risk increases.

AB Although research has documented negative effects of combat deployment on mental health, few studies have examined whether deployment increases risky or self-destructive behavior. The present study addressed this issue. In addition, we examined whether deployment effects on risky behavior varied depending on history of pre-deployment risky behavior, and assessed whether psychiatric conditions mediated effects of deployment on risky behavior. In an anonymous survey, active duty members of the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy (N = 2116) described their deployment experiences and their participation in risky recreational activities, unprotected sex, illegal drug use, self-injurious behavior, and suicide attempts during three time frames (civilian, military pre-deployment, and military post-deployment). Respondents also reported whether they had problems with depression, anxiety, or PTSD during the same three time frames. Results revealed that risky behavior was much more common in civilian than in military life, with personnel who had not deployed, compared to those who had deployed, reporting more risky behavior and more psychiatric problems as civilians. For the current time period, in contrast, personnel who had deployed (versus never deployed) were significantly more likely to report both risky behavior and psychiatric problems. Importantly, deployment was associated with increases in risky behavior only for personnel with a pre-deployment history of engaging in risky behavior. Although psychiatric conditions were associated with higher levels of risky behavior, psychiatric problems did not mediate associations between deployment and risky behavior. Implications for understanding effects of combat deployment on active duty personnel and directions for future research are discussed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study evaluated whether a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) was associated with increased risk for recent suicidal ideation (SI) after accounting for demographics, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and sleep quality. In terms of increased risk, we hypothesized that a history of lifetime TBI would be associated with increased recent SI when compared with no history of TBI; multiple injuries were also evaluated. The sample included Iraq and Afghanistan war-era veterans (n = 838) who served in the United States military since 9/2001 and completed a structured TBI interview. Approximately 50% reported a lifetime history of at least 1 TBI, and 17.9% met criteria for current major depressive disorder (MDD). SI over the past week per the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation was the primary outcome. Demographics, current MDD and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) per Structured Clinical Interview of DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, sleep quality per Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and TBI history per structured interview were included in all statistical models. Current depression and poor sleep quality were consistently associated with recent SI. A history of any TBI history across the life span was not associated with increased recent SI (OR = 1.35, 95% CI [0.83, 2.19]). However, a history of multiple TBIs compared with no history of TBI was associated with increased recent SI (OR = 1.76, 95% CI [1.01, 3.06]). Results support the assertion than an accumulation of injuries amplifies risk. Severity of injury and deployment injuries were not significant factors. Among those with a history of 1 TBI, sleep, and depression, which may also be injury sequelae, may be salient treatment targets.

AB Background: Self-inflicted burns are a regular source of admissions to burns unit's worldwide. However, there is limited evidence regarding risk factors that associated with self-inflicted burn. Aims: To determine factors that associated with self-inflicted burn (SIB) among women in reproductive age in Baghdad, Iraq. Method: Sex, age and time matched case-control study was conducted among females with the age range 15 to 45 years in Baghdad, Iraq. Each case was individual matched to two controls in the similar age (+/- 1), sex and time when SIB happened. Controls were selected from the same hospital where the cases have been admitted in the same period. Data was collected on the variables age, occupation, education, marital status, socioeconomic status (SES), etc. Crude and adjusted odds Ratio (OR) were estimated by simple and multiple conditional logistic regression model. Results: We found a positive association between poor SES (AOR = 3.61; 95% CI (2.04 to 6.11)), family history of SIB (AOR = 1.6; 95% CI (1.14 to 4.18)), homelessness (AOR = 3.9; 95% CI (2.07 to 5.48)), subjected to physical (AOR = 2.0; 95% CI (1.35 to 2.95)) and sexual violence (AOR = 1.1; 95% CI (1.17 to 4.51)), having the history of health problem (AOR = 2.63; 95% CI (1.55 to 6.14)), feeling discrimination (AOR = 3.11; 95% CI (1.10 to 5.03)) and dissatisfaction with unstable living condition (AOR = 3.12; 95% CI (1.90 to 6.41)) with SIB. Conclusions: Several and interlinked socioeconomic and behavioral factors were associated with SIB in women. Implementing multifaceted intervention is vital to prevent SIB among women with poor SES, living in temporary accommodation, and subjected to domestic violence.

AB Wounded troops in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are surviving their injuries at greater rates now than in all previous major American wars, and our returning troops face physical, mental, and sexual health challenges when trying to build and re-establish intimate relationships. We are seeing relationship difficulties like intimate partner violence, child abuse, divorce, partners taking on care giving roles, higher incidence of risky sexual behaviors among single veterans, and special challenges faced by women and gay and lesbian soldiers. Healthy intimate relationships can contribute to a person's recovery from physical and mental trauma, while a lack of them can contribute to ongoing mental health problems and even suicide. Fortunately, we now see greater availability and acceptance of mental health services and resources for supporting intimate relationships in the military.

AB Turkey's snap parliamentary election in November 2015 took place in an environment of growing political violence and terrorism resulting from the renewal of the Kurdish conflict in the southeast and two major suicide bombings carried out by Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Presenting the coalition arithmetic, the article first examines the failure to form a government after the previous election five months earlier. It then examines the campaign for the November election, including party strategies, key issues and the role of the media, before analysing the results and the election winners and losers. In restoring a parliamentary majority for the Adalet ve Kalknma Partisi (Justice and Development Party - AKP) that has governed Turkey continuously for the past 13years, the November election marked the basic continuity of Turkey's predominant party system.

AB The number of women serving in the military and deployed to active-duty is unprecedented in the history of the United States. When women became a permanent sector of the U.S. Armed Services in 1948, their involvement was restricted to comprise only 2% of the military population; today women constitute approximately 14.5% of the 1.4 million active component and 18% of the 850,000 reserve component. Yet, little attention has been paid to the mental health needs of women military members. This review article highlights the history of women in the military and then focuses on the impact of combat exposure and injuries, military sexual trauma, alcohol use, and family separations which are associated with PTSD, depression, suicide, difficulty with reintegration, and homelessness.

AB Following his discovery of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in football players in 2002, Dr. Bennet Omalu hypothesized that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in military veterans may belong to the CTE spectrum of diseases. The CTE surveillance at the Brain Injury Research Institute was therefore expanded to include deceased military veterans diagnosed with PTSD. The authors report the case of a 27-year-old United States Marine Corps (USMC) Iraqi war veteran, an amphibious assault vehicle crewman, who committed suicide by hanging after two deployments to Fallujah and Ramadi. He experienced combat and was exposed to mortar blasts and improvised explosive device blasts less than 50 m away. Following his second deployment he developed a progressive history of cognitive impairment, impaired memory, behavioral and mood disorders, and alcohol abuse. Neuropsychiatric assessment revealed a diagnosis of PTSD with hyperarousal (irritability and insomnia) and numbing. He committed suicide approximately 8 months after his honorable discharge from the USMC. His brain at autopsy appeared grossly unremarkable except for congestive brain swelling. There was no atrophy or remote focal traumatic brain injury such as contusional necrosis or hemorrhage. Histochemical and immunohistochemical brain tissue analysis revealed CTE changes comprising multifocal, neocortical, and subcortical neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic threads (ranging from none, to sparse, to frequent) with the skip phenomenon, accentuated in the depths of sulci and in the frontal cortex. The subcortical white matter showed mild rarefaction, sparse perivascular and neuropil infiltration by histiocytes, and mild fibrillary astrogliosis. Apolipoprotein E genotype was 3/4. The authors report this case as a sentinel case of CTE in an Iraqi war veteran diagnosed with PTSD to possibly stimulate new lines of thought and research in the possible pathoetiology and pathogenesis of PTSD in military veterans as part of the CTE spectrum of diseases, and as chronic sequelae and outcomes of repetitive traumatic brain injuries.

AB Background: War veterans with PTSD have a high chance of developing major depressive disorder (MDD) at some point, while they can also exhibit increased suicidal tendencies. The primary goal of this research was to investigate whether personality dimensions, including temperament, character, and trait impulsivity, were associated with comorbid MDD, as well as with suicidal ideation in psychiatric patients suffering from combat-related PTSD.
   Subjects and methods: The sample consisted of 148 Croatian male war veterans (mean age 49.53 years) treated for PTSD at the National Center for Psychotrauma, Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Center Zagreb. Fifty-one (34%) of them met ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for current or lifetime MDD, while 97 (66%) were diagnosed with PTSD alone. All the participants were assessed with the M.I.N.I. diagnostic interview and they completed the following battery of self-report instruments: the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II), the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R), the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R), and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11).
   Results: Comparisons between the two clinical groups showed that PTSD+MDD patients were more suicidal and differed with regard to temperament dimensions Harm Avoidance, Reward Dependence and Persistence, character dimension Self-Directedness, and trait impulsivity. In three multivariate regression analyses, it was revealed that character dimension Cooperativeness as well as trait impulsivity were unique predictors of suicidal ideation, while controlling for the influence of sociodemographics, length of treatment and comorbid depression.
   Conclusions: Combat-related PTSD patients with comorbid depression exhibit increased suicide thoughts and different personality profiles in comparison with those suffering from PTSD alone. Character dimension Cooperativeness and trait impulsivity seem to be uniquely predictive of suicide ideation in this population. Elucidation of individual psychological factors that increase the risk of MDD and suicidal tendencies in war veterans with PTSD may facilitate more effective prevention and treatment methods.

AB The last two decades have seen increasing numbers of women entering all branches of the U.S. armed forces. Now that women in the military are no longer prohibited from holding direct combat positions, they are often exposed to traumatic events that place them at higher risk for mental health conditions. Nurses working within the Veterans Affairs (VA) system and those working in non-VA settings are likely to encounter female veterans. It's essential for all nurses to be knowledgeable about the mental health issues commonly seen in this population, and to understand the importance of screening, not only for mental health issues but also for physical conditions that may be related to service.
   Numerous studies have focused on the mental health effects of deployment among military men, but very few have been conducted among military women. To learn more, the literature was searched for relevant articles published between January 2005 and December 2015. The research supports the contention that both active-duty and veteran women are at increased risk for postdeployment mental health problems, including posttraumatic stress disorder, military sexual trauma, and suicide. This article discusses the relevant research; identifies gaps in the literature; and addresses the nursing practice implications, including screening.

AB Moral injury is an emerging construct related to negative consequences associated with war-zone stressors that transgress military veterans' deeply held values/beliefs. Given the newness of the construct, there is a need for instrumentation that might assess morally injurious experiences (MIEs) in this population. Drawing on a community sample of 131 Iraq and/or Afghanistan Veterans and clinical sample of 82 returning Veterans, we conducted an initial psychometric evaluation of the newly developed Moral Injury QuestionnaireMilitary version (MIQ-M)a 20-item self-report measure for assessing MIEs. Possibly due to low rates of reporting, an item assessing sexual trauma did not yield favourable psychometric properties and was excluded from analyses. Veterans in the clinical sample endorsed significantly higher scores across MIQ-M items. Factor analytic results for the final 19 items supported a unidimensional structure, and convergent validity analyses revealed that higher scores (indicative of more MIEs) were correlated with greater general combat exposure, impairments in work/social functioning, posttraumatic stress and depression in the community sample. In addition, when controlling for demographics, deployment-related factors and exposure to life threat stressors associated with combat, tests of incremental validity indicated that MIQ-M scores were also uniquely linked with suicide risk and other mental health outcomes. These findings provide preliminary evidence for the validity of the MIQ-M and support the applicability of this measure for further research and clinical work with Veterans.

AB Background: Many patients fulfill criteria for both posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is generally acknowledged to be the most-effective treatment for refractory MDD. This study investigated the efficacy of ECT on long-term clinical outcome of comorbid PTSD and MDD. Methods: This retrospective nested matched case-control study is inclusive of 22,164 subjects [3,485 with comorbid MDD and PTSD (92 with ECT and 3,393 without ECT) and 18,679 without MDD and PTSD]. Results: Using the clinical global impression scale (CGI) to assess efficacy, more-robust improvement of PTSD and MDD symptoms was observed with ECT (90%), compared to antidepressant-treatment alone(50%) (P = 0.001). During the median of 8 years of follow-up, the death-rate was 8% in subjects without PTSD and MDD, 9.7% in PTSD and MDD treated with ECT and 18% in PTSD andMDDwithout ECT (P < 0.05). The suicide-rate was 2.2 and 5.9% in PTSD and MDD with and without ECT-treatment, respectively (P < 0.05). Survival-analyses revealed that the relative-risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality is not significantly different in patients with comorbid MDD and PTSD treated with ECT, compared to a matched-cohort without PTSD and MDD (P > 0.05). The relative risk of suicidality, all-cause, and cardiovascular mortality was reduced 64, 65, and 46% in MDD and PTSD patients treated with ECT, compared to those without ECT (P < 0.05). Conclusion: ECT is associated with a significant reduction of symptoms of PTSD and MDD, as well as reduction in risk of suicidality, cardiovascular, and all-cause mortality in MDD and PTSD, an effect more robust than antidepressant-therapy alone.

AB Screeners in use at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) do not query high-risk and self-harm behaviors that are thought to be more common among veterans, especially male veterans, and may use stigmatizing language to query self-harm behaviors, resulting in underreporting. As such, many veteran's high-risk and self-harm behaviors may go undetected. The present study outlines the development and initial validation of the Direct and Indirect Self-Harm Inventory (DISH), a measure designed to detect high-risk and self-harm behaviors thought to be more common among veterans and to avoid the use of stigmatizing language. We also examined whether, and to what degree, novel behaviors assessed on the DISH longitudinally predict future suicide-related outcomes. Seventy-eight veterans enrolled in VA care and presenting with varying degrees of suicide risk completed the DISH as part of a larger study. Participants also completed the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI; Nock, Holmberg, Photos, & Michel, 2007), a well-validated assessment of self-harm behaviors. The DISH demonstrated good convergent validity with overlapping items on the SITBI (percent agreement ranged from 66.7% to 88.9%). Participants were more likely to report high-risk and indirect self-harm behaviors, but not direct self-harm behaviors, on the DISH than on the SITBI. None of the behaviors assessed on the DISH or the SITBI predicted future suicide-related outcomes. Though additional research is needed to further validate the DISH (e.g., test-retest reliability), the present study suggests that the DISH may be an improvement over existing measures for detecting high-risk and indirect self-harm behaviors in veterans.

AB Introduction In the UK military, suicide is infrequent and studies of self-harm behavior in this population are rare. Objectives To compare lifetime self-harm rates estimated on three occasions between 2004 and 2016 and to explore the associates of lifetime self-harm. Method Three phases of a UK AF cohort study (n = 10,272, 9,990, and 8,581, respectively) provided data. Telephone interviews assessed associates of self-harm among cohort members who reported subjective mental health problems in the past 3 years (n = 1,448). Validated measures of mental health and related stigmatization, social support, and help-seeking were obtained. Results Lifetime self-harm increased significantly (p < .001) from 1.8% among serving personnel and 3.8% among veterans in 2004/06 to 1.9% and 4.5% in 2007/09 and to 4.2% and 6.6% in 2014/16 in the two groups, respectively. Veterans were consistently significantly more likely to report lifetime self-harm than serving personnel. Significant determinants of lifetime self-harm included current mental disorder symptoms, stigmatization, poor social support, suicidal ideation, and seeking help from formal medical sources. Conclusion Self-harm has increased over time in the UK serving and veteran community. Suicide prevention should focus on ameliorating mental disorder by encouraging engagement with health care, reducing negative views of mental illness, and fostering social support.

AB Introduction
   Returning veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan experience high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicidal behavior. Suicidal ideation is among the strongest risk factors for completed suicide. Some research suggests an association between PTSD and suicidal ideation, and that health-promoting behaviors behaviors that sustain or increase well-being play a role in this association. The current study examined whether health-promoting behaviors moderate the association between PTSD severity and suicidal ideation.
   Methods
   Veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF; N = 108) completed measures of PTSD symptoms, trauma exposure, suicidal ideation, and health promoting behaviors.
   Results
   Moderated regression was used to test the hypothesis. Results indicated that health promoting behaviors, beta = -.06, p = .001, and PTSD symptoms, beta = .36, p < .001, were significantly related to suicidal ideation. Consistent with our main hypothesis, the health promoting behaviors x PTSD interaction term was significantly associated with suicidal ideation, beta = -.09, p = .001. The overall model accounted for 13% of the variance in suicidal ideation. Among individuals with high PTSD symptom severity, those who engaged in more health promoting behaviors reported less suicidal ideation than those who engaged in fewer health promoting behaviors.
   Conclusions
   Health-promoting behaviors could be important for reducing suicidal ideation among veterans with high levels of PTSD symptoms. It is recommended that future research examine health promotion interventions as a means of reducing suicidal ideation.

AB This was a retrospective cohort study linking provincial administrative databases to compare rates of non-fatal self-harm between CAF and RCMP veterans living in Ontario and age-matched civilians. This study included male veterans who registered for provincial health insurance between 2002 and 2013. A civilian comparator group was matched 4:1 on age and sex. Self-harm emergency department (ED) visits were identified from provincial ED admission records until death or December 31, 2015. Multivariable Poisson regression compared the risk of self-harm. Analyses adjusted for age, geography, income, rurality, and major physical and mental comorbidities. In total, 9514 male veterans and 38,042 age- and sex-matched civilians were included. Overall, 0.55% of veterans had at least one non-fatal self-harm ED visit, compared with 0.81% of civilians. The rate of ED self-harm visits was 40% lower in the veteran population, compared to the civilian population (RR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.41-0.87). In both groups, psychosocial and physical comorbidities, and death by suicide were more common in those who self-harmed than those who did not. A better understanding of why veterans have a lower rate of self-harm emergency department visits and how it is related to the number of completed suicides is an important area for future consideration.

AB The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) School of Nursing and the Birmingham Veterans Affairs Medical Center (BVAMC) created a Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP) Residency Continuity Clinic tasked with providing Veteran-centric mental health outpatient treatment informed by measurement-based care (MBC) to provide quality outcomes. Approved by the BVAMC, the UAB Institutional Review Board also approved and exempted the project as quality improvement. PMHNP residents administered the Patient Stress Questionnaire (PSQ)-an MBC tool that incorporates validated tools for assessing depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, alcohol use, and pain-to each Veteran from March to August 2016. Patient outcomes focused on depression and anxiety. PSQ scores were reviewed retrospectively via descriptive statistics, paired t tests, and Wilcoxon signed ranks tests. Analysis showed improvement in depression and anxiety that approached significance, and in several national Veterans Affairs mental health performance measures, reinforcing the importance of using MBC in psychiatric assessment.

AB The mediating effects of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, negative mood, and social support on the relationship of war experiences to suicidality were examined. The research literature suggested a sequence among study scales representing these constructs, which was then tested on survey data obtained from a sample of National Guard soldiers (N = 4,546). Results from structural equation modeling suggested that war experiences may precipitate a sequence of psychological consequences leading to suicidality. However, suicidality may be an enduring behavioral health condition. War experiences showed no direct effects on postdeployment suicidality, rather its effect was indirect through PTSD symptoms and negative mood. War experiences were, however, predictive of PTSD symptoms, as would be expected. PSTD symptoms showed no direct effect on postdeployment suicidality, but showed indirect effects through negative mood. Results also suggested that suicidality is relatively persistent, at least during deployment and postdeployment. The percentage of those at risk for suicide was low both during and after deployment, with little association between suicidality and time since returning from deployment. Additionally, few soldiers were initially nonsuicidal and then reported such symptoms at postdeployment. Implications of relationships of both negative mood and combat trauma to suicidality are discussed, as well as possible mediating effects of both personal dispositions and social support on relationships of war experiences to PTSD, negative mood, and suicidality.

AB Introduction: Military veterans arc at heightened risk for developing mental and behavioral health problems. Morally injurious combat experiences have recently gained empirical and clinical attention following the increased rates of mental and behavioral health problems observed in this population. Objective: Extending extant research, the current investigation assessed the relationship between morally injurious experiences and mental and behavioral health outcomes. Furthermore, it examined the potential protective role of self-compassion in these relationships. Method: Participants were 203 military veterans (M age = 35.08 years, 77.30% male) who completed online questionnaires. Results: Analyses indicated that self-compassion significantly moderated the relationship between exposure to morally injurious experiences and posttraumatic stress disorder, depression severity, and deliberate self-harm versatility. Conclusions: These results highlight the potential clinical utility of self-compassion in military mental health, particularly in the context of morally injurious experiences.

AB During the last 30 years, there has been a substantial increase in the study of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Several high-profile traumatic events, such as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the terrorist attacks of September 11 on the World Trade Center, have led to a greater public interest in the risk and protective factors for PTSD. In this In Review paper, I discuss some of the important advances in PTSD. The paper provides a concise review of the evolution of PTSD diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, impact of PTSD in the community, an overview of the established risk factors for developing PTSD, and assessment and treatment. Throughout the paper, controversies and clinical implications are discussed.

AB To evaluate mental health status of the survivors with sulfur mustard (SM) induced severe lung injury (n = 291), Iranian standardized symptom checklist 90-revised (SCL90-R) questionnaire was used. The global severity index (GSI) was compared with the cutoff point of Iranian general population (0.4). About (32.9%, n = 96) had a positive history of previous psychiatric problems. Additional war-related injuries was observed in (89.4%, n = 261). The mean GSI (1.74 +/- 0.74) significantly was higher compared to standardized Iranian cutoff point (p<50.05). The highest means were observed for somatization (2.36 +/- 0.74), obsessive-compulsive (1.94 +/- 0.85), anxiety (1.87 +/- 0.94) and depression (1.8 +/- 0.88). Life satisfaction, hospitalization, previous psychiatric disorders and comorbidity were the most predictive variables for poor mental health (p<50.05).

AB This study examined combat and mental health as risk factors of suicidal ideation among 2854 U.S. soldiers returning from deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Data were collected as part of a postdeployment screening program at a large Army medical facility. Overall, 2.8% of soldiers reported suicidal ideation. Postdeployment depression symptoms were associated with suicidal thoughts, while postdeployment PTSD symptoms were associated with current desire for self harm. Postdeployment depression and PTSD symptoms mediated the association between killing in combat and suicidal thinking, while postdeployment PTSD symptoms mediated the association between killing in combat and desire for self harm. These results provide preliminary evidence that suicidal thinking and the desire for self-harm are associated with different mental health predictors, and that the impact of killing on suicidal ideation may be important to consider in the evaluation and care of our newly returning veterans.

AB We report findings from a 12-week randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial of methylphenidate or galantamine to treat emotional and cognitive complaints in individuals (n=32) with a history of PTSD, TBI, or both conditions. In this small pilot study, methylphenidate treatment was associated with clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement compared with placebo on the primary outcome, a measure of cognitive complaints (Ruff Neurobehavioral Inventory-Postmorbid Cognitive Scale), as well as on the secondary outcomes reflecting post-concussive (Rivermead Post Concussive Symptom Questionnaire) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist). Treatment was well tolerated. These results suggest the need for a larger RCT to replicate and confirm these findings. Design considerations for such a trial should include the need for multiple sites to facilitate adequate recruitment and extension of the treatment and follow-up periods.

AB Background: The Mental Health Clergy Partnership Program established partnerships between institutional (Department of Veterans' Affairs [VA] chaplains, mental health providers) and community (local clergy, parishioners) groups to develop programs to assist rural veterans with mental health needs.
   Objectives: Describe the development, challenges, and lessons learned from the Mental Health Clergy Partnership Program in three Arkansas towns between 2009 and 2012.
   Methods: Researchers identified:three rural Arkansas sites, established local advisory boards, and obtained quantitative ratings of the extent to which partnerships were participatory.
   Results: Partnerships seemed to become more participatory over time. Each site developed distinctive programs with variation in fidelity to original program goals. Challenges included developing trust and maintaining racial diversity in local program leadership.
   Conclusions: Academics can partner with local faith communities to create unique programs that benefit the mental health of returning veterans. Research is needed to determine the effectiveness of community based programs, especially relative to typical "top-down" outreach approaches.

AB Objective: The current study sought to investigate the effects of exposure therapy on suicidal ideation (SI), as well as potential mechanistic pathways of SI reduction among active duty military personnel.
   Methods: Active duty army soldiers (N = 162) were recruited from a military base in the U.S. and were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial comparing Prolonged Exposure (PE), Virtual Reality Exposure (VRE), and a wait list control for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) stemming from deployments to Iraq or Afghanistan. PTSD diagnosis followed DSM-IV-TR criteria. Outcome measures were assessed via self-report and clinician interview. PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, and SI were included in an autoregressive cross lagged panel model to examine mechanistic pathways.
   Results: Analyses revealed that PE/VRE had a lower probability of post-treatment suicidal ideation (OR = 0.23, 95% CI [0.06, 0.86]) compared to the waitlist control. Mediation analyses revealed a significant indirect effect from treatment condition to post-treatment PTSD symptoms through mid-treatment SI (Estimate = -1.420, 95% CI -3.559, -0.223]). Baseline suicidal ideation did not interact with treatment condition to predict PTSD symptom change at mid-treatment (p = .231) or post-treatment (p = .672).
   Conclusion: PE/VRE successfully reduced SI, and the presence of SI at baseline did not affect PTSD symptom reduction, promoting the utility of using PE/VRE to address suicidality among individuals with PTSD. Mediation analyses suggest that reductions in SI were achieved early in treatment.

AB The cumulative strain of 14 years of war on service members, veterans, and their families, together with continuing global threats and the unique stresses of military service, are likely to be felt for years to come. Scientific as well as political factors have influenced how the military has addressed the mental health needs resulting from these wars. Two important differences between mental health care delivered during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and previous wars are the degree to which research has directly informed care and the consolidated management of services. The U.S. Army Medical Command implemented programmatic changes to ensure delivery of high-quality standardized mental health services, including centralized workload management; consolidation of psychiatry, psychology, psychiatric nursing, and social work services under integrated behavioral health departments; creation of satellite mental health clinics embedded within brigade work areas; incorporation of mental health providers into primary care; routine mental health screening throughout soldiers' careers; standardization of clinical outcome measures; and improved services for family members. This transformation has been accompanied by reduction in psychiatric hospitalizations and improved continuity of care. Challenges remain, however, including continued underutilization of services by those most in need, problems with treatment of substance use disorders, overuse of opioid medications, concerns with the structure of care for chronic post-deployment (including postconcussion) symptoms, and ongoing questions concerning the causes of historically high suicide rates, efficacy of resilience training initiatives, and research priorities. It is critical to ensure that remaining gaps are addressed and that knowledge gained during these wars is retained and further evolved.

AB Accidents are a leading cause of deaths in U.S. active duty personnel. Understanding accident deaths during wartime could facilitate future operational planning and inform risk prevention efforts. This study expands prior research, identifying health risk factors associated with U.S. Army accident deaths during the Afghanistan and Iraq war.
   Military records for 2004-2009 enlisted, active duty, Regular Army soldiers were analyzed using logistic regression modeling to identify mental health, injury, and polypharmacy (multiple narcotic and/or psychotropic medications) predictors of accident deaths for current, previously, and never deployed groups.
   Deployed soldiers with anxiety diagnoses showed higher risk for accident deaths. Over half had anxiety diagnoses prior to being deployed, suggesting anticipatory anxiety or symptom recurrence may contribute to high risk. For previously deployed soldiers, traumatic brain injury (TBI) indicated higher risk. Two-thirds of these soldiers had first TBI medical-encounter while non-deployed, but mild, combat-related TBIs may have been undetected during deployments. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) predicted higher risk for never deployed soldiers, as did polypharmacy which may relate to reasons for deployment ineligibility.
   Health risk predictors for Army accident deaths are identified and potential practice and policy implications discussed. Further research could test for replicability and expand models to include unobserved factors or modifiable mechanisms related to high risk. PTSD predicted high risk among those never deployed, suggesting importance of identification, treatment, and prevention of non-combat traumatic events. Finally, risk predictors overlapped with those identified for suicides, suggesting effective intervention might reduce both types of deaths.

AB Objective: National Guard forces have deployed in large numbers to Iraq and Afghanistan since September 11, 2001. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to assess mental health symptoms, utilization of mental health services, and perceived barriers to service use among National Guard members and their significant others (including spouses and others with whom they share a committed relationship) from a Midwestern state. Methods: Participants were recruited for the study at military-sponsored reintegration workshops, which took place 45-90 days after service members' return from deployment. A sample of 332 National Guard members and 212 significant others volunteered to complete a survey that assessed mental health symptoms, service utilization, and barriers to treatment. Results: Forty percent of National Guard members and 34% of significant others met the screening criteria for one or more mental health problems. Of those meeting the criteria, 53% reported seeking help of some kind (50% of soldiers; 61% of significant others). Stigma associated with mental health care and concerns about service utilization appearing on military records ranked high as barriers among service members. Concerns about the influence of mental health issues on career advancement were of note. For significant others, barriers included the costs of mental health care, trouble with scheduling appointments, difficulty in getting time off work, and not knowing where to get help. Conclusions: The mental health effects of combat on the soldier and his or her significant other remain a challenge for National Guard families, who often reside in communities that show little understanding of the psychological costs of war. Barriers remain for mental health service utilization. (Psychiatric Services 62:28-34, 2011)

AB Background: The Iraq-Iran war was one of the longest conflicts in the twentieth century. The aim of our research was to review the incidence of mortality and injuries of the war.
   Methods: A search strategy was designed and run in Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, and Iranian databases including Scientific Information Database (SID), IranMedex, and Magiran. Also, searching grey literature, checking references, tracking citations, hand-searching of focused journals, and websites were utilized for retrieval of related studies. All of articles which studied epidemiology of mortality or injuries of the war were included. The excluding criteria were case reports, case series, laboratory researches, and nonoriginal studies.
   Results: Fourteen articles out of 1751 primary results were selected to be included in the study. During the war (1980 1988), 188,015 to 217,489 Iranians were killed (about 70 people per day). The mean age of mortality was 23 years. Six thousand four hundred twenty-seven (2.9 %) of those who died during the war were females. One thousand five chemical warfare victims died between 1983 and 1994. From 1985 through 1998, 82 veterans had successful suicides too. At the end of war, we had 398, 587 veterans who needed follow- up. Among them, there were 52,000 chemical warfare victims. Between 1988 and 2003, 1400 people died and 2313 injured due to landmines and unexploded ordnances in five border provinces.
   Conclusion: The war caused a lot of mortalities and morbidities in our country. Now, 24 years after the war, many physically, mentally, and chemically injured victims have remained. We suggest other studies about indirect impacts of the war on societies, families, friends, and affiliates of the victims.

AB Methylation of the SKA2 (spindle and kinetochore-associated complex subunit 2) gene has recently been identified as a promising biomarker of suicide risk. Based on this finding, we examined associations between SKA2 methylation, cortical thickness and psychiatric phenotypes linked to suicide in trauma-exposed veterans. About 200 trauma-exposed white non-Hispanic veterans of the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan (91% male) underwent clinical assessment and had blood drawn for genotyping and methylation analysis. Of all, 145 participants also had neuroimaging data available. Based on previous research, we examined DNA methylation at the cytosine guanine locus cg13989295 as well as DNA methylation adjusted for genotype at the methylation-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (rs7208505) in relationship to whole-brain cortical thickness, posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSD) and depression symptoms. Whole-brain vertex-wise analyses identified three clusters in prefrontal cortex that were associated with genotype-adjusted SI<A2 DNA methylation (methylation(adj)). Specifically, DNA methylation,(adj) was associated with bilateral reductions of cortical thickness in frontal pole and superior frontal gyrus, and similar effects were found in the right orbitofrontal cortex and right inferior frontal gyrus. PTSD symptom severity was positively correlated with SKA2 DNA methylation(adj) (a)nd negatively correlated with cortical thickness in these regions. Mediation analyses showed a significant indirect effect of PTSD on cortical thickness via SKA2 methylation status. Results suggest that DNA methylationadi of SKA2 in blood indexes stress-related psychiatric phenotypes and neurobiology, pointing to its potential value as a biomarker of stress exposure and susceptibility.

AB Study Objectives: Short sleep duration (SSD) is common among deployed soldiers. The prevalence of SSD during redeployment, however, is unknown.
   Design: Cross-sectional study of a brigade combat team (n = 3152 US Army soldiers) surveyed 90-180 days after completing a 6-15 month deployment to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). Survey items targeted sleep habits and comorbid medical conditions. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate adjusted odds ratios of medical comorbidities associated with SSD.
   Setting: US Army Infantry Post.
   Subjects: All soldiers from a redeploying brigade combat team participated in a health assessment between 90 and 180 days upon return to Ft. Lewis from Iraq.
   Inerventions: None.
   Measurements and Results: A total of 2738 (86.9%) soldiers answered questions regarding self-perceived sleep and were included in the analysis. Mean sleep duration was 5.8 +/- 1.2 hours. Nineteen hundred fifty-nine (72%) slept <= 6 h, but only 16% reported a daytime nap or felt their job performance was affected due to lack of sleep. Short sleep was more common among soldiers who reported combat exposure. After controlling for combat exposure, short behaviors such as abuse of tobacco and alcohol products, and suicide attempts.
   Conclusions: SSD is common among redeployed soldiers. Soldiers who experienced combat are at increased risk for persistent SSD and comorbidities associated with SSD. Efforts to reestablish good sleep habits and aggressive evaluation of soldiers with persistent SSD following deployment may aid in the prevention and management of associated medical conditions.

DT Article
DE MSBP in Iraq; Munchausen syndrome by proxy: A Novel presentation
ID ABUSE
AB Introduction: Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy or (Caregiver-fabricated illness in a child) is a form of child abuse which entails a child's illness induced by a caretaker; leading to a series of medical procedures and treatments that are unnecessary and potentially harmful as it may lead to significant morbidity and mortality.
   Result and Discussion: A 35 year old lady, was married twice. From the 1st marriage she had 2 children (18 year-daughter and 17-year-old son) and from the 2nd marriage she had a (3-year-old daughter). She was known to have social and marital problems and diagnosed as a case of depression and was on multiple antidepressants and attempted suicide several times. She is using her 6-year-old daughter and her 3-year-old grandson for visiting doctors 4-5 times a week. She had a relationship with a neighbor, a young man (SA) who was a driver and transported the mother and her daughter to hospital or the doctor's clinic. The reasons for doctor visits were different including urinary tract infection, otitis media, gastroenteritis, respiratory infections, different kinds of trauma etc.
   Conclusion: Munchausen syndrome by proxy is a complex type of abuse, usually misdiagnosed and under-diagnosed, and its sequelae have a significant impact. In Iraq, there are some reported cases of Munchausen syndrome by proxy but it is definitely underestimated. Its diagnosis is associated with social and legal problems concerning perpetrator parent, especially in the absence of a framework of formal rules. Health staff and investigators' adequate training is essential in revealing cases of Munchausen syndrome by proxy.

AB This study evaluated the effect of childhood trauma exposure and the role of resilience on both depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. The study evaluated 1,488 military personnel and veterans, who served after September 2001, for depressive, suicidal, and PTSD symptoms, combat exposure, childhood trauma exposure, and resiliency. Participants were enrolled as part of an ongoing multicenter study. Outcome measures were depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. After controlling for the effects of combat exposure and PTSD, results revealed that childhood trauma exposures were significantly associated with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. In addition, resilience was negatively associated with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, suggesting a potential protective effect. These findings suggest that evaluation of childhood trauma is important in the clinical assessment and treatment of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation among military personnel and veterans.

SO MISSION ACCOMPLISHED?: THE CRISIS OF INTERNATIONAL INTERVENTION
LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
AB With Iraq "over" and Afghanistan on the wane, it was if the age of intervention had run out of steam. It needed some new cause to espouse. It soon found one. On 17 December 2010, a young Tunisian street trader committed suicide in public in protest of harassment by local officials. His action sparked the first revolution of the so-called Arab Spring. It was followed by street riots in Algeria, Oman, Yemen, Syria and Morocco. Then on 25 January the occupation of Tahrir Square in Cairo began. Egypt was bigger than all the others put together. The Arab Spring, through still winter, had come of age.
   The international community greeted these protests with unashamed enthusiasm, but was unsure how to proceed. The uprisings seemed autonomous, mimicking each other but essentially local outpourings of domestic dissent. How might liberal interventionism respond to changes that appeared to be moving in the right direction but without external stimulus? In particular might intervention find a way to help events in Egypt, ruled by a regime so far regarded as friendly to the West yet sitting on a powder keg of 82 million Arabs?

AB Purpose: This article focuses on the ways rehabilitation nurses use the therapeutic relationship to lessen barriers some veterans experience when a referral to mental health treatment is recommended.
   Design: Veterans presenting with posttraumatic stress symptoms are discussed, and possible interventions within the therapeutic relationship are proposed.
   Method: Veterans' perception of mental health stigma, building a collaborative therapeutic relationship, recommending a referral and assessments of stress responses, posttraumatic stress symptoms, suicide risk, and intervention strategies are proposed.
   Findings: When changes in functioning and suicidality occur in veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, it is important to screen and engage veterans at risk.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: When veterans in the rehabilitation process present with a need for mental health referral, barriers to treatment may include the stigma of mental health treatment. Rehabilitation nurses using the therapeutic relationship act as change agents to assist veterans in overcoming these barriers to treatment. The therapeutic relationship provides nurses with a foundation to provide opportunities for veterans to be supported and to seek treatment.

AB Objective Preliminary research suggests that perceptions of institutional betrayal are associated with more severe symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, as well as suicide attempts in military sexual trauma (MST) survivors. However, results have not been replicated. Additionally, associations of institutional betrayal with specific PTSD symptom clusters or sexual function are understudied. Method Female service members/veterans who reported experiencing MST (N = 679) completed self-report measures of PTSD and depression symptom severity, suicidal ideation, and sexual function. Institutional betrayal was assessed from free-text descriptions of self-reported index traumas. Results Institutional betrayal was significantly associated with more severe depression and PTSD symptoms, including avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, re-experiencing, and dysphoric arousal. Conclusions Targeting specific PTSD and depressive symptoms through evidence-based treatment may be important for managing institutional betrayal sequelae. Future research should identify specific strategies to help support survivors in their recovery following institutional betrayal.

AB This study describes the epidemiology and patterns of moderate to severe burn injuries (%BSA >= 20-90) treated at the Italian Red Cross Hospital in Baghdad, Iraq, during the medical mission of the tenth Italian Red Cross Contingent, from 3 April to 19 May 2004. Burn injuries sustained by members of the civilian population admitted to the Burns Unit, irrespective of age and sex, are analysed (n = 48). Differences in risk distribution between different segments of the population are reported and typical injury patterns are identified. The six injury patterns identified are labelled "child scaldings", "domestic accidents", "unsafe working conditions", "suicide attempts", "injuries among children in role-play" and "war related injuries". The results show that burn injury incidence is particularly high for women and children. There is a pronounced difference between genders after adulthood (age 15 and up). The mortality rate is higher in females. Most of the burns occurred in the home: a public health education campaign might help reduce the incidence of these injuries. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

TI WHO IS BEHIND THE NAME? A STORY OF VIOLENCE, LOSS, AND MELANCHOLIC
   SURVIVAL IN POST-REVOLUTIONARY IRAN
SO JOURNAL OF MIDDLE EAST WOMENS STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper journeys along the theoretical and historical trajectories of the early stage of post-revolutionary Iran, marked by an external war with Iraq and internal political suppression. Specifically, it grapples with the intricacies of loss, mourning, and survival in the meanders of the life of a woman, a former leftist political prisoner, named Mahtab. Striving to unravel the pathos and aporias of Mahtab's life, this paper ponders the limits of the laws of polity and of kinship, and the "limit of reflexivity" (a phrase introduced by Judith Butler) that may have led to her suicide. Based on Mahtab's story and my ethnographic work with some of the surviving former women inmates, this paper engages with Sigmund Freud's notions of survival, mourning, and melancholia in light of their intertwined relationship to the reformation of the subject. I argue for the centrality of mourning and its limits and illustrate how historically shaped political ideals and gendered subjectivities are implicated and influential in determining the impossibility of survival.

AB The term resilience' has grown in its usage across a range of disciplines and practices. The US military and the British armed forces have typified this increasing use of resilience' in recent years within such initiatives as Comprehensive Soldier Fitness (CSF) and throughout British Army Doctrine. However by unpacking what being resilient' for soldiers might mean we explore the interaction between their personal masculine' characteristics, the structural environment within which they operate, and the civilian life they return to. In doing so this paper offers a critical sociological analysis combining the agency of the soldiers' body with the structure of the military as a [total institution] to problematize issues of masculinity, stigma and resilience within the military setting. As such, we question if the fostering of resilience' in military personnel is something that may be productive during service, but counter-productive thereafter when service personnel return to civilian life as veterans.

AB Drawing from 26 life story interviews of recent American veterans, this paper analyzes the identity struggle faced by soldiers returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom and reentering the civilian world. Instead of examining veterans' problems as a consequence of post-combat mental illnesses such as PTSD and major depression, we analyze the contrast between the participants' identities as soldiers and their identities as civilians. We find that the postwar transition causes adverse mental health effects that stem from contrasts between the military's demands for deindividuation, obedience, chain-of-command, and dissociation and the civilian identity expectations of autonomy, self-advocacy, and being relational. Veterans' reintegration to civilian society is further hindered by a culture that is perceived (by veterans) as having decreased understanding of the soldier/veteran experience itself. These identity conflicts-what we term warring identities-have an important yet understudied effect on veterans' combat-related mental health problems.

AB In the past decade, the Unites States and its allies have been challenged by a different kind of warfare, exemplified by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Although suicide bombings are the most often used form of terror, military personnel must consider a wide range of attack scenarios. Among these is the intentional poisoning of water supplies to obstruct military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. To counter such attacks, the military is developing portable analyzers that can identify and quantify potential chemical agents in water supplies at microgram per liter concentrations within 10 minutes. To aid this effort we have been investigating the value of a surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy based portable analyzer. In particular we have been developing silver-doped sol-gels to generate SER spectra of chemical agents and their hydrolysis products. Here we present SER spectra of several chemical agents measured in a generic tap water. Repeat measurements were performed to establish statistical error associated with SERS obtained using the sol-gel coated vials.

AB One afternoon, a patient who had been in three-times-weekly psychoanalytic psychotherapy for over five years with the author left the office after her session, drove down to the train tracks half a mile away, and sat down facing an oncoming train. Her suicide occurred a little over a year after 19 hijackers took over four passenger airplanes and flew two of them into the World Trade Center and during the period of the massive buildup for a pre-emptive war with Iraq. This paper explores the very personal impact of these interlocking events of personal, political, and state-sponsored terrorism on the author Interweaving the patient and the author personal struggle with the patient overwhelming destructiveness-and how it ultimately failed-with the inability to stop the war despite the unprecedented mobilization of voices for peace across the world, it is a journey through the shattering impact Of violence into the tentative discovery of a sustaining vision of hope. It explores the theme of terrorism, both personal and political, as a theater of violence designed to create maximum impact, and how fantasies of redemption, fueled and blinded by righteous certainty, can transmute into acts of breathtaking violence, and find justification in their own mad logic. Through the elaboration of the patient story and its impact on the author she offers a very personal attempt to understand and reckon with violence and destructiveness as manifested in these different forms, to grasp how openings of hope and new creative possibility are often followed by a violent regressive backlash, and to find a way to survive them without losing heart for the work.

AB BackgroundWe sought to compare trends of suicide-related behavior (SRB) before and after initiation of antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy among AED users (with and without epilepsy) to that of individuals without AED use controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and mental health comorbidity.MethodsWe used national Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data for post-9/11 veterans who received VHA care (2013-2014) without prior AED use. We conducted generalized estimation equation (GEE) analyses, stratified by epilepsy status and type of AED received, to assess the trend of SRB prevalence the year prior to and after the index date (date of first AED prescription/date of first health care encounter for non-AED users) controlling for sociodemographic factors and mental health comorbidity.ResultsThe GEE analysis showed significant curvilinear trends of SRB prevalence over the 24-month study period among the AED users, indicating that the probability of SRB diagnoses increased over time with a peak before the index month and decreased thereafter. Similar patterns were observed among non-AED users, but significantly lower odds for SRB. Among AED users, there were no significant differences by epilepsy status; however, higher SRB prevalence and differential SRB trajectory measures were observed among those who received AEDs with mood-stabilizing action.ConclusionsThe peak of SRB prior to and rapid reduction in SRB after initiation of AED, and the finding that individuals eventually prescribed a mood-stabilizing AED (vs other AED or levetiracetam) had higher odds of SRB, suggests a strong possibility that the relationship of AED and SRB is one of residual confounding.

AB Background: Suicide rates have risen considerably in the United States Army in the past decade. Suicide risk is highest among those with past suicidality (suicidal ideation or attempts). The incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive illnesses has risen concurrently in the U.S. Army. We examined the relationship of PTSD and depression, independently and in combination, and rates of past-year suicidality in a representative sample of U.S. Army soldiers.
   Methods: This study used the DoD Survey of Health Related Behaviors Among Active Duty Military Personnel (DoD HRB) (N=5927). Probable PTSD and depression were assessed with the PTSD Checklist (PCL) and the 10-item short form of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), respectively. Past-year suicidality was assessed via self-report.
   Results: Six percent of Army service members reported suicidality within the past year PTSD and MDD were each independently associated with past-year suicidality. Soldiers with both disorders were almost three times more likely to report suicidality within the past year than those with either diagnosis alone. Population-attributable risk proportions for PTSD, depression, and both disorders together were 24%, 29%, and 45%, respectively.
   Limitations: The current study is subject to the limitations of a cross-sectional survey design and the self-report nature of the instruments used.
   Conclusions: PTSD and depression are each associated with suicidality independently and in combination in the active duty component of the U.S. Army. Soldiers presenting with either but especially both disorders may require additional outreach and screening to decrease suicidal ideation and attempts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Our past lessons from war trauma have taught us that mental health-care stigma and other issues surrounding mental health-seeking behaviors can negatively impact the healing trajectory and long-term function for service members and their families. It can take years to decades before a service member seeks professional help for psychological distress, if he or she seeks it at all. Unfortunately, signs of personal and family problems can be subtle, and consequences, such as suicide, tragic. In this chapter, we consider the story one military health-care provider submitted in response to a study solicitation that read: Please provide your personal story telling me about any psychological distress you may have experienced after returning from deployment and your personal challenges accessing care and/or remaining in treatment. This story is analyzed to explore the moral implications of his experience for the military and for other service members. The main points to be highlighted are that altruism can leave altruists more vulnerable, military mental health stigma may exacerbate this risk, and military families may profoundly be affected.

AB Throughout America's first 145 years of war, far more of the country's military personnel perished from infectious diseases than from enemy action. This enduring feature of war was finally reversed in World War II, chiefly as a result of major medical advances in prevention (vaccines) and treatment (antibiotics). Safeguarding the health of a command is indispensable for the success of any campaign. Wars are lost by disease, which causes an enormous drain on the military's resources and affects both strategy and tactics. Disease and combat mortality data from America's principal wars (1775-present) fall into two clearly defined time periods: the Disease Era (1775-1918), during which infectious diseases were the major killer of America's armed forces, and the Trauma Era (1941-present), in which combat-related fatalities predominated. The trend established in World War II continues to the present day. Although there are currently more than 3,400 U.S. military fatalities in Iraq, the disease-death toll is so low that it is exceeded by the number of suicides.

AB Risky behavior including violence and aggression, self-injury, anger outburst, domestic violence along with self-injury, sexual abuse, rule-breaking, use of drugs and alcohol, suicide, etc. are alarming issues among US military veterans who return from combat zone deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan. Veterans are exposed to trauma in war zones which affect most of them with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other mental health problems to some degree. Studies have shown that veterans have much higher rates of PTSD than civilians and are more likely to engage in risky behavior. One of the forms of displaying and engaging in risky behaviors is through gestures. We collaborated with veterans and social scientists to find the list of 13 gestures that are often used by veterans engaged in risky behaviors.
   In this research work, we have collected accelerometer data from subjects performing the gestures mentioned above and have tried to detect them using machine learning techniques. This paper describes identifying gesture clusters from the accelerometer coordinate data and development of a predictive model that can classify the gestures resulting in the prediction of risky behaviors among the veterans who suffer from PTSD.

AB Objective: Concurrent and prospective predictors of suicidal ideation were examined in a sample of 318 United States Air Force Security Forces across a 1-year deployment in Iraq and 6- to 9-month follow-up. Method: Participants included 294 male and 24 female Airmen ranging in age from 18 to 46 years, predominantly (67%) Caucasian. Measures included self-reports of postdeployment suicidal ideation, posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms, alcohol use, combat experiences, relationship distress, social support, and postdeployment readjustment. Results: Problem drinking before deployment prospectively predicted postdeployment suicidal ideation in univariate analyses. Depressive symptoms and problem drinking were significant independent predictors of postdeployment suicidal ideation. Findings demonstrated a ninefold increase in suicidal ideation among service members with even mild depressive symptoms if moderate problem drinking was also present. Conclusions: Pre-deployment problem drinking may serve as a modifiable target for early intervention of suicidal ideation. Findings illuminate the compound risk of comorbid depressive symptoms and moderate problem drinking in predicting suicidal ideation. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Despite an increasing number of military service members in need of mental health treatment following deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan, numerous psychological and practical barriers limit access to care. Perceived stigma about admitting psychological difficulties as well as frequent long distances to treatment facilities reduce many veterans' willingness and ability to receive care. Telemedicine and virtual human technologies offer a unique potential to expand services to those in greatest need. Telemedicine-based treatment has been used to address multiple psychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and substance use, as well as to provide suicide risk assessment and intervention. Clinician education and training has also been enhanced and expanded through the use of distance technologies, with trainees practicing clinical skills with virtual patients and supervisors connecting with clinicians via videoconferencing. The use of these innovative and creative vehicles offers a significant and as yet unfulfilled promise to expand delivery of high-quality psychological therapies, regardless of clinician and patient location.

DE Amis; Islamism; Orientalism; tragedy; terrorism
AB This article puts forward a reading of Martin Amis's 2008 book The Second Plane with an emphasis on its cultural politics. It reconsiders Amis's book from a distance of almost a decade in light of recent global developments, including the rise of ISIS in the Middle East, the resurgence of acute Islamophobia in Europe and the US, and Tony Blair's public acknowledgement of the shortcomings of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. With these factors in mind, the essay argues that it is possible to detect in Amis's book early warning signs of how the West's relationship with both Islamism and Islam would develop in the period following its publication. Drawing on William Connolly's work on tragedy and Edward Said's work on Orientalism, the essay argues that The Second Plane ought to be read as advancing a hubristic 'neo-Orientalist' cultural and political agenda which today threatens to lock much of the world into an ongoing cycle of recrimination and revenge. Against this, a case is made for an appreciation of the complex circumstances which give rise to suicide terrorism and for a sense of history largely absent from Amis's writing on the subject.

AB Introduction: Published research indicates that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with increased mortality. However, causes of death among treatment-seeking patients with PTSD remain poorly characterized. The study objective was to describe causes of death among Veterans with PTSD to inform preventive interventions for this treatment population.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted for all Veterans who initiated PTSD treatment at any Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center from fiscal year 2008 to 2013. The primary outcome was mortality within the first year after treatment initiation. In 2018, collected data were analyzed to determine leading causes of death. For the top ten causes, standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated from age- and sex-matched mortality tables of the U.S. general population.
   Results: A total of 491,040 Veterans were identified who initiated PTSD treatment. Mean age was 48.5 (+/- 16.0) years, 90.7% were male, and 63.5% were of white race. In the year following treatment initiation, 1.1% (5,215/491,040) died. All-cause mortality was significantly higher for Veterans with PTSD compared with the U.S. population (SMR=1.05, 95% CI=1.02, 1.08, p<0.001). Veterans with PTSD had a significant increase in mortality from suicide (SMR=2.52, 95% CI=2.24, 2.82, p<0.001), accidental injury (SMR=1.99, 95% CI=1.83, 2.16, p<0.001), and viral hepatitis (SMR=2.26, 95% CI=1.68, 2.93, p<0.001) versus the U.S. population. Of those dying from accidental injury, more than half died of poisoning (52.3%, 325/622).
   Conclusions: Veterans with PTSD have an elevated risk of death from suicide, accidental injury, and viral hepatitis. Preventive interventions should target these important causes of death. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

AB IMPORTANCE There has been limited systematic examination of whether risk of suicide attempt (SA) among US Army soldiers is associated with time-related deployment variables, such as time in service before first deployment, duration of first deployment, and dwell time (DT) (ie, length of time between deployments).
   OBJECTIVE To examine the associations of time-related deployment variables with subsequent SA among soldiers who had deployed twice.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using administrative data from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2009, this longitudinal, retrospective cohort study identified person-month records of active-duty Regular Army enlisted soldiers who had served continuously in the US Army for at least 2 years and deployed exactly twice. The dates of analysis were March 1 to December 1, 2017. There were 593 soldiers with a medically documented SA during or after their second deployment. An equal-probability sample of control person-months was selected from other soldiers with exactly 2 deployments (n = 19 034). Logistic regression analyses examined the associations of time in service before first deployment, duration of first deployment, and DT with subsequent SA.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Suicide attempts during or after second deploymentwere identified using US Department of Defense Suicide Event Report records and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification E950 to E958 diagnostic codes. Independent variables were constructed from US Army personnel records.
   RESULTS Among 593 SA cases, most were male (513 [86.5%]), white non-Hispanic (392 [66.1%]), at least high school educated (477 [80.4%]), currently married (398 [67.1%]), and younger than 21 years when they entered the US Army (384 [64.8%]). In multivariable models adjusting for sociodemographics, service-related characteristics, and previous mental health diagnosis, odds of SA during or after second deployment were higher among soldiers whose first deployment occurred within the first 12 months of service vs after 12 months (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.6-2.4) and among those with a DT of 6 months or less vs longer than 6 months (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0). Duration of first deployment was not associated with subsequent SA. Analysis of 2-way interactions indicated that the associations of early deployment and DT with SA risk were not modified by other characteristics. Multivariable population-attributable risk proportions were 14.2% for deployment within the first 12 months of service and 4.0% for DT of 6 months or less.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Time in service before first deployment and DT are modifiable risk factors for SA risk among soldiers.

AB High rates of attrition occur in outpatient and inpatient evidence-based treatments (EBTs) targeting newly returning veterans from Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation New Dawn (OND) with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Traditionally, research has examined attrition as a dichotomous variable (i.e., noncompleters vs. completers) and focused almost exclusively on outpatient EBTs for PTSD. These studies have provided little information to inpatient psychiatric providers about timing-related predictors of treatment discontinuation. The present study attempted to mend these gaps by examining attrition as a continuous variable and investigated predictors of length of stay (LOS) among 282 OEF/OIF/OND male veterans, 69 of which did not complete the full 25-day intensive, multimodal inpatient PTSD EBT program. At admission, participants completed a series of clinician-rated, biological, and self-report assessments. Linear regression analyses were used to identify predictors of shorter LOS. The results demonstrated that less improvement in symptom reduction, overall functioning, and greater number of drugs used at admission were significant and unique predictors of shorter LOS. Overall, these findings reveal clinically relevant, timing-related predictors of attrition and provide generalizable clinical information to inpatient psychiatric providers.

AB The wars on terrorism are exposing our military personnel to unprecedented levels of psychological injury. And yet, nearly a decade in, we remain unprepared to handle the growing numbers of personnel seeking treatment. Several factors seem to be implicated. The first is our defense personnel policy. By choosing an approach that requires longer and more frequent redeployments, we have inadvertently increased the risk to our troops of sustaining psychological wounds, including moral injury. Second, in the wars on terrorism, combatants do not wear identifying marks. They often hide among civilians, increasing the risk of inadvertent civilian casualties, another source of moral injury. Third, and perhaps ironically, when military personnel know that they have hit their target-as is the case with drone pilots and among personnel involved in close combat-they are at greater risk to develop posttraumatic stress disorder, even when the target is a known enemy combatant. Meanwhile, military suicides have reached a record high, outnumbering combat deaths in Afghanistan. As we get better at keeping wounded warriors alive, we need to get better, and more serious, about developing tools for healing injuries to the mind and brain. This article proposes that research focus on therapies tailored to mitigate shame and guilt, the hallmarks of moral injury.

DT Article
DE ISIS; apocalypse; conspiracy; jihadism; Indonesia; terrorism
AB The impact of apocalyptic and conspiracist discourses on Indonesian jihadi thinking and behaviour has been little studied, but evidence in recent years is mounting that it has been significant. Many Indonesians who joined Islamic State forces in Syria and Iraq from 2013 were driven in part by a belief that the final cataclysmic battle between Islam and its foes would occur there imminently, and the families responsible for the 2018 Surabaya suicide bombing which killed more than two dozen people were convinced that the world would soon end. This article examines Indonesia's contemporary apocalyptic literature, with an emphasis on the two main genres: populist and jihadist. It argues that the populist forms, though sensational, highly conspiratorial and commercially motivated, are more insidious than commonly assumed, and can have a "priming effect" upon radicalizing readers by deepening their sense of crisis and grievance, thus inclining them to extreme views and actions. Jihadi apocalypticism has a stronger scholarly basis, but is subject to serious debate and some scepticism within Islamist circles. For some jihadis, such discourses bring a compelling urgency that triggers violence, but for others, apocalypticism is viewed more warily due to the risk that it impairs judgement and leads to erroneous strategies.

AB We evaluated the impact of brief structured suicidal ideation (SI) assessments on mental health care among new-to-care Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) veterans. National datasets provided military, demographic, and clinical information. For all new-to-care OEF/OIF veterans administered depression screens (PHQ-2: Patient Health Questionnaire-2) and structured SI assessments in primary care or ambulatory mental health settings of three Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers between April 2008 and September 2009 (N=465), generalized estimating equations were used to examine associations between SI and number of subsequent-year specialty mental health visits and antidepressant prescriptions. Approximately one-third of the veterans reported SI. In multivariate models, PTSD and anxiety diagnoses, severe depression symptoms, being married, and SI assessment by a mental health clinician were associated with more mental health visits in the subsequent year. Depression, PTSD, and anxiety diagnoses, and SI assessment by a mental health clinician were associated with receiving antidepressants. Presence of SI did not significantly affect subsequent year mental health utilization when adjusting for diagnostic and clinician variables, but inaugural visits involving mental health clinicians were consistently associated with subsequent mental health care.

AB Veteran community reintegration (VCR) difficulties impact personal, interpersonal, educational/occupational, and community aspects of returning military service members. Sense of community (SOC), an individual's feeling of membership, influence, need fulfillment, and emotional connection, is the theoretical underpinnings for community-based practice interventions used with this population. This study investigates the mediating role of SOC on the relationship between mental health risk factors (PTSD, depression, and suicidal ideation), employment status, and VCR difficulties among military veterans. Data used in this study (N = 131) were collected by the authors for an outcome evaluation study in 2013. Results found a statistically significant path from depression to SOC and a significant and direct path from SOC to VCR difficulties, suggesting that veterans who are connected to their local communities may be more at risk for depression and VCR difficulties. Practice implications suggest social workers should look beyond the local community as a resilience factor for military veterans and explore more culturally relevant responses (such as veteran support at public universities, individual social support, and local/virtual military support groups). Future research should continue the search for resilient factors among this millennial generation of returning military veterans.

AB Despite efforts to elucidate the relationship between traumatic event exposure and adverse mental health outcomes, our ability to understand why only some trauma-exposed individuals become emotionally affected remains challenged. The aim of the current study is to determine the relations between social support, religiosity, and number of lifetime traumatic events experienced on past-12 month posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and suicidal ideation (SI) in a nationally representative sample of Canadian Forces personnel. The current study used data from the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 1.2 - Canadian Forces Supplement. The impact of a number of predictive and mediating factors was assessed using structural equation modeling. Social support and number of lifetime traumatic events experienced were significant predictors of past-year PTSD, depression, and SI; however PTSD did not mediate the relationship between number of traumatic events and SI nor between social support and SI. Conversely, depression mediated the relationship between number of traumatic events and SI. Possible mechanisms for these findings and their implications are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objectives. We (1) compared use of various health services nationally between Asian American and Pacific Islander (AA/PI) veterans and veterans of other racial/ethnic groups and (2) specifically compared perceived barriers and stigma related to mental health services.
   Methods. Using bivariate and multivariable statistics, we analyzed a population-weighted sample of 8315 veterans from the 2010 National Survey of Veterans and a random sample of 567 recent veterans from Hawaii.
   Results. A total of 1.5% of veterans were AA/PI compared with 0.4% a decade ago. Compared with other veterans, AA/PI veterans reported higher socioeconomic status and better mental health, although these findings may be specific to AA veterans. Adjusting for sociodemographic and health differences, we found no differences in health service use or perceived barriers or stigma related to mental health services.
   Conclusions. AA/PIs are a small but fast-growing racial/ethnic group within the veteran population that deserves attention. Although veteran status may be protective against some barriers to mental health care found in the general AA/PI population, efforts to reduce barriers to health care among veterans should be continued.

AB This article is a primer to understand the medical advances and the future health care consequences of the current conflicts in the Middle East and Southwest Asia, known as the Global War on Terror. There have been significant advances in health care learned in caring for those injured by the conflict-often a polytrauma blast victim, but there are also very high incidence rates of the hidden injuries of war-traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicide, and depression. These lead to disruptive behaviors, homelessness, and family violence. Global War on Terror returnees are using medical services and applying for disability at higher rates than in previous conflicts. The costs for veterans' care may peak 30 to 40 years or longer following the conflict, and will inflict an enormous burden on services and resources. The effects of the war will linger for years and impact across generations because of the stress on families and children. We must mobilize government agencies, create public-private partnerships, and invest our resources now to mitigate the approaching tsunami of veterans' health care needs, the impact on our social services, and the devastating costs to society.

AB Compelling evidence has emerged on the association between military sexual trauma and suicide attempt; however, research investigating how sexual trauma during deployment relates to suicidal ideation has received considerably less attention and has yielded mixed findings. Furthermore, such research has not accounted for other types of trauma that may occur during deployment. Our objectives were to examine whether sexual trauma during deployment was associated with recent suicidal ideation, adjusting for exposure to combat. Our sample included 199 Operation Enduring Freedom/Iraqi Freedom/New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) veterans entering inpatient trauma-focused treatment who completed the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (Beck & Steer, ) and the Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory Sexual Harassment and Combat Experiences Scales (King, King, Vogt, Knight, & Samper, ). Deployment-related sexual trauma was significantly associated with recent suicidal ideation, adjusting for age and gender ( = .18, (2)(p) = .03) and additionally for combat ( = .17, (2)(p) = .02). These findings underscore the importance of assessing for deployment-related sexual trauma when assessing suicide risk in OEF/OIF/OND veterans in inpatient settings.
   Resumen Trauma Sexual, Combate e Ideacion Suicida Evidencia convincente ha surgido sobre la asociacion entre trauma sexual militar e intento suicida; sin embargo, la investigacion de como el trauma sexual durante el despliegue se relaciona con la ideacion suicida ha recibido considerablemente menos atencion y ha arrojado resultados mixtos. Ademas, tal investigacion no ha dado cuenta de otros tipos de trauma que pueden ocurrir durante el despliegue. Nuestros objetivos fueron investigar si el trauma sexual durante el despliegue estaba asociado a ideacion suicida reciente, ajustando por exposicion a combate. Nuestra mezcla incluyo 199 veteranos OEF/OIF/OND hospitalizados para tratamiento focalizado en el trauma, que completaron la Escala de Beck para Ideacion Suicida, el Inventario de Riesgo de Despliegue y Resiliencia, y las escalas de Acoso Sexual y de Experiencias de Combate. El trauma asociado a despliegue se asocio en forma significativa a ideacion suicida reciente, ajustando por edad y genero ( = .18, p 2 = .03) y adicionalmente por combate ( = .17, p 2 = .02). Estos hallazgos subrayan la importancia de considerar el trauma asociado a despliegue al evaluar riesgo suicida en veteranos OEF/OIF/OND en contexto de hospitalizacion.

AB ObjectivesCurrent regional conflicts are creating a surge in forced migration, and heightened visa restrictions are increasingly being applied. The current study aimed to examine the relationship between visa insecurity and psychological outcomes within a large clinical sample of refugees and people seeking asylum in Australia.MethodsThe sample comprised 781 clients (53.9% male, 16-93years) attending a clinic for trauma survivors. Country of birth was most frequently identified as Afghanistan (18.1%), Iraq (15.3%) and Iran (15.1%). The Hopkins Symptom Checklist was administered at admission.ResultsLatent class analyses identified four groups varying in severity of symptoms, namely very high (16.1%), high (38.1%), moderate (31.5%), and low (14.3%). People with insecure visa status were at least five times more likely to report high (OR=5.86, p<0.001) or very high (OR=5.27, p<0.01) depression and anxiety symptoms than those with permanent residency. Women were almost twice as likely to report high (OR=1.96 p<0.01) or very high (OR=1.96, p<0.05) symptoms.ConclusionsThe findings suggest that temporary visas play a significant role in psychological distress and that timely immigration processing has important implications for health outcomes.

AB Although posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychiatric symptoms are well-established risk factors for suicidal ideation among returning veterans, less attention has been paid to whether the stress of reintegrating into civilian society contributes to suicidal ideation. Utilizing a sample of 232 returning veterans (95% male, mean age=33.63years) seeking PTSD treatment, this study tested whether reintegration difficulties contribute to suicidal ideation over and above the influence of PTSD symptoms, depression symptoms, and potential substance misuse. Logistic regressions indicated that reintegration stress had a unique effect on suicidal ideation over and above PTSD and depression symptoms. Reintegration stress interacted with substance misuse to predict suicidal ideation, such that the effect of reintegration stress on suicidal ideation was much larger for those with potential substance misuse. Exploratory analyses also examined which types of reintegration difficulties were associated with suicidal ideation, and found that difficulty maintaining military friendships, difficulty getting along with relatives, difficulty feeling like you belong in civilian society, and difficulty finding meaning/purpose in life were all significantly associated with suicidal ideation, beyond the effects of psychiatric symptoms and potential substance misuse. Findings highlight the importance of addressing reintegration stress for the prevention of suicide among returning veterans. Implications for treatment are discussed.

AB With involvement in two wars over the past decade, there has been a documented increase in depression prevalence and suicide incidence among U. S. military veterans. Because higher proportions of veterans come from rural communities, access to care may be an issue when behavioral health care is needed. Although the Veterans Administration has expanded health services in rural areas, this has not always resulted in increased service utilization. This study examined the prevalence of depression and associated health service deficits (HSDs) for rural versus nonrural U.S. military veterans. Using bivariate and multivariate techniques, 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data were analyzed. Bivariate analysis revealed that rural veterans had greater odds of having at least one HSD, being currently depressed as measured by the Personal Health Questionnaire-8, and having lifetime depression. Logistic regression analysis confirmed that rural veterans had higher odds of both current and lifetime depression than nonrural veterans when controlling for socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity. Additionally, logistic regression analysis also revealed that rural veterans with current depression had higher odds of being Hispanic or Other/Multiracial than Caucasian, not employed for wages than employed for wages, <65 years of age, and reported having at least one HSD.

AB Severe mercury intoxication is very rare in developed countries, but still occurs as the result of volatile substance abuse, suicide attempts, occupational hazards, or endemic food ingestion as reported in the cases of public health disasters in Iraq and in Minamata Bay, Japan. Here, we describe the dramatic physical and cognitive decline of a 23-year-old patient caused by a severe methyl mercury (MeHg) intoxication of unknown origin. We show serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the patient's brain, as well as ex vivo analyses of blood and cerebrospinal fluid including multicolor flow cytometric measurements, functional assays of hemostaseologic efficacy, and evaluation of regulatory effector molecules. Together with the clinical history, our findings show the progressive neuronal degeneration accompanying the deterioration of the patient. Moreover, the ex vivo analyses display alterations of thrombocyte function and coagulation, as well as an immunological milieu facilitating autoimmunity. Despite the successful reduction of the MeHg concentration in the patient's blood with erythrocyte apheresis and chelator therapy, his condition did not improve and led to a persistent vegetative state. This case illustrates the neurotoxicity of MeHg following severe intoxication for the first time by serial MRI. Data on immune-cell and thrombocyte function as well as on coagulation in mercury poisoning reveal potential implications for anticoagulation and immunomodulatory treatment.

AB The study presents early findings from an ongoing pilot study of a cognitive-behavioral treatment for assisting active-duty military members with deployment-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) designed for use by psychologists working in an integrated primary care clinic. Treatment protocol is based primarily on Prolonged Exposure but also includes elements of Cognitive Processing Therapy that were adapted for use in primary care. Individuals were recruited from the population of patients consulted to the psychologist by primary care providers during routine clinical care. The 15 participants include active-duty or activated reserve Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom veterans seeking help for deployment-related PTSD symptoms, with a PTSD Checklist-Military Version score 32, and interest in treatment for PTSD in primary care. Baseline and 1-month posttreatment follow-up evaluations were conducted by an independent evaluator. Five participants (33%) dropped out of the intervention after one or two appointments. Using the last observation carried forward for intent-to-treat analyses, the results showed that PTSD severity, depression, and global mental health functioning all significantly improved with the intervention. Fifty percent of treatment completers no longer met criteria for PTSD.

TI Sentiment Analysis for PTSD Signals Introduction
SO SENTIMENT ANALYSIS FOR PTSD SIGNALS
SE SpringerBriefs in Computer Science
LA English
DT Editorial Material; Book Chapter
AB Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition triggered by seeing or experiencing an event that caused or threatened serious harm or death (National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), 2007. http://www.nimh.nih. gov/health/publications/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-research-fact-sheet/index. shtml; Mayo Clinic, 2011. http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/post-traumaticstress- disorder/DS00246). PTSD can be difficult to diagnose, but if left untreated, it can lead to a variety of serious personal, familial, and societal problems (e.g., domestic violence, suicide, unemployment). Current available therapeutic interventions for PTSD and major depression vary substantially in their effectiveness. Major impediments to the development of transformational interventions include a lack of basic disease-level knowledge, availability of biomarkers and translational tools, the clinical evidence to identify patients at-risk, and absence of personalized treatment approaches. The governments of the United States, United Kingdom and other countries have identified PTSD as a serious condition affecting many Service members returning from deployments. Many organizations have identified the need to develop new methods for detection and analysis of symptoms and for outreach to Service members suffering from psychological illnesses including PTSD. At present, a large percentage of Service members returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer clinical levels of major depressive disorder and/or PTSD. This book presents technologies demonstrating high accuracy in detection of PTSD signals in textual documents.

TI Erosion of the healthy soldier effect in veterans of US military service

AB Background: This research explores the healthy soldier effect (HSE) - a lower mortality risk among veterans relative to the general population-in United States (US) veterans deployed in support of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan (OEF/OIF/OND). While a HSE has been affirmed in other OEF/OIF/OND populations, US veterans of OEF/OIF/OND have not been systematically studied.
   Methods: Using US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative data, we identified veterans who (1) had been deployed in support of OEF/OIF/OND between 2002 and 2011 and (2) were enrolled in the VA health care system. We divided the VA population into VA health care utilizers and non-utilizers. We obtained Department of Defense (DOD) administrative data on the OEF/OIF/OND population and obtained VA and DOD mortality data excluding combat deaths from the analyses. Indirect standardization was used to compare VA and DOD cohorts to the US population using total population at risk to compute the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR). A directly standardized relative risk (DSRR) was calculated to enable comparisons between cohorts. To compare VA enrollee mortality on military specific characteristics, we used a DOD population standard.
   Results: The overall VA SMR of 2.8 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 2.8-2.9), VA utilizer SMR of 3.2 (95% CI 3.1-3.3), VA non-utilizer SMR of 0.9 (95% CI 0.8-1.1), and DOD SMR of 1.5 (95% CI 1.4-1.5) provide no evidence of a HSE in any cohort relative to the US standard population. Relative to DOD, both the total VA population SMR of 2.1 (95% CI 2.0-2.2) and the SMR for VA utilizers of 2.3 (95% CI 2.3-2.4) indicate mortality twice what would be expected given DOD mortality rates. In contrast, the VA enrollees who had not used clinical services had 40% lower than expected mortality relative to DOD.
   Conclusions: No support was found for the HSE among US veterans of OEF/OIF/OND. These findings may be attributable to a number of factors including post-deployment risk-taking behavior, an abbreviated follow up period, and the nature of the OEF/OIF/OND conflict.

AB Objective: To identify preinjury variables related to mental health treatment utilization at 2 years post-traumatic brain injury (TBI). Setting: Veterans Affairs (VA) TBI Model Systems includes 5 VA Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers. Participants: Veterans and service members enrolled in TBI Model Systems who completed the year 2 follow-up assessment and provided mental health information. Sample was largely male (97%) and White (72%), with median age of 30 years. Design: Participants with elevated mental health symptoms were identified by measures of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic distress; suicide attempt in the past year; or problematic substance use in the past year. Forty-seven percent of participants had elevated mental health symptoms at 2 years postinjury. Among those with elevated symptoms, comparisons were made between those who sought mental health treatment in past year and those who did not. Main Measures: Demographic, historic, environmental, psychological/mental health, and injury/rehabilitation variables. Results: Within the sample, 23% denied utilizing mental health services. Nonutilizers were more likely to deny a preinjury mental health treatment history, to report problematic substance use at year 2, and to report lower levels of internalizing symptoms than the treatment utilizers. Conclusion: Veterans and service members with elevated mental health symptoms may require tailored tactics to promote treatment utilization post-TBI.

TI MODERATE ISLAM AS A SOLUTION TO PLURALISM IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD: THE

DT Article
DE Moderate Islam; Moderate Muslims; Pluralism; Nahdlatul Ulama
AB This study examines the phenomenon occuring in the Islamic world in particular, where religion is experiencing serious self-destructive divisions caused by uncontrolled interests in theology, socio-political and economic matters. This can be seen in several Middle Eastern countries such as Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan where there are numerous suicide bombings and mass killings among groups who are all Muslims. Indonesia as the world's largest Muslim country is trying to protect itself from these undesirable threats, especially those of disunity and separation. This is more so due to the very nature of Indonesia that uniquely has a variety of religions, cultures, languages, customs, ethnic groups and tribes. Based on facts derived from observation and documentation this paper attempts to analyse the phenomenon. The results of the analysis show that Indonesia through the two most dominant religious organizations, namely Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah, has developed moderate Islam as a response to its multicultural and multireligious diversity. Moderate Islam is based on the teachings of Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama 'ah in the fields of law, theology and mysticism which are characterized by tolerance, moderation and acceptance of the existence of others. The moderate Islam model followed by these two religious organizations has been accepted globally through the opening of their branches in several Western countries and the Middle East, thus proving that it can be a solution for creating peace and harmony in the world.

AB The Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center, U. S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, in conjunction with the American Telemedicine Association's Annual Mid-Year Meeting, conducted a 1-day workshop on how maturing and emerging processes and applications in the field of telemental health (TMH) can be expanded to enhance access to behavioral health services in the Pacific Rim. The purpose of the workshop was to bring together experts in the field of TMH from the military, federal agencies, academia, and regional healthcare organizations serving populations in the Pacific Rim. The workshop reviewed current technologies and systems to better understand their current and potential applications to regional challenges, including the Department of Defense and other federal organizations. The meeting was attended by approximately 100 participants, representing military, government, academia, healthcare centers, and tribal organizations. It was organized into four sessions focusing on the following topic areas: (1) Remote Screening and Assessment; (2) Post-Deployment Adjustment Mental Health Treatment; (3) Suicide Prevention and Management; and (4) Delivery of Training, Education, and Mental Health Work Force Development. The meeting's goal was to discuss challenges, gaps, and collaborative opportunities in this area to enhance existing or create new opportunities for collaborations in the delivery of TMH services to the populations of the Pacific Rim. A set of recommendations for collaboration are presented.

AB The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides health care services to a growing number of veterans. There is ample support for the use of technology-based self-screening to support health care delivery. We developed the VA eScreening program for veterans to directly provide self-report mental and physical health information through a veteran-facing portal that communicates with the electronic medical records system. A total of 1,372 newly enrolling veterans in 2 cohorts participated in a study to assess veteran satisfaction, determine accessibility and clinical processes, measure screening differences, and examine connection to care between eScreening and paper screening. Veterans who completed eScreening were slightly more satisfied with screening than those who completed paper screening. Accessibility, rate of screening completion, and clinical processes were significantly better with eScreening than paper screening. Except for higher alcohol use in the paper-based cohort, veterans who completed paper and eScreening were similar in the rates of positive health screens. Connection to VA services, rate and speed of vesting in the health care system, and time to document required suicide risk assessments were better with the VA eScreening program than paper screening. The VA eScreening program is a unique and promising tool that may leverage limited resources to improve screening and care for veterans.

AB Despite research findings that similar numbers of male and female veterans are affected by military sexual trauma (MST), there has been considerably less research on the effects of MST specific to male veterans. The aim of the present study was to provide preliminary data describing functional correlates of military sexual assault (MSA) among male Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans to identify potential health care needs for this population. We evaluated the following functional correlates: posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression symptoms, alcohol use, drug use, suicidality, social support, violent behavior in the past 30 days, incarceration, disability eligibility status, and use of outpatient mental health treatment. We compared 3 groups: (a) male veterans who endorsed a history of MSA (n = 39), (b) a general non-MSA sample (n = 2,003), and (c) a matched non-MSA sample (n = 39) identified by matching algorithms on the basis of factors (e.g., age, education, adult premilitary sexual trauma history, childhood sexual and physical trauma history, and race) that could increase veterans' vulnerability to the functional correlates examined. MSA in men was associated with greater PTSD symptom severity, greater depression symptom severity, higher suicidality, and higher outpatient mental health treatment, above and beyond the effects of vulnerability factors. These findings suggest that, for male veterans, MSA may result in a severe and enduring overall symptom profile requiring ongoing clinical management.

AB Gunshot wounds are rare in Germany and are mostly the result of suicide attempts or improper handling of weapons. The resulting injuries involve extensive tissue damage and complications which are thus unique and require a differentiated approach. As trauma centers may be confronted with gunshot wounds at any time, treatment principles must be understood and regularly reevaluated.
   Due to Bundeswehr operations abroad and the treatment of patients from other crisis regions a total of 85 gunshot wounds in 64 patients were treated between 2005 and 2011. In the majority of cases the lower extremities were affected and we were able to carry out treatment to preserve the extremities. In this article we report on our experiences and the results of treatment of gunshot wounds to the lower extremities.
   This part of the article deals with the epidemiology and pathophysiology of gunshot wounds to the lower extremities. By means of an evaluation of microbiological findings in a subgroup of patients involved in a civil war (n = 10), the problem of multidrug resistant pathogen contamination, colonization and infection is discussed. In addition to a description of initial and emergency treatment of gunshot wounds, measures required for further treatment and decontamination are presented. Finally, the results are discussed with reference to the literature in this field.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence, correlates, and symptom profiles of depressive disorders in men with a history of military service.
   Data were obtained from the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify correlates of lifetime and current depression. Regularly occurring symptom profiles were identified via cluster analysis.
   Prevalence of lifetime and current depression was similar in men with and without a history of military service. Younger age was positively, and black minority status, being in a relationship and self-reported good health were negatively associated with a lifetime diagnosis of depression. Other minority status (non-Hispanic, non-black) was positively, and older age, some college, being in a relationship, and self-reported good health were negatively associated with current depression. A cluster of younger men who experience significant depressive symptoms but may not report depressed mood or anhedonia was identified.
   Depression is as prevalent in men with a history of military service as it is in men without a history. Research should focus on subpopulations of men with a history of military service in which depression may be more prevalent or burdensome. Younger men with significant depressive symptoms may be missed by standard depression screens and still be at elevated risk for negative outcomes associated with depression.

AB This paper reports on a systematic review undertaken in 2013 aimed at identifying evidence and dismissing some of the myths surrounding the needs of the veteran community. Papers were retrieved from a wide range of sources to ensure that literature covered the key areas of health concerns and focused also on time spent in service. Of the twenty eight papers reviewed categories relating to mental health (including PTSD and suicide), the use of alcohol, trauma, hearing loss, cancer and obesity were identified. Outcomes from the review established that while early service leavers were the most vulnerable there were also aspects within service that had an impact on future life events such as the type of leadership experienced, the cohesion of the unit and facing combat situations. The use of alcohol as a coping mechanism is also considered prevalent with adverse effects as is the worry of family situations at home. The impact of service life on the veteran, especially if suffering trauma will have long lasting psychological and physical outcomes, although it is recognised that veterans in the main have excellent physical and psychological strength and many physical illnesses are not greatly exaggerated from that of the general public.

AB Circumstances of modern wars have placed service members at risk for harming noncombatants and engaging in other possible morally injurious acts. Studying a sample of 1,203 combat veterans from the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study (NVVRS), this investigation used structural equation modeling (SEM) to test (1) whether experiences of abusive violence are positively directly linked with drug or alcohol problems and suicidality when accounting for traditional combat stressors, and (2) to what extent experiences of abusive violence have positive indirect effects on these postdeployment outcomes via posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and war-related guilt. Overall, 40% of the sample had witnessed or were directly involved in acts of abusive violence while deployed in Vietnam. When controlling for the effects of traditional combat stressors, SEM results revealed that exposure to acts of abusive violence in Vietnam was linked indirectly with substance abuse via PTSD symptoms and both directly and indirectly with suicidality via PTSD symptoms. There was also a significant link between atrocity exposure and war-related guilt in the model, but veterans' remorse about behavior in Vietnam failed to uniquely predict study outcomes beyond the symptomatology of PTSD. These findings highlight the effects of disproportionate warzone violence on postdeployment mental health, while also suggesting the need for broader conceptual models of combat trauma.

AB Suicide rates among military veterans exceed those found in the general population. While the exact reasons for these high rates are unknown, contributing factors may include the military's perceived rejection of patient identities, creating barriers to mental health care within the clinical sector and a mandate for prevention programs. Spiritual fitness has emerged over the last decade as an important concept in human performance optimization and is included among holistic approaches to developing and maintaining mentally fit fighting forces. In attempts to better understand the role that spiritual fitness and religion play in mitigating and/or reducing suicide risk among veterans, the aims of this study were twofold (1) to assess the utility of the Duke Religion Index as a psychometric instrument for use with veterans completing spiritual fitness training and (2) to offer a post-intervention process evaluation of the spiritual fitness module from one resilience program offered to military veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan in 2016. Twenty-eight attendees at the JRWI Wellness Resilient Leadership Retreat completed post-retreat surveys to assess their satisfaction with the coursework and specifically, to assess the spiritual fitness module of the resiliency retreat's curriculum. In total, the research team reviewed 25 completed post-intervention survey responses (89.3% response rate). Descriptive statistics indicated that respondents (n = 25) were subjectively religious, defined as belief in a higher power practiced in ritualized ways. Over half of program participants indicated they (a) attended religious meetings at least once a week and (b) engaged in private religious activity-such as meditation-at least once a day. Results showed that most program participants reported that the spiritual fitness skills learned during the resilient leadership program were useful (88%) (Z = 3.000, p < 0.001). Additionally, most program participants reported their interest in spiritual exploration was affirmed, renewed, or raised as a result of attending the peer-led resilient leadership program (76%) (Z = 6.000, p = 0.015). Culturally informed prevention programs that emphasize spiritual fitness are indicated for use in veteran outreach and well-being programs. More detailed research is needed to assess curriculum specifics.

ID TRAUMA; EXPOSURE
AB Introduction: In response to a strong focus on suicide prevention for all veterans, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recently revised policy to provide emergency mental healthcare for veterans who received Other Than Honorable (OTH) discharges from the military. This current study takes a preliminary step toward identifying demographic, historic, military, clinical, and social characteristics of veterans with OTH discharges. Materials and Methods: N = 1,172 Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans were evaluated between 2005 and 2016 in the multi-site VA Mid-Atlantic Mental Illness, Research, Education and Clinical Center (MIRECC) Study of Post-Deployment Mental Health (PDMH Study). Results: Veterans with OTH discharges constituted 2.7% of our sample, approximating the estimated rate in the overall U.S. veteran population. Compared to veterans discharged under honorable conditions, veterans with OTH discharges were more likely to be younger and have greater odds of reporting family history of drug abuse and depression. Further, veterans with OTH discharges reported a lower level of social support and were more likely to be single, endorse more sleep problems, score higher on measures of drug misuse, have a history of incarceration, and meet diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. A subsequent matching analysis provided further evidence of the association between OTH discharge and two risk factors: drug misuse and incarceration. Conclusion: These findings elucidate potential factors associated with veterans with OTH discharges, particularly substance abuse and criminal justice involvement. Results also indicate higher incidence of risk factors that often accompany suicidal ideation and should be a highlighted component of healthcare delivery to this vulnerable cohort of veterans.

AB Objective: This pilot study aimed to determine whether interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) would be effective with a sample of women veterans who experienced military-related PTSD. Method: Women veterans presenting for mental health services through the Trauma Services Program at the Washington, DC, Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) were referred to the study by Veterans Affairs (VA) clinicians if they experienced trauma during their military service and scored > 35 on the PTSD Checklist-Military Version. A total of 20 women completed a baseline assessment and were referred to treatment, the first trial of this treatment method with a veteran sample. Of the 15 women veterans who started treatment, 10 completed a trial of 12 individual sessions. Assessments were conducted posttreatment and at three months posttreatment follow-up. Results: There was a significant decline in PTSD symptom severity from baseline to posttreatment, and these gains were maintained at three-month follow-up. Approximately one-third of the group no longer met full criteria for PTSD diagnosis, results that are comparable to studies of evidence-based treatments for PTSD (prolonged exposure and cognitive processing therapy) in military samples. Conclusions: IPT, a non-trauma-focused intervention that aims to increase social support and improve interpersonal functioning, shows promise as another means of addressing PTSD in veterans. It should be tested in a larger sample to determine if IPT for PTSD might serve as an alternative for veterans who would prefer a non-trauma-focused intervention to address their difficulties.

AB Objectives Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are identified as signature injuries of the Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Statistics have confirmed a high incidence of PTSD among military personnel with mild TBI (mTBI) who served in these conflicts. Although receiving less attention, individuals with a history of mTBI are also at increased risk for depressive disorders. This study examines the incidence and correlates of depression in service members with a history of mTBI received an average of 4-1/2 years prior to evaluation.
   Methods Retrospective analysis of 184 service members with a history of mTBI extracted from a data repository maintained at a military medical center.
   Results One-third of the sample (34.2%) was clinically diagnosed with a depressive disorder in the month preceding evaluation. Of those with depression, 81% (51 of 63) were also diagnosed with PTSD. Proportionately more women than men had depression. Depression was more common among those who were undergoing a Military Evaluation Board and those who served in more than three combat deployments.
   Conclusions Results confirm chronically elevated the rates of depressive disorders and PTSD comorbidity among service members with a history of mTBI. Depression screening and treatment within the Military Health System should remain a priority for service members reporting a remote history of mTBI. Individuals with chronic PTSD, women, service members undergoing MEB and those who served in greater than three combat deployments are at particular risk.

AB Purpose: Suicide rates among military service members have risen dramatically, while drivers remain poorly understood. We examined the relationship between coincident alcohol dependence and depression in shaping risk of suicidal ideation among National Guard forces.
   Methods: We performed a longitudinal analysis using a randomly selected, population -based sample of Ohio Army National Guard soldiers. Telephone -based surveys of 1582 soldiers who participated in both wave 1 (2008-2009) and wave 2 (2009-2010) were analyzed.
   Results: Odds ratios (ORs) for suicidal ideation among those with versus without alcohol dependence were similar among nondepressed (OR = 3.85 [95% confidence intervals (Cls) = 1.18-12.52]) and depressed individuals (OR = 3.13 [95% CI = 0.88-11.141); multiplicative interaction was not observed. In contrast, the risk differences (RDs) among those with versus without alcohol dependence diverged for those without depression (RD = 0.04 [95% CI = 0.02-0.07]) compared with those with depression (RD = 0.11 [95% CI = 0.06-0.181); strong evidence of additive interaction was observed.
   Conclusions: We found that alcohol dependence and depression interact statistically in shaping risk for incident suicidal ideation among Army National Guard service members. A high -risk prevention approach including population -based screening for suicidality among patients with alcohol dependence, depression, and particularly those with both conditions is warranted in military populations.

AB Introduction: Social isolation is closely associated with negative mental health outcomes. Social media platforms may expand opportunities for social contact, but whether online interactions are as effective as face-to-face, or in-person, interactions at protecting against the negative effects of social isolation is unclear.
   Methods: Participants consisted of U.S. military veterans who served since September 2001 and used Facebook (n = 587). Our independent variables were frequency of social contact occurring in-person and on Facebook. Dependent variables were probable psychiatric disorders and suicidality, measured using several validated screening tools. The independent effect of each form of social contact was assessed using multivariate logistic regression, which included adjustment for several potential confounders.
   Results: We found that veterans who frequently interacted on Facebook engaged in more in-person social contact than infrequent Facebook users (p < .001). More frequent in-person social interaction was associated with significantly decreased risk of symptoms of major depression and PTSD, compared with contact every few weeks or less. In contrast, increased frequency of social interaction on Facebook had no associations with mental health outcomes.
   Limitations: All associations are cross-sectional (direction of association is unclear) and based on self-report measures.
   Conclusions: Although veterans who frequently use Facebook are also typically social in their offline life, it is their offline (in-person) social interaction, rather than their social contact on Facebook, that is associated with reduced psychiatric symptoms.

AB Background: Many veterans experience significant compromised spiritual and mental well-being. Despite effective and evidence-based treatments, veterans continue to experience poor completion rates and suboptimal therapeutic effects. Spirituality, whether expressed through religious or secular means, is a part of adjunctive or supplemental treatment modalities to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and is particularly relevant to combat trauma. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the relationship between spirituality and mental well-being in postdeployment veterans. Methods: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, JSTOR) were searched from database inception to March 2016. Gray literature was identified in databases, websites, and reference lists of included studies. Study quality was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool and Critical Appraising Skill Programme Qualitative Checklist. Results: From 6,555 abstracts, 43 studies were included. Study quality was low-moderate. Spirituality had an effect on PTSD, suicide, depression, anger and aggression, anxiety, quality of life, and other mental well-being outcomes for veterans. "Negative spiritual coping" was often associated with an increase mental health diagnoses and symptom severity; "positive spiritual coping" had an ameliorating effect. Discussion: Addressing veterans' spiritual well-being should be a routine and integrated component of veterans' health, with regular assessment and treatment. This requires an interdisciplinary approach, including integrating chaplains postcombat, to help address these issues and enhance the continuity of care. Further high-quality research is needed to isolate the salient components of spirituality that are most harmful and helpful in veterans' mental well-being, including the incorporating of veterans' perspectives directly.

AB The benefits of positively integrating newcomers into organizations are well known in civilian contexts. Less known is the role of integration among US soldiers who frequently relocate and integrate into new units. Perceptions of integration were examined both cross-sectionally and longitudinally as predictors of mental health, anger reactions, unit climate and functional impairment for soldiers who recently joined their unit. In addition to rating their perceptions of integration, soldiers also rated their leader and unit member support for integration. Cross-sectional correlations indicated that positive personal integration was significantly associated with fewer mental health problems, fewer anger reactions, better unit climate, and less functional impairment. Positive leader and unit support for integration was significantly associated with better unit climate. Positive leader support was also associated with fewer mental health symptoms. Only the associations of positive personal integration, with anxiety symptoms and unit climate held over time. Mediation analyses showed that personal integration fully mediated the cross-sectional relationship between leader support for integration and depression symptoms and partially mediated the relationship between leader support for integration and anxiety symptoms and unit climate. Personal integration also partially mediated the relationship between unit member support for integration and unit climate. These findings identify the importance of the individual's personal perception of integration in predicting reduced mental health symptoms and increased unit climate, both in the short and long term. Leaders and unit members facilitate this process and could therefore benefit from training on how best to integrate new members to the unit.

AB Nearly 2 million Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) occur in the U. S. each year, with societal costs approaching $60 billion. Including mild TBI and concussion, TBI's are prevalent in soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan as well as in domestic athletes. Long-term risks of single and cumulative head impact dosage may present in the form of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, suicide, Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), dementia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Quantifying head impact dosage and understanding associated risk factors for the development of long-term sequelae is critical toward developing guidelines for TBI exposure and post-exposure management. The current knowledge gap between head impact exposure and clinical outcomes limits the understanding of underlying TBI mechanisms, including effective treatment protocols and prevention methods for soldiers and athletes. In order to begin addressing this knowledge gap, Cleveland Clinic is developing the "Intelligent Mouthguard" head impact dosimeter. Current testing indicates the Intelligent Mouthguard can quantify linear acceleration with 3% error and angular acceleration with 17% error during impacts ranging from 10g to 174g and 850rad/s(2) to 10000rad/s(2), respectively. Correlation was high (R-2 > 0.99, R-2 = 0.98, respectively). Near-term development will be geared towards quantifying head impact dosages in vitro, longitudinally in athletes and to test new sensors for possible improved accuracy and reduced bias. Long-term, the IMG may be useful to soldiers to be paired with neurocognitive clinical data quantifying resultant TBI functional deficits.

TI Mefloquine prescriptions in the presence of contraindications:

SO PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
LA English

ID SERVICE MEMBERS; IRAQ
AB Purpose Contraindications to mefloquine use include a history of certain prevalent neuropsychiatric disorders, which are thought to increase the risk of severe adverse events including anxiety, paranoia, depression, hallucinations, psychosis, and possibly suicide. Within the US military, the continued availability and use of mefloquine is subject to administrative policies dating to 2002 that require clinicians to exercise added caution during prescribing. This analysis was performed to quantify the effectiveness of these policies in ensuring health care provider compliance with package insert prescribing guidance.
   Methods A previously identified cohort consisting of 11725 active duty US military personnel, among whom 1127 (9.6%) had contraindications to mefloquine use identified through medical surveillance and pharmaceutical databases, was examined to identify individuals receiving prescriptions for mefloquine in the 45 days prior to a combat deployment in 2007.
   Results Among the 11725 cohort members, 4505 (38.4% of the cohort) received a prescription for mefloquine. Among the 1127 cohort members with contraindications, 155 (1.3% of the cohort) were prescribed mefloquine, comprising 13.8% of those with contraindications.
   Conclusions Despite the longstanding administrative policies meant to reduce such events, approximately one in seven individuals with neuropsychiatric contraindications received a prescription for mefloquine prior to a recent combat deployment, significantly increasing the risk of subsequent adverse events. Given the prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders among US military personnel and the continued availability of mefloquine, additional study is recommended to describe and quantify the nature and extent of mefloquine-associated adverse events experienced among this group.

AB Background: The majority of studies comparing active psychological treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) do not find significant differences at posttreatment. This was the case in a recent trial examining prolonged exposure (PE) and virtual reality exposure (VRE) among active-duty soldiers with combat-related PTSD. Matching individual patients to specific treatments provides a potential avenue to improve significantly the public health impact of effective treatments for PTSD. A composite moderator approach was used to identify profiles of patients who would see superior PTSD symptom reduction in VRE or PE to inform future treatment matching.
   Methods: Active duty U.S. army soldiers (N=108) were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial comparing VRE and PE in the treatment of PTSD stemming from deployments to Iraq or Afghanistan. Eighteen baseline variables were examined to identify treatment response heterogeneity in two patient groups: those with a superior response to PE and those with a superior response to VRE. The final composite moderator comprised four of 18 baseline variables.
   Results: Results revealed that patients who were predicted to see greater PTSD symptom reduction in VRE were likely to be younger, not taking antidepressant medication, had greater PTSD hyperarousal symptoms, and were more likely to have greater than minimal suicide risk.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that treatment matching based on patient profiles could meaningfully improve treatment efficacy for combat-related PTSD. Future research can build on these results to improve our understanding of how to improve treatment matching for PTSD.

AB Purpose: Transgender (TG) persons are overrepresented in prison settings and in the U.S. veteran population. Health disparities studies of large populations of transgender people involved with the criminal justice system have not been published to date.
   Methods: We studied a large cohort of TG veterans who received care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities during 2007-2013 (n = 4,793) and a 3: 1 matched control group of veterans without known TG identification (n = 13,625). Three hundred twenty six (n = 138 TG, 188 non-TG) had received VHA services in programs designed to address the needs of justice involved (JI) veterans. We linked patients in each of the three groups to their medical and administrative data.
   Results: TG veterans were more likely to be justice involved than controls (2.88% vs. 1.38%; P < .0001). Compared to non-TG JI veterans, TG JI veterans were more likely to have a history of homelessness (80% vs. 67%; P < .05) and to have reported sexual trauma while serving in the military (23% vs. 12%; P < .01). Significant health disparities were noted for TG JI veterans for depression, hypertension, obesity, posttraumatic stress disorder, serious mental illness, and suicidal ideation/attempts.
   Conclusion: These data suggest that TG veterans experience a number of health risks compared to non-TG veterans, including an increased likelihood of justice involvement. TG veterans involved with the criminal justice system are a particularly vulnerable group and services designed to address the health care needs of this population, both while incarcerated and when in the community, should take these findings into account in the development of health screenings and treatment plans.

TI Predictors of mortality in close proximity blast injuries during
   operation Iraqi freedom
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
LA English
DT Article
ID SUICIDE BOMBING ATTACKS; SYSTEM
AB BACKGROUND: Blast injury is an increasingly common problem faced by military surgeons in the field. Because of urban terrorism worldwide, blast injury is becoming more common in the civilian sector as well. Blast injuries are often devastating and can overwhelm medical resources. We sought to determine whether simple factors easily obtained from the clinical history and primary survey could be used to triage patients more effectively.
   STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of 18 consecutive close-proximity blast injury patients presenting to a forward deployed surgical unit in Iraq was performed. Patients' injuries and outcomes were recorded. We compared the presence of sustained hypotension, penetrating head injury, multiple (three or more) long-bone fractures, and associated fatalities (whether another patient involved in the same explosion died) between nonsurvivors and survivors using Fisher's exact test.
   RESULTS: All patients who presented alive but exhibited sustained hypotension (n = 5) died, versus 0% who did not exhibit sustained hypotension (n = 9, p < 0.01). There was no marked increase in mortality with presence of multiple long-bone fractures, penetrating head injury, or associated fatalities individually. Having two or more of these factors was associated with a mortality of 86% (6 of 7) versus 20% (2 of 10, p = 0.015) in those who had less than two factors.
   CONCLUSIONS: Blast injury can overwhelm military and civilian trauma systems alike. Sustained hypotension and presence of two or more easily determined factors, including three or more long-bone fractures, penetrating head injury, and associated fatalities, are associated with increased mortality and can potentially help triage patients and allocate scarce resources more efficiently.

AB Objectives Combat experiences predict PTSD and depression in U.S. military veterans. However, few studies have investigated associations between mindfulness and these constructs. We examined main, direct, and indirect effects for mindfulness and combat experiences on veterans' PTSD and depressive symptoms and investigated the explanatory value of mindfulness on outcome variance in these models. Methods A total of 485 post-9/11 era military veterans with previous combat deployments residing in four major US cities completed online surveys asking about their combat experiences, mindfulness, and mental health. Two multivariable ordinary least squares regression models were specified to investigate main effects of mindfulness and combat experiences on veterans' PTSD and depressive symptoms. Path models examined direct and indirect effects of combat experiences and mindfulness on these outcomes. Results There were significant associations for mindfulness (beta = - 0.68, p < 0.001), (beta = - 0.67, p < 0.001) and combat experiences (beta = 0.12, p < 0.001), (beta = 0.09, p < 0.001) with PTSD and depression respectively. In both models, the addition of the mindfulness parameter significantly increased model R2. Path analysis demonstrated significant direct effects for mindfulness and combat experiences and indirect effects for combat experiences on PTSD and depressive symptoms through the mindfulness pathway. Conclusions The associations of mindfulness with PTSD and depressive symptoms were greater in magnitude than the associations for combat experiences, and mindfulness explained a large and significant proportion of the variance in outcomes. Additional longitudinal research investigating how mindfulness skills and strategies may buffer against risk for PTSD and depression posed by combat experience is warranted in this high risk population.

AB Mild traumatic brain injury in the Veteran population is frequently comorbid with pain, posttraumatic stress disorder, and/or depression. However, not everyone exposed to mild traumatic brain injury experiences these comorbidities and it is unclear what factors contribute to this variability. The objective of this study was to identify comorbidity phenotypes among Post-9/11 deployed Veterans with no or mild traumatic brain injury and examine the association of comorbidity phenotypes with adverse outcomes. We found that Veterans with mild traumatic brain injury (n = 93,003) and no brain injury (n = 434,378) were mean age of 32.0 (SD 9.21) on entering Department of Veterans Health Administration care, were predominantly Caucasian non-Hispanic (64.69%), and served in the Army (61.31%). Latent class analysis revealed five phenotypes in each subcohort; Moderately Healthy and Mental Health phenotypes were common to both. The Healthy phenotype was found only in no brain injury. Unique phenotypes in mild traumatic brain injury included Moderately Healthy+Decline, Polytrauma, and Polytrauma+Improvement. There was substantial variation in adverse outcomes. The Polytrauma+Improvement phenotype had the lowest likelihood of adverse outcomes. There were no differences between Moderately Healthy+Decline and Polytrauma phenotypes. Phenotypes of comorbidity vary significantly by traumatic brain injury status including divergence in phenotypes (and outcomes) over time in the mild traumatic brain injury subcohort. Understanding risk factors for the divergence between Polytrauma vs. Polytrauma+Improvement and Moderately Healthy vs. Moderately Healthy+Decline, will improve our ability to proactively mitigate risk, better understand the early patterns of comorbidity that are associated with neurodegenerative sequelae following mild traumatic brain injury, and plan more patient-centered care.

AB 2012 marks the 90th year since the purification of insulin and the miraculous rescue from death of youngsters with type 1 diabetes. In this review, we highlight several previously unappreciated or unknown events surrounding the discovery. (i) We remind readers of the essential contributions of each of the four discoverers Banting, Macleod, Collip, and Best. (ii) Banting and Best (each with his own inner circle) worked not only to accrue credit for himself but also to minimize credit to the other discoverers. (iii) Banting at the time of the insulin research was very likely suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that originated during his heroic service as a surgeon in World War I on the Western Front in 1918, including an infected shrapnel wound that threatened amputation of his arm. His war record along with the newly discovered evidence of a suicide threat goes along with his paranoia, combativeness, alcohol excess, and depression, symptoms we associate with PTSD. (iv) Banting's eureka idea, ligation of the pancreatic duct to preserve the islets, while it energized the early research, was unnecessary and was bypassed early. (v) Post discovery, Macleod uncovered many features of insulin action that he summarized in his 1925 Nobel Lecture. Macleod closed by raising the question what is the mechanism of insulin action in the body? a challenge that attracted many talented investigators but remained unanswered until the latter third of the 20th century.

AB Military sexual trauma (MST) is a significant public health issue associated with adverse psychiatric outcomes, including heightened risk for suicide, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and substance use disorders. Recently, research has begun exploring gender-linked disparities in mental health outcomes for individuals who experience MST. The current study assessed whether women who screened positive for MST were at disproportionately higher risk for diagnoses of alcohol-use disorder (AUD) or drug-use disorder (DUD) relative to men. Veterans Health Administration (VHA) clinical data were extracted for 435,690 military veterans who separated from the military between 2004 and 2011 and had at least 5 years of follow-up data after their initial VHA visit until the end of fiscal year 2014. Logistic regression models examined the main and interactive effects of gender and screening positively for MST as predictors of AUD and DUD. MST positive screens were associated with increased rates of both AUD and DUD across genders. Although rates of both AUD and DUD were higher among men, the increased rate of diagnosis associated with MST positive screens was proportionally higher for women than men interaction adjusted odds ratios = 1.43 and 1.17 for AUD and DUD, respectively), indicating the presence of a gender-linked health risk disparity. This disparity was more pronounced for AUD than DUD (p < .01). The current study adds to previous literature documenting increased risk for women exposed to MST. These findings support efforts to reduce the occurrence of MST and continued use of MST screening measures within the VHA.

AB Objectives: We describe processes, rates, and patient and system correlates of brief structured assessments (BSAs) for suicidal ideation among Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) veterans with positive depression screens.
   Methods: Electronic Veterans Affairs (VA) medical record and Department of Defense data were used to identify individual-level and BSA-process variables for 1662 OEF/OIF veterans at three VA Medical Centers.
   Results: Overall, 1349/1662 (81%) veterans received BSAs for suicidal ideation within 1 month of depression screening; 94% of BSAs were conducted within 1 day. Stratified analyses revealed significant intersite differences in veteran demographics, instruments used, clinical setting and staff performing assessments, and correlates of assessment completion. At two sites, men were more likely to be assessed than women [odds ratio (OR)=2.15 (95% confidence interval {CI}=1.06-4.38) and 3.14 (CI=1.27-7.76)]. In a combined model adjusted for intrasite correlation, assessment was less likely during months 8-12 and 13-18 of the study period [OR=0.39 (CI=0.28-0.54) and OR=0.48 (95% CI=0.35-0.68), respectively] and more likely to occur among veterans receiving depression or posttraumatic stress disorder diagnoses on the day of depression screening [OR=1.83 (CI=1.36-2.46) and OR=1.50 (CI=1.13-1.98), respectively].
   Conclusions: Most veterans with positive depression screens receive timely BSAs for suicidal ideation. Processes used for brief assessment for suicidal ideation vary substantially across VA settings. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB OBJECTIVES: The Paris terrorist attacks on 13 November 2015 caused 482 casualties, including 130 deaths and 352 wounded. Facing these multisite terrorist attacks, Parisian public and military hospitals simultaneously managed numerous patients with penetrating thoracic injuries. The aim of this study was to analyse this cohort, the injury patterns, and assess the results of this mobilization.
   METHODS: The clinical records of all patients admitted to Parisian public and military hospitals with a penetrating thoracic injury related to the Paris 13 November terrorist attacks were reviewed.
   RESULTS: The study group included 25 patients (7% of the casualties) with a mean age of 34 +/- 8 years and a majority of gunshot wounds (n=20, 80%). Most patients presented with severe thoracic injury (Abbreviated Injury Score Thorax 3.3 +/- 1.2), and also associated non-thoracic injuries in 21 cases (84%). The mean Injury Severity Score was 26.8 +/- 9.4. Eight patients (32%) were managed with chest tube insertion and 17 (68%) required thoracic surgery. Lung resection, diaphragmatic repair, and lung suture were performed in 6 (36%), 6 (35%), and 5 cases (29%), respectively. Extra-thoracic surgical procedures were performed in 16 patients, mostly for injuries to the extremities. Postoperative mortality was 12% (n=3) and postoperative morbidity was 60% (n = 15),
   CONCLUSIONS: The coordination of Parisian military and civilian hospitals allowed the surgical management of 25 patients. The mortality is high but consistent with what has been reported in previous series. The current times expose us to the threat of new terrorist attacks and require that the medical community be prepared.

AB Background: Younger military veterans are at high risk for psychiatric disorders and suicide. Reaching and engaging veterans in mental health care and research is challenging. Social media platforms may be an effective channel to connect with veterans.
   Objective: This study tested the effectiveness of Facebook advertisements in reaching and recruiting Iraq and Afghanistan-era military veterans in a research study focused on mental health.
   Methods: Facebook ads requesting participation in an online health survey ran for six weeks in 2017. Ads varied imagery and headlines. Validated instruments were used to screen for psychiatric disorders and suicidality. Outcomes included impressions, click-through rate, survey completion, and cost per survey completed.
   Results: Advertisements produced 827,918 impressions, 9,527 clicks, and 587 survey completions. Lack of enrollment in Veterans Affairs health care (193/587, 33%) and positive screens for current mental health problems were common, including posttraumatic stress disorder (266/585, 45%), problematic drinking (243/584, 42%), major depression (164/586, 28%), and suicidality (132/585, 23%). Approximately half of the survey participants (285/587, 49%) were recruited with just 2 of the 15 ads, which showed soldiers marching tied to an "incentive" or "sharing" headline. These 2 ads were also the most cost-effective, at US $4.88 and US $5.90 per participant, respectively. Among veterans with current suicidal ideation, the survey-taking image resulted in higher survey completion than the soldiers marching image (P=.007).
   Conclusions: Facebook advertisements are effective in rapidly and inexpensively reaching military veterans, including those at risk for mental health problems and suicidality, and those not receiving Veterans Affairs health care. Advertisement image and headlines may help optimize the effectiveness of advertisements for specific subgroups.

AB This article will examine baseline assessment data from consecutive admissions to the MISSION Program, a transitional case management program for homeless veterans, to better understand the differences across military service eras that impact the psychosocial treatment needs of homeless, mentally ill, substance-abusing veterans. In all, 373 homeless veterans with a co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorder received the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Diagnosis, a modified Addiction Severity Index, the BASIS-32, and a comprehensive assessment battery focusing on other psychosocial treatment needs. Chi-square analysis and ANOVA were used to measure differences in mental health, substance use, physical health status, and homelessness across service eras, broken down by Vietnam era, post-Vietnam era, and Persian Gulf/Middle East era. Persian Gulf/Middle East era veterans were significantly more likely to have mental health problems than other veteran cohorts, especially problems with post-traumatic stress disorder (p <= .001), and reported more days of mental health problems in the last month (p = .01). Mideast veterans also became homeless at a significantly earlier age than other veterans (p <= .001), were more likely to report housing instability in their families of origin (p <= .05) and to attribute their homelessness to mental health problems (p = .01). Service providers need to be aware of the diversity of homeless veterans' service needs by period of military service in order to develop well-targeted, effective interventions.

AB Objective: Recent developments in psychometrics enable the application of network models to analyze psychological disorders, such as PTSD. Instead of understanding symptoms as indicators of an underlying common cause, this approach suggests symptoms co-occur in syndromes due to causal interactions. The current study has two goals: (1) examine the network structure among the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, and (2) incorporate clinically relevant variables to the network to investigate whether PTSD symptoms exhibit differential relationships with suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, physical functioning/quality of life (QoL), mental functioning(QoL, age, and sex.
   Method: We utilized a nationally representative U.S. military veteran's sample; and analyzed the data from a subsample of 221 veterans who reported clinically significant DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. Networks were estimated using state-of-the-art regularized partial correlation models. Data and code are published along with the paper.
   Results: The 20-item DSM-5 PTSD network revealed that symptoms were positively connected within the network. Especially strong connections emerged between nightmares and flashbacks; blame of self or others and negative trauma-related emotions, detachment and restricted affect; and hypervigilance and exaggerated startle response. The most central symptoms were negative trauma-related emotions, flashbacks, detachment, and physiological cue reactivity. Incorporation of clinically relevant covariates into the network revealed paths between self-destructive behavior and suicidal ideation; concentration difficulties and anxiety, depression, and mental QoL; and depression and restricted affect.
   Conclusion: These results demonstrate the utility of a network approach in modeling the structure of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, and suggest differential associations between specific DSM-5 PTSD symptoms and clinical outcomes in trauma survivors. Implications of these results for informing the assessment and treatment of this disorder, are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Veterans are disproportionately affected by overweight/obesity and growing evidence suggests that post-deployment is a critical period of accelerated weight gain.
   Objective: We explored the relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis, gender, and post-deployment weight trajectories among U.S. Operations Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom, and New Dawn veterans.
   Design: We used Veterans Affairs electronic health record data from 248,089 veterans (87% men) who, after their last deployment, had at least one medical visit between October 2001 and January 2009 and more than one BMI recorded through September 2010. We analyzed repeated BMI measurements using linear mixed models, with demographics, PTSD and other relevant psychiatric diagnoses as predictors.
   Results: At the first recorded BMI, veterans' median age was 29, and 59% of women and 77% of men were overweight/obese. They had a median of 6 BMI measurements during a median follow-up of 2.4 years. Controlling for potential confounders, women with a PTSD diagnosis had a yearly BMI growth rate of 0.11 kg/m(2) (95% CI 0.09 to 0.13, p < 0.001) higher than women without PTSD. For men, the corresponding PTSD effect was also significant, but slightly lower: 0.07 kg/m(2) ((95% CI 0.05 to 0.09, p < 0.001); women-men difference: 0.03 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.06) kg/m(2), p= 0.006).
   Conclusions: The post-deployment period is critical for weight gain, particularly for veterans diagnosed with PTSD and women veterans with PTSD. Efforts are needed to engage post-deployment veterans in weight management services, and to determine whether tailored recruitment/treatment interventions will reduce disparities for veterans with PTSD.

TI Non-routine Discharge From Military Service: Mental Illness, Substance

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE

DT Article

   DEPLOYMENT; PTSD
AB Introduction: Mental illness and substance use disorders among newly returned military service members pose challenges to successful reintegration into civilian life and, in extreme cases, may lead to outcomes such as incarceration, homelessness, and suicide. One potential early indicator for these difficulties is non-routine discharge from military service.
   Methods: Using data from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) for 443,360 active duty service Veterans who deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq and subsequently utilized VHA services between Fiscal Years 2004 and 2013, this study examined risk for receiving a VHA-documented diagnosis of mental illness, substance use disorders, and suicidality as a function of discharge type, controlling for demographic and military service covariates. Analyses were conducted in 2016.
   Results: In total, 126,314 Veterans (28.5%) had a non-routine military service discharge. Compared with routinely discharged Veterans, odds for nearly all diagnostic outcomes were significantly greater among Veterans discharged for disqualification or misconduct, including personality disorders (AOR=9.21 and 3.29, respectively); bipolar/psychotic disorders (AOR=3.98 and 3.40); alcohol/substance use disorders (AOR=1.55 and 4.42); and suicidal ideation and behaviors (AOR=2.81 and 2.77). Disability-discharged Veterans had significantly higher odds for diagnoses of anxiety disorders (AOR=1.97) and bipolar/psychotic disorders (AOR=3.93).
   Conclusions: Non-routine service discharge strongly predicts VHA-diagnosed mental illness, substance use disorders, and suicidality, with particularly elevated risk among Veterans discharged for disqualification or misconduct. Results emphasize the importance of discharge type as an early marker of adverse post-discharge outcomes, and suggest a need for targeted prevention and intervention efforts to improve reintegration outcomes among this vulnerable subpopulation.

AB Since 9/11, hospitals and health authorities have been preparing medical response in case of various mass terror attacks. The experience of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center in treating suicide-bombing mass casualties served, in the time leading up to the war in Iraq, as a platform for launching a preparedness program for possible attacks with biological and chemical agents of mass destruction. Adapting Quarantelli's criteria on disaster mitigation to the "microinfrastructure" of the hospital, and including human behavior experts, we attempted to foster an interactive emergency management process that would deal with contingencies stemming from the potential hazards of chemical and biological (CB) weapons. The main objective of our work was to encourage an organization-wide communication network that could effectively address the contingent hazards unique to this unprecedented situation. A stratified assessment of needs, identification of unique dangers to first responders, and assignment of team-training sessions paved the way for program development. Empowerment through leadership and resilience training was introduced to emergency team leaders of all disciplines. Focal subject matters included proactive planning, problem-solving, informal horizontal and vertical communication, and coping through stress-management techniques. The outcome of this process was manifested in an "operation and people" orientation supporting a more effective and compatible emergency management. The aim of article is to describe this process and to point toward the need for a broad-spectrum view in such circumstances. Unlike military units, the civilian hospital staff at risk, expected to deal with CB casualties, requires adequate personal consideration to enable effective functioning. Issues remain to be addressed in the future. We believe that collaboration and sharing of knowledge, information, and expertise beyond the medical realm is imperative in assisting hospitals to expedite appropriate preparedness programs.

AB The Special Issue (June 2011) of the Journal of Clinical Psychology in Medical Settings titled Strengthening Our Soldiers (SOS) and Their Families: Contemporary Psychological Advances Applied to Wartime Problems revealed the following important concerns: 1) Who is at risk for psychological sequelae during and following service in the U.S. military? 2) How to deliver the best treatment for our soldiers and veterans with PTSD, Traumatic Brain Injury and Pain? 3) How to train the trainers? and 4) What are the current priorities for service delivery, research and funding? Assessment strategies and tools are provided to assist in identification of suicidal ideation and behaviors, alcohol abuse in spouses, posttraumatic stress disorders, depression, brain injuries and post-concussion syndrome, as well as positive growth experiences. Empirically validated Cognitive Processing and Prolonged Exposure treatments are described as are the empirical results already in evidence in our military populations. The innovative use of Virtual Reality and Telehealth applications is demonstrated in both army and naval settings for preparing and reducing trauma in affected soldiers. The Functional and Occupational Rehabilitation Treatment (FORT) Program and its role in returning function to injured soldiers with musculoskeletal pain and motion restrictions, while also leading to reductions of anxiety, depression and use of medical services, is described. A critique about providing service-research for children's reactions to their parent's deployments and family functioning during separation and reintegration is provided. The need for theoretical-empirical approaches to understanding pain-behavior, anxiety dysregulation as it impacts the brain function and structure is provided by experts in pain, neuropsychology, brain circuitry and anxiety management of multiple traumas. This final paper in SOS provides commentary on SOS and describes possible future implications of current psychological knowledge related to military personnel and their families.

AB Objective: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for deleterious mental health and functional outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine the strength and specificity of the association between deployment-acquired TBI and subsequent posttraumatic stress and related disorders among U.S. Army personnel.
   Method: A prospective, longitudinal survey of soldiers in three Brigade CombatTeams was conducted 1-2 months prior to an average 10-month deployment to Afghanistan (T0), upon redeployment to the United States (T1), approximately 3 months later (T2), and approximately 9 months later (T3). Outcomes of interest were 30-day prevalence. postdeployment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive episode, generalized anxiety disorder, and suicidality, as well as presence and severity of postdeployment PTSD symptoms.
   Results: Complete information was available for 4,645 soldiers. Approximately one in five soldiers reported exposure to mild (18.0%) or more-than-mild (1.2%) TBI(s) during the index deployment. Even after adjusting for other risk factors (e g., predeployment mental health status, severity of deployment stress, prior TBI history), deployment-acquired TBI was associated with elevated adjusted odds of PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder at T2 and T3 and of major depressive episode at T2. Suicidality risk at T2 appeared similarly elevated, but this association did not reach statistical significance.
   Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance of surveillance efforts to identify soldiers who have sustained TBIs and are therefore at risk for an array of postdeployment adverse mental health outcomes, including but not limited to PTSD. The mechanism(s) accounting for these associations need to be elucidated to inform development of effective preventive and early intervention programs.

TI Disability Rating, Age at Death, and Cause of Death in US Veterans with
   Service-Connected Conditions
SO MILITARY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; BENEFITS; HEALTH; PTSD
AB Introduction: The association between disability and cause of death in Veterans with service-connected disabilities has not been studied. The objective of this study was to compare age at death, military service and disability characteristics, including disability rating, and cause of death by year of birth. We also examined cause of death for specific service-connected conditions. Materials and methods: This study used information from the VETSNET file, which is a snapshot of selected items from the Veterans Benefits Administration corporate database. We also used the National Death Index (NDI) for Veterans which is part of the VA Suicide Data Repository. In VETSNET, there were 758,324 Veterans who had a service-connected condition and died between the years 2004 and 2014. Using the scrambled social security number to link the two files resulted in 605,493 (80%) deceased Veterans. Age at death, sex, and underlying cause of death were obtained from the NDI for Veterans and military service characteristics and types of disability were acquired from VETSNET. We constructed age categories corresponding to period of service; birth years 1938 and earlier corresponded to Korea and World War II ("oldest"), birth years 1939-1957 to the Vietnam era ("middle"), and birth years 1958 and later to post Vietnam, Gulf War, and the more recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan ("youngest"). Results: Sixty-two percent were in the oldest age category, 34% in the middle group, and 4% in the youngest one. The overall age at death was 75 +/- 13 yr. Only 1.6% of decedents were women; among women 25% were in the youngest age group, while among men only 4% were in the youngest group. Most decedents were enlisted personnel, and 60% served in the U.S. Army. Nearly 61% had a disability rating of >= 50% and for the middle age group 54% had a disability rating of 100%. The most common service-connected conditions were tinnitus, hearing loss, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In the oldest group, nearly half of deaths were due to cancer or cardiovascular conditions and <2% were due to external causes. In the youngest group, cardiovascular disease and cancer accounted for about 1/3 of deaths, whereas external causes or deaths due to accidents, suicide, or assault accounted for nearly 33% of deaths. For Veterans with service-connected PTSD or major depression; 6.5% of deaths were due to external causes whereas for Veterans without these conditions, only 3.1% were due to external causes. Conclusion: The finding of premature death due to external causes in the youngest age group as well as the finding of higher proportions of external causes in those with PTSD or major depression should be of great concern to those who care for Veterans.

AB Objective: To describe the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid psychiatric disorders and identify correlates of PTSD in a contemporary, nationally representative sample of US veterans.
   Method: Data were analyzed from Wave 1 of the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, a cross-sectional, retrospective, web-based survey of a population-based sample of 3,157 US veterans conducted between October and December 2011. The main outcome measure was probable lifetime PTSD, which was assessed by using a DSM-IV version of the PTSD Checklist (PCL), the PCL-Specific Stressor version.
   Results: The weighted lifetime and current prevalence of probable PTSD was 8.0% (standard error [SE] = 0.48) and 4.8% (SE = 0.40), respectively. 87.0% of veterans reported exposure to at least 1 potentially traumatic event (PTE); veterans reported a mean of 3.4 (SD = 2.8) different PTE types in their lifetime. Sudden death of a loved one was the most frequently endorsed PTE (61.3%), and sexual abuse in adulthood had the highest conditional probability of PTSD (37.3%). PTSD was associated with increased odds of mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders (odds ratios [ORs] = 2.2-19.1, P values < .001); suicidal ideation (OR = 9.7, P < .001); and suicide attempts (OR = 11.8, P < .001). Psychosocial factors, including resilience, community integration, and secure attachment, were associated with decreased odds of PTSD (ORs = 0.5-0.7, P values < .05).
   Conclusions: In a nationally representative sample of US veterans, the prevalence of lifetime and current PTSD was 8.0% and 4.8%, respectively, and PTSD was associated with elevated risk for several psychiatric conditions and suicidality. Veterans reported exposure to many PTE types in addition to combat, and conditional risk for PTSD was high for noncombat-related trauma. Prevention and treatment efforts designed to bolster protective psychosocial factors may help mitigate PTSD risk in this population. (C) Copyright 2014 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB Background: The long-term effects of military deployment on the mental health of war veterans have been investigated extensively, but few studies have examined the longterm impact of parental deployment on children's mental health.
   Methods: Using a retrospective, multigenerational survey and propensity score analysis to adjust for selection effects and endogeneity bias, we investigated the impact of parental deployment on the mental health of the adult children of Australian veterans of the Vietnam War. We analysed data from 1966 adult men (35%) and women (65%) whose fathers (N = 1418) were selected at random from the population of surviving men who served in the Australian army during the Vietnam War (1962-75). Mean age of respondents was 37. The main outcome measures were self-reported diagnosis or treatment for anxiety and depression (i.e. lifetime and previous 12 months), suicidality based on Psychiatric Symptom Frequency Scale, and current mental health as measured by the Mental Health Inventory of the SF-36. The key independent variable was whether their fathers were deployed to the Vietnam War.
   Results: Almost 40 years after the war, the adult children of deployed veterans were more likely to have been diagnosed with anxiety [odds ratio (OR) = 1.54, confidence interval (CI) = 1.04, 2.28] and depression (OR = 1.77, CI = 1.03, 3.05), to have had thoughts of suicide and self-harm (OR = 2.39, CI = 1.57, 3.65) and to have made suicidal plans (OR = 3.52, CI = 1.40, 8.85) than the offspring of comparable, non-deployed army veterans. They also reported poorer current mental health (Coefficient = -5.08, CI = -6.60 - -3.56).
   Conclusions: The results imply that there are significant and enduring adverse effects of parental deployment on the mental health of children in military families, and provide some insight into the potential long-term impacts of recent military engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq.

AB Objective The primary objective was to explore differences in mental health problems (MHP) between serving Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) components (Regular Force (RegF); Reserve Force (ResF)) with an Afghanistan deployment and to assess the contribution of both component and deployment experiences to MHP rising covariate-adjusted prevalence difference estimates. Additionally, mental health services use (MHSU) was descriptively assessed among those with a mental disorder.
   Design Data came from the 2013 CAF Mental Health Survey, a cross-sectional survey of serving personnel (n=72 629). Analyses were limited to those with an Afghanistan deployment (population n=35311; sampled n=4854). Logistic regression compared MHP between RegF and ResF members. Covariate-adjusted prevalence differences were computed.
   Primary outcome measure The primary outcomes were MHP, past-year mental disorders, identified using the WHO's Composite International Diagnostic Interview, and past-year suicide ideation.
   Results ResF personnel were less likely to be identified with a past-year anxiety disorder (adjusted OR (AOR)=0.72 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.90)), specifically both generalised anxiety disorder and panic disorder, but more likely to be identified with a past-year alcohol abuse disorder (AOR=1.63 (95% CI 1.04 to 2.58)). The magnitude of the covariate-adjusted disorder prevalence differences for component was highest for the any anxiety disorder outcome, 2.8% (95% CI 1.0 to 4.6); lower for ResF. All but one deployment-related experience variable had some association with MHP. The 'ever felt responsible for the death of a Canadian or ally personnel' experience had the strongest association with MHP; its estimated covariate-adjusted disorder prevalence difference was highest for the any (of the six measured) mental disorder outcome (11.2% (95% CI 6.6 to 15.9)). Additionally, ResF reported less past-year MHSU and more past-year civilian MHSU.
   Conclusions Past-year MHP differences were identified between components. Our findings suggest that although deployment-related experiences were highly associated with MHP, these only partially accounted for MHP differences between components. Additional research is needed to further investigate MHSU differences between components.

AB Introduction: Volunteering as a health promotion intervention is positively related to improved health and well-being in civilians and older adults. Yet, the impacts of participating in a community-based volunteering program on returning military veterans have not been studied, nor have the outcomes for veterans who have experienced a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Materials and Methods: This observational, pre-post survey examines health, psychological, and social outcomes from a cohort of post-9/11/01 veterans with (N = 67) and without a reported TBI history (N = 273) who completed a 6-month, 20-hour per week veteran-focused civic service program. This study was approved by the Saint Louis University Institutional Review Board. Results: Veterans with a TBI history who completed the 6-month civic service program conducted by a veteran-focused national nonprofit organization showed significant pre-post improvement (p < 0.05) in overall health, decreased post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, increased perceived self-efficacy, decreased feelings of isolation and loneliness, and increased perceived availability of social support. These significant findings were not due to participants seeking external help for emotional problems. Out of four aspects of PTSD symptomatology assessed, "feeling numb or detached from others, activities, or surroundings" most accounted for the decrease in PTSD scores. Given this and taken together with the significant decrease in social isolation and loneliness and the social nature of the program, we posit that decreased social isolation and loneliness is the primary driver of the improved psychological and social outcomes documented here. Finally, pre-post change scores did not differ significantly between veterans with and without a TBI, indicating that TBI history did not hinder the ability to benefit from this program. Conclusion: Completion of this civic service program positively impacted veterans with TBI, especially on psychological and social outcomes important to recovery and life satisfaction after TBI. Civic service may provide an innovative approach to promoting wellness in returning veterans with a TBI. Results of this study provide preliminary evidence that civic service decreases social isolation and loneliness in veterans with a reported TBI history. Given our findings, volunteering may prevent against social isolation and be promotional of perceived social support in veterans with TBI.

AB A general public perception about architects and designers is that they only design buildings, and interiors. However, they are trained to solve diverse societal challenges using their creativity and design thinking skills. In this paper, the author will discuss a unique collaborative education model to demonstrate how her design students worked with a retired colonel and the Service Members' Agricultural Vocational Education (SAVE) Organization to design an agricultural education campus to overcome shortage of farmers in the US and assist wounded warriors and veterans in becoming productive citizens of the society.
   The above mentioned project was designed to solve two different challenges to support two very diverse US communities: 1) the agricultural community in the US is facing a shortage of one million farmers due to the retiring farmers, whose' next generation is not interested in farming, and 2) how to assist wounded veterans and stop them from ending their lives. By the end of 2015, more than 1.5 million Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans have returned home. Despite their physiological and psychological injuries, these service men and women want to continue to serve their country and live independent, productive lives. Unfortunately, when they do not get timely psychological help, it leads to suicide. Each day 22 veterans take their lives. 61% of these soldiers and veterans come from a farming family or community. 45% of these soldiers are interested in farming.
   The author worked with the SAVE leadership to develop a community-based design project and encouraged her graduate design students to employ their design thinking skills to develop an agricultural campus where soldiers can learn farming. In this paper, the author will present her students' evidence-based design efforts to assist the agricultural and veteran communities to demonstrate how design thinking can help resolve agricultural challenges in the US; and how designers can become "change agents" in the society and save lives. In conclusion, the author will discuss how this innovative and collaborative model can assist in fulfilling the future agricultural production and food supply challenges, and how other economic sectors can benefit from design thinking approach to resolve their challenges facing the global market.

AB Across the globe, the threat from terrorist attacks is rising, which requires a careful assessment of long-term medical support. We found 3 major sources of costs: hospital expenditures, mental health services dedicated to acute stress reactions, and ambulatory follow-up. During the first year, most of the costs were related to hospitalization and support for stress relief. During the second year, ambulatory and rehabilitation costs continued to grow. Public health specialists should consider these major components of costs and their evolution over time to properly advise the medical and social authorities on allocating resources for the medical and nonmedical support of civilian casualties resulting from war or terror.
   ContextAcross the globe, the threat from terrorist attacks is rising, which requires a careful assessment of long-term medical support. Based on an 18-month follow-up of the Israeli civilian population following the 2014 war in Gaza, we describe and analyze the medical costs associated with rocket attacks and review the demography of the victims who filed claims for disability compensation. We then propose practical lessons to help health care authorities prepare for future confrontations.
   MethodUsing the National Insurance Institute of Israel's (NII) database, we conducted descriptive and comparative analyses using statistical tests (Fisher's Exact Test, chi-square test, and students' t-tests). The costs were updated until March 30, 2016, and are presented in US dollars. We included only civilian expenses in our analysis.
   FindingsWe identified 5,189 victims, 3,236 of whom presented with acute stress reactions during the conflict. Eighteen months after the conflict, the victims' total medical costs reached $4.4 million. The NII reimbursed $2,541,053 for associated medical costs and $1,921,792 for associated mental health costs. A total of 709 victims filed claims with the NII for further support, including rehabilitation, medical devices, and disability pensions.
   ConclusionWe found 3 major sources of costs: hospital expenditures, mental health services dedicated to acute stress reactions, and ambulatory follow-up. During the first year, most of the costs were related to hospitalization and support for stress relief. During the second year, ambulatory and rehabilitation costs continued to grow. Public health specialists should consider these major components of costs and their evolution over time to properly advise the medical and social authorities on allocating resources for the medical and nonmedical support of civilian casualties resulting from war or terror.

AB IMPORTANCE Whether traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a risk factor for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been difficult to determine because of the prevalence of comorbid conditions, overlapping symptoms, and cross-sectional samples.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the extent to which self-reported predeployment and deployment-related TBI confers increased risk of PTSD when accounting for combat intensity and predeployment mental health symptoms.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS As part of the prospective, longitudinal Marine Resiliency Study (June 2008 to May 2012), structured clinical interviews and self-report assessments were administered approximately 1 month before a 7-month deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan and again 3 to 6 months after deployment. The study was conducted at training areas on a Marine Corps base in southern California or at Veterans Affairs San Diego Medical Center. Participants for the final analytic sample were 1648 active-duty Marine and Navy servicemen who completed predeployment and postdeployment assessments. Reasons for exclusions were nondeployment (n = 34), missing data (n = 181), and rank of noncommissioned and commissioned officers (n = 66).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the total score on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) 3 months after deployment.
   RESULTS At the predeployment assessment, 56.8% of the participants reported prior TBI; at postdeployment assessment, 19.8% reported sustaining TBI between predeployment and postdeployment assessments (ie, deployment-related TBI). Approximately 87.2% of deployment-related TBIs were mild; 250 of 287 participants (87.1%) who reported posttraumatic amnesia reported less than 24 hours of posttraumatic amnesia (37 reported >= 24 hours), and 111 of 117 of those who lost consciousness (94.9%) reported less than 30 minutes of unconsciousness. Predeployment CAPS score and combat intensity score raised predicted 3-month postdeployment CAPS scores by factors of 1.02 (P < .001; 95% CI, 1.02-1.02) and 1.02 (P < .001; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02) per unit increase, respectively. Deployment-related mild TBI raised predicted CAPS scores by a factor of 1.23 (P < .001; 95% CI, 1.11-1.36), and moderate/severe TBI raised predicted scores by a factor of 1.71 (P < .001; 95% CI, 1.37-2.12). Probability of PTSD was highest for participants with severe predeployment symptoms, high combat intensity, and deployment-related TBI. Traumatic brain injury doubled or nearly doubled the PTSD rates for participants with less severe predeployment PTSD symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Even when accounting for predeployment symptoms, prior TBI, and combat intensity, TBI during the most recent deployment is the strongest predictor of postdeployment PTSD symptoms.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to estimate the contribution of the mission in Afghanistan to the burden of mental health problems in the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF).
   Methods: Data were obtained from the 2013 Canadian Forces Mental Health Survey, which assessed mental disorders using the World Health Organization's Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The sample consisted of 6696 Regular Force (RegF) personnel, 3384 of whom had deployed in support of the mission. We estimated the association of past-year mental health problems with Afghanistan deployment status, adjusting for covariates using logistic regression; population attributable fractions (PAFs) were also calculated.
   Results: Indication of a past-year mental disorder was identified in 18.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.0% to 19.7%) of Afghanistan deployers compared with 14.6% (95% CI, 13.3% to 15.8%) in others. Afghanistan-related deployments contributed to the burden of a past-year disorder (PAF = 8.7%; 95% CI, 3.0% to 14.2%), with the highest PAFs being seen for panic disorder (34.7%) and posttraumatic stress disorder (32.1%). The PAFs for individual alcohol use disorders and suicide ideation were not different from zero. Child abuse, however, had a much greater PAF for any past-year disorder (28.7%; 95% CI, 23.4% to 33.7%) than did the Afghanistan mission.
   Conclusions: The mission in Afghanistan contributed significantly to the burden of mental disorders in the CAF RegF in 2013. However, the much stronger contribution of child abuse highlights the need for strong military mental health systems, even in peacetime, and the need to target the full range of determinants of mental health in prevention and control efforts.
   Objectif: Cette etude visait a estimer la contribution de la mission en Afghanistan au fardeau des problemes de sante mentale dans les Forces armees canadiennes (FAC).
   Methodes: Les donnees ont ete obtenues de l'Enquete de 2013 sur la sante mentale dans les Forces canadiennes (ESMFC), qui a evalue les troubles mentaux a l'aide de l'entrevue diagnostique composite internationale de l'Organisation mondiale de la sante. L'echantillon se composait de 6696 membres de la Force reguliere (Freg), dont 3384 avaient ete deployes pour soutenir la mission. Nous avons estime l'association des problemes de sante mentale de l'annee precedente avec le statut de deploiement en Afghanistan, en ajustant pour les covariables par la regression logistique; les fractions attribuables a la population (FAP) ont aussi ete calculees.
   Resultats: L'indication d'un trouble mental de l'annee precedente a ete identifiee chez 18,4 % (intervalle de confiance (IC) a 95 % 17,0 a 19,7 %) des deployes en Afghanistan compare a 14,6 % (IC a 95 % 13,3 a 15,8 %) chez les autres. Les deploiements lies a l'Afghanistan contribuaient au fardeau des troubles de l'annee precedente (FAP = 8,7 %; IC a 95 % 3,0 a 14,2 %), la FAP la plus elevee etant observee dans le trouble panique (34,7 %) et le trouble de stress post-traumatique (32,1 %). Les FAP des troubles individuels d'utilisation d'alcool et d'ideation suicidaire ne differaient pas de zero. Toutefois, l'enfance maltraitee avait une FAP beaucoup plus elevee que la mission en Afghanistan pour tout trouble de l'annee precedente (28,7 %; IC a 95 % 23,4 a 33,7 %).
   Conclusions: La mission en Afghanistan a contribue significativement au fardeau des troubles mentaux dans la Freg des FAC en 2013. Cependant, la contribution beaucoup plus elevee de l'enfance maltraitee met en evidence le besoin de systemes militaires de sante mentale solides, meme en temps de paix, et le besoin de cibler toute la gamme des determinants de la sante mentale dans le cadre des initiatives de prevention et de controle.
