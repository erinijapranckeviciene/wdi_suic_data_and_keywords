AB Suicide terrorism is one of the most dreadful challenges for Pakistan as the country has been the primary and most frequent target of suicide terrorism in the world during recent years. Pakistan had two major sources of data on suicide bombings and related terrorism activities, the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies and the Pakistan Body Count; however, these sources lacked comprehensive databases on these incidents and related news. The most reliable sources of information have been international data providers such as the Chicago Project on Security and Terrorism, the Global Terrorism Database Portal, and others. Recently, the Pakistan Body Count launched an improved version of its database with several new variables, updated information records, and error corrections. This study analyzes the datasets available from international organizations, the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies, and the Pakistan Body Count and the variables recorded in them. It explains the benefits of the Pakistan Body Count data over other similar efforts, elaborates on the data collection methodology, provides a glimpse of possible analytics that can be performed using the updated dataset, and identifies areas of further improvement for this database.

TI Female Suicide Rates in Ghizer, Pakistan
SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
AB Suicide is an understudied subject in Pakistan. There are many social, legal, and religious sanctions against it. National rates of suicides are not known. We calculated suicide rates of women in the Ghizer District of the remote Northern Areas of Pakistan. During years 2000 to 2004, 49 women committed suicide. Taking average mean population for women for 5 years as 65,783, we calculated annual crude suicide rates for women as 14.89/100,000/year. For women over the age of 15 years, rates were 33.22/100,000/year; age-specific rates for 15-24 years were 61.07/100,000 per year. These figures are considerably higher than suicide rates in other parts of Pakistan and may be related to high psychiatric morbidity in Pakistani women. This study underscores the need for a standardized system of registration of suicides in Pakistan. There is also urgent need to address high psychological distress in women in Pakistan.

DT Article
DE Islam; Pakistan; rates; suicide
AB In recent years suicide has become a major public health problem in Pakistan. Despite this there are no official statistics on suicide and national rates are unknown. To determine rates we carried out an analysis of suicide reports from six cities in Pakistan. Rates vary from 0.43/100,000 in Peshawar to 2.86/100,000 in Rawalpindi. Rates for men are consistently higher than women; highest rates for men were 7.06/100,000 between the ages 20-40 years in Larkana, Sindh province. Given the legal, socio-cultural, and religious stigma of suicides in Pakistan, we believe these figures to be an underestimate. There is urgent need for a standard system of recording of suicides in Pakistan, so that true rates can be determined. This will help in informing policy and monitoring effectiveness of suicide prevention programs.

   DISORDERS; TRAGEDY; STRESS
AB Background
   In recent years suicide has become a major public health problem in Pakistan.
   Aims
   To identify major risk factors associated with suicides in Karachi, Pakistan.
   Method
   A matched case-control psychological autopsy study. interviews were conducted for 100 consecutive suicides, which were matched for age, gender and area of residence with 100 living controls.
   Results
   Both univariate analysis and conditional logistic regression model results indicate that predictors of suicides in Pakistan are psychiatric disorders (especially depression), marital status (being married), unemployment, and negative and stressful life events. only a few individuals were receiving treatment at the time of suicide. None of the victims had been in contact with a health professional in the month before suicide.
   Conclusions
   Suicide in Pakistan is strongly associated with depression, which is under-recognised and under-treated, The absence of an effective primary healthcare system in which mental health could be integrated poses unique challenges for suicide prevention in Pakistan.

ID STRESS
AB There are no official data on suicide from Pakistan, a conservative South Asian Islamic country with traditionally low suicide rates. Both suicide and attempted suicide are illegal acts, as well as socially and religiously condemned, making research in this area difficult. Recent reports suggest an increase in suicide rates. In this study, police data from the Sindh province were examined to provide a unique picture of trends of suicide over 15 years (1985-1999). During this period there were 2,568 reported suicides (71% men, 39% women; ratio 1.8). The lowest number was 90 in 1987 and maximum was 360 in 1999. Poisoning by organophosphates was the most common method followed by hanging. This study, although limited in scope, provides evidence of an increase in suicide rates in Pakistan, from one data source. There is urgent need for further research on suicide in Pakistan; interventions for suicide prevention in the country can then be planned.

DE attitudes; suicide bombing; Pakistan
AB Although suicide bombing is a historical phenomenon, there has been a recent upsurge in such incidents. In Pakistan, over the last year, more than 1,000 people have been killed in suicide bombing incidents. Assessing the attitudes and perceptions of people toward suicide bombing can help understand some of the root causes of this phenomenon. In this pilot study, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of people (N = 215) in Karachi, Pakistan, to assess their attitudes and perceptions toward suicide bombing. The majority of the respondents condemned suicide bombing and disagreed with the notion that Islam or any other religion supports it. Belonging to the Sunni Muslim sect and strong adherence to religion predicted support for suicide bombing. The majority believed suicide bombing to be a result of religious fundamentalism. Opinion was divided as to whether suicide bombers have an underlying psychiatric illness. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to determine the attitudes and perceptions of the Pakistani population regarding this important issue.

ID PREVENTION
AB In recent years, both suicide and suicide bombing (SB) have increased dramatically in Pakistan, a developing country in South Asia. Suicide had been a relatively rare event, and SB was virtually unknown. Over the last 20 to 30 years, however, there have been countless SB acts with a great deal of casualties. In Pakistan, both suicide and SB acts are mostly perpetrated by young, single men from low socioeconomic strata. Although both are distinct phenomena-suicide is an intensely personal act, whereas the purpose of SB is to inflict injury and death on others-there are common factors such as poverty, deprivation, unemployment, and lack of education. Understanding commonalities in suicide and SB is important for prevention. Prevention programs should focus on improving social conditions that appear to contribute to the frustration and anger evident in people who commit suicide and SB acts.

ID EXPLOSIONS
AB Study design: Descriptive case series.
   Objectives: Describe the unusual etiology and pattern of spinal cord injury due to terrorist suicide bombings in Pakistan.
   Settings: Spinal Rehabilitation Unit, Armed Forces Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.
   Methods: Hundreds of suicide attacks on civil and military forces have occurred over the last 6 years in Pakistan. These have resulted in thousands of death and many more injured. Six victims of terrorist suicide bombings were admitted over the years 2006 to 2009, who had a spinal cord injury (SCI). This is the first case series of SCI, secondary to terrorist suicide blast.
   Results: All patients were males. The mean age was 30 +/- 11 years. Most (five) were injured directly due to splinters from the blast. On admission to rehabilitation, all patients had thoracic complete paraplegia and their SCI was managed conservatively for their spinal injuries. Associated injuries included intestinal perforations, fracture metatarsals, humerus and brachial plexus injury. Pressure ulcer was the commonest complication (3 patients). Two patients had neurological improvement at 1-year follow-up.
   Conclusion: Suicide bombing is an effective weapon of terrorists in the modern world of today. The resulting injuries can be diverse and devastating. Spinal cord injury is an uncommon sequel of suicide bombing, which should be kept in mind while dealing with victims of suicide bombing.

AB Terrorism is a crucial issue of the contemporary world. Pakistan is one of the most affected countries from suicide attacks in recent years. Its impacts are so startling in different fields of life and it has been considered as the most important issue of Pakistan. The objective of this study was to find the impact said attacks on climate change specifically on temperature change due to suicide attacks happened in Pakistan during 1995 to 2016. This study is based on the data set compiled by Pakistan Body Count, which is the oldest and most authentic running tally of suicide attacks in Pakistan. Point density analysis technique was used to find out spatial distributions of suicide attacks and to visualize the most affected regions from the terroristic attacks. According to the point density analysis the areas around Peshawar city came out to be the most attacked region from suicide bombing in Pakistan during 1995 to 2016. To estimate the impact of temperature change due to suicide attacks, most attached city i.e. Peshawar was selected as a study area (75 out of 496 attacks happened during 1995 to 2016). Year wise temperature readings (maximum, minimum and average temperature) of Peshawar city during 2009 to 2015 were extracted and analyzed. The analysis reports that there is a direct relationship between number of attacks in a region and temperature changes. Maximum temperature of 45 degrees C was recorded in Peshawar city during 2009 due to the fact that maximum numbers of suicide attacks (20 out 75) were reported in Peshawar city during the year 2009. This study may help environmental protection department of the country to measure the temperature changes in a city so that they can optimize their counter activities by prioritizing the most attacked regions.

AB Suicide is now considered a major public health problem, especially in low income countries. A systematic review was conducted to identify risk factors and causes of deliberate self-harm and suicide in Pakistan - a Muslim, South Asian nation. In addition, the role of emergency department-based surveillance is explored. Four electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL Plus, MDConsult, PakMediNet) were searched and 23 studies were reviewed. Risk factors for deliberate self-harm included young age (less than 35 years), being female, occupation (housewives), being married and low socio-economic status; while reported risk factors for suicide were young age (less than 35 years), male gender, being married and low socio-economic status. Medications were commonly used for deliberate self-harm while firearm, hanging and organophosphorus poisoning were more frequent means for suicide. The most common reported cause for both health outcomes was interpersonal conflict. There is accumulating evidence that deliberate self-harm and suicide have increased in recent years in Pakistan. There is a need for greater attention and in-depth studies to elaborate on causative mechanisms for these public health issues.

AB Introduction: Suicide and related issues are one of the under studied social problems in Pakistan (see Daily Times, 2015) despite the fact that it prevails and is on increase with the passage of time in Pakistan (Ebrahim, 2013). Gender is an eminent aspect in relevance to suicide and related behaviors (Samaritans, 2012). This study is an effort to investigate into suicide and related issues with specific reference to gender. Study Area: the current study investigates into suicide and related issues with specific reference to gender in District Dir Lower, Khyber Pakhtunkhwah, Pakistan. Methodology: this study is cross-sectional and has been framed under qualitative research design. Sampling for the study has been done purposively whereby 35 individuals were sampled with the history of attempting a suicide. Besides, information from area hospitals has been collected regarding suicide and related cases in order to identify the rate of attempting a suicide among men and women. The sampled individuals were interviewed through an interview guide. The collected information from hospitals regarding rates and methods of suicide attempt has been tabulated while the information collected through in-depth interviews has been linked with the available literature to produce authentic findings. Findings: findings of the study are theorized into four dimensions according to objectives and themes: first, there is variation in rates of attempted suicide and completion of suicide across gender; second, gender plays a significant role in choosing method of attempting a suicide; third, masculinity has its own specific role in making men suicidal; and fourth, mental illness varies among men and women leading to difference in rates of attempting suicides.

AB This study aimed at developing an Urdu version of the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSI) for use with Pakistani adolescents and young adults. For this purpose, the English BSI was translated into Urdu and tested for psychometric properties. The analyses were carried out with data from a sample of 904 adolescents and young adults from eight major cities of Pakistan. The Cronbach's alpha of .75 showed that the Urdu version of the BSI has reasonable internal consistency. Principal Component Analysis gave one meaningful component that indicated Active Suicidal Desire. This preliminary validation study of the Urdu version of the BSI showed that it is an acceptable measure to be used with Pakistani adolescents and young adults. The need for further research on suicide in Pakistan is discussed.

AB Introduction: Ascertaining putative sociodemographic and clinical causes for death by probable suicide can potentially help implement region-specific strategies to reduce suicide rates. In this study, we wanted to investigate methods utilized and the psychosocial and mental health characteristics of youths (aged 12-26 y) who died by probable suicide.
   Method: We examined data from mental health clinical files and forensic reports and performed qualitative psychological autopsy interview from more than multiple sources for each youth who died by probable suicide between 1 May and 31 December 2015 in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan.
   Results: The two most common methods of probable suicide were by firearm use and self-poisoning utilizing pesticides that were significantly associated with male and female gender, respectively. The most common mental health difficulties were major depressive disorder and harmful use of psychoactive substances. Other clinical features particularly evident included thoughts of self-harm, irritability and aggression, low self-esteem, treatment nonadherence, family dispute, and financial distress.
   Conclusion: Efforts to reduce the ease of access to firearms and pesticides may potentially have a beneficial effect in reducing the suicide rate in this region of Pakistan.

AB Few studies have investigated suicidal ideation among medical students in the developing world. We found only one report on suicidal ideation among medical students in Pakistan published in the year 2005. The present cross-sectional survey on suicidal ideation conducted in July 2013 involved 331 medical students of Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan. In the past one year, suicidal ideation was found in 118 (35.6%) students. Forty-six (13.9%) of all the students had made a plan in their life time to commit suicide while 16 (4.8%) of the 331 students tried to commit suicide at some point of time in their life. More females than males pondered suicide while first year medical students formed the majority of those with suicidal ideation. The single greatest risk factor predisposing to suicidal ideation was substance abuse. This was followed jointly by parental neglect and previous psychiatric disorder. Campaigns against substance abuse and counseling of vulnerable students will help in eradicating suicidal intent. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

ID TERRORISM; LOGIC
AB This article explores the relationship between suicide bombings and public cleric statements in Pakistan between 20002010. It establishes that bombings and statements increase over time, that cleric statements vary according to the bombing target, and that police and military targets most frequently garner clerics' attention. An adaptation of Kaplan, Mintz, and Mishal's (2006) maximum likelihood estimation method determines whether cleric statements affect the bombing rate. The analysis shows that pro-suicide statements have a far greater effect on the bombing rate than anti-suicide statements, both in the magnitude of increased bombings and by the length of time over which they exert influence.

AB Self-harm is a major public health issue in Pakistan, yet the characteristics of those who self-harm are under-explored. This is a secondary analysis from a large randomized control trial on the prevention of self-harm, exploring demographic, clinical and psychological characteristics of people who self-harm in Pakistan. A total of 221 participants with a history of self-harm were recruited from medical wards of three major hospitals in Karachi. The Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), and Suicide Attempt Self Injury Interview (SASII) assessment scales were completed. The sample consisted predominantly of females (68.8%) in their 20's. Interpersonal difficulties were most commonly reported as the main antecedent to the self-harm, followed by financial difficulties. Participants had high severity scores on BSI, BDI and BHS. Pesticide and insecticide use were (n = 167, 75.6%) the most common methods of self-harm. The findings indicate that some characteristics of those who self-harm in Pakistan are comparable to other populations. This may raise the possibility of common causal mechanisms and processes. Future research needs to examine the efficacy of interventions targeting these risk factors in reducing rates of self-harm and thus suicide.

ID SUICIDE
AB Background: Suicidal behavior is an understudied subject in Pakistan, a South- Asian developing country with a predominantly Muslim population. Aims: This study examined the characteristics and management of patients presenting with Deliberate Self-Harm (DSH) to the Emergency Department (ED) of a tertiary care teaching hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. Methods: A retrospective chart review of all patients (n = 98), over a period of 12 months was carried out. The demographic details of patients; method of DSH and, if drugs were used, their type, route, and quantity; reason for DSH; past psychiatric history; and outcome were recorded. Results: The mean age of subjects was 23.5 years. The majority of patients were female; most had used drugs for DSH. After initial treatment in the ED, 34 patients were admitted to medical wards for further treatment, 12 were discharged from ED, while 52 patients left against medical advice. The main reasons for leaving against medical advice were financial constraints and fear of legal issues. Seven patients had at least one previous episode of DSH. Conclusions: Patients who left the ED without psychosocial assessment are at increased risk for repetition of DSH as well as suicide.

AB Female suicide bombers are increasingly seen in conflicts throughout the world; in recent years, they have become much more prevalent in religious-fundamentalist conflict. Specifically, global jihadist groups are increasingly incorporating female suicide bombers into their operations, a significant ideological and operational shift for most of these groups. Jihadist groups are using women to fill a recruiting void, to achieve tactical surprise, and for strategic purposes. Female suicide bombers are likely to emerge in jihadist conflicts throughout the world, from Nigeria to Pakistan and beyond.

AB Globally, suicide remains one of the leading causes of death among individuals aged 10 to 64 years and it ranks between second and fourth among those age 10 to 45 years. Data on suicidal behavior from Pakistan is sparse, especially for children and adolescents. A retrospective descriptive case note study was carried out of all patients under the age of 18 years (n = 69) admitted with deliberate self-harm (DSH) to a university hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. Females (63.8%) outnumbered males by 1.7:1. The mean age of the group was 16 years (+/- 2.2). The most frequent method used was benzodiazepine overdose (30.4%). "Family conflicts" was the main stressor reported by 66.7%. The most frequent diagnosis made was major depressive disorder in 18%. Despite the fact that 98% of our sample was Muslims and suicide is strictly forbidden in Islam, 76.8% expressed their intent to die. Multivariate logistic regression found current stressor to be significantly associated with an intention to die. Patients with nonfatal suicidal behavior form a pool for future suicides. Preventive efforts should be directed at this group. School based programs would be an effective way of addressing this.

AB Background: Suicide is a major global public health problem with more than 800,000 incidents worldwide annually. Seventy-five percent of the global suicides occur in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Pakistan is a LMIC where information on suicidal behavior is limited. The aim of the review is to map available literature on determinants, risk factors and other variables of suicidal behavior in Pakistan.
   Method: This study was based on Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework of scoping review, combining peer reviewed publications with grey literature. Ten databases including Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), Cochrane Trials Register (CRG), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), National Library of Medicine Gateway (NLMG), ExcerptaMedica (EMBASE), National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE (PUBMED), PSYCHINFO, Social Science Citation Index and Science Citation Index (SCI) and Pakmedinet. com were searched from the beginning of their time frames until December 2016 using a combination of key terms. The inclusion criteria included studies of various study designs covering different aspects of suicidal behavior in English language.
   Results: Six hundred and twenty three articles were initially retrieved from all ten databases. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts for relevance. One hundred and eighteen articles were read in full, out of which 11 were excluded because they did not fit the eligibility criteria. One hundred and ten articles, including two student theses and one report, were included in the final review. Most studies were descriptive in nature, with only three that used a case-control design. Majority of the studies were from urban areas, and addressed determinants rather than risk factors. Gender differences and age were predominantly reported, with more males committing suicide. Suicidal behavior was more common among individuals younger than 30 years of age. The three most common methods for suicides were hanging, poisoning and use of firearms. Mental illness as a risk factor for suicides was mentioned in only three studies.
   Conclusions: This review is the first attempt to synthesize available literature on suicidal behavior in Pakistan. The evidence is limited, and calls for more robust analytical research designs, along with a focus on risk factors.

AB Objective: Suicidal victims often reach Intensive Care Units (ICU), if they manage to reach a hospital, and the anesthesiologist get involved in their management. We aimed to evaluate the incidence of suicidal patterns, methods being used and seasonal variations in the frequency of suicide victims admission at Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Peoples Medical College Hospital (PMCH), Nawabshah (Pakistan).
   Study design: Retrospective study
   Methodology: A cohort study was conducted over a four and a half years (January 2014 to August 2018), including suicidal cases of both sexes received at ICU, PMCH, Nawabshah, from six districts of interior Sindh. Cases were selected on the basis of information from hospital record files after the approval of hospital ethical review committee. Findings were tabulated and analysed.
   Results: This study revealed that out of a total of 685 cases, 391 (57.08%) were males and 294 (42.92%) were females. Eighty males (11.67%) and 68 (9.93%) females could not be survived while two cases (0.29%) were referred to Karachi during the study period. The highest incidence of suicidal attempts and suicidal deaths were 164 and 38 during 2017 and 2014 respectively. Males were the predominant victims of suicide with a male to female ratio of 2:1.7. The most common method used for suicide was poisoning 98.77% (n = 656) followed by hanging 3.21% (n = 22) and drug overdose 1.02% (n = 07). A seasonal surge in autumn (August 17.81%) was noted.
   Conclusion: Males were the predominant victims of suicide in rural areas of interior Sindh Province of Pakistan. The most common method used for suicide was poisoning.

ID CELEBRITY SUICIDE; MEDIA GUIDELINES; PREVENTION; AUSTRALIA; COVERAGE;

AB Suicide attempt rates are on the rise in predominantly Islamic Republic of Pakistan. However, there exists an indigenous academic apathy toward exploring media-suicide relationships. This study, using content analysis and interviews, examines the lack of compliance with international ethical guidelines for suicide reporting by Pakistani newspapers. In 553 reported suicide cases, 2,355 guideline violations were detected. The overall tone of suicide news stories remained overwhelmingly irresponsible, and analysis indicates that both Urdu and English language newspapers made similar violations. Largely ignorant of international standards, Pakistani journalists report attempted suicide cases just like any other crime. This study suggests a prompt action on the part of appropriate bodies to amend relevant codes of ethics and eventually educate relevant journalist fraternities to report suicides in a socially responsible way.

AB This descriptive research was conducted to estimate the method of suicide and suicidal intent among hospitalised suicide attempters at Pakistan Ordinance Factory (POF) Hospital, Wah Cantt, from December 2012 to June 2013. Data were collected from 49 hospitalised suicide attempters through purposive sampling technique by using Suicidal Intent Scale. Majority of suicide attempters (92%) used self-poisoning as the method of suicide regardless of their gender, age, occupation, past medical history, past psychiatric history, and history of suicide and psychiatric illness in their families. Additionally, most of them (43%) reported high level of suicidal intent, while 16 (33%) reported medium suicidal intent and 12 (24%) reported mild suicidal intent. Keeping in view the fact that majority of suicide attempters used self-poisoning as a method and most of them reported high level of suicidal intent, it is important to plan preventive measures.

ID TERRORISM
AB The authors examine the effect of educational attainment and income on support for suicide bombing among Muslim publics in six predominantly Muslim countries that have experienced suicide bombings: Indonesia, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan, and Turkey. The authors make two contributions. First, they present a conceptual model, which has been lacking in the literature. Second, they consider attitudes toward two different targets of suicide bombings: civilians within the respondent's country and Western military and political personnel in Iraq. The authors find that the effect of educational attainment and income on support for suicide bombings varies across countries and targets.The findings therefore draw attention to the difficulties of making generalizations about Muslim countries and the importance of distinguishing between targets of suicide bombings.

AB This paper examines narratives of women from the Indian subcontinent, including Canadian refugee claimants, emerging from the conflict regions of Pakistan, Punjab, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, who have presented suicidal ideation or attempts or died by suicide. The focus is on the relationship of suicide and suicide behavior to particular systemic stressors related to familial, social, and group agendas. The vulnerability of individual women is presented in the context of gender issues, deeply embedded group trauma, historical legacies, and intragenerational dynamics, as well as acute stressors that contribute to the underlying distress of these women.

AB Objective. To determine the prevalence of suicidal thoughts and attempts and to identify demographic variables and mental health correlates such as anxiety/depression and domestic violence among pregnant women in an urban community in Pakistan. Design. Cross-sectional data from a prospective cohort study are presented. Setting. Women enrolled in an antenatal care clinic and followed to delivery in an urban area of Pakistan. Population. Cohort of pregnant women in Pakistan. Methods. A total of 1,369 pregnant women were enrolled and interviewed regarding various maternal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes, and were asked specific questions about suicidal thoughts and attempts and administered the Aga Khan University Anxiety Depression Scale at 20-26 weeks of gestation. Main outcome measures. Suicidal thoughts and attempts, verbal, sexual or physical abuse. Results. Overall, 148 of the 1,369 (11%) women studied had considered suicide. Of these, 148 women, 67 (45%) had attempted suicide. In all, 18% of the women were classified as having depression/anxiety, almost half (48%) reported experiencing verbal abuse and 20% reported physical/sexual abuse. Women who had anxiety/depression or had experienced verbal or physical/sexual abuse were significantly more likely to have had suicidal thoughts and attempts. Conclusions. Women at the greatest risk for having suicidal thoughts or a suicide attempt were those who were depressed/anxious and had experienced some form of domestic abuse. With the high prevalence of these conditions, attention should be given to the establishment of effective mental health treatment programs for pregnant women.

In tracing the rise of the Taliban in Pakistan, the authors review the country's history of state and civil society formation, its relations with Afghanistan, and U. S. and Western policy in the region. The authors present timely information and insights that enhance understanding of the recent surge in terrorist attacks on civilians in Pakistan and its ties to the eastward spread of conflict from neighboring Afghanistan.

For reference, we compared these data to a sample previously collected from German and Chinese students. Results indicated relatively poorer mental health and access to mental health treatments among the Pakistani sample, including a higher rate of recent suicidal ideation and bullying. Acknowledgment of these issues in Pakistani culture would be a good starting point to work on developing solutions to enhance the overall mental health of Pakistani students.

DE suicide bombings; suicide bombers; martyrdom; Jihadi Salafism
AB Suicide attacks by radical Islamists mainly target and harm their co-religionists. Whether in Iraq, Afghanistan or Pakistan, suicide bombers are increasingly directing their blows against Muslims, including non-combatants, they label apostates, infidels or collaborators with foreign powers. The culprits for this indiscriminate carnage are primarily radical Sunnis known as Jihadi Salafists. How could these Sunni radicals square their Islamic legitimacy with three clearly established prohibitions in Islam: Do not kill yourself, do not killing non-combatants, and do not kill fellow Muslims? Jihadi Salafists circumvent these commands by redefining the meaning of piety in Islam to frame their co-religionists as apostates and heretics outside the protective umbrella of Islam. They also give primacy to human intentionality in warfare to frame self-immolation as martyrdom, not suicide. Finally, they unearth rulings by medieval scholars that permit indiscriminate tactics during warfare to protect the collective interests of Muslims. The case of Al-Qaeda in Iraq and its indiscriminate suicide bombings illustrate these justifications.

AB Background: Globally, suicide is an important cause of mortality. In low- and middle income settings, it is difficult to find unequivocal data to establish suicide rates. The objective of this review is to synthesize the reporting of suicide incidence in six south Asian countries.
   Methods: We conducted a scoping review combining peer-reviewed studies (PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE) with in-country searches for grey literature in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, India, Nepal and Bangladesh. The review included mapping reported suicide rates, quality appraisals of the studies, use of definitions of suicide and means of committing suicide.
   Results: In total, 114 studies and reports were included in the review, including 50 peer-reviewed publications. Reported suicide rates varied widely from 0.43/100,000 to 331.0/100,000. The average suicide rate across studies was found to be high compared to the world average, however many studies were of poor quality or not representative. The majority of studies failed to explicitly define suicide (84% of the published articles and 92% of the grey literature documents). Poisoning and hanging were consistently the most common methods of committing suicide on the sub-continent.
   Conclusions: The reported suicide rates in South Asia are high compared to the global average, but there is a paucity of reliable data on suicide rates in South Asia. Reports are likely to diminish rather than exaggerate the magnitude of suicide rates. There is an urgent need to establish new, or evaluate existing, national suicide surveillance systems in the South Asian countries.

AB Based on the case study of Pakistan's largest Sufi Shrine, Data Darbar, situated in Lahore, this paper explores ways in which sacred places can be used by diverse actors for social welfare. As blessings (barraka) from the saint/shrine are connected to much of the social welfare, services are not exclusively used by the poor, taking away any stigmatisation of those relying on these services. Although Data Darbar is one of the most important centres of social welfare in Pakistan, Western development agencies have so far overlooked the groups involved especially the Faith Based Organisations (FBOs). The reason for this lies in the general neglect of Islamic institutions as part of civil society due to their negative image as the example of the Pakistani madrasas shows. Apart from being a centre of social welfare, the shrine has also become a place of risk due to suicide attacks in 2010. However, the shrine continues to be a place of comfort rather than a place of fear, because the belief in the saint gives visitors and those providing social welfare a strong psychological resilience. The paper therefore suggests that sacred places and FBOs be included more often in the debate on security, resilience and development in South Asia.

AB Purpose The aim of our study was to analyze the pattern of injuries, hospital care, and outcome of the victims of suicide bomb attacks in Pakistan.
   Methods This prospective, cohort study was conducted at the Combined Military Hospital Rawalpindi during the last 3 years. Seriously injured patients in the "immediate category" were resuscitated in the emergency operation theater adjacent to the emergency room and, after resuscitation, the patients were transferred to the main operation theaters, where consultant surgeons were available.
   Results During the study period, 1,296 terrorist victims presented to the emergency department and (86.9%) were admitted, with a mean hospital stay of 8.2 +/- A 2.1 days. The majority of patients arrived by ambulance (91%) and only 38 (3%) were evacuated by air. Penetrating splinter injuries were the most prevalent (87%), and 29% patients also had associated injuries. Open bone fractures were found in 48% and 42% had injured hollow and solid viscous. Overall, 33% of patients had thoracic injuries and neuro-trauma was observed in 16% of the study population. Deafness was a feature in 33% patients, 121 had to undergo limb amputations, and mortality remained in 7% of patients.
   Conclusion Most of the problems encountered were logistic in nature. Early evacuation of the victims remains pivotal in saving lives. The major causes of death in peripheral patients was hypovolemic shock, sepsis, and hypothermia. Mortality and morbidity can be enhanced by ample fluid resuscitation, tetanus prophylaxis, and proficient first aid at the site of injury.

AB Objective. Trends in suicide death rates among migrants to England and Wales 1979-2003 were examined.
   Methods. Age-standardised rates derived for eight country of birth groups.
   Results. For men born in Jamaica, suicide death rates increased in 1999-2003. There were declines in rates for men and women from India and from Scotland, men from East Africa and Northern Ireland and women from the Republic of Ireland. For both men and women born in Scotland or the Irish Republic, despite declines for some, rates remained higher than for England and Wales born. Rates among men from Pakistan were consistently lower than men born in England and Wales.
   Conclusion. These analyses indicate declining trends for most migrant groups and for England and Wales-born women, but adverse trends in death rates for some country of birth groups.

ID TERRORISM; IRAQ; MECHANISMS; MARTYRDOM; AUTHORITY; JIHADISM; LOGIC
AB Over the last 25 years, suicide attacks have become an alarming threat. They are a political tool which has been adopted by several organizations in Sri Lanka, Palestine and the Occupied Territories, Turkey, Chechnya, Afghanistan, Pakistan and, in particular, by the Al-Qaeda-led insurgency in Iraq in its struggle against the US and its allies. Recent analyses have traced back the use of suicide terrorism to its 'strategic logic': organizations and their militants resort to suicide attacks mainly because they view this form of violence as an efficient weapon for their revolutionary and nationalist campaigns. An explanation based on the paradigm of rational choice theory or instrumental rationality alone is, however, insufficient. This article suggests the importance of combining the paradigm of instrumental rationality with that of axiological rationality. Only this kind of explanation is able to clarify the crucial role played by those cultural and symbolic elements which justify and encourage the martyrdom of suicide attackers. Moreover, by adopting a multi-causal analysis of the armed organizations, their constituencies and the attackers, as well as of their interaction, the article outlines a theoretical model of the most important social mechanisms underlying the use of suicide tactics.

AB The war in Afghanistan incorporates a series of questionable anthropological assumptions. Quite aside from the involvement of anthropologists in the war's "human terrain projects," the current administration has continued a mistaken view of the tribes of the region, the reasons why there have been no attacks on the American homeland from the Afghan-Pakistan border region, the nature of suicide bombing, and the reasons why a singular model for all counterinsurgency plans may fail. By carefully analyzing these assumptions, anthropologists may offer a more refined critique of their own work and the goals of the present war.

AB Background: To gain information on the attitudes and life orientations of Pakistani adolescents, the present study aimed at measuring hopelessness and hopefulness in Pakistani adolescents. Methods: The Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS; Beck, Weissman, Lester, & Trexler, 1974) and the Life Orientation Test (LOT; Scheier & Carver, 1985; Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 1994) were translated into Urdu and validated for use in Pakistan. Back translation with a committee approach was used to translate the scales. The translated versions were administered to 723 adolescents and young adults in Pakistan. Results: For the Urdu-BHS, all item-total correlation coefficients were significant and yielded a single component. The principal component analysis on the Urdu-LOT yielded two components representing positively worded Optimism items and negatively worded Pessimism items. The BHS, as well as the two subscales of the LOT, were found to be predictive of suicide ideation. Gender comparisons showed that the two genders differed significantly on Hopelessness and the Optimism component of the Urdu-LOT. Conclusions: The Urdu version of the BHS and the LOT are established for use with young Pakistanis, after translations, and reliability and validity analyses. The need for further empirical research is emphasized for understanding the concepts and antecedents of hopelessness, optimism, and pessimism in adolescents, generally and in Pakistani adolescents, specifically.

AB Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and Suicide Bombing have become the headline news for every other day. It is a growing global phenomenon that is happening from Iraq to Afghanistan, Syria to United Kingdom and Spain to Pakistan. An average US soldier in Iraq receives 6 to 23 blast wave shocks over his/her tenure in Iraq. Pakistan has witnessed 120 suicide bombing attacks in last six years. While various attempts have been made to assess the impact of blast overpressure on buildings and animals, little has been done on crowd formation, crowd density and underlying geometry to mitigate the effects. This paper is set to make geometrical recommendations to reduce the casualties in case of such an incident for high value targets, like mosques and army facilities in the frontline countries fighting the global war on terrorism. A virtual simulation tool has been developed which is capable of assessing the impact of crowd formation patterns and their densities on the magnitude of injury and number of casualties during a suicide bombing attack. Results indicated that the worst crowd formation is street (Zig-Zag) where 30% crowd can be dead and 45% can be injured, given typical explosive carrying capacity of a single suicide bomber. Row wise crowd formations was found to be the best for reducing the effectiveness of an attack with 18% crowd in lethal zone and 38% in injury zones. For a typical suicide bombing attack, we can reduce the number of fatalities by 12%, and the number of injuries by 7%. Simulation results were compared and validated by the real-life incidents and found to he in good agreement. Line-of-sight with the attacker, rushing towards the exit, and stampede were found to be the most lethal choices both during and after the attack. These findings, although preliminary, may have implications for emergency response and counter terrorism.

AB In recent times Pakistan's biggest city, Karachi, has witnessed numerous terrorist attacks. The city does not have an emergency response system and only one of the three public sector hospitals has a trauma centre. We describe the pattern of injuries and management of two terror-related mass casualty incidents involving suicide bombers in a developing nation with limited resources. The first incident occurred in May 2002 with 36 casualties, of whom 13 (36%) died immediately and 11 (30.5%) died at the primary receiving hospitals. The second incident was targeted against the local population in May 2004. The blast resulted in 104 casualties, of which 14 (13.46%) died at the site. All patients had their initial assessment and treatment based on Advanced Trauma and Life Support principles and documented on a trauma form.

AB The present study aimed to establish and explore the relationship between gender differences and death obsession to understand increasing suicide statistics, and discuss the impact of marital status, religion and political instability found in Pakistan on death obsession. A convenience sample of 125 participants was selected and Death Obsession Scale (DOS) was administered (Abdel-Khalek, 1998). The results found significant gender differences in death obsession, with males obtaining a higher mean score (t= -1.625, p< 0.019, M= 0.47290) than females (M= 0.39734). The study demonstrates reasons for such results, along with the significance of current findings and avenues for further research. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   Aims
   To determine the efficacy of a brief psychological intervention culturally adapted manual-assisted problem-solving training (C-MAP) delivered following an episode of self-harm compared with treatment as usual (TAU).
   Method
   The study was a randomised controlled assessor-masked clinical trial (trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01308151). All patients admitted after an episode of self-harm during the previous 7 days to the participating medical units of three university hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan, were included in the study. A total of 250 patients were screened and 221 were randomly allocated to C-MAP plus treatment as usual (TAU) or to TAU alone. All patients were assessed at baseline, at 3 months (end of intervention) and at 6 months after baseline. The primary outcome measure was reduction in suicidal ideation at 3 months. The secondary outcome measures included hopelessness, depression, coping resources and healthcare utilisation.
   Results
   A total of 108 patients were randomised to the C-MAP group and 113 to the TAU group. Patients in the C-MAP group showed statistically significant improvement on the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation and Beck Hopelessness Inventory, which was sustained at 3 months after the completion of C-MAP. There was also a significant reduction in symptoms of depression compared with patients receiving TAU.
   Conclusions
   The positive outcomes of this brief psychological intervention in patients attempting self-harm are promising and suggest that C-MAP may have a role in suicide prevention.

SO STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM
LA English
DT Article
AB Since 11 September 2001, Europe has suffered multiple jihadi attacks but the United States has not. This American exceptionalism has been attributed to the special qualities of U.S. Muslims, who are seen as politically better integrated and less sympathetic toward radical politics than other Muslims. This article tests the exceptionalism hypothesis by comparing results from a 2007 Pew poll of U.S. Muslims with results from 2006-2007 START polls of Muslims in Morocco, Egypt, Pakistan, and Indonesia. On questions about religious identity, attitude toward Al Qaeda, U.S. intentions in the War on Terrorism, and suicide terrorism, U.S. Muslims differed only slightly from comparison Muslims.

AB Background: Suicidal ideation is an indicator of psychological distress and a proportion of people reporting suicidal ideation attempt or commits suicide. Mental illness of any type is strongly associated with suicidal ideation. Furthermore, the links between exposure to domestic violence and mental health problems are well established. Furthermore, a number of studies have reported an association between domestic violence and suicidal ideation.
   Aims: To study the link between domestic violence, mental health and suicidal ideation.
   Method: Using data from a group of 650 Pakistani women, we explored the putative predictors of suicidal ideation using univariate and multiple logistic regression. Significant predictors were then entered into a path analysis in order to evaluate both the direct and indirect effects of domestic violence on the odds of a study participant reporting suicidal ideation.
   Results: Mental disorders were observed to significantly predict suicidal ideation. Ability to negotiate conflict between couples appeared to both directly and indirectly, via mitigation against mental disorder, protect against suicidal ideation.
   Conclusions: The effect of verbal aggression on suicidal ideation appeared to be mostly mediated via its impact on mental health.

AB We used a community surveillance system to gather information regarding pregnancy outcomes and the cause of death for women of reproductive age (WRA) in Kanchanpur, Nepal. A total of 784 mother groups participated in the collection of pregnancy outcomes and mortality data. Of the 273 deaths among WRA, the leading causes of death reported were chronic diseases (94, 34.4%) poisoning, snake bites, and suicide (grouped together; 55, 20.1%), and accidents (29, 10.6%), while maternal mortality accounted for 7%. Nevertheless, the calculated maternal mortality ratio was quite high (259.3 per 100,000 live births).

AB Background: Recent Life Changes Questionnaire (RLCQ) developed by Richard Rahe has enabled quantification of stress by analyzing life events. The overall aim of the study was to create a reliable version of the Rahe's RLCQ for measuring stress in individuals living in developing countries and assess its validity. This paper discusses criterion validation of the adapted RLCQ in urban communities in Pakistan.
   Methods: This is a criterion validation study. Four urban communities of Karachi, Pakistan were selected for the study in which households were randomly chosen. Two data collectors were assigned to administer the adapted RLCQ to eligible participants after obtaining written informed consent. Following this interaction, two psychologists interviewed the same participants with a diagnostic gold standard of Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) which is utilized in usual practice within Pakistan to confirm the presence of stress related mental disorders such as Depression, Anxiety, Dysthymia, Suicide, Phobia, OCD, Panic Disorder, PTSD, Drug abuse and dependence, Alcohol abuse and dependence, Eating Disorders and Antisocial Personality Disorder to validate the accuracy of the adapted RLCQ. We generated the ROC curves for the adapted RLCQ with suggested cut-offs, and analyzed the sensitivity and specificity of the adapted RLCQ.
   Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety was 0.64, where sensitivity was 66%, specificity was 56% and the corresponding cut off from the adapted RLCQ was 750. Individuals scoring >= 750 were classified as high stress and vice versa. In contrast, the area under the ROC curve for serious mental disorder and adverse outcomes such as suicide, bipolar and dysthymia was 0.75, where sensitivity was 72% and specificity was 60% at the cut off of 800 on the adapted RLCQ. Individuals scoring >= 800 were classified as high stress and vice versa. The rate of agreement between the two psychologists was 94.32% (Kappa=0.84).
   Conclusion: The adapted and validated RLCQ characterizes common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety with moderate accuracy and severe mental disorders such as suicide, bipolar and dysthymia with high accuracy.

AB Introduction: Stigmatization, social exclusion and consequent banishment from the society makes transgender's life even tougher; isolating, pushing and forcing them into inappropriate conducts/habits like selling sex. This study investigates the association of social exclusion/victimization with high-risk behaviors among transgender community of Rawalpindi and Islamabad (Pakistan). Methods: Through a cross-sectional study design, a sample of 189 transgender community living in twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad was selected using snowball sampling technique. A validated close ended questionnaire was used to estimate the high-risk behaviors. Multivariate logistic regression was used to explore the competing outcomes associated with suicidal risk, selling sex and substance abuse. Results: Majority study participants 77.8% experienced physical attacks with institutional discrimination even higher (91.5%). Commercial sex work and drug abuse was reported in 39.2% and 37.6% respectively. The prevalence of suicide ideation was high (38.6%) however, suicide attempted rate was less (18.5%). In the multivariate logistic regression, compared to those with no risk, being physically attacked increased the odds of both attempting (OR=2.18) and contemplating suicide and selling sex (OR=4.10). Nevertheless, the relative impact of institutional victimization on suicidal behavior was higher among those who were targeted on the basis of their gender identity or expression (AOR = 6.20, CI = 1.58-24.29, p=0.009). Conclusion: The transgender community is socially excluded by the Pakistani society where they experience high levels of physical abuse and face discriminatory behavior in daily life. Such attitudes make them vulnerable for risky behaviors; forcing them to become commercial sex workers, begging, drugs use and even suicidal ideation.

DT Article
DE causes; risk factors; risk management; security risk; terrorism
AB Terrorism is a complex issue and various researchers have identified numerous causes and conditions that generate or are capable of generating terrorism. In the last decade, terrorist attacks claimed 36,495 lives and injured 27,985 people in Pakistan as a result of 3,482 bomb blasts and 281 suicide attacks. The aim of this research was to establish the major risk factors generating terrorism, based on the opinions of security officials who dealt directly with the Pakistan security situation. Sixty-five causes identified from the literature and interviews with security officials were modeled and transformed into a questionnaire. A nationwide response from security officials who were directly involved in dealing with apprehended terrorists was obtained. The population was selected proportionately from high, medium, and low security zones of Pakistan. Out of 500 questionnaires sent, 103 valid responses were received. The results helped establish the 13 major risk factors associated with generating terrorism. It was observed that addressing these 13 major risk factors would mostly resolve the other minor risk factors as well. Findings of this research might be beneficial for countries affected by terrorism, and countries with prioritized and rationalized allocation of funds in their budgets for substantially overcoming terrorism.

DE Poisoning; Paraphenylene-diamine (PPD); Tracheostomy; Suicide
AB Paraphenylene-diamine is a coloring dye but a toxic chemical at the same time with its use as a tool for suicide being cheaper and easy availability as reported by many countries in recent past. This agent affects liver, kidney, heart, lungs and muscles and ultimately death if left unmanaged. Current research on 24 Patients presenting as poisoning cases at Liaquat University Hospital, Hyderabad, Pakistan found 70.83%(17) female and 29.17%(6) male gender involved in poisoning more in married subjects 75%(18) as compared to unmarried 25%(6) in low socio-economic people 91.66%(22). All cases were suicidal in nature presenting with Hemodynamic Shock (4.17%), Anuria 50%, Oliguria (54.17%), pain in throat (87%), Rhabdomyolysis (95%) and Dark urine (100%). Tcheostomy performed 29.17% (7) and 70.83 % (17) were provided ventilatory support despite of that only 58.33% (14) could be revived leaving a mortality rate to 41.66% (10). Hospital stay duration was from 1-8days depending on the severity of condition.
   Conclusion: This poisoning is becoming more common in younger age, married and poor females with high mortality so the easy availability of this toxic agent should be restriction.

AB Objectives
   Burnout is a psychophysiological syndrome, consisting of a triad of emotional and physical exhaustion, exhibition of impersonal attitude and loss of a sense of achievement for oneself. This study aimed to pinpoint its risk factors, measure its current prevalence in medical students of Karachi, Pakistan and accentuate the areas of focus to benefit the primary care-oriented community as a whole.
   Methods
   This cross-sectional study included responses from 600 medical students in Karachi (third to final year). A self-administered questionnaire using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey (MBIHSS), multi-dimensional mood state questionnaire and perceived stress scale was used, along with a section about burnout prevention assessment. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 24.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) and chisquare tests used to find significant associations.
   Results
   One-fifth (n=109, 18.2%) of our subjects were burned out. The syndrome was significantly observed in those who operated on insufficient sleep (p-value 0.028) and in those having anger management issues and non-dominating temperaments (p-value 0.05). Furthermore, it was statistically significant in those who gave up easily, in those who had no hobbies and had no time to exercise and pray (p-value < 0.05). It was more prevalent in pupils of private medical colleges whereas two of its three constitutive factors, Emotional Exhaustion (p-value 0.03) and Personal Achievement (p-value < 0.001) were significantly higher in pupils of public sector universities.
   Conclusion
   The deleterious repercussions of burnout syndrome warrant the need for extensive efforts towards the propagation of its awareness.

AB In this study, we assessed the epidemiological patterns of suicide terrorism in the civilian population of Pakistan. Information about suicide terrorism-related events, deaths and injuries was extracted from the South-Asian Terrorism Portal (SATP) for the period from 2002 to October 2009. Of 198 events, civilians were involved in 194 events. Civilians accounted for 74.1% (N = 2017) of those who died and 93.8% (N = 6129) of those who were injured. In nine districts, mortality rates were more than one death per 100,000 inhabitants per year. The yearly trend showed a shift of attack targets from foreigners and sectarian targets in 2002-2005 to security forces or general public in 2006-2009. Attacks on public installations (mosques) or political gatherings resulted in a significantly greater (P <= 0.02) number of deaths (22 vs. 8) and injuries (59 vs. 24) per event compared with security installations. These results show that prevention might focus on political negotiation with armed groups and that appropriate measures should be taken to protect mosques and political gatherings.

AB This article explains the factors that contributed to the socialisation of youth into a radical ideology in one nationally powerful Islamist organisation in Pakistan. It argues that young individuals who join Islamist organisations do not necessarily hold pre-existing extremist views that dispose them towards such organisations. Instead, the radicalisation of personal beliefs and worldview may in fact also occur after joining such an organisation. Findings indicate that young members' gradual orientation to an Islamist ideology resulted from the interplay of a number of factors. First, their close and significant friendships increasingly became concentrated inside the organisation. Second, participation in various organisational meetings brought a personally meaningful improvement in their skills and self-esteem. Third, the organisation bestowed power and influence on its members, both in psychological and actual terms.

   INJURY; IRAN
AB Objective: To highlight the demographic profile, various methods of self inflicted burn, and to probe into the problem by knowing various precipitating factors that may lead to self inflicted burn in our part of the country.
   Patients and Methods: This is a study of 154 cases of self-inflicted burns treated at the Burn Emergency Unit of Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences Jamshoro Pakistan, during a period of 08 years. These self inflicted burns, were divided into two groups, those with suicidal intent called suicide attempter and those who mutilate themselves as self immolator. Except that these patients throughout the period of their hospital stay were under surveillance of a psychiatrist, they were managed according to the routine protocol of our unit. The patients were analyzed with respect to age, sex, method used for self inflicted burns, place of burn, psychiatric history; interpersonal problems, total body surface area (TBSA) burnt, depth of burn and outcome. The continuous variables were compared using t-test while for categorical data chi-square test was used. SPSS 15 was used as statistical software.
   Results: The prevalence of self inflicted burns was 9.80% with a consistent rise in number of self inflicted burns from 2001 through 2008. The self immolators were significantly younger then suicide attempters. Males dominated in self immolators, while in suicide attempters female outnumbered males. The mean TBSA affected was significantly higher in suicide attempters when compared to self immolators. The mean hospital stay did not differ significantly in both groups. The mortality for self immolators was 6.38%, in contrast to suicide attempter where it was 33.65%.
   Conclusion: The radical change in the socioeconomic condition of common people, traditional joint family system, political system and justice, has reflected as increased prevalence of self infliction both as self mutilators and suicide attempters (JPMA 60:338; 2010).

AB The objective of this study was to examine the association between bullying victimization and symptoms of depression among adolescents in Myanmar, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Little is known about adolescents' bullying victimization and its ramifications in South Asia. Given that children's rights remain low amidst taboo surrounding their mental health issues that prevent parents from seeking help for their children, there is a need to understand the link between the two. Data from the Global School-Based Student Health Survey (GSHS) from Pakistan, Sri-Lanka, and Myanmar were analyzed. The GSHS is conducted using standardized sampling and survey methodology procedures. The association between experiences of bullying and depressive symptoms was estimated by computing unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios. Results indicate that adolescents who were bullied were significantly more likely to report symptoms of depression in all three countries. Findings support those from other regions suggesting that adolescents are at higher risk of developing depressive symptoms when they experience bullying, highlighting the need for resources, including policy and infrastructure, to address both bullying and mental health issues in the region.

The inquiry included 315 police officers from three districts of the understudied province. Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (Lovibond and Lovibond 1995) was administered. It was hypothesized that police officers working in urban areas would project higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress as compared to police officers working in rural areas. The results supported the hypotheses on significant differences.

AB Introduction: Previous deliberate self-harm (DSH) is the strongest predictor of suicide. Although several studies exist in other countries, characteristics of DSH have not been well-studied in Pakistan. Aims: To identify characteristics of deliberate self-harm in a hospital population, building on previous work carried out on this subject at this center. Methods: 284 cases admitted to the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, between January 1997 and August 2003 were studied by analyzing medical records. Information was collected regarding demographics, family history, personal history, suicidal ideation, current stressors, the act of DSH and its management. Results: The most common age group was 21-25 years of age. The majority were females (60.3%). 95.1% of patients used self-poisoning as a method of deliberate self-harm. 47.3% used benzodiazepines for self-poisoning. Precipitating factors included conflict with family, marital problems, chronic illnesses, and unemployment. Comorbid psychiatric disorders were present in 76.4% patients. Discussion: Despite the difference in socio-cultural background of our patients, many of our results were found to be consistent with Western data. Our findings suggest that problem-solving therapy, stress management and improved mental health care may be effective interventions in preventing DSH. Prescription of medications should be regulated. Further studies are suggested at the community level.

DE suicidal behavior; ideation; Pakistan; Muslim
AB Suicidal behavior includes ideation, attempts and completed suicides. Information on suicidal behavior from Pakistan, a conservative South Asian Islamic country is lacking. To address the issue, a pilot study was carried out to assess the prevalence of suicidal ideation in Pakistani college students. Suicidal ideation was assessed on the basis of responses to four questions contained in the depression subscale of the General Health Questionnaire-28. Of the total 217 completed questionnaires, the overall rate of suicidal ideation was 31.4%. While there was no significant difference between genders, more females (33%) than males (29.2%) responded positively. Respondents belonging to single parent families and those living at home, compared to those using hostel facilities, reported higher rates. The reported rate in our sample is higher than similar studies conducted elsewhere. There is the need for more information in this important area of suicidal behavior, including studying such feelings in school going children as well as in a larger community sample. The findings of such studies can contribute to our understanding of the suicidal process in the Pakistani population and to address it at various levels.

AB Background: Adolescent physical fighting is a problem of public health importance, with varied consequences in the form of school absenteeism, injury, and, in some cases, death. Although research on risk and protective factors exists, most has been conducted in high-income countries. Methods: The 2009 Pakistan Global School-based Health Survey (GSHS) data were used. Logistic regression models were used to determine the associations. Five independent variables were investigated at the individual level (anxiety, suicide planning, truancy, physical activity, and bullying victimization) and four independent variables at the social level (presence of supportive parental figures, presence of helpful peers, extent of social network, and food insecurity). Results: Among adolescents in this study (N = 5177), 20% reported being involved in two or more physical fights, most of whom were males (79.9%). The factors associated with physical fighting were: being male (OR = 2.78); bullying victimization (OR = 3.14); truancy (OR = 1.63), loneliness (OR = 1.44); and suicidality, as evidenced by having a suicide plan (OR = 1.75). Having few close friends (0-2) as opposed to more (>3) was found to be protective against engaging in physical fighting. Conclusion: Risk factors for physical fighting among adolescents in South Asia seem to corroborate with previously-identified risk factors using samples in high-income countries, while protective factors seemed to differ. More research needs to be conducted to understand why certain factors do not have the same protective effect among South Asian adolescents. Aim: The aim of this study was to examine demographic and contextual factors associated with physical fighting among a nationally representative sample in a rapidly developing South Asian context.

DE Paraphenylene-diamine (PPD); Suicide; Rhabdomyolysis; Mortality
AB Paraphenylene-diamine (PPD) ingestion as a suicidal agent is becoming a more common toxicity in Pakistan and other Asian countries as reported in published literature. This coloring dye contains toxic chemicals responsible for hepatic necrosis, renal failure, rhabdomyolysis and severe laryngeal edema that leads to death if not timely managed. This chemical is quite cheap and easily available to a common man so the PPD poisoning is becoming in adults as a source of deliberate self-harm. Current study was conducted from Jan2015 to June 2015 in the ICU(Intensive Care Unit) of the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences Hospital Hyderabad, Sindh, Pakistan. This study was arranged because no such study was reported from this region of the country previously. There were 24 Patients were diagnosed as kala Pathar poisoning during the study time period with age range of 15-35 yrs. Most of them 17(70.83%) were females while 6(29.17%) were males. Majority of patients were married 18(75%) while 6(25%) were unmarried. Most of the patients belonged to low socio-economic background 22(91.66%) while 02(10.44%) were from middle group and no case was found to belong with high socio-economic group. Overall mortality was found 41.66% and Cure was 54.17% while 4.16% got referred to other facility. It is suggested that the easy availability of this chemical should be stopped and social life of community be improved.

AB Background: DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure-Adult (APA, 2013) is a self-reported instrument to measure comorbidity of psychiatric symptomology. Translation and validation of this instrument contribute to the literature, both in terms of its availability in native language Urdu and its usefulness in the prison settings of Pakistan.
   Aim: The purpose of the present study is to translate DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure-Adult (APA, 2013) and to measure comorbid psychiatric symptomology among convicted criminals of Central Jail Bahawalpur (CJB) and Central Jail Sahiwal (CJS).
   Materials and Method: Cross-sectional design was used and guideline proposed by Mapi Institute (Acquadro et al. 2012) was used for the translation and adaptation process. Data were collected from 362 imprisoned convicts.
   Statistical analysis: For construct validity, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was done by taking domains as continuous variables. The analysis was conducted using AMOS. Cross-tabulation analysis was conducted to see the association of comorbid psychiatric symptomology with respect to crime-related variables by using SPSS.
   Results and Conclusion: Goodness of fit showed that the translated version of the instrument has a satisfactory to good construct validity. For domains with more than one items, Guttmann and Alpha reliability analysis showed satisfactory reliability of domains (.52-.71) and Alpha reliability of .89 for the overall instrument. Sleep disturbance and anger related symptoms showed a high prevalence in the current sample. Current and previous crime-related variables do associate significantly with comorbid psychiatric symptomology.

AB Objective. Abuse of women has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Data about abuse from developing countries are scarce, especially from Muslim societies. Our objective was to investigate domestic violence before and during pregnancy among women in an urban area of Pakistan. Design. Population-based cohort study. Setting. An urban community in Hyderabad, Pakistan. Population. Thousand three hundred and twenty-four pregnant women at 20-26 weeks gestation. Methods. Socio-demographic and reproductive history data were obtained through structured interviews. We used a modified World Health Organization screening instrument to assess women's experience of domestic violence. Measures. Physical, sexual, and verbal abuse and demographic characteristics. Results. The majority of women had received some schooling and in most households the husbands were employed; by Pakistani standards, they were middle class. Young maternal age, having an unemployed husband and one with other wives/partners, and having had a prior pregnancy were significant predictors of abuse. In the six months prior to and/or during pregnancy, 51% reported experiencing verbal, physical or sexual abuse. Twenty percent reported physical or sexual abuse alone. Sixteen percent of women considered suicide as a response to the abuse. Conclusions. Domestic violence is common among urban Pakistani women of reproductive age, suggesting a need for universal screening during antenatal care, and for support and referral. Further research is needed to determine factors that place women at greatest risk, and to assess the impact of domestic violence on pregnancy outcomes.

American, British, and Pakistani authorities thwarted this planned attack in August 2006. Both incidents are among the most important Al Qaeda operations in recent years. Initially, they were dismissed by the authorities, pundits, and the media alike as the work of amateur terroristsuntrained obunches of guyso acting entirely on their own with no links to Al Qaeda. Subsequent evidence, however, has come to light, which reveals clear links to senior Al Qaeda commanders operating in Pakistan's lawless frontier border area with Afghanistan.

DE Coping strategies; Suicide; Medical students
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; DEPRESSION; STRATEGIES; STRESS
AB Objective: To identify the coping mechanisms as positive and negative predictors of suicidal ideation among medical students.
   Method: This cross-sectional analytical study was conducted from January to October 2017, and comprised students aged 19-25 years selected from 3 public-sector medical colleges located in Gujrat and Lahore, both in the Punjab province of Pakistan. Multilevel mixed methods sampling was used. Two standardised scales were used to assess the suicidal ideation and coping mechanisms of the participants.
   Results: Of the 1200 subjects, 640(53%) were males and 560(47%) were females. Besides, 390(32%) subjects hailed from Gujrat and 810(68%) from Lahore. Self-distraction (p<0.05)), active coping (p<0.0001), use of emotional support (p<0.05), use of instrumental support (p<0.001) positive reframing (p<0.0001), planning (p<0.001), humour (p>0.05), acceptance (p<0.001) and religion (p<0.0001) were negative predictors of suicidal ideation whereas denial (p<0.0001), substance use (p<0.05), venting (p>0.05) and self-blame (p<0.0001) were positive predictors of suicidal ideation.
   Conclusion: A psycho-educational programme must be introduced for medical students to enable them to adopt the right coping strategies in order to handle stressful situations.

ID SUICIDE; METABOLISM; BORN
AB Introduction: An increased incidence of suicides and suicidal behaviour among immigrants has been described in other countries. In Denmark, misuse of paracetamol is suspected in some foreign-born minority groups, although no data have been produced to substantiate this suspicion.
   Methodology. A retrospective study of the incidence of paracetamol poisoning in patients admitted to a specialised department of hepatology from 1994 to 1999 was carried our.
   Results: Of a total of 580 patients, 56 (9.7%; 95%-conridrnce interval 7.2-12.1%)were immigrants, among whom a significant overrepresentation was found of immigrants from Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, and Lebanon (Observed/ Expected-ratios of 1.95, 4.14, 2.67, and 2.45 respectively: p <0.05). The immigrants differed from the Danish-born patients being younger(21 vs 35 years of age; p<0.05), having a lower level of alcohol consumption (3% vs 30% with regular alcohol abuse; p<less than>0.05), and in general being less severely intoxicated (3% vs 22% developing hepatic encephalopathy; p<0.05). Compared to the Danish-born patients, the immigrants more frequently stated socio-economic problems as the reason for their self-poisoning (29% vs 10%; p<less than>0.05).
   Conclusions: The study demonstrates an overrepresentation of immigrants among patients admitted with paracetamol poisoning in Denmark.

DE Migrant workers; Depression; Suicide
ID DISORDERS; PAKISTAN; BRITAIN
AB Migrant workers comprise 80% of the population of the United Arab Emirates, but there is little research on their mental health. To determine the prevalence and correlates of depression among workers living in labor camps, we conducted a cross-sectional survey in labor camps in Al Ain city. The Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-42) was used to assess depression and suicidal ideation among the study participants. Off the 319 contacted workers agreed to participate, however 239 fully completed the DASS-42. The prevalence of a score >=10 ("depression") was 25.1% (60/239). Depression was correlated with physical illness (97/301), (adjusted odds ratio-AOR = 2.9; 95% CI 2.26-5.18), working in construction industry (prevalence 124/304), AOR = 2.2; 95%CI 1.56-3.83), earning less than 1,000 UAE Dirham per month (prevalence 203/314), (AOR = 1.8; 95%CI 1.33-3.16), and working more than 8 h a day (prevalence 213/315), (AOR = 2.7; 95%CI 1.19-6.27). 20/261 (6.3%) of the study participants reported thoughts of suicide and 8/265 (2.5%) had attempted suicide. People with suicidal ideation were more likely to have a physical illness (AOR = 8.1, 95%CI 2.49-26.67), earn less than 1,000 UAE Dirham per month (AOR = 5.98, 95%CI 1.26-28.45), and work for more than 8 h a day (AOR = 8.35, 95%CI 1.03-67.23). The study identified self reported indicators of a substantial burden of depression, and thoughts of self-harm among laborers surveyed. Policy level intervention and implementation, is needed to improve working conditions, including minimum wages and regulation of working hours is recommended.

   Sumar's Khamosh Pani
SO ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE Eco-cosmopolitanism; Feminism; Islamization; Pakistan; Partition
AB In an attempt to address the violence against women in South Asia while also keeping the environment in mind, I argue that Sabiha Sumar's film Khamosh Pani resists both religious nationalism and global capitalism through an eco-cosmopolitan feminist stance that is grounded in a materiality of place signified by land, water, and food. In my reading, the eco-cosmopolitan feminism of this film critiques patriarchy in the Punjab across the border with India and, simultaneously, remains locally grounded in that place with its local language, customs, and religious practices. As the history of the partition of British India has shown, when fathers and brothers forced their women to commit suicide by jumping in the village well to avoid rape, they simultaneously poisoned the well-water as the men migrated across the border. Violence against women was also violence against the waters of the Punjab. After showing how the film is feminist, I discuss how it draws attention to the materiality of the Pakistani Punjab on eco-cosmopolitan feminist terms. Specifically, I demonstrate that portrayals of land, water, and food present crucial tensions between patriarchal and nationalist Islamization and the resistance of Pakistan's women to these forces. An eco-cosmopolitan feminist reading of this film is particularly significant at this time given the continued violence against women in Punjab in the name of honor.

AB The problem of Kashmir continues to be the most important dispute between India and Pakistan. These two nuclear states are responsible for a situation that has been ongoing for 70 years: hundreds of people lose their lives every year, suicide attacks frequently occur, state forces apply disproportionate interventions, and the community is oppressed. The UN Security Council, which is primarily responsible for protecting international peace and security, adopted Resolution (47) during its first years of existence. This resolution provides detailed content for direct resolution of the Kashmir problem. For example, the resolution includes the plan for Kashmir to first be cleared of the military, and then the final situation of Jammu-Kashmir should be determined on the basis of the plebiscite application under UN supervision. Unfortunately, despite the plan, the resolution was not implemented due to disruptions in the UN system.

AB Bangladesh, one of the world's largest Muslim countries, is generally viewed as a success story with a strong tradition of secular democracy. Unfortunately, this assertion rests on a weak empirical foundation. Since becoming independent from Pakistan in 1971, democracy and secularism have been consistently undermined. Moreover, since 2000 Bangladesh has experienced more than 100 incidents of Islamist terrorism. More recently, the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda Indian Subcontinent have assaulted religious and ethnic minorities as well as secular and liberal activists. While these turns of events are alarming, Islamist militancy in Bangladesh remains understudied. In this article, we address this lacuna by undertaking regression analysis of recent Pew Research Center survey data to exposit the determinants of popular support of Islamist terrorism. With this study, we hope other scholars will be motivated to turn their attention to this increasingly important state.

DE FATA; CPEC; integration; security; Tribal; Taliban; terrorism
AB Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) remained as 'no men's land' since the times of the British rule and was governed under the Frontier Crime Regulation (FCR), a draconian law based on collective responsibility of the tribesman. The non-integration of FATA has kept it backward and deprived it from the fruits of a civilized life on one hand while on the other hand; it remained open for the intruders from the outside world. For instance, the Taliban and terrorists found a safe haven in FATA after the American attack on Afghanistan because of the absence of direct administrative system there. Their cadres included not only the tribal madrassa students but also the Afghans, Arabs and Uzbeks who have not only hijacked FATA but also posed a potential threat to the rest of the country. In order to counter the menace of the Taliban and terrorists, Pakistan's army launched various operations and proclaimed successes but such claims were usually followed by a fresh wave of terrorist and suicide attacks in the country. For a permanent solution to the problem and for the security of the road project which is being constructed from Xinxiang in the north-west China to Gwadar port in Baluchistan under the newly signed CPEC agreement with China, integration and mainstreaming of FATA with KP is indispensable which automatically will help in closing the nurseries of such unwelcomed Taliban and terrorist outfits.

AB A suicide bomb blast in 2013 at a distant city of Pakistan killed 84 and wounded more than 150 people. Some patients were transferred to our tertiary care hospital because of extreme load on medical services there. This patient arrived at the Aga Khan Hospital, 2 days after the bomb blast injury and underwent an orthopedic procedure. Next day, he developed sudden tachypnea, desaturation, and circulatory collapse. After initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation, he was immediately transferred to surgical intensive care unit. Based on history, echocardiography findings and patient parameters, a clinical diagnosis of massive pulmonary embolism was made and immediate thrombolytic therapy with alteplase was started. The immediate improvement in hemodynamic status was evident following 2 hours of alteplase infusion. This case also highlights the aggressiveness of resuscitation, decision making in initiating thrombolytic therapy on clinical grounds, importance of deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, and exhaustion of health resources due to blast related mass destruction.

LA English
DT Article
DE Recent life changes questionnaire; Adaptation; Pakistan
ID COUNTRIES; DISORDERS; POVERTY; URDU
AB Background: Contextually relevant stressful life events are integral to the quantification of stress. None such measures have been adapted for the Pakistani population.
   Methods: The RLCQ developed by Richard Rahe measures stress of an individual through recording the experience of life changing events. We used qualitative methodology in order to identify contextually relevant stressors in an open ended format, using serial in-depth interviews until thematic saturation of reported stressful life events was achieved. In our next phase of adaptation, our objective was to scale each item on the questionnaire, so as to weigh each of these identified events, in terms of severity of stress. This scaling exercise was performed on 200 random participants residing in the four communities of Karachi namely Kharadar, Dhorajee, Gulshan and Garden. For analysis of the scaled tool, exploratory factor analysis was used to inform structuring. Finally, to complete the process of adaption, content and face validity exercises were performed. Content validity by subject expert review and face validity was performed by translation and back translation of the adapted RLCQ. This yielded our final adapted tool.
   Results: Stressful life events emerging from the qualitative phase of the study reflect daily life stressors arising from the unstable socio-political environment. Some such events were public harassment, robbery/theft, missed life opportunities due to nepotism, extortion and threats, being a victim of state sponsored brutality, lack of electricity, water, sanitation, fuel, destruction due to natural disasters and direct or media based exposure to suicide bombing in the city. Personal or societal based relevant stressors included male child preference, having an unmarried middle aged daughter, lack of empowerment and respect reported by females. The finally adapted RLCQ incorporated "Environmental Stress" as a new category.
   Conclusion: The processes of qualitative methodology, in depth interview, community based scaling and face and content validity yielded an adapted RLCQ that represents contextually relevant life stress for adults residing in urban Pakistan.

ID DELIBERATE SELF-HARM; EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; COUNTRIES; PAKISTAN; KARACHI
AB Background: The management of patients who have made suicide attempts is a responsibility that frequently falls to general healthcare professionals in the clinic, hospital, and emergency room. Management here holds a wide meaning. In the acute situation, the first step of management is to stabilize the patient and ensure his/her medical safety. Further steps include exploring the history and circumstances of the attempt, assessing persistent ideation and the likelihood of recurrence of the attempt and finally, referral to a psychiatrist.
   Objective: This study hopes to unearth the factors contributing to neglect of patients suicidal ideation, intent & attempts by general healthcare professionals.
   Methodology: This cross-sectional analysis was conducted upon a total of 64 healthcare professionals. Data was collected using a self-administered, semi-quantitative questionnaire containing 12 close ended (quantitative) and 14 open-ended (qualitative) questions (in addition to basic demographic inquiries) after taking written informed consent. Both, acts of commission (of errors) and omission (of any of the steps of management, either acute or long-term) were considered as neglect. The data obtained was analyzed using MS. Excel 2017 and SPSS v. 21.0.
   Results: All subjects effectively provided acute medical care to the patients that helped stabilize the patients condition and successfully ameliorated all adverse symptoms, however, all but 12.5% of the subjects admitted to have omitted the crucial steps of referral to a psychiatrist. 15.6% of the subjects professed that the thought of referral never crossed their mind. 18.8% of the subjects admitted to have known the referral protocol but they never felt the need for referral. 53.1% of the subjects considered it to be not a part of their duty as a healthcare professional.
   Conclusion: Most primary care physicians in our set-up, despite effectively ameliorating the patient's acute situation, do not bother to carry on and complete the management. They do not facilitate the coordination of care with appropriate psychiatric resources and are thus guilty of neglect by omission.

AB The global threat of Al Qaeda post 9/11 and ISIL, increased Sunni-Shia conflicts, and violence in the Middle East and Pakistan dominate headlines and challenge governments in the region and globally. Both Muslim extremists and some Western experts and observers speak of a clash of civilizations or a culture war in Muslim-West relations. Both the discourse and violence yet again raise questions about the relationship of Islam to violence and terrorism: is Islam a particularly violent religion? Critics cite Quranic passages, doctrines like jihad and events in Muslim history as strong indicators and proof that Islam is the primary driver of Muslim extremism and terrorism. What do the Quran and Islamic law have to say about violence, jihad and warfare? What are the primary drivers of terrorism in the name of Islam today? This article will address these questions in the context of development of global jihadist movements, in particular Al Qaeda and ISIL, their roots, causes, ideology and agenda.

AB In recent years, jihadists across the world have transformed their gendered violence, shocking the world by breaking from prior taboos and even celebrating abuses that they had previously prohibited. This behavior is surprising because jihadists represent a class of insurgents that are deeply bound by rules and norms. For jihadists, deviating from established Islamist doctrines is no easy feat. What then explains these sudden transformations in the rules and norms governing jihadist violence? An inductive investigation of contemporary jihadist violence in Pakistan and Nigeria reveals a new theory of jihadist normative evolution. Data from these cases show that dramatic changes in jihadist violence occur when an external trigger creates an expanded political space for jihadist entrepreneurs to do away with normative constraints on socially prohibited types of violence. As these jihadist leaders capitalize on the triggers, they are able to encourage a re-socialization process within their ranks, resulting in the erosion of previously held taboos, the adoption of proscribed behaviors, and the emergence of toxic new norms.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the moderating role of marital status between infidelity and development of stress, anxiety and depression. Additionally, to investigate the relationship among infidelity, stress, anxiety and depression among married couples and divorced individual.
   Design/methodology/approach A purposive sampling technique was used based on cross-sectional design. In total, 200 participants (married couples, n=100; divorced individuals, n=100) were incorporated from different NGO's and welfare organizations of Rawalpindi, and Islamabad, Pakistan. Age ranged from 20 to 60 years. Two scales were used to measure the infidelity, stress, anxiety and depression in married couples and divorced couples.
   Findings The result revealed that emotional infidelity was positively significant correlated with stress (r=0.39, p=0.001), anxiety (r=0.40, p=0.001) and depression (r=0.35, p=0.001) for married couples. The result also displayed that sexual infidelity was positively significant correlated with stress (r=0.39, p=0.001), anxiety (r=0.39, p=0.001) and depression (r=0.34, p=0.001) for married couples. The result further elaborated that emotional infidelity and sexual infidelities were positively non-significant correlated with stress, anxiety and depression for divorced individuals. The analysis results revealed that marital status was moderator between infidelity and development of stress, anxiety and depression.
   Research limitations/implications This paper consisted of sample from three basic cities of Pakistan; thus, this paper finding may not be applied on whole population. Consequently, explanatory, exploratory and descriptive studies would be useful to enlighten the infidelity's mechanism in prolongation of psychological distress across married couples and divorced individual in detail. Local tools to measure gender-related issues would be helpful in prospect while it combine cultural aspects as well.
   Social implications This study would be helpful in clinical settings to raise the awareness to effectively deal with their children.
   Originality/value The study recommended that those divorced individuals who had experienced either sexual infidelity or emotional infidelity were more likely to develop psychological problems as compared to married couples. This study would be helpful in clinical settings to raise the awareness to effectively deal with their children.

TI Poverty in Global Perspective: Is Shame a Common Denominator?
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Focussing on the psychosocial dimensions of poverty, the contention that shame lies at the 'irreducible absolutist core' of the idea of poverty is examined through qualitative research with adults and children experiencing poverty in diverse settings in seven countries: rural Uganda and India; urban China; Pakistan; South Korea and United Kingdom; and small town and urban Norway. Accounts of the lived experience of poverty were found to be very similar, despite massive disparities in material circumstances associated with locally defined poverty lines, suggesting that relative notions of poverty are an appropriate basis for international comparisons. Though socially and culturally nuanced, shame was found to be associated with poverty in each location, variably leading to pretence, withdrawal, self-loathing, 'othering', despair, depression, thoughts of suicide and generally to reductions in personal efficacy. While internally felt, poverty-related shame was equally imposed by the attitudes and behaviour of those not in poverty, framed by public discourse and influenced by the objectives and implementation of anti-poverty policy. The evidence appears to confirm the negative consequences of shame, implicates it as a factor in increasing the persistence of poverty and suggests important implications for the framing, design and delivery of anti-poverty policies.

AB Objective: To determine the risk factors for Deliberate Self-Harm (DSH) in patients presenting to the Emergency Departments (EDs) of three tertiary care hospitals of Karachi, Pakistan.
   Study Design: Multicentre matched case control study.
   Place and Duration of Study: EDs of the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Civil Hospital, Karachi and Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, from March 2011 to February 2012.
   Methodology: A total of 201 cases and 201 matched controls were taken from three hospitals situated in Karachi. All patients of 16 years and above presenting to the EDs of the hospitals with DSH attempt were invited to participate in the study. Controls were ED patients with complaints other than DSH. A control was matched with case for hospital, gender and age. Two questionnaires were used to collect information on the risk factors of DSH. Conditional Logistic Regression (CLR) was used to assess the association of various risk factors with DSH.
   Results: Risk factors of DSH in Karachi included current history of mental disorder (OR = 4.53, 95% CI = 1.59 - 12.92), not sharing problems with someone (OR = 4.67, 95% CI = 2.4 - 9.0), living in rented houses (OR = 2.58, 95% CI = 1.37 -4.84), Pathan ethnicity (OR = 5.05, 95% CI = 1.01-25.38) followed by others (OR = 3.88, 95% CI = 0.77 - 19.69) and Urdu speaking (OR = 2.71, 95% CI = 0.59 - 12.45). Absence of physical illness in the past month had an inverse association with DSH (OR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.07 - 0.37).
   Conclusion: Mental illnesses, low socio-economic status and loneliness were the risk factors of DSH patients presenting to the three EDs of Karachi. Physical illness in the last month was protective against DSH in these patients. Psychiatric evaluation of DSH patients in the ED is important for early diagnosis and management of mental disorders.

TI Newspaper reports as a source for injury data in developing countries
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB Injuries are an important public health problem and a leading cause of death among adults and children. In most of the developing world, with rapid changes in lifestyle, rural development, urbanization, an increase in number of vehicles, introduction of mechanized farming and pesticides in agriculture, the effect of injuries on mortality and morbidity is expected to increase.
   Injuries have been infrequently studied in developing countries; their importance is incompletely understood and they are seriously neglected in health research and policy. The reasons for this situation may be many, but one important reason is the unavailability of data in countries to assess the magnitude of the problem.
   Hospital and police records are the primary data source for injuries in the majority of the developing world. Newspaper reports may be an alternative source for injury data. This hypothesis was tested in the Rawalpindi Division of Pakistan by collecting data from newspaper reports for both intentional and unintentional injuries for 6 months (January-June 1999). This was compared with police data for the same time period. The results revealed that newspapers report more injury-related events and for some categories, such as suicides, the reporting was far greater by newspapers than the police. We conclude that the current system of police data collection needs to be strengthened. Newspapers may serve as a comparative source of information to evaluate the coverage of police data.

AB There is some evidence that natural levels of lithium (Li) in drinking water may have a protective effect on neurological health. In present study, we evaluate the Li levels in drinking water of different origin and bottled mineral water. To evaluate the association between lithium levels in drinking water with human health, the scalp hair samples of male subjects (25-45 years) consumed drinking water obtained from ground water (GW), municipal treated water (MTW) and bottled mineral water (BMW) from rural and urban areas of Sindh, Pakistan were selected. The water samples were pre-concentrated five to tenfold at 60 degrees C using temperature-controlled electric hot plate. While scalp hair samples were oxidized by acid in a microwave oven, prior to determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The Li content in different types of drinking water, GW, MTW and BMW was found in the range of 5.12-22.6, 4.2-16.7 and 0.0-16.3 lg/L, respectively. It was observed that Li concentration in the scalp hair samples of adult males consuming ground water was found to be higher, ranged as 292-393 lg/kg, than those who are drinking municipal treated and bottle mineral water (212-268 and 145-208 lg/kg), respectively.

AB The current study extended the Procrastination-Health model by examining a multiple mediation model, with two cognitive schemas (defectiveness; insufficient self-control) serving as mediators. The models were as follows: procrastination -> defectiveness -> depression; procrastination -> insufficient self-control -> depression. Participants included 412 (271 women, 141 men) United States (US) and 240 (107 women, 133 men) Pakistani college students, who responded via self-report questionnaires. In the US sample, results revealed a non-significant direct effect between procrastination and depression after consideration for the two cognitive schemas, suggesting the schemas completely mediated the model. Both defectiveness and insufficient self-control schemas were significant individual mediators. In the Pakistani model, results revealed a significant direct effect and indirect effect through the two cognitive schemas, indicating partial mediation. Only the indirect path through defectiveness schemas was significant in the Pakistani model. Given slight differences in the two models, a moderated-mediation model was analyzed to determine if the strength of the direct and indirect effects varied by nationality. The strength of the direct and indirect effects was not moderated by nationality. Overall, this is the first study to identify cognitive mediators in the procrastination-depression relationship. Such findings represent a significant extension of the Procrastination-Health model and offer some unique cognitive insights into culturally sensitive conceptualizations and treatments for depression.

AB Introduction
   Corrosive ingestion is a grave public health problem. It is a medical emergency and shows diverse clinical presentations. The ingestion of corrosive substances has devastating effects on upper gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and the corrosive injury is associated with numerous life-threatening complications. The present study aims to explore the clinico-epidemiological characteristics of patients of corrosive ingestion presenting at a tertiary care hospital of Multan, Pakistan.
   Method
   The target study population consists of all the patients with primary diagnosis of corrosive ingestion who presented to the department of thoracic surgery, Nishtar Medical University Hospital Multan, Pakistan, from January 2016 to December 2017. The follow-up cases and the cases with ingestion of substances other than corrosives were not included in the study. All the included cases were evaluated by detailed history, thorough physical examination and the necessary investigations. The post-corrosive tissue damage was classified according to Zargar's classification system. All the demographic data and other variables were measured and recorded using a Performa. The data were analyzed by using computer program SPSS 21 version.

   The total study population was 206 patients. There were 135 females (65.5%) and 71 male patients (34.5%). Age ranged from 2 to 42 years (mean 23.44 +/- 7.19). Only seven cases were found in the age group of 2-7 years. The residents of rural areas showed a slightly increased inclination towards corrosive ingestion. One hundred and ten cases were unmarried (53.4%) while 90 patients were married (43.7%). The incidence of corrosive ingestion was much high in illiterate/less educated patients belonging to the groups of lower socio-economic status. One hundred and ninety-seven patients ingested corrosive substances deliberately with the suicidal intention (95.6%). The acid used as bathroom cleaner and the laundry bleaches were the most commonly used corrosive agents. In 166 cases the corrosive materials were already present at home for domestic purposes (80.6%), but 18 subjects particularly purchased these corrosive substances to commit suicide. The quantity of ingested material ranged between 10 ml and 150 ml with a mean of 42.6 ml +/- 33.2. The shortest hospital stay was one day, and the longest one was 60 days. Esophagus and oropharyngeal area were the most common site which sustained the corrosive injury, whereas corrosive injury to duodenum was least frequent (34.5 %).
   Conclusion
   Corrosive ingestion is a serious medical problem and it requires a multidisciplinary approach and a good coordination between different medical specialists. Underprivileged teenager females of rural areas are more likely to ingest corrosive materials with suicidal intention. In most of the ingestions, household cleaning products are used. Only the patients with severe corrosive injury should be admitted to intensive care units. Enforcing regulations for the manufacturers of household cleaning products can significantly reduce the incidence of this potentially fatal condition.

TI EFFECT OF PARENTAL SEPARATION ON MENTAL HEALTH STATUS OF CHILDREN OF AGE

AB The trends in family composition have major implications in the life course of children and their mental well-being. A stable family is vital for sound development of the personality of children. Despite the increase in the trend of parental separation, there are few studies in Pakistan pertaining to the effects of parental separation on child health and even those do not provide a good insight. Therefore, it is a need of the hour to investigate these effects. For this purpose, a cross-sectional study was carried out among the children with such circumstances, of ages 6 - 16 years, visiting the psychiatry department of public sector hospitals of Lahore. A questionnaire was formulated and was filled by 98 participants. Analysis of the data collected showed that among these children, there is higher frequency of depression, violence, social, learning and moral deterioration. Most of them suffer from low self-esteem and have an increased tendency to self-harm. Thus the hypothesis that parental separation affects the mental health status of children negatively resulting in emotional and psychological disturbance was supported. So, there is a need of proper counselling of the children to make them understand the circumstances of separation. In addition to that, the platforms of print, electronic and social media should be employed to spread awareness on this subject. Public should be made aware of the drastic effects that an unstable familial environment brings to the mental well-being of children.

AB This article reviews evaluation studies of interventions aimed at preventing and reducing incidents of suicide and self-harm among incarcerated individuals. Study design, sample characteristics, intervention procedures, study measures, and relevant results of each study are reviewed. The outcomes of interest include severity and frequency of self-harm episodes and suicidal ideation, scores on adaptive coping methods, scoring on the Beck Hopelessness scale and risk scores. The six evaluated studies are peer-reviewed, published between 1990 and 2015, and took place in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Pakistan. Treatment modalities widely vary across studies and include cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, peer programming, staff intervention training, and uniquely-designed courses that incorporate various aspects from other treatment modalities. Due to the nature of the studies, only one multi-randomized controlled trial was identified. All identified studies had a pre- and post-treatment design either lacking a comparison group or containing 1-2 comparison groups and conduct follow-up of varying times. While Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) interventions and uniquely-tailored intervention programs suggest promising results, the general absence of comparison groups, the shortage of relevant evaluation studies and the inconsistency of behavioral outcome measurements compromise the capacity of this review. Further, definitional variances, particularly for self-injury (self-harm, non-suicidal self-injury [NSSI], deliberate self-harm, suicidal behavior, etc.) affect the ability to synthesize study results. This article aims to synthesize the literature results to identify the most effective interventions that would benefit from additional research.

AB This study evaluated the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the severity of PTSD symptoms in survivors, rescuers and witnesses of terrorist attacks on Khyber bazaar, Qissa Khawani bazaar, and All Saints Church in Peshawar city area. Cross-sectional survey is carried out on a sample of one hundred survivors, rescuers and witness of terrorist attacks using structured interviews to assess the severity of posttraumatic stress, five months after the attacks. The study period extended from January 24, 2014 to March 24, 2014 which constitutes a total of period of 8 weeks. PTSD symptoms are measured using Posttraumatic Symptom Scale Interview (PSSI) and conferred to a diagnosis of PTSD at 5 months. Additionally, the severity of PTSD symptoms were determined using PSSI scores, severity ranged from 0-51. Of the one hundred survey respondents, 88% were males and 12% were females. Forty percent (40%) had attained 10 years of education, matriculation, but irrespective of the gender or educational status, all had some degree of PTSD. Sixty-six (66%) percent respondents are diagnosed as having moderate PTSD while 11% of the sample suffered from severe PTSD level. Age, gender, occupation and education level did not have any correlation with PTSD development. The contemporary findings indicate that any person who has witnessed or survived catastrophes of terrorist activities like bomb blast or being exposed to suicide attacks is at risk for developing PTSD, and there is necessity to deliver specialized post-disaster mental health facilities to the people having substantial levels of PTSD after calamities of such great intensity.

   Place and Duration of Study: Medical Unit II and III, Nishtar Hospital, Multan, from April 2015 to September 2016.
   Methodology: All adult patients admitted with history of paraphenylene diamine ingestion were evaluated for clinical features, complications, and outcomes on a pre-designed proforma.
   Results: Out of 122 patients, 95 were females (77.9%) and 101/122 patients had ingested the poison with an intention of suicide or self harm (82.8%). The mean age of presentation was 23.21 +/- 8.2 years. Cervico-facial edema was the chief presenting complaint, seen in 116/122 (95%) of patients, with median of 2 (interquartile range=3) for time of onset after ingestion of poison. Tracheostomy was needed in 95/116 (82%) patients with cervico-facial edema. Other common complaints were dark urine in 95/122 (77.9%) and pain in limbs in 98/122 (80.3%) patients. Rhabdomyolysis was evident in 91/122 (74.5%) patients at admission. Acute kidney injury developed in 37/122 (30.3%) patients. Among these, 16 (43.2%) patients required haemodialysis. Myocarditis was diagnosed in 33/122 (27%) patients. The median for hospital stay was 9.50 days (interquartile range=6.25). The mortality was 34/122 (28%). Ventricular arrhythmias were the commonest cause of death in 25/34 (73.5%), followed by renal failure in 5/34 (14.7%), asphyxia in 2/34 (5.88%), and aspiration pneumonia in 2/34 (5.88%) patients.

AB Objective: To determine the characteristics of firearm injuries on head and neck in patients presenting to the Ear Nose and Throat Department of a tertiary care hospital.
   Methods: This prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted at the Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar, from June 2014 to May 2015, and comprised victims of firearm injuries. They were subjected to a thorough examination of the wounds specifically and the rest of the Ear, Nose and Throat, Head and Neck regions generally. Data was collected on a proforma. SPSS 16 was used for data analysis.
   Results: Out of the 56 patients, 49(87.5%) were men. The overall mean age was 28.68 +/- 1.63 years (range: 6-80 years. Besides, 33(58.9%) patients were in the age range 20-40 years followed by 18(32.1%) below 20 years. Overall, 27(48.2%) patients were jobless and 24(42.9%) had education below grade ten. Pistol was the most commonly-used weapon in 28(50%). Hospital stay was 2-10 days with a mean of 4.37 +/- 1.74 days. Single-entry wound on the neck was common 21(37.5%), predominantly on the right side 24(42.9%), while there were 33(58.9%) single-exit wounds, affecting neck in 18(32.1%) cases and on the left side in 19(33.9%).
   Conclusion: Firearm injuries were common among young men who were illiterate and poor socioeconomically. Homicidal injuries mostly occurred during the daytime. Pistol was the most commonly-used weapon, while wounds on the neck were more common.

DE Paraphenylene diamine; Poisoning; Facial edema; Tracheostomy: Mortality
ID ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY; HAIR DYE; EXPERIENCE; MORTALITY
AB Background: Paraphenylenediamine (PPD), also known as Kaala pathar, has become an emerging and life threating source of poisoning in Pakistan as well as in many other Asian and African nations. The aim of this study is to recognize the etiological factors, clinical features and outcomes of patients with PPD poisoning.
   Methodology: This observational prospective analytic study included 32 patients who presented in ICU of Nishtar Hospital, Multan. Patients were first managed conservatively by IV fluids, diuretics, antihistamines and steroids; tracheal intubation or tracheostomy was performed only if needed. Univariate analysis was used to determine the independent variables of mortality after PPD poisoning and odds ratios were calculated.
   Results: Cervicofacial edema, oral erythema and sore throat were most common clinical presentation of patients at the time of admission in ICU, with incidence rates of 93.8%, 81.3% and 75.0%, respectively. Acute renal failure occurred in 34.4% patients and acute hepatitis in 18.75% patients. The independent predictors of mortality after PPD poisoning were: male gender (odds ratio 16.62), dysphagia (odds ratio 9.92), hyperkalemia (odds ratio 84.0), development of cardiogenic shock (odds ratio 36.75), acute renal failure (odds ratio 16.62) and acute hepatitis (odds ratio 27.50). Tracheostomy was required in all 30 (93.7%), and 13 (40.6%) patients required mechanical ventilation support. Inhospital mortality was 9 (28.1%). Mean stay of patients in ICU was 3.47 +/- 2.04 days
   Conclusion: Paraphenylenediamine (Kaala Pathar) poisoning has become one of the major means of suicide attempts with very high mortality rate. Male gender, dysphagia at the time of presentation, hyperkalemia, cardiogenic shock, acute renal failure and acute hepatitis are the independent predictors of mortality after PPD poisoning.

AB Background
   The delivery of mental health services in rural China has been notably limited due to lack of qualified mental health professionals among other impeding factors. A village doctor-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention may be one way of improving accessibility. The purpose of this study was to explore the advantages and challenges of implementing this intervention, as delivered by trained village doctors, to treat late-life depression in rural China.
   Methods
   We conducted one focus group discussion with 10 village doctors, 10 individual interviews with each of the village doctors, and individual interviews with 19 older adults. The topic guides were advantages and challenges of the intervention program from the perspective of the village doctors and older adults. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded using NVivo 8, and analyzed using thematic analysis.
   Results
   The village doctors stressed the importance of role-playing and using instructive manuals in the training. Proper supervision was also a key component of the program. The benefits received from the intervention for the village doctors and the elders were positive such that both the doctors and the older adults were willing to implement/receive this intervention. Cultural and political factors (renqing and perceived policy consideration) facilitated the elders' access to mental health services. Challenges included a lack of real therapy (in contrast to role-playing) demonstrated in the training and lack of a step-by-step manual based on different types of problems encountered. Other impediments to the successful implementation of the intervention included the time constraints of village doctors and the presence of other people when conducting the intervention.
   Conclusions
   The present study has demonstrated that the intervention program is likely to be an acceptable geriatric depression intervention in rural China if several challenges are appropriately addressed.

AB VISHRAM is a community-based mental health program to address psycho-social distress and risk factors for suicide in a predominantly rural population in Central India, through targeted interventions for the prevention and management of Depression and Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD). The evaluation was designed to assess the impact of program on the contact coverage of evidence-based treatments for depression and AUD through a repeated survey design. This paper describes the baseline prevalence of depression among adults in rural community, association of various demographic and socio-economic factors with depression and estimates contact coverage and costs of care for depression.
   Population-based cross-sectional survey of adults in 30 villages of Amravati district in Vidarbha region of Central India. The outcome of interest was a probable diagnosis of depression which was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Data were analyzed using simple and multiple logistic regression.
   The outcome of current depression (PHQ-9 a parts per thousand yen 10) was observed in 14.6 % of the sample (95 % CI 12.8-16.4 %). The contact coverage for current depression was only 4.3 % (95 % CI 1.5-7.1 %). Prevalence of depression varied greatly between the two sites of the study; higher age, female gender, lower education, economic status below poverty line and indebtedness were associated with depression; and while a contact coverage with formal health care was very low, a large proportion of affected persons had consulted family members.
   Our findings clearly indicate that psycho-social distress in rural communities in Maharashtra is strongly associated with social determinants such as gender, poverty and indebtedness and affects the entire population and not just farmers.

AB Rates of self-harm appear high in South Asian young women in the United Kingdom (UK) although previous studies were mostly small. Data on treatment and outcomes for South Asians are lacking. This study compared rates of self-harm, socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, provision of services and risk of repetition by ethnicity.
   A prospective cohort of adult self-harm attendees (n = 7185), aged 15 and over presenting to four emergency departments in the cities of Manchester and Salford, UK over a 4-year period.
   The study included 299 South Asians. South Asian women aged 16-24 years were more likely to self-harm than Whites of the same age group (1010.9 vs. 754 per 100,000). Across all age groups the rates of self-harm were lower in South Asian men compared to White men and to South Asian women. South Asian women were significantly more likely to report relationship problems within the family than White women (32% vs. 19%, P = < 0.001). South Asians were less likely than Whites to report depressive symptoms and to be offered specialist mental health services (Rate ratio = 0.75), and more likely to be referred back to the GP (Rate ratio = 1.83). South Asians were less likely to attend with a repeat episode (Rate ratio = 0.56).
   Young South Asian women are at high risk of self-harm, but their clinical risk appears to be lower in terms of the accepted contextual factors contributing to risk. Potentially useful service provision may include an interpersonal problem solving approach although to be effective, interventions would need to be acceptable to South Asian women and culturally appropriate.

AB Background: Unhealthy behaviors are associated with mental health problems and violence in adolescents, yet their combined association has been understudied. Using the Global School Health Survey, this study examined the association between combined unhealthy behaviors (including fast food, soft drink, smoking, other tobacco products and physical inactivity) and anxiety, suicidal ideation and involvement in physical fight among Pakistani adolescents.
   Methods: Data were obtained from the Global School Health Survey conducted in Pakistan (2009). The study population consisted of school going adolescents aged 13 to 15 years. Association of combined unhealthy behaviors with anxiety, suicidal ideation and involvement in physical fight were studied through secondary analysis. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis by complex sample method, accounting for cluster sampling technique used for data collection.
   Results: Of the total 4583 students, weighted percentage and unweighted count for one, two, three and four or more unhealthy behaviors was 39.4% (n = 1770), 22.1% (n = 963), 5.9% (n = 274) and 1.2% (n = 62) respectively. The weighted prevalence for anxiety, suicidal ideation and involvement in physical fight were 8.4%, 7.3% and 37.4% respectively. The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis after adjustment showed that students who had four or more unhealthy behaviors had higher odds of; being anxious (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.31-4.59, p value 0.004), suicide ideation (OR 4.56, 95% CI 2.58-8.07, p value < 0.001) and being involved in physical fight (OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.63-6.08, p value < 0.001) as compared to those who had not adopted any unhealthy behaviors.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that the co-occurrence of unhealthy behaviors is associated with anxiety, suicidal ideation and physical fight among adolescents. These findings should be considered when developing interventions to combat detrimental outcomes of unhealthy behaviors during adolescence.

AB Although problems in mental health constitute 14% of the global burden of disease, mental health has been largely missing from the international health agenda. The burden from mental illness is largely attributable to the chronically disabling nature of depression and other common mental disorders, alcohol-use and substance-use disorders, and psychoses. The last decade has seen some progress in addressing this gap. In 2001, the World Health Report, Mental Health: New Understanding, New Hope, drew attention to the situation, with an appeal from the World Health Organization's Director General that 'mental health - neglected for far too long - is crucial to the overall well-being of individuals, societies and countries and must be universally regarded in a new light.' In September 2007, the journal Lancet launched the global mental health series, which highlighted the public-health dimension of mental health, identified barriers to receiving treatment, and gave a call for action to the nations of the world, to make a major commitment to upgrade the quality of mental-health services, to develop evidence-based treatment and preventive measures, to provide support for research in mental health, and to develop indicators to monitor progress. In October 2008, the World Health Organization launched the Mental Health Gap Action Programme, with the aim of scaling up the services for mental, neurological and substance-use disorders in all countries but especially those with low and middle incomes. The programme aims to develop evidence-based packages of care, psycho - social interventions and pharmacotherapy for tens of millions who could be treated for depression, schizophrenia and epilepsy, prevented from suicide, and begin to lead normal lives - even in very poor countries. While there is cause for optimism, much remains to be done. Most of all, there needs to be awareness amongst health providers and planners that mental health is an integral part of general health concerns, and that there can be no health without mental health.

AB IMPORTANCE The literature focuses on mortality among children younger than 5 years. Comparable information on nonfatal health outcomes among these children and the fatal and nonfatal burden of diseases and injuries among older children and adolescents is scarce.
   OBJECTIVE To determine levels and trends in the fatal and nonfatal burden of diseases and injuries among younger children (aged < 5 years), older children (aged 5-9 years), and adolescents (aged 10-19 years) between 1990 and 2013 in 188 countries from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 study.
   EVIDENCE REVIEW Data from vital registration, verbal autopsy studies, maternal and child death surveillance, and other sources covering 14 244 site-years (ie, years of cause of death data by geography) from 1980 through 2013 were used to estimate cause-specific mortality. Data from 35 620 epidemiological sources were used to estimate the prevalence of the diseases and sequelae in the GBD 2013 study. Cause-specific mortality for most causes was estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble Model strategy. For some infectious diseases (eg, HIV infection/AIDS, measles, hepatitis B) where the disease process is complex or the cause of death data were insufficient or unavailable, we used natural history models. For most nonfatal health outcomes, DisMod-MR 2.0, a Bayesian metaregression tool, was used to meta-analyze the epidemiological data to generate prevalence estimates.
   FINDINGS Of the 7.7 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 7.4-8.1) million deaths among children and adolescents globally in 2013, 6.28 million occurred among younger children, 0.48 million among older children, and 0.97 million among adolescents. In 2013, the leading causes of death were lower respiratory tract infections among younger children (905 059 deaths; 95% UI, 810304-998 125), diarrheal diseases among older children (38 325 deaths; 95% UI, 30 365-47 678), and road injuries among adolescents (115 186 deaths; 95% UI, 105 185-124 870). Iron deficiency anemia was the leading cause of years lived with disability among children and adolescents, affecting 619 (95% UI, 618-621) million in 2013. Large between-country variations exist in mortality from leading causes among children and adolescents. Countries with rapid declines in all-cause mortality between 1990 and 2013 also experienced large declines in most leading causes of death, whereas countries with the slowest declines had stagnant or increasing trends in the leading causes of death. In 2013, Nigeria had a 12% global share of deaths from lower respiratory tract infections and a 38% global share of deaths from malaria. India had 33% of the world's deaths from neonatal encephalopathy. Half of the world's diarrheal deaths among children and adolescents occurred in just 5 countries: India, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Ethiopia.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Understanding the levels and trends of the leading causes of death and disability among children and adolescents is critical to guide investment and inform policies. Monitoring these trends over time is also key to understanding where interventions are having an impact. Proven interventions exist to prevent or treat the leading causes of unnecessary death and disability among children and adolescents. The findings presented here show that these are underused and give guidance to policy makers in countries where more attention is needed.

AB Terrorism and insurgence of varying magnitude at the national and international levels have continued to threaten global peace and kept most governments and communities of the world on toes. Terrorism is the use of violence against a civilian population or non-combatant group to compel government or an international organization to act or abstain from doing an act [1], [2]. The 11th September, 2001 (9/11) simultaneous attacks in US on the World Trade Centre in New York, the Pentagon in Virginia and site at Pennsylvania claiming over 3,996 lives and leaving over 6000 others injured and which brought down to rabbles one of the biggest edifices of our time and stirred the whole world out of complacency is a typical act of terrorism. This singular event more than any previous cases of terrorism has put most nations on red alert while similar affronts to human peace and comfort continue to heighten as they last in other parts of the globe[2]. For more than a decade now, terrorism and insurgence have taken the nations of the world by storm. What started as pockets of disaffection and protests reactions at different parts of the world has assumed unimaginable sophistication and startling dimensions. The bombing and sinking of British Palestine Ship at Haifa killing 267 persons on board and Leaving 172 injured in 1940 and the poisoning of bread for prisoners in Camp Stalag 13, Germany in 1946 where 148 persons died and 124 injured [3], are nothing to compare with the 9/11 attack. The hijacking of planes and detonating of bombs by suicide bombers killing themselves and their unsuspecting victims in aircrafts, trains and train platforms, parks and garages, churches, market places, hotels, night clubs, cinema houses and even hospitals and schools where our young go to learn to improve the quality of humanity is an unparalleled dimension of terrorism[3],[2]. The Beslan school hostage in Russia in September 1-3, 2004 where 385 persons died and 783 were injured; the multiple bombing in London, United Kingdom in 2005 where 65 people died and over 700 were injured; Peshawar School attack in Pakistan in December, 2014 where 170 persons died and un-estimated number injured, and the abduction of 300 school girls in Chibok, Nigeria and taken to unknown destination since 2014 as well as the coordinated attack on Paris and St Denis, France in November 13, 2015, killing 130 persons and leaving hundreds injured is not only a clear indication of extreme radicalization of local affairs but an attempt to annihilate the world. As a matter of fact, peace is eluding many nations of the world including Nigeria [4],[5]. Of a truth, peace is eluding the whole world. Peace is when people are able to resolve conflicts without violence and can work together to improve the quality of their lives; when everyone live in safety, without fear or threat of violence and no form of violence is tolerated[6]. If this definition of peace is true then no nation today is at peace with itself thus making the concern in this study more compelling.
