AB Introduction: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a common form of violence experienced by pregnant women and is believed to have adverse mental health effects postnatally. This study investigated the association of postnatal depression (PND) and suicidal ideation with emotional, physical and sexual IPV experienced by women during pregnancy.
   Methods: Data were collected from 842 women interviewed postnatally in six postnatal clinics in Harare, Zimbabwe. We used the World Health Organization versions of IPV and Centre for Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale measures to assess IPV and PND respectively. We derived a violence severity variable and combined forms of IPV variables from IPV questions. Logistic regression was used to analyse data whilst controlling for past mental health and IPV experiences.
   Results: One in five women [21.4% (95% CI 18.6-24.2)] met the diagnostic criteria for PND symptomatology whilst 21.6% (95% CI 18.8-24.4) reported postpartum suicide thoughts and 4% (95% CI 2.7-5.4) reported suicide attempts. Two thirds (65.4%) reported any form of IPV. Although individual forms of severe IPV were associated with PND, stronger associations were found between PND and severe emotional IPV or severe combined forms of IPV. Suicidal ideation was associated with emotional IPV. Other forms of IPV, except when combined with emotional IPV, were not individually associated with suicidal ideation.
   Conclusion: Emotional IPV during pregnancy negatively affects women's mental health in the postnatal period. Clinicians and researchers should include it in their conceptualisation of violence and health. Further research must look at possible indirect relationships between sexual and physical IPV on mental health. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A retrospective study of the pattern of poisoning cases admitted to eight major urban referral hospitals in Zimbabwe over a 2-year period (1998-1999 inclusive) was conducted to describe the pattern of poisoning at these centres. There were a total of 2764 hospital admissions due to poisoning, involving a total of 2846 toxic agents. Accidental poisoning (AP) and deliberate self-poisoning (DSP) accounted for 48.9% (1352 cases) and 41.3% (1142 cases), respectively. With AP, the highest number of cases (45.9%) occurred in children below the age of 5 years, with half of these due to chemicals, mainly paraffin. In the DSP group, however, more than 60% of all cases occurred in the 16-25-year age group. In addition, twice as many females as males were admitted for DSP compared with an overall male/female ratio of 1 : 1.2. Pesticides (31.4%) and pharmaceuticals (30.4%) were the most common groups of toxic agents responsible for the hospital admissions. Unknown toxins, natural toxins and pesticides showed the highest mortality rates (15.4%, 8.3% and 6.7%, respectively). Compared with the last major survey of poisoning in Zimbabwe, the pattern of poisoning at referral hospitals has changed over the last decade, with an increase in pesticide and pharmaceutical cases and a marked fall in cases of traditional medicine poisoning. Educational and legislative interventions may be required to address these changes. There is the need also to investigate further the high mortality rates associated with traditional medicine poisoning. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Background. Deliberate self-poisoning by ingesting pesticides is a serious health problem among farmers, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Preventing these suicides is a priority for a public mental health agenda.
   Objective. To examine the role of pesticide poisoning in suicide and nonfatal deliberate self-harm, and clarify awareness of risks, safe practices concerning storage and use of pesticides, and associated self-injury, both unintentional and intentional, within farmer households of the Sundarban region, India.
   Methods. Retrospective record review of adult cases of deliberate self-poisoning at the Block Primary Health Centres of 13 Sundarban Blocks was performed to analyze the relative roles of various methods of self-harm and their lethality. Focus group discussions, questionnaires, and in-depth interviews were undertaken in a community study of farmer households to examine pesticide-related views and practices, with particular attention to storage, use, and health impact.
   Results. Pesticide poisoning was the most common method of deliberate self-harm in both men and women. Pesticide storage in most households was unsafe and knowledge was inadequate concerning adverse effects of pesticides on health, crops, and the environment.
   Conclusions. An intersectoral approach linking the interests of public health, mental health, and agriculture is well suited to serve the collective interests of all three agendas better than each in isolation. Such an approach is needed to reduce morbidity and mortality from unintentional and intentional self-injury in low-income agricultural communities like those of the Sundarban region.

AB The use of political assassinations against key leaders of liberation movements has had a major impact on the course of history in Africa and the Middle East. Not only have some of the greatest of Third World leaders been killed but so, too, has the hope for political change they embodied. This survey of assassinations carried out by western states and their agents from the 1960s onwards reveals a bloody legacy of killings of leaders from Algeria, Cameroon, Congo, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Morocco, Mozambique, Palestine, South Africa, Togo and Zimbabwe - all of which were linked to the interests of western imperialism. Today's daily diet of suicide bombings and the targeting of civilians by both western militaries and jihadis is one consequence, it is suggested, of the brutalisation effected by the policy of political assassination.

AB Background: The use of simulated patients to teach in psychiatry has not been reported from low-income countries. This is the first study using simulation teaching in psychiatry in Africa. The aim of this study was to introduce a novel method of psychiatric teaching to medical students at the University of Zimbabwe and assess its feasibility and preliminary effectiveness. We selected depression to simulate because students in Zimbabwe are most likely to see cases of psychoses during their ward-based clinical exposure.
   Methods: Zimbabwean psychiatrists adapted scenarios on depression and suicide based on ones used in London. Zimbabwean post-graduate trainee psychiatrists were invited to carry out the teaching and psychiatric nursing staff were recruited and trained in one hour to play the simulated patients (SPs). All students undertaking their psychiatry placement (n = 30) were allocated into groups for a short didactic lecture on assessing for clinical depression and then rotated around 3 scenarios in groups of 4-5 and asked to interview a simulated patient with signs of depression. Students received feedback from peers, SPs and facilitators. Students completed the Confidence in Assessing and Managing Depression (CAM-D) questionnaire before and after the simulation session and provided written free-text feedback.
   Results: Post-graduate trainers, together with one consultant, facilitated the simulated teaching after three hours training. Student confidence scores increased from mean 15.90 to 20.05 (95% CI = 2.58-5.71) t (20) = 5.52, (p > 0.0001) following the simulation teaching session. Free-text feedback was positive overall with students commenting that it was "helpful", "enjoyable" and "boosted confidence".
   Conclusions: In Zimbabwe, simulation teaching was acceptable and could be adapted with minimal effort by local psychiatrists and implemented by post-graduate trainees and one consultant, Students found it helpful and enjoyable and their confidence increased after the teaching. It offers students a broader exposure to psychiatric conditions than they receive during clinical attachment to the inpatient wards. Involving psychiatry trainees and nursing staff may be a sustainable approach in a setting with small number of consultants and limited funds to pay for professional actors.

DT Article

ID EXPERIENCES; GAMBIA
AB Male impotence and infertility are health and social problems that have resulted in significant suffering to men the world over. From an African perspective, and in Zimbabwe in particular, the taboo nature of male impotence and infertility carries a lot of mystique. Based on evidence from focus-group discussions, in-depth and key-informant interviews, this study reveals rural Shona people to have indigenous knowledge systems that trigger the investigatation of signs of impotence (perceived as associated with male infertility) at infancy, puberty and after marriage. Male infertility carries overtones of failure, frustration, pain, social ostracism, stigma, marital instability, discomfiture and suicide. Intervention strategies to remedy perceived problems were exclusively sociocultural, involving the administration of traditional herbs and traditional healers' divination. Given the existence of indigenous knowledge systems for the investigation and mediation of male impotence and infertility, it is worth incorporating traditional healers in future strategies targeting these emasculating conditions. La impotencia y la infertilidad masculinas son problemas sociales y sanitarios que causan mucho sufrimiento a los hombres en todo el mundo. Desde una perspectiva africana, y de Zimbabue en particular, el caracter tabu de la impotencia y la infertilidad masculinas tiene mucha mistica. Basandonos en datos recogidos en charlas en grupo y en entrevistas exhaustivas con informantes clave, en este estudio indicamos que el pueblo Shona rural utiliza sistemas indigenas de conocimiento para poner en marcha un sistema que estudia los signos de impotencia (percibida como asociada a la infertilidad masculina) en la infancia, la pubertad y despues del matrimonio. La infertilidad masculina esta asociada a fracaso, frustracion, dolor, ostracismo social, estigma, inestabilidad matrimonial, decepcion y suicidio. Las estrategias de intervencion para remediar los problemas percibidos eran exclusivamente socioculturales, entre ellas la administracion de hierbas tradicionales y la divinacion de curanderos tradicionales. Dada la existencia de los sistemas indigenas de conocimiento para el estudio y la mediacion de la impotencia y la infertilidad masculinas, seria positivo que en los futuros programas sobre estos trastornos de la poblacion masculina se tuviera en cuenta a los curanderos tradicionales. L'impuissance et l'infertilite masculines sont des problemes sanitaires et sociaux qui ont pour consequence une souffrance considerable parmi les hommes dans le monde. Dans une vision africaine, au Zimbabwe en particulier, le caractere tabou de ces troubles leur confere une forte dimension mystique. S'appuyant sur des preuves ayant emerge de discussions de groupes thematiques, d'entretiens en profondeur et avec des informateurs cle, cette etude revele que chez les Shona vivant dans les zones rurales il existe des systemes de connaissance qui permettent la recherche de signes d'impuissance (percue comme associee a l'infertilite masculine) a la prime enfance, a la puberte et apres le mariage. L'infertilite masculine a des connotations d'echec, de frustration, de douleur, d'ostracisme social, de stigma, d'instabilite conjugale, de desarroi et de suicide. Les traitements des problemes dont la presence est percue grace a ces methodes sont exclusivement socio-culturels et comprennent l'administration d'herbes traditionnelles et la divination de guerisseurs traditionnels.
   Etant donnee l'existence de ces systemes indigenes de connaissance permettant la recherche et la soumission a la mediation de l'impuissance et de l'infertilite masculines, il convient d'integrer les guerisseurs traditionnels aux futures strategies ciblant ces troubles castrateurs.

TI Risk factors and health consequences of physical and emotional violence
   against children in Zimbabwe: a nationally representative survey
SO BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID SEXUAL-ABUSE
AB Introduction This study provides, for the first time, comparable national population-based estimates that describe the nature and magnitude of physical and emotional violence during childhood in Zimbabwe.
   Methods From August to September 2011, we conducted a national population-based survey of 2410 respondents aged 13-24 years, using a two-stage cluster sampling. Regression models were adjusted for relevant demographics to estimate the ORs for associations between violence, risk factors and various health-related outcomes.
   Results Respondents aged 18-24 years report a lifetime prevalence (before the age of 18) of 63.9% (among girls) to 76% (among boys) for physical violence by a parent or adult relative, 12.6% (girls) to 26.4% (boys) for humiliation in front of others, and 17.3% (girls) to 17.5% (boys) for feeling unwanted. Almost 50% of either sex aged 13-17 years experienced physical violence in the 12 months preceding the survey. Significant risk factors for experiencing physical violence for girls are ever experiencing emotional abuse prior to age 13, adult illness in the home, socioeconomic status and age. Boys' risk factors include peer relationships and socioeconomic status, while caring teachers and trusted community members are protective factors. Risk factors for emotional abuse vary, including family relationships, teacher and school-level variables, socioeconomic status, and community trust and security. Emotional abuse is associated with increased suicide attempts for both boys and girls, among other health outcomes.
   Conclusion Physical and emotional violence often work in tandem causing poor mental and physical health outcomes. Understanding risk factors for violence within the peer or family context is essential for improved violence prevention.

TI Understanding the experience and manifestation of depression in
   adolescents living with HIV in Harare, Zimbabwe
SO PLOS ONE

   HIV/AIDS; AIDS
AB Background
   Studies have found that adolescents living with HIV are at risk of depression, which in turn affects adherence to medication. This study explored the experience and manifestation of depression in adolescents living with HIV in Zimbabwe in order to inform intervention development.
   Methods
   We conducted a body mapping exercise with 21 HIV positive 15-19 years olds who had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Participants created a painted map of their body to assist them in expressing their somatic and emotional experiences in qualitative interviews. The interviews were transcribed and thematically coded using NVivo 10.
   Results
   Participants attributed their experiences of depression to their relationships and interactions with significant people in their lives, primarily family members and peers. A sense of being different from others was common among participants, both due to their HIV status and the impact HIV has had on their life circumstances. Participants described a longing to be important or to matter to the people in their lives. A sense of isolation and rejection was common, as well as grief and loss, including ambiguous and anticipated loss. Participants' idioms of distress included 'thinking deeply' ('kufungisisa'), 'pain', darkness, 'stress' or a lack of hope and ambiguity for the future. Suicidal ideation was described, including slow suicide through poor adherence. Supportive factors were also relational, including the importance of supportive relatives and peers, clinic staff and psychosocial support programmes.
   Conclusions
   An understanding of HIV positive adolescents' own narratives around depression can inform the development and integration of appropriate mental health interventions within HIV care and treatment programmes. Study findings suggest that family and peer-led interventions are potentially useful in the prevention and management of depression in adolescents living with HIV.

AB Background: Suicidal ideation may lead to deliberate self-harm which increases the risk of death by suicide. Globally, the main cause of deliberate self-harm is depression. The aim of this study was to explore prevalence of, and risk factors for, suicidal ideation among men and women with common mental disorder (CMD) symptoms attending public clinics in Zimbabwe, and to determine whether problem solving therapy delivered by lay health workers can reduce common mental disorder symptoms among people with suicidal ideation, using secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial.
   Methods: At trial enrolment, the Shona Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ) was used to screen for CMD symptoms. In the intervention arm, participants received six problem-solving therapy sessions conducted by trained and supervised lay health workers, while those in the control arm received enhanced usual care. We used multivariate logistic regression to identify risk factors for suicidal ideation at enrolment, and cluster-level logistic regression to compare SSQ scores at endline (6 months follow-up) between trial arms, stratified by suicidal ideation at enrolment.
   Results: There were 573 participants who screened positive for CMD symptoms and 75 (13.1%) reported suicidal ideation at baseline. At baseline, after adjusting for confounders, suicidal ideation was independently associated with being aged over 24, lack of household income (household income yes/no; adjusted odds ratio 0.52 (95% CI 0.29, 0.95); p = 0.03) and with having recently skipped a meal due to lack of food (adjusted odds ratio 3.06 (95% CI 1.81, 5.18); p < 0.001). Participants who reported suicidal ideation at enrolment experienced similar benefit to CMD symptoms from the Friendship Bench intervention (adjusted mean difference -5.38, 95% CI -7.85, -2.90; p < 0.001) compared to those who had common mental disorder symptoms but no suicidal ideation (adjusted mean difference -4.86, 95% CI -5.68, -4.04; p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Problem-solving therapy delivered by trained and supervised lay health workers reduced common mental disorder symptoms among participants with suicidal thoughts who attended primary care facilities in Zimbabwe.

AB Chloroquine (CQ) has been widely used in the treatment of malaria since the 1950s, though toxicity and resistance is increasingly limiting its use in the clinic. More recently, CQ is also becoming recognized as an important therapeutic compound for the treatment of autoimmune disorders and has shown activity as an anticancer agent. However, the full extent of CQ pharmacology in humans is still unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that the lysosomal protein saposinB (sapB), critical for select lipid degradation, binds CQ with implications for both CQ function and toxicity. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fluorescence quenching experiments, CQ was shown to bind to the dimeric form of sapB at both pH5.5 and pH7.4 with an average binding affinity of 2.3x10(4)m(-1). X-ray crystallography confirmed this, and the first complete crystal structure of sapB with a bound small molecule (CQ) is reported. The results suggest that sapB might play a role in mitigating CQ-based toxicity and that sapB might itself be overwhelmed by CQ causing impaired lipid degradation.

AB Sexual violence is a major public health problem due to the associated risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections, behavioural disorders and risk of committing suicide. The Adult Rape Clinic (ARC) was established at Parirenyatwa Hospital, Harare in 2009 with the objective of providing medical and support services for survivors of sexual violence in a safe and private environment. The data collected had never been analysed since the establishment of the clinic. We described the clients' profile and the services offered at the clinic to identify gaps in service provision and areas of improvement. A retrospective record review of data was carried out from the ARC collected from February 2009 to December 2017. We analyzed 2343 affidavits that were available. Out of 2343 records analysed, (2190) 93.5% were female and 6.5 % (153) were male. The median age was 23years (Q1=21; Q3= 29) for males and 19 years (Q1= 17; Q2=25) for females. Among the clients, 2164 (92.4%) received a baseline HIV test, and 263 females and 6 males tested positive. From 2010 to 2017, six clients' seroconversion was recorded. Only 863(36.8%) clients presented within 3 days after the sexual assault. About 40% of male victims were assaulted by someone they knew and 27% were married. The study recommends further research on the determinants of late presentation after sexual assault.

AB Introduction The objective of this study was to explore the acceptability of rapid HIV self-testing (RHST) among men who have sex with men (MSM).
   Methods During 2006-2009, a sample of 500 MSM was recruited through Respondent Driven Sampling for an HIV prevalence/incidence study. Attitude toward RHST was explored among HIV negative MSM. Data were weighted prior to analyses.
   Results Participants reported they were likely to buy RHST (74%), test themselves more frequently than they currently do (77%), and that the procedure would simplify testing (70%). Furthermore, 71% reported they would probably use it alone, 66% would use it with a steady partner, and 56% with a friend/partner. While a majority acknowledged that RHST use would deprive them of receiving counseling (61%), 74% declared they would go for help if they tested positive; 57% would use an RHST in order to avoid condoms. Probability of use surpassed 70% among gay and non-gay identified MSM as well as those with and without a previous HIV test. Those likely to buy RHST were older (p = 0.025) and more likely to identify as gay (p = 0.036). A total of 17% said they would think about killing themselves and 9% would attempt suicide if they tested positive. These MSM were more likely to be younger (p<0.001), with lower mood level (p<0.001) and greater feelings of loneliness (p = 0.026).
   Conclusions The high acceptability of RHST found among MSM should encourage the authorities to consider the possibility of offering it for self-testing, as it can improve early diagnosis and prevention of future transmissions. However, further research is needed to understand how to

Few studies focus on adolescents' substance use in relation to mental distress and protective factors in African countries. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and correlates (mental distress and protective factors) of substance use among school-going adolescents in six African countries. The sample included 20,765 students aged from 13 to 15 years from six African countries (Kenya, Namibia, Swaziland, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe), chosen by a two-stage cluster sample design to represent all students in grades 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 in each country. The measure used was part of the Global School-Based Health Survey (GSHS) questionnaire, including various domains of health behaviour. Results indicate a prevalence of 12.6% tobacco use (past month), 6.6% risky alcohol use (two or more per day for at least 20 days or more in the past month), and 10.5% of illicit drug use (three or more times ever) in school-going adolescents in six African countries. School truancy, loneliness, sleeping problems, sadness, suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and poverty were associated with substance use (tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs), while school attendance and parental supervision and connectedness were protective factors for substance use, and peer support protective for tobacco use. It is concluded that tobacco use, risky drinking and illicit drug use were common, clustered together and were associated with school truancy, mental distress, and lack of parental and peer support among adolescent African school children. These findings stress the need for early and integrated prevention programmes.

AB Background: Adolescents have significant sexual and reproductive health needs. However, complex legal frameworks, and social attitudes about adolescent sexuality, including the values of healthcare providers, govern adolescent access to sexual and reproductive health services. These laws and social attitudes are often antipathetic to sexual and gender minorities. Existing literature assumes that adolescents identify as heterosexual, and exclusively engage in (heteronormative) sexual activity with partners of the opposite sex/gender, so little is known about if and how the needs of sexual and gender minority adolescents are met.
   Methods: In this article, we have analysed data from fifty in-depth qualitative interviews with representatives of organisations working with adolescents, sexual and gender minorities, and/or sexual and reproductive health and rights in Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
   Results: Sexual and gender minority adolescents in these countries experience double-marginalisation in pursuit of sexual and reproductive health services: as adolescents, they experience barriers to accessing LGBT organisations, who fear being painted as "homosexuality recruiters," whilst they are simultaneously excluded from heteronormative adolescent sexual and reproductive health services. Such barriers to services are equally attributable to the real and perceived criminalisation of consensual sexual behaviours between partners of the same sex/gender, regardless of their age.
   Discussion/conclusion: The combination of laws which criminalise consensual same sex/gender activity and the social stigma towards sexual and gender minorities work to negate legal sexual and reproductive health services that may be provided. This is further compounded by age-related stigma regarding sexual activity amongst adolescents, effectively leaving sexual and gender minority adolescents without access to necessary information about their sexuality and sexual and reproductive health, and sexual and reproductive health services.

AB Background: There is limited evidence that interventions for depression and other common mental disorders (CMD) can be integrated sustainably into primary health care in Africa. We aimed to pilot a low-cost multicomponent 'Friendship Bench Intervention' for CMD, locally adapted from problem-solving therapy and delivered by trained and supervised female lay workers to learn if was feasible and possibly effective as well as how best to implement it on a larger scale.
   Method: We trained lay workers for 8 days in screening and monitoring CMD and in delivering the intervention. Ten lay workers screened consecutive adult attenders who either were referred or self-referred to the Friendship Bench between July and December 2007. Those scoring above the validated cut-point of the Shona Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ) for CMD were potentially eligible. Exclusions were suicide risk or very severe depression. All others were offered 6 sessions of problem-solving therapy (PST) enhanced with a component of activity scheduling. Weekly nurse-led group supervision and monthly supervision from a mental health specialist were provided. Data on SSQ scores at 6 weeks after entering the study were collected by an independent research nurse. Lay workers completed a brief evaluation on their experiences of delivering the intervention.
   Results: Of 395 potentially eligible, 33 (8%) were excluded due to high risk. Of the 362 left, 2% (7) declined and 10% (35) were lost to follow-up leaving an 88% response rate (n = 320). Over half (n = 166, 52%) had presented with an HIV-related problem. Mean SSQ score fell from 11.3 (sd 1.4) before treatment to 6.5 (sd 2.4) after 3-6 sessions. The drop in SSQ scores was proportional to the number of sessions attended. Nine of the ten lay workers rated themselves as very able to deliver the PST intervention.
   Conclusion: We have found preliminary evidence of a clinically meaningful improvement in CMD associated with locally adapted problem-solving therapy delivered by lay health workers through routine primary health care in an African setting. There is a need to test the effectiveness of this task-shifting mental health intervention in an appropriately powered randomised controlled trial.
