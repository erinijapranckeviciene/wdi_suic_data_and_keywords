AB Background: In 2012, international statistics showed El Salvador's suicide rate as 40th in the world and the highest in Latin America. Over the last 15 years, national statistics show the suicide death rate declining as opposed to an increasing rate of homicide. Though completed suicide is an important social and health issue, little is known about its prevalence, incidence, etiology and spatio-temporal behavior. The primary objective of this study was to examine completed suicide and homicide using the stream analogy to lethal violence within a spatio-temporal framework.
   Methods: A Bayesian model was applied to examine the spatio-temporal evolution of the tendency of completed suicide over homicide in El Salvador. Data on numbers of suicides and homicides at the municipal level were obtained from the Instituto de Medicina Legal (IML) and population counts, from the Direccion General de Estadistica y Censos (DIGESTYC), for the period of 2002 to 2012. Data on migration were derived from the 2007 Population Census, and inequality data were obtained from a study by Damianovic, Valenzuela and Vera.
   Results: The data reveal a stable standardized rate of total lethal violence (completed suicide plus homicide) across municipalities over time; a decline in suicide; and a standardized suicide rate decreasing with income inequality but increasing with social isolation. Municipalities clustered in terms of both total lethal violence and suicide standardized rates.
   Conclusions: Spatial effects for suicide were stronger among municipalities located in the north- east and center-south sides of the country. New clusters of municipalities with large suicide standardized rates were detected in the north-west, south-west and center-south regions, all of which are part of time-stable clusters of homicide. Prevention efforts to reduce income inequality and mitigate the negative effects of weak relational systems should focus upon municipalities forming time-persistent clusters with a large rate of death by suicide. In municipalities that are part of newly-formed suicide clusters and also are located in areas with a large rate of homicide, interrupting the expansion of spatial concentrations of suicide over time may require the implementation of both public health and public safety interventions.

AB Purpose: To examine suicide mortality trends among young people (10-24 years of age(1)) in selected countries and territories of the Americas.
   Methods: An ecological study was conducted using a time series of suicide mortality data from 19 countries and one territory in the Region of the Americas from 2001 to 2008, comprising 90.3% of the regional population. The analyses included age-adjusted suicide mortality rates, average annual variation in suicide mortality rates, and relative risks for suicide, by age and sex.
   Results: The mean suicide rate for the selected study period and countries/territory was 5.7/100,000 young people (10-24 years), with suicide rates higher among males (7.7/100,000) than females (2.4/100,000). Countries with the highest total suicide mortality rates among young people (10-24 years) were Guyana, Suriname, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Chile, and Ecuador; countries with the lowest total suicide mortality rates included Mexico, Venezuela, Cuba, and Brazil, and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. During this period, there was a significant increase in suicide mortality rates among young people in the following countries: Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, and Suriname; countries with significant decreases in suicide mortality rates included Canada, Colombia, Cuba, El Salvador, and Venezuela. The three leading suicide methods in the Americas were hanging, firearms, and poisoning.
   Conclusions: Some countries of the Americas have experienced a rise in adolescent and youth suicide during the study period, with males at a higher risk of committing suicide than females. Adolescent and youth suicide policies and programs are recommended, to curb this problem. Methodological limitations are discussed. (C) 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB This paper presents a study conducted on 709 Latin American undergraduates from four countries with different development levels (Nicaragua, El Salvador, Chile and Spain). The intention of this paper is to value the differences in the number and characteristics of stressful life events (SLE) suffered by the participants. Another purpose is to confirm the relation between SLE and suicidal conduct in Spanish cultural contexts, through the study of a multicultural sample of Spanish-speaking university students, and finally, to isolate the SLE that allow predicting a later suicidal conduct to a greatest extent. The information was collected by means of a self-applied questionnaire. The results indicate a greater presence of SLE among those who live in countries with lower development levels and among those who have attempted committing suicide. It is observed that the fact of having suffered certain SLE physical or sexual mistreatment, excessive alcohol or drug consumption and having left home during childhood or adolescence aid in the prediction of later suicidal conducts in the studied samples.

AB Objectives. As Latin Americans' exposure to the USA increases through migration patterns and US political and economic ties to their countries Of origin, they become susceptible to adopting not only the cultural expressions of the USA such as fashion, but also the health-related behaviors of the US population. In assessing potential health risks for Salvadoran youth that may result from the connection between Latin Americans and the USA, this study compared the prevalence of health risk behaviors from four behavior domains (aggression and victimization, depression and suicidal ideation, substance use, and sexual behavior) between Salvadoran and US Latino secondary school students aged 14-17 years.
   Design. A secondary analysis was performed on two 1999 cross-sectional survey data. In the USA, results were based on 1,063 Latino high school students who answered the nationally representative Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In El Salvador, results were based on 793 public secondary school students who answered a local YRBS survey conducted in coordination with the Ministry of Education of El Salvador.
   Results. The prevalence rates for aggression/victimization and for depression and suicidal ideation behaviors were similar between Salvadoran and US Latino adolescents. Substance use prevalence, however, was 10-40% higher for US Latino adolescents. While the prevalence of sexual intercourse was higher among US Latino youth (between 13 and 27% higher, depending on age), the prevalence of condom use was lower among sexually active Salvadoran youth (between 11 and 42% lower, depending on age).
   Conclusions. In the context of the transnationalization of the Salvadoran population, with potential for increased influence of the USA in Salvadoran culture, these differences in risk behavior are important for targeting effective interventions for Latino adolescents in El Salvador and in the USA.

AB The author explores the concept of identity as a frame of analysis in adolescents responding to various actual experiences of trauma. The author looks into numerous themes including the impact of broken identities, different ways of understanding the "victim identity", the identities of trauma, the role of transitions, as well as identity dilemmas. By examining the experience of young Mapuche in South America, the experience of war and political violence in Mexico and el Salvador, the identity of displaced young people in Colombia, and a multilevel analysis of child suicides among the Embera ethnic group in Choco, Colombia, a psychosocial and communitarian analysis of the impact of violence and war on youth is offered.

TI Stories of the <i>pos-guerra</i>:: Alone in Jacinta!Escudos's
   'zoo-ciety'
SO BULLETIN OF HISPANIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Since the signing of peace accords in the 1990s, Central American literature has turned from a testimonial vein to more personal discourses (memoir, interior journey, exploration of the erotic). Salvadoran writer Jacinta Escudos emerges during this period, pursuing themes related to tensions experienced by women and, more broadly, by a variety of social pariahs in a repressive patriarchal society. She turns inward, often through the literary device of stream of consciousness, or free indirect style, to examine the consequences of domestic violence, emotional battery, and stultifying social mores. In this paper, I examine several short stories from Escudos's 1993 collection, Contra-corriente. Escudos offers no easy answers, tidy endings, or moralizing conclusions. Site creates alienated dark characters. In her vision, society (her 'zoociedad'- a bestial, dehumanizing world) and its rules ironically increase our loneliness. I attempt to put this loss of solidarity/connectedness and the move toward solitude, suicide, and insanity, in the context of postwar El Salvador.
