TI CONTINUING BONDS AFTER SUICIDE BEREAVEMENT IN CHILDHOOD
SO DEATH STUDIES

DT Article
ID ATTACHMENT; CHILDREN; DEATH
AB It has been argued that the grieving process after suicide bereavement has unique properties (e. g., J.R. Jordan, 2001). A qualitative study was conducted to explore one aspect of the grieving process-continuing bonds-after suicide bereavement in childhood. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 10 suicide-bereaved children and analyzed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (Smith & Osborn, 2003). Three themes are discussed: thinking about the deceased, coping strategies, and ongoing connections to the deceased. The findings highlight potentially unique qualities of continuing bonds after childhood suicide bereavement and factors that might influence their adaptiveness. Theoretical and clinical implications are outlined.

AB This study investigated the prevalence of suicidal behavior and psychological distress in university students across 12 nations. A total of 5,572 university students from 12 countries were surveyed about suicide ideation, suicide attempts, and psychological distress by means of a self-administered questionnaire. Almost 29% of the samples reported having contemplated suicide and 7% reported attempting suicide. Of the total sample, 51.1% scored above the General Health Questionnaire-123 cut-off points, 41.6% above the GHQ-124 cut-off points, and 33.8% scored above the GHQ-125 cut-off points. While odds of suicide ideation were elevated in Austria and the UK, reduced ORs were detected for China, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Turkey. Similarly, while odds of suicide attempt were high in Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, and to some extent in Turkey, reduced ORs were observed for Austria, China, Italy, Japan and the United States. Elevated ORs for psychological distress were seen in Japan, Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Turkey but reduced ORs were noted in Austria, China, Iran, Italy, and the United States. Psychological distress was strongly associated with reports of suicide ideation and attempts. Suicide ideation, suicide attempt, and psychological distress are common in university students but their rates vary depending on the sociocultural context. Due attention should be devoted to the mental health needs of young adults enrolled in higher educational institutions and more cross-cultural research is warranted to better understand the etiology of the observed intersocietal variations in suicidal behavior and psychological distress.

ID TERRORISM
AB The authors examine the effect of educational attainment and income on support for suicide bombing among Muslim publics in six predominantly Muslim countries that have experienced suicide bombings: Indonesia, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan, and Turkey. The authors make two contributions. First, they present a conceptual model, which has been lacking in the literature. Second, they consider attitudes toward two different targets of suicide bombings: civilians within the respondent's country and Western military and political personnel in Iraq. The authors find that the effect of educational attainment and income on support for suicide bombings varies across countries and targets.The findings therefore draw attention to the difficulties of making generalizations about Muslim countries and the importance of distinguishing between targets of suicide bombings.

AB There is a scarcity of research on suicidal phenomena in the Muslim world. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating the self-reported prevalence of suicidal thoughts, attempts and motives in 12 Muslim countries. A total of 8417 (54.4% women) university students were surveyed by means of a self-report questionnaire. Overall, 22% of the participants reported suicidal ideation and 8.6% reported attempting suicide. The odds of suicidal thoughts were elevated in Azerbaijan, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, while reduced ORs were recorded in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Malaysia. While odds of suicide attempts were high in Azerbaijan, Palestine and Saudi Arabia reduced odds ratios (OR) were detected in Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Malaysia and Tunisia. Taking drugs and using a sharp instrument were the two most frequently used methods to attempt suicide. Only 32.7% of attempts required medical attention. Escape motives were endorsed more than social motives by participants who attempted suicide. Suicidal behaviors were more frequent in women than in men. Compered to men, fewer attempts by women required medical attention. Moreover, our results show that making suicide illegal does not reduce the frequency of suicidal behavior. Results from this comparative study show that suicidal thoughts and attempts are frequent events in young adults in countries where religious scripture explicitly prohibit suicide and the frequencies of nonfatal suicidal behavior show large variation in nations adhering to the same religion.

AB Objective The relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV) and women's use of negative and positive coping strategies was investigated. Design and Sample For this cross-sectional study, a convenience sample of 300 refugee women was recruited from health care centers in three cities in Jordan. Logistic regression adjusted to women's demographic characteristics was used. Results The study's results revealed that, compared to non victims, victimized women showed a lower tendency to receive psychological support from the family (adjusted OR=0.53, 95% CI=0.290.96), to smoke (adjusted OR=0.28, 95% CI=0.090.82), to use tranquilizers (adjusted OR = 0.014, 95% CI = 0.00-0.86), to think of suicide (adjusted OR=0.04, 95% CI=0.0090.15), and to attempt suicidal actions (adjusted OR=0.02, 95% CI=0.0020.19). Conclusions The study indicated that women's lack of use of negative coping strategies (smoking, use of tranquilizers, suicidal thoughts, and suicidal actions) was promising. However, the lack of use of positive coping strategies (disclosure of abuse, psychological support from friends, and help from family/friends) was somewhat concerning. The role of health care professionals may be helpful in this context. Counseling and support to IPV victims via effective listening, nonjudgmental discussions, and provision of information can be offered by health professionals as part of the treatment in health care centers.

AB Background Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for 14-20% of suicides worldwide. Regulation aimed at restricting access to pesticides or banning highly hazardous pesticides is one approach to reducing these deaths. We systematically reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness of pesticide regulation in reducing the incidence of pesticide suicides and overall suicides.
   Methods We did a systematic review of the international evidence. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase for studies published between Jan 1, 1960, and Dec 31, 2016, which investigated the effect of national or regional bans, and sales or import restrictions, on the availability of one or more pesticides and the incidence of suicide in different countries. We excluded other interventions aimed at limiting community access to pesticides. We extracted data from studies presenting pesticide suicide data and overall suicide data from before and after national sales restrictions. Two reviewers independently assessed papers for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We undertook a narrative synthesis of the data in each report, and where data were available for the years before and after a ban, we pooled data for the 3 years before and the 3 years after to obtain a crude estimate of the effect of the ban. This study is registered through PROSPERO, number CRD42017053329.
   Findings We identified 27 studies undertaken in 16 countries-five low-income or middle-income countries (Bangladesh, Colombia, India, Jordan and Sri Lanka), and 11 high-income countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, UK, and USA). Assessments largely focused on national bans of specific pesticides (12 studies of bans in six countries-Jordan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Greece [ Crete], South Korea, and Taiwan) or sales restrictions (eight studies of restrictions in five countries-India, Denmark, Ireland, the UK and the USA). Only five studies used optimum analytical methods. National bans on commonly ingested pesticides in five of the six countries studied, including four studies using optimum analytical methods, were followed by reductions in pesticide suicides and, in three of these countries, falls in overall suicide mortality. Greece was the only country studied that did not show a decrease in pesticide suicide following a ban. There were no high-quality studies of restricting sales to people for occupational uses; four of the seven studies (in three of the five countries studied-India, Denmark, and the USA) showed sales restrictions were followed by decreases in pesticide suicides; one of the two studies investigating trends in overall suicide mortality reported a fall in deaths in Denmark, but there were also decreases in suicide deaths from other methods.
   Interpretation National bans on highly hazardous pesticides, which are commonly ingested in acts of self-poisoning, seem to be effective in reducing pesticide-specific and overall suicide rates. Evidence is less consistent for sales restrictions. A worldwide ban on the use of highly hazardous pesticides is likely to prevent tens of thousands of deaths every year. Copyright (C) The Author(s).

SO CRITIQUE-STUDIES IN CONTEMPORARY FICTION

DE Seaside resort; Neil Jordan; contemporary Irish fiction; archipelagic
AB This essay identifies the seaside resort as an important space in Irish fiction of the past forty years. Specifically, it argues that just as British and Irish seaside resorts were undergoing profound transformation what John K. Walton refers to as "the traumatic changes of the 1970s and 1980s" (3) the seaside resort emerges in Irish fiction as the backdrop for various kinds of personal and social rupture, ranging from adolescence, mental breakdown, marital breakup, spousal death, and suicide to the social transformations we associate with modernity: emigration, internal migration, suburbanization, and secularization. The essay focuses predominantly on Irish fiction's most insistent bard of the seaside, Neil Jordan, who locates almost all of his fictional and filmic work in Irish seaside towns. After discussing Jordan's work, the essay, expands the analysis to other paeans to the Irish seaside resort in order to demonstrate the sheer range of contemporary Irish writers for whom the seaside is an important location, and to suggest directions for future study.

AB Suicide ideation (SI) is considered a major psychiatric emergency in patients diagnosed with chronic illnesses. Suicide ideation is a multifaceted issue that involves bio-psychosocial and cultural factors that interfere with patients' abilities. The purpose of this study is to investigate the psychosocial predictors of SI among Jordanian patients with chronic illnesses. A cross-sectional design using self-administered questionnaires was used to collect data from 480 patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. The mean score of suicide ideation was 4.07 (SD = 1.7) and almost 20% (n = 85) of the participants found to be suicidal, the majority were suffering from moderate to severe depressive symptoms and low levels of life satisfaction. Also, the analysis showed that the patients had a high level of optimism and moderate perception of social support from family, friends, and significant other. Type of illness has a significant relation to the 'seriousness' component of SI (p = 0.023). Depression (beta = 0.345, p<0.001) was a significant risk factor for 'thought' component of SI, and optimism (beta = -0.008, p < 0.05) a significant protective factor against the thought component of SI. Patients with chronic illnesses suffer serious psychological disturbances and are in need of psychological care, and periodic psychological screening to maintain their psychological wellbeing.

TI Does the biopsychosocial-spiritual model of addiction apply in an
   Islamic context? A qualitative study of Jordanian addicts in treatment
SO DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE

ID DRUG; CHALLENGE
AB Background: There is a dearth of research in the published literature on substance use and addiction in the Middle East and Islamic countries. This study was the first to explore whether the biopsychosocial-spiritual model of addiction was relevant to an addicted treatment population in Jordan, an Islamic country.
   Methods: A qualitative study design using semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with a sample of 25 males in addiction treatment. The sample was drawn from a cohort of in-patients at a treatment centre in Amman, Jordan who had already participated in a quantitative survey. A purposive sample was selected to ensure the inclusion of a range of characteristics that might affect their experience of developing addiction and its consequences, i.e., age, marital status and educational level. Interviews were transcribed and thematic analysis conducted using verbatim quotes to illustrate themes. Themes were mapped onto the biopsychosocial-spiritual model of addiction.
   Results: This study found addiction was associated with a range of health (physical and psychological), social and spiritual factors. Unpleasant physical withdrawal effects, psychological symptoms, such as anxiety and suicide attempts, were experienced. There was breakdown in marital and family relations, loss of employment, involvement in crime and neglect of religious practices, resulting in social isolation.
   Conclusion: This study found that, despite some differences in emphasis, the biopsychosocial, spiritual model of addiction fit well particularly given the relative importance of religion in Islamic culture. Spirituality was not explored and further study of spirituality versus religious practice in this culture is recommended. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB The TRACK-II program is a multi-site, community-based randomized controlled trial evaluating an intervention to assist mothers living with HIV (MLH) in disclosing their HIV status to their young children. Many participantsboth mothers and childrenreported significant depression and/or suicidal ideation, a phenomenon that presented ethical challenges. This article focuses on participants at one site (Atlanta). Through the vignette of Jordan, we describe ethical challenges that may arise when faced with the responsibility of maximizing participants' safety while maintaining the boundaries of the researcher role. Guided by community psychology values, our team has taken measures within our role as researchers to empower and protect children and mothers endorsing suicidal ideation. For example, we have relied on relationships with community-based organizations and AIDS service organizations to connect HIV-affected families to mental health services. Furthermore, we have expanded our system of documentation to follow-up adequately with families at risk, and we track family resources to promote a strengths-based framework. We have solicited families' feedback about their supports and needs to understand how we may best serve them by connecting them to the resources they report needing most and empowering them to care for themselves.
