SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY

DT Article
DE Youth suicide; adolescent suicide; suicidal behaviour; Denmark;
   Greenland
AB Background: Suicide is a tremendous public health issue and worldwide the second leading cause of death among young people. In 2015, Greenland had the highest burden of disease due to self-harm with loss of 2,952.97 disability-adjusted life years per 100,000 inhabitants, more than six times as many as Denmark.
   Aims: What are possible reasons for Greenland's higher youth suicide rate compared to Denmark, despite being one kingdom of Denmark?
   Method: Mixed methods in the form of qualitative, semi-structured interviews, the analysis of available data for 2003-2016 and a literature review were conducted with the aim to answer this question.
   Results: Several exposures cause this difference, most significantly adverse effects of the colonial past, such as social issues and experienced traumas in Greenland compared to its former coloniser Denmark.
   Conclusion: The ongoing burden of youth suicide in Greenland requires enhanced actions of all stakeholders involved in suicide prevention, intervention and postvention.

AB The purposes of the study were (1) to estimate the risk of suicide attempts in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in Denmark and compare the risk to the background population in the County of Funen, Denmark; (2) to estimate the risk of suicide attempts in MS patients receiving immunomodulating therapy compared with untreated patients. The Danish MS Registry, the Danish MS Treatment Registry and the Suicide Attempt Registry are linked and merged together using a person identification number given to all persons residing in Denmark. Among 404 MS patients, 15 patients had attempted suicide, although no increased risk for suicide attempts was found in MS patients. No difference in number of suicide attempts in treated and untreated patients was found.

AB This research examines empirically the determinants of suicides in Denmark over the period 1970-2006. To our knowledge, there exist no previous study that estimates a dynamic econometric model of suicides on the basis of time series data and cointegration framework at disaggregate level. Our results indicate that suicide is associated with a range of socio-economic factors but the strength of the association can differ by gender. In particular, we find that a rise in real per capita income and fertility rate decreases suicides for males and females. Divorce is positively associated with suicides and this effect seems to be stronger for men. A fall in unemployment rates seems to lower significantly suicides in males and females. Policy implications of suicides are discussed with some appropriate recommendations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MEDICOLEGAL AUTOPSY; FORENSIC AUTOPSY; DETERMINING MODE; DEATH;
   MORTALITY; HOMICIDE; TRENDS; BODY
AB National differences in the legislation on cause and manner of death investigation are reflected in a high autopsy rate in suicides in Finland and a low corresponding rate in Denmark. The consequences for mortality statistics of these different investigation practices on deaths classified as suicides in Denmark and Finland, respectively, are not known in detail.
   The aim of this article was to analyse autopsy rates in deaths classified as suicides, and to identify any differences in investigation practices in deaths with a comparable cause of death, but classified as unnatural deaths other than suicide.
   Data from the mortality registries were summarised for the years 2000, 2005 and 2010. Autopsy rates (total, forensic and medical) were analysed with regard to deaths classified as suicide, and they were compared for three age groups (1-50 years, 51-70 years and >= 71 years) and for causes of death. Deaths classified as suicide were compared with other unnatural classifications, and comparable causes of death were coded into six subgroups: poisonings, suffocations/strangulations, firearm discharges, drowning/submersions, explosions/flames and other/unspecified causes.
   The total autopsy rate for suicides was 99.8% in Finland and 13.2% in Denmark. Almost all of these autopsies were conducted as forensic autopsies. In the age group >= 71 years, Danish suicides outnumbered Finnish suicides (410 versus 283). The total autopsy rate was lower in the more senior age group in Denmark (19.5%, 9.9%, 5.6%), whereas it was consistently high in Finland (99.8%, 99.9%, 99.6%). Among Danish deaths due to poisonings, the autopsy rate was 89.5% when these were classified as accidents, but only 20.7% for cases classified as suicides. The number of deaths in the two Danish subgroups was comparable (550 versus 553).
   In Denmark, the decision regarding the need, if any, for a forensic autopsy is made during the external forensic examination of the body. Our study showed that the limited use of forensic autopsy to confirm the cause of death in deaths classified as suicides raises doubts about the accuracy of the Danish suicide mortality statistics. Our finding is emphasised by those cases in which the cause of death was registered as intentional self-poisoning. The high number of suicides among the elderly in Denmark is striking and begs further investigation and research. Overall, our data from Finland and Denmark reveal striking differences between the two countries and warrant further comparative studies on the subject in other countries.

AB Background: There may be various reasons for differences in suicide rates between countries and over time within a country. One reason can be different registration practices. Aims: The purpose of this study was to describe and compare the present procedures for mortality and suicide registration in the three Scandinavian countries and to illustrate potential sources of error in the registration of suicide. Method: Information about registration practices and classification procedures was obtained from the cause of death registers in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. In addition, we received information from experts in the field in each country. Results: Sweden uses event of undetermined intent more frequently than Denmark does, and Denmark more frequently than Norway. There seems to be somewhat more uncertainty among deaths classified as ill-defined and unknown cause of mortality in Norway, compared with the other two countries. Sweden performs more forensic autopsies than Norway, and Norway more than Denmark. In Denmark, in cases of a suspected unnatural manner of death, a thorough external examination of the deceased is performed. Conclusion: Differences in the classification of causes of death and in postmortem examinations exist in Scandinavian countries. These differences might influence the suicide statistics in Scandinavia.

AB This paper studied the seasonality of suicides among persons with and without psychiatric illness in Denmark from 1970 to 1999. A non-homogenous Poisson process was used to examine the data. The seasonality of suicides was shown to be associated with gender and their psychiatric histories with a declining trend of suicide incidence noted over the captured period. A mild seasonal component was reported in the period of the late 70s to early 80s (1975-1984) among females who did not have any psychiatric treatment history, while in the 80s the significant seasonality was mainly contributed by male suicides without a psychiatric history. Another mild possible invoked seasonality in the 90s was in males who suffered from psychiatric illness. The rest could be treated as random events. Apparently, the seasonality among suicides with psychiatric illness exists but its effect could vary in different periods of time and among genders in Denmark. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Minority sexual orientation has been repeatedly linked to elevated rates of suicide attempts. Whether this translates into greater risk for suicide mortality is unclear. We investigated sexual orientation-related differences in suicide mortality in Denmark during the initial 12-year period following legalization of same-sex registered domestic partnerships (RDPs).
   Using data from death certificates issued between 1990 and 2001 and population estimates from the Danish census, we estimated suicide mortality risk among individuals classified into one of three marital/cohabitation statuses: current/formerly in same-sex RDPs; current/formerly heterosexually married; or never married/registered.
   Risk for suicide mortality was associated with this proxy indicator of sexual orientation, but only significantly among men. The estimated age-adjusted suicide mortality risk for RDP men was nearly eight times greater than for men with positive histories of heterosexual marriage and nearly twice as high for men who had never married.
   Suicide risk appears greatly elevated for men in same-sex partnerships in Denmark. To what extent this is true for similar gay and bisexual men who are not in such relationships is unknown, but these findings call for targeted suicide prevention programs aimed at reducing suicide risk among gay and bisexual men.

AB Suicide is the leading cause of death among young men aged 15-29 in Greenland, but few epidemiological studies have described this problem. We aimed to summarise descriptive epidemiological studies of suicide in young men in Greenland compared with other demographic groups in Denmark and Greenland to inform future suicide prevention strategy. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase using an agreed search strategy to identify English-language papers describing suicide epidemiology in Greenlandic men aged 15-29. We followed PRISMA guidelines in screening and appraising eligible publications. Eight articles fulfilled inclusion criteria of 64 meeting search criteria. Findings covering 1970-2011 supported a dramatic rise in suicide rates in Greenlandic men aged 15-24 from 1976, who remained the highest-ranking demographic group over 1976-2011 compared with men and women of all age groups in Denmark and Greenland. Highest rates recorded were almost 600 per 100,000 per year in men aged approximately 20-23 over 1977-1986. No studies described suicide epidemiology after 2011, and no studies described risk factors for suicide in young men. Given the very high suicide rates recorded for young men over 1976-2011, such studies will be essential for informing the development and evaluation of appropriate preventive interventions.

AB Background: Although many authors have investigated the impact of sex on the association between socio-economic status (SES) and suicide, a definite consensus has not yet emerged. Using Danish population registration data including 15 648 suicide deaths of individuals aged 18-65 year during 1981-97 and matched population controls, we investigate the associations of multiple SES factors with suicide risk and explore the sex-specific aspects of these associations. Methods: We use conditional logistic regression models to estimate the statistical relationship between SES, sex and suicide. Results: SES, proxied by low income, unskilled blue-collar work, non-specific wage work and unemployment, increases suicide risk more prominently for men than for women. Marital status has a comparable influence on suicide risk in both sexes; parenthood is protective against suicide, and the effect is larger for women. Living in a large city raises suicide risk for women but reduces it for men; residents with a foreign citizenship in Denmark have a lower risk of suicide compared with Danish citizens, but this protection is confined to male immigrants. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that suicide risk is associated with a range of SES proxies but the strength and/or direction of the association can differ by sex. Risk assessement and, therefore, prevention approaches should take this into consideration.

ID MOTOR-VEHICLE EXHAUST
AB In the period 1995-1999 there were 388 car exhaust-gas suicides in Denmark. Of these 343 (88.4%) were men and 45 (11.6%) were women, the average age being 47 years. The car exhaust-gas suicides made up 9.3% of all suicides in Denmark in the period. The corresponding rate was 11.7% for men and 3.7% for women. In rural areas a larger part of all suicides were committed with car exhaust-gas compared to the more densely populated areas. Mental disease was diagnosed in 124 (32.0%) cases. A suicide note was found in 165 (42.5%) cases. A hose was fitted to the exhaust pipe in 334 (86.1%) cases. Of these the 234 (60.3%) occurred outside, typically in a forest area, while 76 (19.6%) occurred in a closed garage. All the 54 (13.9%) cases with no hose fitted to the exhaust pipe occurred in a garage. Seven (1.8%) victims were found in a burning or burnt-out car, where the following investigation revealed that it was actually a car exhaust-gas suicide. Carboxyhemoglobin was measured in 26 (6.7%) victims. In two of these victims no carboxyhemoglobin was found, as they had survived for some time after the poisoning. The average saturation of the remaining victims was 67%, the lowest saturation being 20% and the highest being 84%.
   In the period 1969-1987 the number of car exhaust-gas suicides in Denmark increased from 50 to similar to 190 per year and the rate of car exhaust-gas suicides compared to all suicides increased from similar to 5% to similar to 13%. In 1987-1999 these figures decreased from similar to 190 to 63 per year and from 13% to similar to 8%. During these 30 years the number of passenger cars in Denmark doubled, which explains the increase in car exhaust-gas suicides during 1969-1987. A possible explanation for the decrease in 1987-1999 is the introduction of the catalytic converter, which was made mandatory in 1990. We anticipate that car exhaust-gas suicides will continue to decrease in numbers, as more cars are equipped with catalytic converters. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Media awards for responsible reporting of suicide: Experiences from

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Media awards to encourage responsible reporting of suicide have been introduced in several countries, including Australia, Belgium and Denmark.
   Aims: This study aimed to examine the experiences of Australian, Belgian and Danish award recipients in preparing stories on suicide, and consider the impacts of the awards for these recipients and for media professionals more broadly.
   Method: We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with the majority (14 out of 15) of past recipients of the awards in the three countries of interest.
   Results: Media awards appear to show promise as a method of reinforcing national and international media guidelines on reporting suicide. The recipients of awards were proud to have had their achievements recognized in this way, and had developed a heightened awareness of the issues inherent in reporting suicide. Although relatively few had prepared subsequent stories on suicide, a number had been given opportunities to provide advice to other media professionals about how best to approach this sensitive topic. Recipients viewed the awards as an important means by which good quality reporting can be rewarded, and a springboard for raising community awareness about suicide.
   Conclusion: The experience from Australia, Belgium and Denmark suggests that media awards which recognize responsible reporting of suicide are extremely worthwhile.

AB Antidepressant use in Denmark, as in many developed countries, has substantially increased during recent years, coinciding with a decreasing suicide rate. In a nationwide observational cohort study with linkage of registers of all prescribed antidepressants and recorded suicides in Denmark from 1995 to 2000, we investigated the relation between continued treatment with antidepressants and suicide in a population of all patients discharged from hospital psychiatry with a diagnosis of depressive disorder. Patients discharged from hospital psychiatry with a diagnosis of depressive disorder had a highly increased rate of suicide. Those who continued treatment with antidepressants had a decreased rate of suicide compared with those who purchased antidepressants once (rate ratio: 0.31, 95% confidence interval: 0.26-0.36). Further, the rate of suicide decreased consistently with the number of prescriptions. On individualized data from a cohort of patients with a known history of depressive disorder, continued antidepressant treatment was associated with reduced risk of suicide.

AB Objective: To study the incidence and risk factors of psychiatric inpatient suicide within a national cohort representing all psychiatric hospital admissions.
   Method: This national prospective register-based study followed all psychiatric hospital admissions in Denmark from the date of patient admission until patient discharge or inpatient suicide over a 10-year study period from 1997 through 2006. By using survival analysis techniques, this study was the first to take the inpatient time at risk into account in the estimation of the suicide rate and the predictors of suicide among hospital-admitted psychiatric patients.
   Results: Among 126,382 psychiatric inpatients aged 14 years or older, 279 suicides occurred. The risk of inpatient suicide was high: 860 suicides per 100,000 inpatient years. Of those individuals who completed suicide, 50% died within 18 days of admission. The inpatient suicide rate significantly decreased, about 6% each year (HR = 0.94; 95% CI, - 0.90-0.99), over this 10-year period. Several significant predictors of suicide were found, including the following: Patients with a bachelor's degree had a significantly higher hazard ratio (HR) of suicide compared with those with a primary school education (HR = 0.41; 95% CI, = 0.29-0.60) or those with vocational training (HR = 0.54; 95% CI, = 0.39-0.77). Having a personality disorder as a secondary diagnosis (all psychiatric diagnoses were made according to ICD-10) raised the risk of suicide (HR = 1.60; 95% CI, 1.01-2.53), as did having recent contact (within the last year) with a private psychologist (HR = 1.85; 95% CI, 1.05-3.28). Recent suicide attempt before admission to the hospital was associated with the highest risk of inpatient suicide (HR = 4.99; 95% CI, 3.57-6.96).
   Conclusions:This study demonstrated a high risk of psychiatric inpatient suicide in Denmark of 860 per 100,000 inpatient years and also revealed several significant predictors of psychiatric inpatient suicide. Furthermore, the inpatient suicide rate decreased from 1997 through 2006 in Denmark. J Clin Psychiatry 2012;73(2):144-151 (C) Copyright 2011 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB Objective: The aims of this paper are (i) to describe the specific characteristics of suicide in China and compare it with that in a western country, Denmark; and (ii) to discuss the accuracy of suicide data and the possible explanations for suicide behaviour in China.
   Method: Data for the study are obtained from the World Health Statistics Annual based on official records in China and the Danish Cause-of-Death Register, and standardized according to the age-specified population of China in 1990.
   Results: The specific characteristics of suicide in China differed strikingly from the general pattern of suicide in other western countries as well as in Denmark: suicide rates in females were higher than in males; rural rates were more than three times higher than urban rates; suicide rates peaked for those aged 75+ years, bu; with a minor peak in females for those aged 15-24 years old.
   Conclusion: These specific characteristics of suicide in China may possibly be interpreted in terms of traditional culture, social forces, political environment and economic status.

AB Intimate partner homicides represent the most severe outcome of intimate partner violence, and constitute more than a quarter (26%) of all homicides in adults over 15 years of age in Southern Denmark. In our experience the victims of partner homicides are primarily women, often from socially disadvantaged families, and that these homicides usually are the result of an impulsive act, with the perpetrator often committing suicide after the act. The aim of this study was to investigate these hypotheses further, and to provide an up-to-date overview of intimate partner homicides in Southern Denmark.

AB Objectives: Systematic suicide risk assessment is recommended for patients with schizophrenia; however, little is known about the implementation of suicide risk assessment in routine clinical practice. The study aimed to determine the use of systematic suicide risk assessment at discharge and predictors of suicide attempt among hospitalized patients with schizophrenia in Denmark. Methods: A one-year follow-up study was conducted of 9,745 patients with schizophrenia who were discharged from psychiatric wards and registered in a national population-based schizophrenia registry between 2005 and 2009. Results: The proportion of patients receiving suicide risk assessment at discharge from a psychiatric ward increased from 72% (95% confidence interval [CI]=71%-74%) in 2005, when the national monitoring began, to 89% (CI.89%-90%) in 2009. Within one year after discharge, 1% of all registered patients had died by suicide and 8% had attempted suicide. One out of three patients who died by suicide had no documented suicide risk assessment before discharge. Conclusions: The use of systematic suicide risk assessment at discharge among patients with schizophrenia increased in Denmark between 2005 and 2009, in accordance with recommendations in national clinical guidelines and monitoring in a national clinical registry. Additional efforts are warranted to ensure a lower risk of suicidal behavior after hospital discharge.

   A case-control study based on Danish longitudinal registers
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY

DT Article
ID DENMARK; SCHIZOPHRENIA; RATES
AB Objective: In light of the consistent reduction in suicide rate during the past 20 years in Denmark, this study aims to investigate trends in suicide risk associated with hospitalized psychiatric illness and to explore differences in the changes with regard to clinical phases of illness, sex, age, and diagnosis.
   Method: This population-based study includes all of 21,169 suicides in Denmark during the years 1981 through 1997 and 423,128 controls matched for sex, age, and time (using a nested case-control design). Personal data on psychiatric history and socioeconomic status were retrieved from Danish longitudinal registers. Data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression.
   Results: This study shows that the reduction in suicide rate is generally faster among individuals with a history of psychiatric admission than among individuals without such a history. However, this substantial reduction is mainly accounted for by the reduction among patients who had been discharged from psychiatric hospitals for more than 1 year. For patients who had been discharged from hospitals within 1 year, the reduction is similar to that of the general population; while for patients hospitalized for treatment at the time of suicide or the index date, the reduction in suicide rate is relatively slower. Such trends hold for all diagnostic groups. Further analyses stratified by age indicate that the faster reduction in suicide rate associated with history of hospitalized psychiatric illness is more pronounced among patients aged 36 years and older.
   Conclusion: The reduction in suicide rate is substantial for patients who have been discharged from psychiatric hospitals for more than 1 year and for middle-aged and older patients. Recent improvement in psychiatric care and treatment and promotion of new generation antidepressants may contribute to these changes.

AB Background The effect of recent increases in antidepressant prescribing on population suicide rates is uncertain.
   Aims To investigate the relationship between antidepressant sales and trends in suicide rates.
   Method Graphical and quantitative assessment of trends in suicide and antidepressant sales in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland.
   Results Suicide rates declined in all four countries during the 1990s, whereas antidepressant sales increased by 3- to 4-fold. Decreasing suicide rates in Sweden and Denmark preceded the rise in anti depressant sales by over 10 years, although the reductions accelerated between 1988 and 1990. In Norway, a modest but short-lived decline in suicide rates began around the time of the increase in antidepressant sales. In Finland, decreases in male suicide rates and to a lesser extent in female suicide rates began around the time of increased antidepressant sales. In all four countries decreases in suicide rates appeared to precede the widespread use of SSRIs.
   Conclusions We found mixed evidence that increases in antidepressant sales have coincided with a reduction in the number of suicides in Nordic countries.

AB Psychiatric illness and deliberate self-harm (DSH) are major risk factors of suicide. In largely 15 % of psychiatric admissions in Denmark, the patient had an episode of DSH within the last year before admission. This study examined the survival and predictors of suicide in a suicidal high-risk cohort consisting of hospitalized psychiatric patients with recent DSH.
   This national prospective register-based study examined all hospitalized psychiatric patients who self-harmed within a year before admission. All admitted patients, in the time period 1998-2006, were followed and survival analyses techniques were used to identify predictors of suicide.
   The study population consisted of 17,257 patients; 520 (3 %) died by suicide during follow-up; 50 % of the suicides occurred within a year from the index admission. A rate of 1,645 suicides per 100,000 person-years in the first year after psychiatric admission was found. Adjusted analyses showed that a higher degree of education, having DSH within a month before psychiatric admission and contact with a private psychiatrist increased the risk of suicide.
   Psychiatric hospitalized patients with recent DSH revealed high suicide rates, even during hospitalization. When discharging psychiatric patients with recent DSH careful arrangement of follow-up treatment in the outpatient setting is recommendable.

AB We assess (i) whether being married is a protective factor against socio-economic inequalities in suicide, and (ii) whether any such buffering effect varies between countries. We used the data from a European cross-national comparison project, a prospective follow-up of several European population censuses matched with vital statistics. The data encompass 99.5 million person-years aged 30 and above and, 25,476 suicides in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Turin, Madrid, Norway and Switzerland. Standardised rates were computed and logistic regressions were used to assess educational inequalities. Among the non-married, the lower educational group had an increased risk of dying of suicide compared to the higher group (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.45). Inequalities among the married were lower (OR = 1.29). In all countries or regions except Austria, the lower educational group had a higher risk of suicide mortality among the non-married than among the married. The buffering effect of being married was not observed for elderly individuals (65 and over). Among younger individuals, the buffering effect of being married on relative inequalities in suicide was stronger in Madrid, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland (but significant only for Denmark and Norway). There was no indication that countries with stronger welfare policies or lower divorce rate had a lower buffering effect. We conclude that being married protects against inequalities in suicide and that this protective effect is not affected by the level of social capital at the country level. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Restriction of means for suicide is an important part of suicide preventive strategies in different countries. All suicides in Denmark between 1970 and 2000 were examined with regard to method used for suicide. Overall suicide mortality and method-specific suicide mortality was compared with official information about availability of medical compounds (barbiturates, benzodiaze-pines, analgesics, antidepressants) and carbon monoxide in vehicle exhaust and household gas. Restrictions on the availability of carbon monoxide, barbiturates and dextropropoxyphen was associated with a decline in the number of suicides by self-poisoning with these compounds. Restricted access occurred concomittantly with a 55% decrease in suicide rate.

AB Most research regarding posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicide has focused on suicidal ideation or attempts; no known study of the association between PTSD and completed suicide in a population-based sample has been reported. This study examined the association between PTSD and completed suicide in a population-based sample. Data were obtained from the nationwide Danish health and administrative registries, which include data on all 5.4 million residents of Denmark. All suicides between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 2006, were included, and controls were selected from a sample of all Danish residents. Using this nested case-control design, the authors examined 9,612 suicide cases and 199,306 controls matched to cases on gender, date of birth, and time. Thirty-eight suicide cases (0.40%) and 95 controls (0.05%) were diagnosed with PTSD. The odds ratio associating PTSD with suicide was 9.8 (95% confidence interval: 6.7, 15). The association between PTSD and completed suicide remained after controlling for psychiatric and demographic confounders (odds ratio = 5.3, 95% confidence interval: 3.4, 8.1). Additionally, persons with PTSD and depression had a greater rate of suicide than expected based on their independent effects. In conclusion, a registry-based diagnosis of PTSD based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, is a risk factor for completed suicide.

AB Objective To estimate the risk of suicide in young people related to family and individual psychiatric and socioeconomic factors.
   Design Population based nested case-control study.
   Setting Data from longitudinal Danish registers.
   Cases and controls 496 young people aged 10-21 years who had committed suicide during 1981-97 in Denmark and 24 800 controls thatched for sex, age, and time.
   Main outcome measures All suicides in Denmark compared with controls; parents and siblings identified from population based registers; inpatient information from discharge registers of national hospitals; and socioeconomic data from administrative registers.
   Results Parental factors associated with an increased risk of suicide in young people were suicide or early death, admission to hospital for a mental illness, unemployment, low income, poor schooling, and divorce, as well as mental illness in siblings and mental illness and short duration of schooling in the young people themselves. The strongest risk factor was mental illness in the young people. The effect of the parents' socioeconomic factors decreased after adjustment for a family history of mental illness and a family history of suicide.
   Conclusions Recognising mental illness in young people and dealing with it appropriately could help prevent suicides. The high relative risk associated with a low socioeconomic status of the parents may be confounded and overestimated if not adjusted for mental illness and suicide in the family.

AB There is a dearth of knowledge about factors correlated with suicide risk among minority groups in Western societies. In the present study we compared suicide risk among persons with foreign background with that of the majority population to determine whether certain minority groups are at a particular risk for suicide, as well as to illuminate gender differences herein. Suicide risk was generally higher among persons with foreign background compared with the majority population and the risk was highest among Nordic-born persons. Overall, suicide risk was significantly lower among Asian-born persons; however, there were gender differences in correlations between ethnicity and suicide risk.

AB Background and aim: The Nordic countries provide a suitable setting for comparing trends in suicide mortality. The aim of this report is to compare suicide trends by age, gender, region and methods in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden 1980-2009. Methods: Suicide statistics 1980-2009 were analyzed for men and women aged 15 years and above and the age group 15-24 years. Regional suicide rates in 2009 were presented in maps. Results: The suicide rates across the Nordic countries declined from 25-50 per 100,000 in 1980 to 20-36 in 2009 for men and from 9-26 in 1980 to 8-11 in 2009 for women. The rates in Finland were consistently higher than those of the other countries. A significant increase of suicides in young women in Finland and Norway and a lack of a decline among young women in Sweden were noted. The male-female ratio of suicide converged to approximately 3:1 across the region during the study period. Rural areas in Finland, Norway and Sweden saw the highest suicide rates, whereas the rates in the capital regions of Denmark, Norway and Sweden were lower than the respective national rates. Conclusions: We hold that the overall decline of suicide rates in the Nordic countries reflects the socio-economic development and stability of the region, including the well-functioning healthcare. The increasing rates in Finland and Norway and the unchanged rate in Sweden of suicide in young women are an alarming trend break that calls for continued monitoring.

AB As in many developed countries, the use of antidepressants in Denmark has been substantially increasing during recent years, coinciding with a decreasing suicide rate. We aimed to investigate the relationship between treatment with antidepressants and suicide on individualized data from a nationwide study comprising an observational cohort study with linkage of registers of all prescribed antidepressants and recorded suicides in Denmark during the period 1995-99. A total of 438 625 patients who purchased at least one prescription of antidepressants and 1073862 individuals from the general population were included in the study. Patients who continued treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (i.e. who purchased SSRIs twice or more) had a decreased rate of suicide compared with patients who purchased SSRIs once only [rate ratio (RR)=0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.56-0.71]. Furthermore, the rate of suicide decreased consistently with the number of prescriptions. Similarly, among patients treated with newer antidepressants other than SSRIs, the rate of suicide was decreased compared with the rate for patients who purchased other newer antidepressants once only (RR=0.70; 95% CI=052-0.94). Continued antidepressant treatment with SSRIs or other newer antidepressants is found to be associated with a reduced risk of suicide.

AB On average, two suicides occur in Denmark every day. In order to prevent suicides, it is important to understand their nature. The forensic autopsy plays an important role by providing detailed knowledge of the cause and manner of death. Unfortunately, the autopsy rate for suicides in Denmark is very low.
   The aim of this study was to elucidate the factors that may affect the decision to perform a forensic autopsy and thereby affect the autopsy rate of suicidal deaths in the Capital area of Copenhagen.
   Data from 6211 death certificates from the Capital area of Copenhagen, Denmark, over a study period of six years, were investigated. For deaths classified as suicide, the presence of the following factors were registered: gender, age, date of birth, date of death, marital status, nationality, place of death, cause of death, psychiatric condition, former admissions at a psychiatric ward, former attempts of suicide, presence of suicide note, history of substance abuse (alcohol, narcotics or both), and presence of self-inflicted scars. These factors were cross-tabulated with whether a referral to a forensic autopsy was made. Significant association was calculated by using Chi(2) and Fisher's exact test.
   We found a total of 381 cases of suicide. The forensic autopsy rate was 21.3%. The following factors were associated with a significantly lower forensic autopsy rate: age above 50, history of psychiatric illness, the presence of a suicide letter, and cause of death registered as hanging/strangulation/suffocation, drowning/ submersion, self-harm with sharp object, and jumping from height. Only the presence of a suicide letter remained significant after the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. History of substance abuse and cause of death registered as intentional exposure to smoke, fire and flames were associated with a significantly higher forensic autopsy rate.
   A forensic autopsy can give more precise information on suicide methods, the impact of fatal lesions and comorbidity. Our study results showed that violent methods of suicidal death and psychiatric comorbidity led to a lower forensic autopsy rate. A higher autopsy rate would enable more thorough study and investigation of suicides, which would benefit the next-of-kin, general preventive procedures, and treatment of patients at risk of suicide.

AB Research on the relationship between social integration and suicide rates has neglected a historical perspective. Analyses are often based on relatively short time periods where there may not be enough variation in integration to affect the national suicide rate, or where overall integration levels are not low enough to buttress a link between a specific index of low integration, such as divorce, and suicide. The present investigation contributes to the literature by testing a hypothesis on domestic integration and suicide over a century, the longest period studied to date, encompassing periods of low and high overall social integration, and emergent risk and protective factors. Data are available for core variables for Denmark, 1906-2006. Annual data include those on suicide, and indicators of integration (divorces, births, marriages), as well as for economic strain (unemployment) and time trends. A log linear Poisson model is estimated, which explores the central divorce-suicide relationship under controls for confounders. Controlling for confounders, a one percent increase in divorce increases male suicides by 0.52% and female suicides by 1.12%. As anticipated, marriages decrease suicide: a one percent increase in marriages reduces suicide by 0.77% for men and by 0.63% for women. The trend in divorce, in particular, offers accurate predictions of suicide throughout the century. The relationship between divorce and suicide over a century is robust. The results offer the strongest support to date in support of a social integration model based on long term historical data on suicide and divorce. (C) 2011 Western Social Science Association.

AB Restriction of means for suicide is an important part of suicide preventive strategies in different countries. The effect on method-specific suicide rate and overall suicide rate of restrictions on availability of carbon monoxide, barbiturates, and dextropropoxyphene was examined. From 1970 to 2000, overall suicide mortality and method-specific suicide mortality in Denmark were compared with official information about availability of barbiturates and analgesics and carbon monoxide in vehicle exhaust and household gas. Restrictions on availability of household gas with carbon monoxide content and barbiturates was associated with a decline in the number of suicides and suicides by self-poisoning with these compounds after controlling for the effect of calender year. Restricted access occurred concomittantly with a 55 percent decrease in suicide rate.

AB Background: In Denmark 8,000 to 10,000 people will attempt suicide each year. The Centre of Excellence in Suicide Prevention in the Capital Region of Denmark is treating patients with suicidal behavior, and a recent survey has shown that 30% of the patients are suffering from borderline personality disorder. The majority of patients (70% to 75%) with borderline personality disorder have a history of deliberate self-harm and 10% have a lifetime risk to die by suicide. The DiaS trial is comparing dialectical behavior therapy with collaborative assessment and management of suicidality-informed supportive psychotherapy, for the risk of repetition of deliberate self-harm in patients with a recent suicide attempt and personality traits within the spectrum of borderline personality disorder. Both treatments have previously shown effects in this group of patients on suicide ideation and self-harm compared with treatment as usual.
   Methods/Design: The trial is designed as a single-center, two-armed, parallel-group observer-blinded randomized clinical superiority trial. We will recruit 160 participants with a recent suicide attempt and at least two traits of the borderline personality disorder from the Centre of Excellence in Suicide Prevention, Capital Region of Denmark. Randomization will be performed though a centralized and computer-generated approach that conceals the randomization sequence. The interventions that are offered are a modified version of a dialectical behavior therapy program lasting 16 weeks versus collaborative assessment and management of suicidality-informed supportive psychotherapy, where the duration treatment will vary in accordance with established methods up to 16 weeks. The primary outcome measure is the ratio of deliberate self-harming acts including suicide attempts measured at week 28. Other exploratory outcomes are included such as severity of symptoms, suicide intention and ideation, depression, hopelessness, self-esteem, impulsivity, anger, and duration of respective treatments.

AB Background: The Register for Suicide Attempts ( RSA) is a product of the WHO research project "WHO/Euro Multicentre Study on Parasuicide", which, among other things, had the purpose of collecting data on suicide attempts from 13 European countries. Data is collected in order to calculate trends and identify high-risk groups. Data collection for the RSA started in 1989.
   Methods: The RSA is a longitudinal, person-based register. It contains information about people who have been in contact with the health care system in the County of Funen as a result of a suicide. The RSA contains 11 variables, which describe the incident in detail, and a number of variables describing the person. The RSA contains data covering the period April 1989 to December 2001 and is updated annually. Data is collected from somatic and psychiatric hospitals in an administrative district (County of Funen). The data collection is done manually by going through all the records in which a contact to the health care system, i.e. a potential suicide attempt, is described. Only incidents matching the WHO definition of an attempted suicide are registered.
   Conclusion: Data from the RSA has been used in national and international studies. The RSA is the most suitable register in Denmark for analyses of suicide attempts.

AB Carbon monoxide (CO) inhalation is a well-known method of committing suicide. There has been a drastic increase in suicide by inhalation of CO, produced from burning charcoal, in some parts of Asia, and a few studies have reported an increased number of these deaths in Europe. CO-related deaths caused by charcoal burning have, to our knowledge, not been recorded in the Danish population before. In this retrospective study we present all autopsied cases of CO poisoning caused by charcoal burning in the period 2008-2012. 19 autopsied cases were identified, comprising 11 suicides, 4 accidents, and 2 cases of maternal/paternal filicide-suicide. The mean age of decedents was 38.2 years and the majority of the decedents were men. In 16 cases carboxyhemoglobin levels were above 50 % and in 14 cases we found distinctive cherry red livor mortis. Various concentrations of ethanol and drugs were found in 9 cases. Data suggest that this method of death has increased significantly in Denmark. Therefore, it is highly relevant to draw attention to the subject, to increase awareness as well as prevent future escalation.

ID PREVENTION STRATEGIES; DANISH EXPERIENCE; RATES; COUNTRIES; TRENDS
AB INTRODUCTION: Major advances have been achieved in suicide prevention over the past decades. Effective suicide prevention requires vigilant monitoring of suicide trends. The aim of this study was to assess the change in the Danish suicide rate over time using joinpoint regression analysis and to examine the distribution of suicide methods in the 1980-2015 period.
   METHODS: Nationwide register data were obtained from the Central Research Register and the Danish Cause of Death Register. Rates were calculated per 100,000 persons by gender and age group. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to assess changes over time in the overall suicide rate.
   RESULTS: The suicide rate declined from 40.4 (95% confidence interval (CI): 38.4-42.3) in 1980 to 11.9 (95% CI: 10.9-12.9) in 2015. A significant reduction ranging between 2-6% was observed during 1980-1999 after which the decrease was modest. The rate was higher for men than for women (rate ratio 1.9; 95% CI: 1.7-2.1), and more so by the end of the period (rate ratio = 2.4; 95% CI: 1.9-2.8). The suicide rate was found to increase with increasing age. Hanging, poisoning and shooting were the most frequent methods for men, whereas poisoning followed by hanging and drowning were the most frequent methods for women.
   CONCLUSIONS: The suicide rate fell sharply between 1980 and 1999 in Denmark, but since then the decrease has been modest, especially since 2007. Further reduction in the suicide rate requires new and effective measures.

AB Introduction: The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for suicide related to the course of treatment. Method: All persons in Denmark hospitalised for the first time because of an affective disorder during the period 1973-1993 were included. Results: In 53 466 patients, suicide was the cause of death in 3141 (6%) cases. The risk of suicide was high both immediately after admission and immediately following discharge. Increased risk was also associated with short duration of affective disorder, a history of multiple admissions, male gender, and increasing age. Limitations: We were not able to distinguish with certainty between manic and depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. Prior suicide attempts could not be included in the analyses. Lack of operationalised diagnostic criteria. Conclusions: Patients hospitalised because of an affective disorder are a highly relevant target group for suicide prevention. There is a need for improvement of preventive measures during admission and at discharge. Likewise, there is a need for preventive measures which can minimize the risk of relapse in affective disorders. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Design A nested casecontrol study. Setting Data were retrieved from five Danish national registers. Subjects On the basis of the entire population of Denmark, this study included 27 similar to 262 suicide cases, and 468 similar to 007 live controls matched for sex and date of birth. Main outcome measures Risk of suicide was assessed using conditional logistic regression. Results In the study population, 63.5% of suicide cases and 44.5% of comparison controls had a history of hospitalization for physical illness. A physical illness significantly increased the risk of subsequent suicide (incidence rate ratios 2.13, 95% CI 2.072.18) with a substantially greater effect in women than in men (P similar to<similar to 0.01). The elevated risk increased progressively with frequency and recency of hospitalization and was significant for diseases occurring in all organs or systems of the body. Comorbidity involving several organs or systems increased the risk substantially. The associated estimates were to some extent reduced but remained highly significant after adjustment for psychiatric history and socio-economic status. Taking into account both prevalence and adjusted effect size, physical illness accounted for 24.4%, 21.0% and 32.3% of population attributable risk for suicide in total, male and female populations, respectively. Conclusions Physical illness constitutes a significant risk factor for suicide independent of psychiatric and socio-economic factors. Clinicians treating physically ill patients should be aware of the risk, especially amongst those with multiple or recent hospitalizations, or multiple comorbidities.

AB BACKGROUND: Women with fertility problems often experience higher levels of stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms associated with both the infertility diagnosis and eventual fertility treatment. The authors investigated whether women who do not succeed in having a child after an infertility evaluation are at a higher risk of suicide than women who succeed in having a child after an infertility evaluation.
   METHODS: A cohort of 51 221 Danish women with primary or secondary infertility and referred to hospitals or private fertility clinics in Denmark during 1973-1998 was established. The cohort was linked to four Danish administrative population-based registries. Each woman was followed from the date of her initial fertility evaluation at the clinic or hospital until 2006. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for suicide and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for potential confounders.
   RESULTS: Women who did not have a child after an initial fertility evaluation had >2-fold (HR: 2.43; 95% CI: 1.38-3.71) greater risk of suicide than women who had at least one child after a fertility evaluation. Women with secondary infertility, i.e. women who had a child before a fertility evaluation but did not succeed in having one after, also had an increased risk for suicide (HR: 1.68; 95% CI, 0.82-3.41) compared with women who succeeded in having another child, although the risk estimate failed to reach significance.
   CONCLUSIONS: Health-care personnel treating women with fertility problems should be aware of the emotional response of their patients in order to recognize and treat possible psychiatric morbidity after fertility problems.

AB LSD was introduced in psychiatry in the 1950s. Between 1960 and 1973, nearly 400 patients were treated with LSD in Denmark. By 1964, one homicide, two suicides and four suicide attempts had been reported. In 1986 the Danish LSD Damages Law was passed after complaints by only one patient. According to the Law, all 154 applicants received financial compensation for LSD-inflicted harm. The Danish State Archives has preserved the case material of 151 of the 154 applicants. Most of the patients suffered from severe side effects of the LSD treatment many years afterwards. In particular, two-thirds of the patients had flashbacks. With the recent interest in LSD therapy, we should consider the neurotoxic potential of LSD.

AB Background: Little is known about the suicide risk of older adults diagnosed with schizophrenia. The purpose of the study is to examine whether older adults diagnosed with schizophrenia have an elevated risk of dying by suicide, examine trends by age, and identify predictors of death by suicide.
   Methods: Individual-level register data on all older adults aged 50+ living in Denmark during 1990-2006 (N = 2,899,411) were assessed using survival analysis. The impact of predictors was adjusted for a series of socio-demographic and health-related covariates.
   Results: In all, 248 suicides were identified among older adults diagnosed with schizophrenia. The suicide rate ratios of men and women aged 50-69 years with a diagnosis of schizophrenia was 7.0 [95%CI: 5.8-8.4] and 13.7 [95%CI: 11.3-16.6], respectively, when compared to those with no diagnosis. With increasing age a lower rate ratio was found; for men and women aged 70+ it was 2.1 [95%CI: 1.1-3.9] and 3.4 [95%CI: 2.0-5.8], respectively. Adjusted analyses revealed an elevated risk of suicide for diagnoses of schizophrenia, greater number of hospitalizations, recent admission (for men), recent discharge, previous suicide attempt, recent suicide attempt, comorbidity of mood disorders, personality disorders, and substance abuse (for women).
   Conclusions: We found an elevated mortality risk of suicide for both men and women aged 50 years and over diagnosed with schizophrenia. Health care staff should be aware of elevated risk, particularly in older women diagnosed with schizophrenia, in relation to chronic disease courses, recent discharge, and suicide attempt.

AB Objective: Older adults have elevated suicide rates, especially in the presence of a psychiatric disorder, yet not much is known about predictors for suicide within this high-risk group. The current study examines the characteristics associated with suicide among older adults who are admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Method: All persons aged 60 and older living in Denmark who were hospitalized with psychiatric disorders during 1990-2000 were included in the study. Using a case-control design and logistic regression analysis, the authors calculated the suicide risk associated with specific patient characteristics. Results: Affective disorders were found to be associated with an almost twofold higher risk of suicide among psychiatric inpatients than other types of disorders (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5-2.6). Patients with dementia had a significantly lower risk ratio of 0.2 (95% CI: 0.1-0.3). In combination with other types of disorder, affective disorders were found to modify an increased risk of suicide. First versus later admission for depression was a better predictor for suicide than age at first hospitalization for depression (before or after age 60 years). More than half of suicides occurred either within the first week of admission or discharge (chi(2) [1] = 27.70, p < 0.001) compared with the distribution of patient days. Conclusions: Our findings underline the important role of affective disorder in combination with other types of disorders. Assessment of suicide risk among older psychiatric inpatients should take current or previous episodes of affective illness into consideration and pay special heed to the time shortly after admission and discharge.

AB Background-Myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with an increased risk of anxiety, depression, low quality of life, and all-cause mortality. Whether MI is associated with an increased risk of suicide is unknown. We examined the association between MI and suicide.
   Methods and Results-We conducted a population-based case-control study by retrieving data from 5 nationwide longitudinal registers in Denmark. As cases, we selected all persons aged 40 to 89 years who died by suicide from 1981 to 2006. As controls, we randomly selected up to 10 persons per case matched by sex, day of birth, and calendar time. We identified 19 857 persons who committed suicide and 190 058 controls. MI was associated with a marked increased risk of suicide. The risk of suicide was highest during the first month after discharge for MI for patients with no history of psychiatric illness (adjusted rate ratio, 3.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.61 to 6.56) and for patients with a history of psychiatric illness (adjusted rate ratio, 64.05; 95% confidence interval, 13.36 to 307.06) compared with those with no history of MI or psychiatric illness. However, the risk remained high for at least 5 years after MI.
   Conclusions-MI is followed by an increased risk of suicide for persons with and without psychiatric illness. Our results suggest the importance of screening patients with MI for depression and suicidal ideation. (Circulation. 2010;122:2388-2393.)

   DEATH; YOUNG; LIFE
AB Background: Persons with a history of admission to a psychiatric hospital are at high risk for suicide, but little is known about how this is influenced by factors related to psychiatric hospitalization.
   Objective: To explore suicide risk according to time since admission, diagnosis, length of hospital treatment, and number of prior hospitalizations.
   Design: Nested case-control design.
   Setting: Individual data are drawn from various Danish longitudinal registers.
   Participants: All 13681 male and 7488 female suicides committed in Denmark from January 1, 1981, to December 31, 1997, and 423128 population control subjects matched for sex, age, and calendar time of suicide.
   Main Outcome Measure: Risk of suicide is estimated by conditional logistic regression. Data are adjusted for socioeconomic factors.
   Results: This study demonstrates that there are 2 sharp peaks of risk for suicide around psychiatric hospitalization, one in the first week after admission and another in the first week after discharge; suicide risk is significantly higher in patients who received less than the median duration of hospital treatment; affective disorders have the strongest impact on suicide risk in terms of its effect size and population attributable risk; and suicide risk associated with affective and schizophrenia spectrum disorders declines quickly after treatment and recovery, while the risk associated with substance abuse disorders declines relatively slower. This study also indicates that an admission history increases suicide risk relatively more in women than in men; and suicide risk is substantial for substance disorders and for multiple admissions in women but not in men.
   Conclusions: Suicide risk peaks in periods immediately after admission and discharge. The risk is particularly high in persons with affective disorders and in persons with short hospital treatment. These findings should lead to systematic evaluation of suicide risk among inpatients before discharge and corresponding outpatient treatment, and family support should be initiated immediately after the discharge.

AB There are meager prospective data from nonclinical samples on the link between anxiety disorders and suicide or the extent to which the association varies over time. We examined these issues in a cohort of 309,861 U.S. Air Force service members, with 227 suicides over follow-up. Mental disorder diagnoses including anxiety, mood, and substance-use disorders (SUD) were based on treatment encounters. Risk for suicide associated with anxiety disorders were lower compared with mood disorders and similar to SUD. Moreover, the associations between mood and anxiety disorders with suicide were greatest within a year of treatment presentation.

DT Article
DE assisted suicide; prioritization; health resources; philosophical
   analysis
AB This article examines two current debates in Denmark-assisted suicide and the prioritization of health resources-and proposes that such controversial bioethical issues call for distinct philosophical analyses: first-order examinations, or an applied philosophy approach, and second-order examinations, what might be called a political philosophical approach. The authors argue that although first-order examination plays an important role in teasing out different moral points of view, in contemporary democratic societies, few, if any, bioethical questions can be resolved satisfactorily by means of first-order analyses alone, and that bioethics needs to engage more closely with second-order enquiries and the question of legitimacy in general.

AB Objective: The current study aims to examine the risk of suicide in persons diagnosed with dementia during a hospitalization and its relationship to mood disorders. Design: Event-history analysis using time-varying covariates. Setting: Population-based record linkage. Participants: All individuals aged 50+ living in Denmark (N = 2,474,767) during January 1, 1990 through December 31, 2000. Measurements: Outcome of interest is suicide. Relative risks are calculated based on person-days spent in each stratum. Results: A total of 18,648,875 person-years were observed during the 11-year study period. During this period, 136 persons who previously had been diagnosed with dementia died by suicide. Men and women aged 50-69 years with hospital presentations of dementia have a relative suicide risk of 8.5 (95% confidence interval: 6.3-11.3) and 10.8 (95% confidence interval: 7.4-15.7), respectively. Those who are aged 70 or older with dementia have a threefold higher risk than persons with no dementia. The time shortly after diagnosis is associated with an elevated suicide risk. The risk among persons with dementia remains significant when controlling for mood disorders. As many as 26% of the men and 14% of the women who died by suicide died within the first 3 months after being diagnosed whereas 38% of the men and 41% of the women died more than 3 years after initial dementia diagnosis. Conclusions: Dementia, determined during hospitalization, was associated with an elevated risk of suicide for older adults. Preventive measures should focus on suicidal ideation after initial diagnosis but also acknowledge that suicides can occur well after a dementia diagnosis has been established.

AB Although sexual victimization has been associated with suicidal behaviors, its association with completed suicide has not been examined. We investigated this association among Danish women using longitudinal data and a conservative definition of victimization. This population-based case-control study included 476 suicide cases and 12,010 matched controls. Seven cases (1.5%) and 5 controls (0.04%) experienced sexual victimization that was reported to the police and resulted in a conviction. Sexual victimization was associated with a 14-fold increased rate of suicide, controlling for confounders and matching (95% CI: [3.4, 59]). Completed suicide is an important potential outcome of sexual victimization, warranting further examination.

   AFFECTIVE-ILLNESS; MOOD DISORDERS; MORTALITY; RECURRENCE; BEHAVIOR;
   PREDICTORS
AB Context: Prior observational studies suggest that treatment with lithium may be associated with reduced risk of suicide in bipolar disorder. However, these studies are biased toward patients with the most severe disorders, and the relation to sex and age has seldom been investigated.
   Objective: To investigate whether treatment with lithium reduces the risk of suicide in a nationwide study.
   Design: An observational cohort study with linkage of registers of all prescribed lithium and recorded suicides in Denmark during a period from January 1, 1995, to December 31, 1999.
   Setting: All patients treated with lithium in Denmark, ie, within community psychiatry, private specialist practice settings, and general practice.
   Participants: A total of 13 186 patients who purchased at least 1 prescription of lithium and 1.2 million subjects from the general population.
   Main Outcome Measure: All suicides identified on the basis of death certificates completed by doctors at the time of death.
   Results: Patients who purchased lithium had a higher rate of suicide than persons who did not purchase lithium. Purchasing lithium at least twice was associated with a 0.44 reduced rate of suicide (95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.70) compared with the rate when purchasing lithium only once. Further, the rate of suicide decreased with the number of prescriptions of lithium. There was no significant interaction between continued lithium treatment and sex and age regarding the suicide rate.
   Conclusion: In a nationwide study including all patients treated with lithium, it was found that continued lithium treatment was associated with reduced suicide risk regardless of sex and age.

AB Availability of drugs with high lethality has been hypothesized to increase the risk of self-poisoning suicides. A literature search concerning deliberate self-poisoning and the effect of restricting access to drugs was conducted, and the effect of restrictions in availability of barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants, dextropropoxyphene, and weak analgesics was reviewed. The correlations between method-specific and overall suicide rates and sales figures for barbiturates, dextropropoxyphene, weak analgesics, and tricyclic antidepressants were reviewed. It is concluded that restriction in availability of drugs with high case fatality should be a part of suicide prevention strategies.

AB A family history of completed suicide and psychiatric illness has been identified as risk factors for suicide.
   To examine the risk of offspring suicide in relation to parental history of suicide and other parental risk factors.
   The study population consisted of 7,177 adult offspring born 1959-1961 and their parents from the Copenhagen Perinatal Cohort. Cohort members and their parents who had committed suicide were identified in the Danish Causes of Death Registry (follow-up until December 31, 2005), while information on psychiatric hospitalisation history was obtained from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register.
   Forty-eight cohort members, 77 mothers and 133 fathers had committed suicide during the follow-up. Independent of parental psychiatric illness and social status, parental suicide significantly increased suicide risk in offspring (hazard ratio 4.40 with 95% CI 1.81-10.69). A stronger effect of parental suicide was observed in offspring without a history of psychiatric hospitalisation.
   Parental history of suicide is a risk factor for suicide in offspring, but primarily in offspring without psychiatric hospitalisation.

AB Objectives: To examine risk of suicide among individuals with hospitalised chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to profile differences according to sex, age, psychiatric history, and recency and frequency of COPD hospitalisations.
   Design: Nested case-control study.
   Setting: Data were retrieved from Danish national registries.
   Participants: All suicide cases aged 40-95 years deceased between 1981 and 2006 in Denmark (n=19 869) and up to 20 live population controls per case matched on sex and date of birth (n=321 867 controls).
   Main outcome measures: The relative risk of suicide associated with COPD was computed using conditional logistic regression and adjusted for effects of psychiatric history and important sociodemographic factors.
   Results: In our study population, 3% of suicide cases had been hospitalised for COPD compared with 1% of matched population controls. Thus, a hospitalised COPD was associated with a significantly increased risk for suicide (OR 2.6; 95% CI 2.3 to 2.8). The increased risk remained significant after adjustment for psychiatric history and sociodemographic variables (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.8 to 2.2), and increased progressively with frequency and recency of COPD hospitalisation. At the same time, suicide risk associated with COPD differed significantly by sex, age and psychiatric status. The relative risk was more pronounced in women, in individuals older than 60 years and in persons with no history of psychiatric illness.
   Conclusions: COPD confers an important risk factor for suicide completion. Risk assessment and prevention efforts should take patients' sex, age and psychiatric history into consideration.

AB The objective of this study was to determine predictors of repeated suicide attempts in young people, focusing on psychiatric illness. A longitudinal population-based register study of all adolescents born in Denmark between 1984 and 2006 was conducted. Greater numbers of hospitalizations, psychiatric diagnoses, and psychopharmacological medications prescribed to youth before and after the index attempt were risk factors for repeated suicide attempts. Parental diagnoses and drug prescriptions following a child's first suicide attempt moderated the risk of repeated attempts. Psychiatric illness is a strong predictor of repeated suicide attempts in young people, and those with co-morbid diagnoses are at increased risk of repeated suicide attempts. Treatment of psychiatric illness in the parents after their child's first suicide attempt is a potential protective factor.

TI Prevention of suicide with regulations aimed at restricting access to

   evidence

AB Background Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for 14-20% of suicides worldwide. Regulation aimed at restricting access to pesticides or banning highly hazardous pesticides is one approach to reducing these deaths. We systematically reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness of pesticide regulation in reducing the incidence of pesticide suicides and overall suicides.
   Methods We did a systematic review of the international evidence. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase for studies published between Jan 1, 1960, and Dec 31, 2016, which investigated the effect of national or regional bans, and sales or import restrictions, on the availability of one or more pesticides and the incidence of suicide in different countries. We excluded other interventions aimed at limiting community access to pesticides. We extracted data from studies presenting pesticide suicide data and overall suicide data from before and after national sales restrictions. Two reviewers independently assessed papers for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We undertook a narrative synthesis of the data in each report, and where data were available for the years before and after a ban, we pooled data for the 3 years before and the 3 years after to obtain a crude estimate of the effect of the ban. This study is registered through PROSPERO, number CRD42017053329.
   Findings We identified 27 studies undertaken in 16 countries-five low-income or middle-income countries (Bangladesh, Colombia, India, Jordan and Sri Lanka), and 11 high-income countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, UK, and USA). Assessments largely focused on national bans of specific pesticides (12 studies of bans in six countries-Jordan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Greece [ Crete], South Korea, and Taiwan) or sales restrictions (eight studies of restrictions in five countries-India, Denmark, Ireland, the UK and the USA). Only five studies used optimum analytical methods. National bans on commonly ingested pesticides in five of the six countries studied, including four studies using optimum analytical methods, were followed by reductions in pesticide suicides and, in three of these countries, falls in overall suicide mortality. Greece was the only country studied that did not show a decrease in pesticide suicide following a ban. There were no high-quality studies of restricting sales to people for occupational uses; four of the seven studies (in three of the five countries studied-India, Denmark, and the USA) showed sales restrictions were followed by decreases in pesticide suicides; one of the two studies investigating trends in overall suicide mortality reported a fall in deaths in Denmark, but there were also decreases in suicide deaths from other methods.
   Interpretation National bans on highly hazardous pesticides, which are commonly ingested in acts of self-poisoning, seem to be effective in reducing pesticide-specific and overall suicide rates. Evidence is less consistent for sales restrictions. A worldwide ban on the use of highly hazardous pesticides is likely to prevent tens of thousands of deaths every year. Copyright (C) The Author(s).

AB The social and economic characteristics of geographic areas are associated with their suicide rates. The extent to which these ecological associations are due to the characteristics of the people living in the areas (compositional effects) or the influence of the areas themselves on risk (contextual effects) is uncertain. Denmark's Medical Register on Vital Statistics and its Integrated Database for Longitudinal Labour Market Research were used to identify suicides and 20 matched controls per case in 25-60-year-old men and women between 1982 and 1997. Individual and area (municipality) measures of income, marital and employment status were obtained. There were 9011 suicides and 180,220 controls. Individual-level associations with these risk factors were little changed when controlling for contextual effects. In contrast, ecological associations of increased suicide risk with declining area levels of employment and income and increasing proportions of people living alone were much attenuated after controlling for compositional effects. We found no consistent evidence that associations with individual-level risk factors differed depending on the areas' characteristics (cross-level interactions). This analysis suggests the ecological associations to be attributed to characteristics of the residents rather than area influences on risk. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Gender differences in risk factors for suicide in Denmark

DT Article
ID UNEMPLOYMENT; DISORDERS; ABUSE; RATES; WOMEN
AB Background Gender is one of the most frequently replicated predictors for suicide.
   Aims To identify risk factors for suicide among males and females and to investigate whether risk factors for suicide differ by gender.
   Method A time-matched nested case control design was performed using Danish longitudinal register databases to obtain 811 suicide cases and 79 871 controls. Data were analysed using conditional logistic regression.
   Results A history of hospitalised mental illness was the most marked risk factor for suicide for both genders. Unemployment, retirement, being single and sickness absence were significant risk factors for men, whereas having a child <2 years old was significantly protective for women. The relative risks for suicide differed significantly between genders according to psychiatric admission status and being the parent of a child <2 years. However, adjustment for these factors did not eliminate the gender difference in suicide risk.
   Conclusions Risk factors for suicide differed by gender and gender differences could not be explained by differential exposure to known risk factors.

AB Objective: The author hypothesized, based on research until 1991, that a five-fold increase in the use of antidepressants might reduce Swedish suicide rates by 25%. A subsequent 3.5-fold increase in the use of antidepressants provided a 'natural experimental situation' for prospectively testing this hypothesis.
   Method: Swedish statistics on suicide, use of antidepressants, unemployment and alcohol consumption were obtained for 1978-96. Time-series of the latter variables were compared with suicide rates. Demographic subgroups regarding age, gender and county were analysed. Suicide rates were also compared with the use of antidepressants in Denmark, Norway and Finland.
   Results: Suicide rates decreased in accordance with the a priori hypothesis. Alcohol consumption and unemployment rates did not correlate well with suicide rates.
   Conclusion: This naturalistic study is not conclusive. The increased use of antidepressants appears, however, to be one of the contributing factors to the decrease in the suicide rate. It is of great scientific and clinical importance that this be evaluated by further studies.

AB Japan has the highest suicide rates among the OECD countries and this public health problem seems to be accelerating in over the recent decades. Investigating and understanding the suicidal behaviour is of crucial importance to society and health policy makers. Such an investigation could provide with useful information for those responsible in formulating the national policies on suicide prevention. This study estimates dynamic econometric models for total, male and female suicides in Japan for the period of 1957-2009. Using the ARDL approach to cointegration, we find that the associations of suicide with sociological factors (divorce and fertility rates) were stronger than those with economic factors (per capita GDP and unemployment) for females.

AB Context: Two studies based on clinical samples have found an association between Toxoplasma gondii infection and history of suicide attempt. To our knowledge, these findings have never been replicated in a prospective cohort study.
   Objective: To examine whether T gondii-infected mothers have an increased risk of self-directed violence, violent suicide attempts, and suicide and whether the risk depends on the level of T gondii IgG antibodies.
   Design: Register-based prospective cohort study. Women were followed up from the date of delivery, 1992 to 1995 until 2006.
   Setting: Denmark.
   Participants: A cohort of 45 788 women born in Denmark whose level of Toxoplasma-specific IgG antibodies was measured in connection with child birth between 1992 and 1995.
   Main Outcome Measures: Incidence rates of self-directed violence, violent suicide attempts, and suicide in relation to T gondii seropositivity and serointensity.
   Results: T gondii-infected mothers had a relative risk of self-directed violence of 1.53 (95% CI, 1.27-1.85) compared with noninfected mothers, and the risk seemed to increase with increasing IgG antibody level. For violent suicide attempts, the relative risk was 1.81 (95% CI, 1.13-2.84) and for suicide, 2.05 (95% CI, 0.78-5.20). A similar association was found for repetition of self-directed violence, with a relative risk of 1.54 (95% CI, 0.98-2.39).

AB Objective: To compare the temporal changes in suicide rate among patients treated with antidepressants with the change in suicide rate among persons who have not been treated with antidepressants during 1995-1999.
   Method: In a historic prospective national pharmacoepidemiological register linkage study by using four Danish registers we included 438 625 patients who had purchased antidepressants, and compared them with 1 199 057 population based control persons. The annual rate of suicide was estimated using Poisson regression analyses.
   Results: The suicide rate decreased for persons treated with antidepressants as well as for persons not treated with antidepressants. The proportion of persons, who committed suicide and who had not been treated with antidepressants decreased. The reduction in suicide rate was more pronounced among persons treated with SSRIs or older antidepressants than among persons not treated with antidepressants.
   Conclusion: Several factors contribute to the decreasing suicide rate. The most pronounced decrease in suicide rate was found among persons treated with antidepressants.

AB Since Durkheim's work on suicide, the family has widely been seen as providing partial protection against the development of tendencies to suicide. This study assesses the impact of parenthood (both number of children and age of youngest child) on suicide following the death of a spouse. Using data for Belgium in the 5 years following the 1991 census, the study adopts a nested case-control design with information on 3,800 suicides and 75,673 matched controls. The analysis takes into account several social-economic variables. The findings show that the impact of children on the elevated suicide levels found among widows and widowers relative to the still married can be positive or negative, and differs by both age and sex of the parent, age of the child or children, and time since bereavement.

AB Aims: To explore: (1) The relationship between children admitted to our paediatric department as a result of suicide attempts with acetaminophen and their parents and friends. (2) The extent to which the children had attempted to speak to their parents about their problems before their suicide attempts. (3) The frequency of self-mutilation among children with suicidal behaviour. (4) The purposes and reasons for childhood suicide attempts. Methods: A retrospective case-control study based on medical records and in-hospital child psychiatric assessments at the Paediatric Department, Hillerod Hospital, Denmark, 2006-2011. Study group: 107 children, 11 to 15 years old. Control group: 59 age-and gender-matched children. Results: 43.5% experienced a dissociated parental relationship characterized by the inability to speak to their parents about any problems, compared with 2% in the control group. There was a significant association between a dissociated parental relationship and 'the feeling of not being heard' (p = 0.004), the discovery of the suicide attempt (p = 0.008), the reasons for the suicide attempt (p = 0.006), academic school problems (p = 0.03), and the child's relationships with friends (p = 0.02). Prior to their suicide attempts, 41.5% of the children had attempted to speak to their parents about their problems but felt that they were not heard. There was a significant association among 'the feeling of not being heard' and the purpose of the suicide attempt (p = 0.002) and self-mutilation (p = 0.002). Forty percent mutilated themselves repeatedly. Conclusions: A consistently impaired parent-child relationship, 'the feeling of not being heard', and self-mutilation are identifiable early risk factors that require increased concern and attention among professionals who work with children.

AB Objectives. The purpose of our study is to examine suicide trends among the old (65-79 years) and oldest old (80+ years).
   Methods. All persons aged 50 or older who committed suicide in Denmark during 1972-1998 are included in the analysis. Suicide trends are analyzed by sex, age, civil status, and methods. Age, period, and cohort effects are examined graphically.
   Results. In all, 17,729 persons (10,479 men and 7,250 women) committed suicide. During the study period, the suicide trends among the middle-aged and the old adults decreased. The trend among the oldest old, by contrast, remained stable. Marriage ceases to have a preventive effect among the oldest old. The oldest old tend to use more determined suicide methods.
   Discussion. Distinct differences in suicide mortality between the old and the oldest old were found. The suicide trend of the oldest old does not reflect the recent improvements found in their overall mortality. Interestingly, it seems that the preventive effect of marriage seems to be ceasing with increasing age.

AB The literature on inpatient suicides was systematically reviewed. English, German, and Dutch articles were identified by means of the electronic databases PsycInfo, Cochrane, Medline, EMBASE psychiatry, CINAHL, and British Nursing Index. In total, 98 articles covering almost 15,000 suicides were reviewed and analyzed. Rates and demographic features connected to suicides varied substantially between articles, suggesting distinct subgroups of patients committing suicide (e. g., depressed vs. schizophrenic patients) with their own suicide determinants and patterns. Early in the admission is clearly a high-risk period for suicide, but risk declines more slowly for patients with schizophrenia. Suicide rates were found to be associated with admission numbers, and as expected, previous suicidal behavior was found to be a robust predictor of future suicide. The methods used for suicide are linked to availability of means. Timing and location of suicides seem to be associated with absence of support, supervision, and the presence of family conflict. Although there is a strong notion that suicides cluster in time, clear statistical evidence for this is lacking. For prevention of suicides, staff need to engage with patients' family problems, and reduce absconding without locking the door. Future research should take into account the heterogeneous subgroups of patients who commit suicide, with case-control studies addressing these separately.

AB Background: Using a large cohort of western Canadian sawmill workers (n=28,794), the association between psychosocial work conditions and attempted and completed suicide was investigated. Methods: Records of attempted and completed suicide were accessed through a provincial hospital discharge registry to identify cases that were then matched using a nested case control method. Psychosocial work conditions were estimated by expert raters using the demand - control model. Univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the association between work conditions and suicide. Results: In multivariate models, controlling for sociodemographic ( marital status, ethnicity) and occupational confounders ( job mobility and duration), low psychological demand was associated with increased odds for completed suicide, and low social support was associated with increased odds for attempted suicides. Conclusions: This study indicates that workers with poor psychosocial working conditions may be at increased risk of both attempted and completed suicide.

AB Background: Few studies have examined the correlation between social circumstances during childhood and adult suicide behaviour in a prospective design. How indicators of impaired childhood development affect the risk of suicide behaviour before the age of 50 years are analysed in this study.
   Method: 9359 Men born in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1953, who had completed conscription medical examination at approximately 18 years of age and for whom birth certificates had been traced were followed from 1972 to 2003 in Danish health registers regarding suicide or suicide attempts. At the age of 12 years 6856 of these cohort members had completed a cognitive performance test.
   Results: During follow-up, 92 (1.0%) and 228 (2.4%) of the men, respectively, committed suicide or had one or more suicide attempt. Low body mass index (BMI), low cognitive test score, and mental disorder at the age of 18 years were associated with an increased risk of suicide. After adjustment, mental disorder remained significantly associated with suicide risk (hazard ratio 2.49, 95% CI 1.03 to 6.02), whereas the estimates for cognitive function (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.01) and BMI ( HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.02) were attenuated. In the crude analyses suicide attempt was associated with all indicators, but after adjustment mental disorder (HR 2.64 (95% CI 1.55 to 4.49), no more than a basic school education (HR 2.28, 95% CI 1. 30 to 4.00), BMI (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.00) and cognitive test score at the age of 18 years (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.01) were associated with the risk of suicide attempt.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that low BMI, low cognitive function, and mental disorder in early adulthood are markers of an increased risk of suicide among men born in Denmark in 1953.

AB Background: A reduction in the number of inpatient beds as well as shorter admissions have aroused concern that tendencies to deinstitutionalize may increase the suicide rate for psychiatric patients who have been hospitalized. One study indicates that a decreasing inpatient suicide rate may actually reflect a transfer to an increasing postdischarge suicide rate; however, uncertainties exist about this transfer, since it is not well studied. The objectives of this study were to estimate adjusted changes over time in suicide rates among psychiatric inpatients and recently discharged psychiatric patients and to estimate changes in these rates by gender and diagnosis.
   Method: Data on all psychiatric patients admitted from 1998 through 2005 in Denmark were extracted from the Danish Psychiatric Central Register and merged with information from the Danish Cause of Death Register. Calendar year was applied as an independent continuous variable in Cox survival analyses modeling the hazard of suicide during inpatient treatment and during the 3-month postdischarge period. Analyses were adjusted for sex, age, educational status, primary diagnosis, and previous suicide attempt.
   Results: The overall inpatient suicide rate declined in psychiatric patients admitted from 1998 through 2005 (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.93 [95% CI, 0.88-0.99]), particularly among women (HR = 0.87 [95% CI, 0.79-0.96]). The overall rate of suicide in the 3-month postdischarge period also declined significantly (HR = 0.94 [95% CI, 0.91-0.98]), which was explained mostly by a falling rate among men (HR = 0.94 [95% CI, 0.90-0.98]) as well as among patients who were discharged with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (HR = 0.90 [95% CI, 0.83-0.99]).
   Conclusions: Although our results show a decreasing trend in suicide rates, the sizes of the rates emphasize that focus on suicide in mental health care settings must continue and be improved, as the rates are still very high. (C) Copyright 2013 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB Background: Prior studies suggest anticonvulsants purchasers may be at greater risk of suicide than lithium purchasers.
   Methods: Longitudinal, retrospective cohort study of all individuals in Denmark purchasing anticonvulsants (valproic acid, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine or lamotrigine) (n=9952) or lithium (n = 6693) from 1995-2001 who also purchased antipsychotics at least once (to select out nonpsychiatric anticonvulsant use). Poisson regression of suicides by medication purchased (anticonvulsants or lithium) was conducted, controlling for age, sex, and calendar year. Confounding by indication was addressed by restricting the comparison to individuals prescribed the same medication: individuals with minimal medication exposure (e.g., who purchased only a single prescription of anticonvulsants) were compared to those individuals with more consistent medication exposure (i.e., purchasing >= 6 prescriptions of anticonvulsants).
   Results: Demographics and frequency of anticonvulsant, lithium. or antipsychotic use were similar between lithium and anticonvulsant purchasers. Among patients who also purchased antipsychotic at least once during the study period, purchasing anticonvulsants more consistently (>= 6 prescriptions) was associated with a substantial reduction in the risk of suicide (RR=0.22, 95% CI=0.11-0.42, p<0.0001), similar to patients consistently purchasing lithium (RR=0.27, 95% CI=0.12-0.62, P=0.006). Absolute suicide risks of consistent anticonvulsant and consistent lithium purchasers were similar.
   Limitations: Lack of information about diagnoses and potential confounders, as well as other covariates that may differ between minimal and consistent medication purchasers, are limitations to this study.
   Conclusions: In this longitudinal study of anticonvulsant purchasers likely to have psychiatric disorders, consistent anticonvulsant treatment was associated with decreased risk of completed suicide. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Temporal trends in incidence of hospital-treated self-harm among

AB Background Studies conducted in the UK and in Ireland have reported increased rates of self-harm in adolescent females from around the time of the 2008 economic recession and through periods of subsequent national austerity programme implementation. It is not known if incidence rates have increased similarly in other Western European countries during this period. Methods Data from interlinked national administrative registers were extracted for individuals born in Denmark during 1981-2006. We estimated gender- and age-specific incidence rates (IRs) per 10,000 person-years at risk for hospital-treated non-fatal self-harm during 2000-2016 at ages 10-19 years. Results Incidence of self-harm peaked in 2007 (IR 25.1) and then decreased consistently year on year to 13.8 in 2016. This pattern was found in all age groups, in both males and females and in each parental income tertile. During the last 6 years of the observation period, 2011-2016, girls aged 13-16 had the highest incidence rates whereas, among boys, incidence was highest among 17-19 year olds throughout. Conclusions The temporal increases in incidence rates of self-harm among adolescents observed in some Western European countries experiencing major economic recession were not observed in Denmark. Restrictions to sales of analgesics, access to dedicated suicide prevention clinics, higher levels of social spending and a stronger welfare system may have protected potentially vulnerable adolescents from the increases seen in other countries. A better understanding of the specific mechanisms behind the temporal patterns in self-harm incidence in Denmark is needed to help inform suicide prevention in other nations.

AB 'Undetermined' (UnD) and accidental deaths (AccD) are explored as possible sources of 'under-reported-suicides' (URS) in 20 Western countries.
   WHO mortality rates per million of AccD, UnD and suicides analysed. UnD:suicides ratios of < 1:5 calculated as likely URS versus ratios > 1:10 unlikely URS and all correlated by sex and age.
   Male URS likely in 7 countries and in 11 for females. URS in AccD likely in 5 countries for both sexes only UnD and suicide rates the elderly (75+) significantly correlated.
   Strong indication of URS in the UK, Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany with likely URS in AccD in Greece, Portugal, Switzerland and USA. These findings have important implications, indicating that, with the exception of France and Japan, official reported suicide rates contain a degree of under-reporting, and especially for women yet it is essential to have accurate suicide data to ensure adequate service provision.

DT Article
ID DISORDER; AGE; RISK
AB Background Very old people have higher suicide rates than the younger elderly population. Psychiatric disorders are known to have a strong association with suicide among elderly people.
   Aims To analyse the suicide risk associated with psychiatric hospitalisation among the very old (>= 80 years) compared with the middle-aged (50-64 years) and old (65-79 years) populations.
   Method Individual-level data on the entire Danish population aged 50 years or over were analysed for the period 1994-1998. Relative suicide risks were calculated using event-history analysis.
   Results Among 1978 527 persons, 2323 died by suicide. Although the very old group exhibited a four-fold to five-fold increase in risk of suicide for those previously hospitalised, we noted an inverse interaction effect: the increase is distinctly smaller compared with that in the middle-aged and old groups.
   Conclusions The association between suicide and psychiatric hospitalisation is much weaker for the very old than for the old. Psychiatric disorders among very old people may be interacting with other disorders, may be underdiagnosed or treated in other healthcare settings.

AB Previous research has shown for the most part positive correlations between intelligence and suicide prevalence on the national level. However, this study found proxies for regional intelligence in Australia (international average domain scores from the PISA 2000 study) to be significantly negatively correlated with the total, male, and female suicide rates of the different administrative divisions of Australia, and this finding was independent of regional wealth. A research synthesis of the current results and those from similar studies of other countries (positive correlations for Austria, Belarus, The British Isles, Denmark, and The Netherlands; inconclusive findings for France, Germany, and the USA) was conducted. This synthesis of research findings showed that positive ecological correlations of intelligence with suicide rate were more likely observed for nations with higher suicide rates and poorer general living conditions, whereas there was no relation with national IQ.

ID PARASUICIDE; POPULATION; PREVALENCE
AB This study describes the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempted suicide in a representative survey among adults in Denmark and gives the proportion of people reporting a suicide attempt that results in contact with the health care system. The data for the 1994 Danish national health interview survey were collected by personal interview and a self-administered questionnaire. A subsample of 1362 individuals participated in the part of the survey that addressed suicidal behaviour (64% of the random sample). The results show that 6.9% reported having had suicidal thoughts within the past year. Averaging across all age groups the overall prevalence of people reporting ever having made a suicide attempt was 3.4% and the one-year prevalence was 0.5%. Suicidal ideation was more prevalent among young people than among older people, whereas ever-attempted suicide showed no age gradient. Both suicidal ideation and ever-attempted suicide were more prevalent among economically inactive people (e.g. unemployed) and among unmarried or divorced people. We estimate that 50 - 60% of suicide attempts reported in a representative, national survey become known to the healthcare system.

AB Background: As many as 47% of adults over age 50 discontinue treatment with antidepressants after redeeming only one prescription. The study aim was to assess the risk of suicide in adults aged 50+ who discontinue antidepressants at an early stage of treatment.
   Method: Case control study of all individuals aged 50+ living in Denmark and who initiated antidepressant treatment between July 1st 1995 and December 31st 2000 (N=217,123). Hazard ratios were calculated using Cox regression analyses, propensity score matching techniques, and marginal structural models.
   Results: During the study period, 78,594 men and 138,529 women aged 50+ began treatment with an antidepressant medication, of whom 309 men and 229 women died by suicide. Men aged 50+ who discontinued treatment early had a suicide rate of 167 per 100,000 compared with 175 per 100,000 in those who continued refilling prescriptions: hazard ratio=0.98 [CI-95%: 0.78-1.23]. The suicide rate in women who discontinued treatment was 52 per 100,000 compared with 74 per 100,000 in those who continued refilling: hazard ratio=0.72 [CI-95%: 0.55-0.94]. Although people with previous psychiatric hospitalizations had greater risk of suicide than those without past hospital admissions. the difference was not significant in the adjusted model.
   Limitations: Prescriptions redeemed at pharmacies are our only indicator of treatment adherence. Also, information on severity of depression was not available.
   Conclusions: We did not find a lower suicide risk among people over age 50 who seemingly follow treatment in comparison with those who discontinued treatment with antidepressants at an early stage. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Low Morals at a High Latitude? Suicide in Nineteenth-century Scandinavia
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
ID STATISTICS
AB This paper explores the usage of suicide statistics and the emergence of suicidology in nineteenth-century Scandinavia and Finland. Drawing upon texts from Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark-with a focus on Swedish language sources-it illustrates the significance that suicide statistics gained during this period, and pays attention to the question of how the Scandinavian discussion on suicide was linked to ideas from outside the geographic area. Taking the cross-references between the selected texts as a starting point, this short foray into early suicidology commences in Finland and works its way westwards.
   The discussed works provide a multi-faceted perspective on the issue of suicide statistics in nineteenth century Scandinavia. The paper confirms the influence of central European personalities and ideas on the discussion in the Nordic countries, but at the same time shows that Scandinavian scholars presented unique and novel works, and thus were actively participating and contributing to the emerging pan-European debate on suicide.

AB Objective: To calculate the incidence rates of hospital-treated psychosis and suicide in historical cohorts of a small rural community in southeast Norway, and to compare the local findings with the national ones.
   Method: We have carried out a longitudinal epidemiological study, reviewing the patient records at the mental hospitals of people born in the rural community after 1845. Based on these records, we have constructed a local register of psychosis and suicide in this population. The local incidence rates of psychosis and suicide have been compared with the national ones.
   Results: The overall local incidence rates of psychosis and suicide were similar to the national ones. The local rates of schizophrenia dropped considerably after World War II.
   Conclusion: The overall local incidence rates of psychosis and suicide seem to be representative for the country at large despite frequent endogamy. The recent drop in the incidence rate of schizophrenia seems to be in agreement with several international studies.

AB Introduction. Suicide is a multidimensional problem. Observations of family history of suicide suggest the existence of a genetic vulnerability to suicidal behaviour.
   Aim. Starting with a historical perspective, the article reviews current knowledge of a genetic vulnerability to suicidal behaviour, distinct from the genetic vulnerability to psychiatric disorders, focused on clinical and population-based studies, and findings from recent molecular genetics association studies.
   Method. The review includes peer-reviewed research articles and review papers from the professional literature in English language, retrieved from PubMed/Medline and PsycINFO.
   Results. The research literature confirms a existence of a genetic vulnerability to suicidal behaviour. Even though the results of individual studies are difficult to compare, genetic influences could explain up to half of the variance of the occurrence of suicide.
   Conclusion. Genetic vulnerability could be a distal risk factor for suicide, which helps us to understand the occurrence of suicide among vulnerable people. Ethical implications of such vulnerability are highlighted.

AB Objective: To investigate whether childhood sociodemographic factors and parental psychopathology affect suicide risk differently in men and women.
   Method: Cox regressions were used to calculate interaction effects of gender for childhood and parental risk factors for 8815 suicides (27% women) in a national cohort of 2.47 million people born between 1946 and 1968.
   Results: Low parental socioeconomic status increased suicide risk only for men, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.22 (P = 0.003 for gender interaction), while living in a metropolitan area increased the risk only for women, HR = 1.42 (P < 0.001 for gender interaction). Parental psychotic or affective disorder increased suicide risk more strongly for women (HR = 2.08), than for men (HR = 1.52) (P = 0.004 for gender interaction).
   Conclusion: Growing up in an urban environment and parental psychotic or affective disorder are significant gender-related risk factors for suicide, both conveying higher risks in women. The mechanisms linking childhood urbanicity to increased risk of suicide in adult women stand out as an important research area for the future. Can J Psychiatry. 2009; 55(2): 108-111.

ID RISK-FACTORS; MENTAL-ILLNESS; MORTALITY; REGISTER; PEOPLE
AB Objective To study the change in risk of suicide among patients with schizophrenia and related disorders.
   Design Nested case-control design with linked data.
   Setting Four longitudinal Danish registers.
   Participants 18 744 people aged Lip to 75 years who committed suicide in 1981-97 individually matched with 20 controls.
   Results Over the time studied the reduction in suicide rate among patients with schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorder was similar to that seen in the general population (incidence rate ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.98 to 1.03). The reduction among patients with other psychosis in the schizophrenia spectrum was faster than the reduction seen in the general population. Among people admitted to hospital with schizophrenia the risk of suicide was highest in the first year after first admission, and the excess risk was largest in the younger age groups-that is, the risk decreased per year for every additional year of age.
   Conclusion he suicide rate among patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and related disorders has fallen. This may be due to better psychiatric treatment, reduced access to means of suicide, or improvements in treatment after suicide attempts.

AB Background Familial clustering of suicidal behaviour has been well documented. We aimed to assess whether family history of completed suicide and mental illness that results in admission to hospital are risk factors for suicide, and whether these factors interact.
   Methods We did a nested case-control study using data from Danisn longitudinal registers. We included 4262 people who had committed suicide aged 9-45 years during 1981-97 (cases), and 80 238 population-based controls matched for age, sex, and date of suicide. Suicide and psychiatric history of parents and siblings and socioeconomic, demographic, and psychiatric data for every case were retrieved and merged. Data were analysed with conditional logistic regression.
   Findings A family history of completed suicide and psychiatric illness significantly and independently increased suicide risk (odds ratio 2.58 [95% CI 1.84-3.61] and 1.31 [1.19-1.45], respectively). These effects were not accounted for by the socioeconomic status and psychiatric history of cases. A history of family psychiatric illness significantly raised suicide risk only in people without a history of psychiatric illness (1.55 [1.38-1.75]), whereas a family history of suicide increased suicide risk irrespective of psychiatric illness (2.7 [1.11-5.09] and 2.66 [1.82-3.88]) for people with and without a psychiatric history, respectively,
   Interpretation Completed suicide and psychiatric illness in relatives are risk factors for suicide, and the effect of family suicide history is independent of the familial cluster of mental disorders. Family history of suicide should be established in the assessment of suicide risk.

AB Although suicide rates among prisoners are high and vary between countries, it is uncertain whether this reflects the importation of risk from the general population or is associated with incarceration rates.
   We collected data on suicides and undetermined deaths in 12 countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England and Wales, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, and Sweden) directly from their prison administrations for 2003-2007. These were compared with rates of suicides in the general population separately by gender using Pearson's correlations. In addition, they were compared with rates of incarceration. Linear regression was used to examine any association after adjustment for rates of incarceration.
   Data were collected on 861 suicides in prison, of which 810 were in men. In the men, crude relative rates of suicide were at least three times higher than the general population. Western European countries had similar rates of prisoner suicide which were mostly higher than those in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. There was no association between rates of suicide in prisoners and general population rates or rates of incarceration. In the women, inmate suicide rates varied widely and were mostly raised compared with rates in the general population. In addition, these rates did not appear to be associated with general population rates of suicide.
   Rates of prison suicide do not reflect general population suicide rates, suggesting that variations in prison suicide rates reflect differences in criminal justice systems including, possibly, the provision of psychiatric care in prison.

AB Background: Immigrant populations in Western European countries have grown in their size and diversity, but little is known about risks of self-directed and externalised violence among second-generation immigrants.
   Aims: To compare risks for attempted suicides and violent offending among second-generation immigrants to Denmark according to parental region of origin versus the native Danish population.
   Methods: Data from interlinked national Danish registers were used (N=1,973,614). Parental origin outside Denmark was categorised thus: Asia, Africa, Middle East, Greenland, other Scandinavian countries, elsewhere in Europe and all other regions. We estimated gender-specific cumulative incidence and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) versus native Danes.
   Results: In virtually all subgroups of second-generation immigrants, risk was elevated for the two adverse outcomes in both genders. Females generally had greater elevations in attempted suicide risk, and males had greater elevations in violent offending risk. For attempted suicide, especially large IRRs were observed for males and females whose parents emigrated from Greenland; for violent offending, risks were particularly raised for males and females of Middle Eastern, Greenlandic and African origin. Adjustment for socioeconomic status partially explained these associations.
   Conclusion: Western European nations should develop preventive programmes tailored towards specific second-generation immigrant populations, with integrated approaches jointly tackling suicidality and violence.

AB Four epidemiologic studies have examined mortality among women with cosmetic silicone gel-filled breast implants and have found that risk of death from suicide is two- to threefold higher in this group than among women of comparable age in the general population. The authors review the literature on the psychological and psychiatric hypotheses concerning women undergoing plastic surgery, although these hypotheses do not specifically address the association with suicide. Epidemiologic research is urgently needed to evaluate whether this association is an artifact of a higher prevalence of underlying and unreported psychopathology and other risk factors for suicide among women receiving breast implants or whether implants have an actual causal role in the risk of suicide. Until such studies are completed, psychiatric consultation should be considered before breast augmentation, especially for patients perceived to be at high risk by the plastic surgeon.

AB Objective: To explore socioeconomic and psychiatric characteristics of persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and to assess the effect of AIDS/HIV infection on risk for subsequent suicide in the context of psychiatric comorbidity and socioeconomic status.
   Method: In this study based on the entire population of Denmark, we interlinked 5 national registers to retrieve personal data on AIDS/HIV infection and covariates for 9,900 men who died of suicide during 1986-2006 and 189,037 controls matched for sex and date of birth. Suicide risk associated with AIDS/HIV infection was assessed using a conditional logistic regression model.
   Results: People with AIDS/HIV infection, especially those who died of suicide, mostly lived as single people, had low income, and were dwellers of the Capital area of Denmark (Copenhagen and Frederiksberg). While presence of other physical illness was common in these patients, 38.6% of suicide and 29.0% of control patients developed psychiatric illness after being diagnosed with AIDS or HIV infection. Meanwhile, AIDS/HIV infection constituted a significant risk factor for subsequent suicide (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 3.84; 95% confidence interval, 2.53-5.81); the risk was substantially higher for persons who were diagnosed for the first time recently, were treated as inpatients, had a recent hospital contact, or had multiple hospital contacts because of the illness. The increased suicide risk associated with AIDS/HIV infection was slightly stronger before the introduction in 1997 of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (adjusted IRR = 5.55; 95% CI, 3.07-10.06), but remained highly significant in the HAART era (adjusted IRR = 2.77; 95% CI, 155-4.94). Moreover, AIDS/HIV infection significantly interacted with psychiatric illness (P < .0001), and their comorbidity increased the risk of suicide substantially.
   Conclusions: Suicide risk is increased in individuals with AIDS/HIV infection, particularly those with a recent diagnosis, more intensive and frequent hospital care, or comorbid psychiatric illness.The findings call for improvement of clinical capacities to address psychosocial and existential needs in the treatment of patients with AIDS/HIV infection.

AB Given the continued paucity of research into suicide in lesbian and gay (LG) people, there is a need to investigate the characteristics of those LG suicides that are able to be identified. The aim of this article was to analyze pathways to suicide in lesbian and gay individuals by way of life charts. Data were gathered through of 24 psychological autopsy interviews with next-of-kin of an LG person who had died by suicide. The female (n = 5) and male (n = 19) cases in this study clustered into younger and older suicides. The defining feature of the younger suicides was lack of acceptance by family and, to a lesser extent, self, and that of the older suicides was romantic relationship conflict, although this was also common in younger suicides. There appears to have been, furthermore, an accumulation of risk factors, particularly in the period prior to death where these specific risk factors combined with other life stressors, such as work problems. Initiatives to reduce stigma around diversity in sexuality and to support families and young people through the coming out process as well as services designed to assist those experiencing problems in same-sex relationships, in particular, would appear to be the most relevant within the trajectories presented.

AB Aim To determine gender differences in suicidal behavior and investigate the factors associated with suicide attempts.
   Methods In the framework of the WHO/Euro Multicenter Study on Suicidal Behavior, 1,158 suicide attempts have been registered and analyzed retrospectively in Pecs center, Hungary. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were performed to compare the characteristics of male and female suicide attempters.
   Results A "typical" female suicide attempter could becharacterized as follows: retired or economically inactive (OR=2.38), widowed (OR= 6.55), divorced (OR= 1.64), or with depression in her personal history (OR= 1.27). Female attempters were mainly repeaters, using the method of self-poisoning, mostly with benzodiazepines. Among men, unemployment, living alone, never having been married, and problems with addiction were the main risk factors, while violent methods characterized the typical attempt In the cases of self-poisoning, men were more likely to take meprobamate or carbamazepine.
   Conclusion Significant differences were found in the risk factors for suicide attempts between men and women. Since suicide is a multi-causal phenomenon, its therapy and prevention should be complex and gender differences should be taken into consideration while building up our helping strategies.

   SEEKING
AB Five large epidemiologic mortality studies of women with cosmetic breast implants have consistently reported a two- to threefold higher rate of suicide compared with the general female population. Overall, 135 suicides have been observed, compared with 66.9 expected, yielding a significantly elevated standardized mortality ratio of 2.0 (95% CI, 1.5-2.6). In addition to suicides, excesses from other external causes of death related to drug and alcohol abuse/dependence, atypical motor vehicle accidents, and other self-harm causes have been consistently reported. These observations, together with limited but direct epidemiologic evidence of preimplant psychiatric hospitalization, as well as self-reports of preimplant psychiatric disorders, including depression, eating disorders, and body image dissatisfaction, among implant women raise the possibility of significant underlying psychiatric morbidity for a subgroup of implant patients. Research into the psychiatric profiles and history of the women who have committed suicide in the investigated cohorts appears warranted.

TI Combined effects of physical illness and comorbid psychiatric disorder

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY

DT Article
ID QUALITY-OF-LIFE; MEDICALLY ILL; HEALTH; DEPRESSION; REGISTER;
   SCHIZOPHRENIA; DISEASES; CANCER; COHORT; ADULTS
AB Background
   People with physical illness often have psychiatric disorder and this comorbidity may have a specific influence on their risk of suicide.
   Aims
   To examine how physical illness and psychiatric comorbidity interact to influence risk of suicide, with particular focus on relative timing of onset of the two types of illness.
   Method
   Based on the national population of Denmark, individual-level data were retrieved from five national registers on 27 262 suicide cases and 468 007 gender- and birth-date matched living controls. Data were analysed using conditional logistic regression.
   Results
   Both suicides and controls with physical illness more often had comorbid psychiatric disorder than their physically healthy counterparts. Although both physical and psychiatric illnesses constituted significant risk factors for suicide, their relative timing of onset in individuals with comorbidity significantly differentiated the associated risk of suicide. While suicide risk was highly elevated when onsets of both physical and psychiatric illness occurred close in time to each other, regardless which came first, psychiatric comorbidity developed some time after onset of physical illness exacerbated the risk of suicide substantially.
   Conclusions
   Suicide risk in physically ill people varies substantially by presence of psychiatric comorbidity, particularly the relative timing of onset of the two types of illness. Closer collaboration between general and mental health services should be an essential component of suicide prevention strategies.

AB Objective: The objective of the present study was to examine if the change in the suicide rate is associated with individuals' use of antidepressants as has been suggested by ecological studies.
   Design: Decomposition of suicide rates by antidepressant treatment group.
   Setting: Population-based record linkage.
   Participants: All individuals aged 50 years and older living in Denmark between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 2000 ( N = 2 100 808).
   Main outcome measures: Suicide rates are calculated according to current antidepressant treatment status ( no treatment, tricyclic antidepressants ( TCA), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRI), other antidepressants). The change in the suicide rate during 1996-2000 was decomposed by treatment group.
   Results: Only one in five older adults dying by suicide was in treatment at the time of death. Whereas the male suicide rate declined by 9.7 suicides per 100 000, recipients of antidepressants contributed to the decline by 0.9 suicides. Women redeeming antidepressant prescriptions accounted for 0.4 suicides of the observed reduction of 3.3 per 100 000. The average suicide rates for men receiving TCA and SSRI were 153.3 and 169.0 per 100 000 person-years, respectively. Among older women, both TCA and SSRI users had an average suicide rate of 68.8 per 100 000 over the period examined.
   Conclusions: Just a small proportion of older adults dying by suicide were found to be in treatment with antidepressants at the time of death. Individuals in active treatment with antidepressants seem to account for 10% of the decline in the suicide rate. Nevertheless, suicides might be prevented by more effective treatment.

AB Background/Aim. Recognition of suicide risk factors is important in taking adequate suicide preventive measures, Suicide Prevention Program for Professional Military Personnel (PMP) implemented in the Army of Serbia in 2003. The aim of our study was to establish suicide risk factors in PMP of the Army of Serbia. Methods. Analysis of suicide risk factors in PMP was carried out on the basis of data obtained by psychological suicide autopsy. The controls were demographically similar psychiatric outpatients with no history of suicidal behaviour. A descriptive statistics method was used for risk factors analysis. The t-test was used for testing statistical hypotheses. Results. A total of 30 PMP, aged 22-49 years (30.53 +/- 6.24 on average) committed suicide within the period 1998-2007. Distal suicide risk factors in PMP were considered to be not being married, psychiatric heredity, having no outpatient psychiatric treatment, gambling, regular physical practice (bodybuilding), less transfer to a different post, low motivation for military service (p < 0.001), not having children, parental loss in early childhood, alcohol abuse (P < 0.005), low salary (p < 0.01) uncompleted military school, debts in the family (p < 0.05). The commonest proximal suicide risk factors were: actual family problems (36.6%), actual mental problems (13.3%), burnout (13.3%), negative balance of accounts (13.3%), professional problems (6.7%), behavioral model while for 10.0% PMP suicide risk factors could not be established. Conclusion. According to the presence of multiple suicide risk factors, Suicide Prevention Program for PMP in the Army of Serbia is directed to the prevention of both proximal and distal suicide risk factors.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the relative risk of suicide attempt and suicide in users of hormonal contraception.
   Method: The authors assessed associations between hormonal contraceptive use and suicide attempt and suicide in a nationwide prospective cohort study of all women in Denmark who had no psychiatric diagnoses, antidepressant use, or hormonal contraceptive use before age 15 and who turned 15 during the study period, which extended from 1996 through 2013. Nationwide registers provided individually updated information about use of hormonal contraception, suicide attempt, suicide, and potential confounding variables. Psychiatric diagnoses or antidepressant use during the study period were considered potential mediators between hormonal contraceptive use and risk of suicide attempt. Adjusted hazard ratios for suicide attempt and suicide were estimated for users of hormonal contraception as compared with those who never used hormonal contraception.
   Results: Among nearly half a million women followed on average for 8.3 years (3.9 million person-years) with a mean age of 21 years, 6,999 first suicide attempts and 71 suicides were identified. Compared with women who never used hormonal contraceptives, the relative risk among current and recent users was 1.97 (95% CI= 1.85-2.10) for suicide attempt and 3.08 (95% CI= 1.34-7.08) for suicide. Risk estimates for suicide attempt were 1.91 (95% CI= 1.79-2.03) for oral combined products, 2.29 (95% CI= 1.77-2.95) for oral progestin-only products, 2.58 (95% CI= 2.06-3.22) for vaginal ring, and 3.28 (95% CI= 2.08-5.16) for patch. The association between hormonal contraceptive use and a first suicide attempt peaked after 2 months of use.
   Conclusions: Use of hormonal contraception was positively associated with subsequent suicide attempt and suicide. Adolescent women experienced the highest relative risk.

   MARRIAGE
AB Objective: Suicide risk was addressed in relation to the joint effect of factors regarding family structure, socioeconomics, demographics, mental illness, and family history of suicide and mental illness, as well as gender differences in risk factors.
   Method: Data were drawn from four national Danish longitudinal registers. Subjects were all 21,169 persons who committed suicide in 1981-1997 and 423,128 live comparison subjects matched for age, gender, and calendar time of suicide by using a nested case-control design. The effect of risk factors was estimated through conditional logistic regression. The interaction of gender with the risk factors was examined by using the log likelihood ratio test. The population attributable risk was calculated.
   Results: Of the risk factors examined in the study, a history of hospitalization for psychiatric disorder was associated with the highest odds ratio and the highest attributable risk for suicide. Cohabiting or single marital status, unemployment, low income, retirement, disability, sickness-related absence from work, and a family history of suicide and/or psychiatric disorders were also significant risk factors for suicide. Moreover, these factors had different effects in male and female subjects. A psychiatric disorder was more likely to increase suicide risk in female than in male subjects. Being single was associated with higher suicide risk in male subjects, and having a young child with lower suicide risk in female subjects. Unemployment and low income had stronger effects on suicide in male subjects. Living in an urban area was associated with higher suicide risk in female subjects and a lower risk in male subjects. A family history of suicide raised suicide risk slightly more in female than in male subjects.
   Conclusions: Suicide risk is strongly associated with mental illness, unemployment, low income, marital status, and family history of suicide. The effect of most risk factors differs significantly by gender.

SO LANCET PSYCHIATRY

AB Background Suicidal ideation due to abortion has been used to justify restrictive US abortion policies. Much research examining abortion and mental health has relied on self-report, has had low participation rates, and did not consider confounding factors. In the present study, we used data that do not rely on self-report and are not affected by low participation rates to examine the association between abortion and non-fatal suicide attempts, adjusting for confounding factors.
   Methods In this longitudinal cohort study of Danish population registries, we linked data on a cohort of women born in Denmark between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 30, 1998, who did not die or emigrate from Denmark before their 18th birthday or before study entry. Follow-up started on the woman's 18th birthday or Jan 1, 2000, whichever came last. Follow-up ended at the date of first suicide attempt, date of emigration from Denmark, date of death, or Dec 31, 2016, whichever came first. Women were between the ages of 18 and 36 years during the study period. We used a survival analysis to examine the risk of first suicide attempts or self-harm associated with a first abortion compared with no abortion, in the complete study cohort. To examine incidence rate ratios (IRRs) associated with abortion, we used Poisson regression with the logarithm of woman-years at risk as an offset We also examined whether the risk of suicide attempts changed before and after the abortion, adjusting for age, calendar year, socioeconomic status, and history of childbirth, mental health, parental mental health, and physical health.
   Findings Data on 523 280 women were included in this study. Of these, 48 990 (9.4%) women had a record of at least one first-trimester abortion, and 10 216 (2.0%) had a suicide attempt during the study period. Among 48 990 women who had an abortion, 1402 (2.9%) had a first suicide attempt after the first abortion. In our fully-adjusted model which adjusted for all covariates, the risk of first-time non-fatal suicide attempts was similar in the year before an abortion (IRR 2.46 [95% CI 2. 22-2. 72]) and the year after an abortion (IRR 2.54 [2.29-2.81], p=0.509) compared with women who had not had an abortion, and decreased with increasing time since the abortion (1-5 years IRR 1.90 [1.75-2.06]; >= 5 years IRR 1.73 [1.53-1.96]).
   Interpretation We found that women who had abortions had a higher risk of non-fatal suicide attempts compared with women who did not have an abortion. However, because the increased risk was the same both the year before and after the abortion, it is not attributable to the abortion. Thus, policies based on the notion that abortion increases women's risk of suicide attempts are misinformed. Copyright (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The relative importance of socio-economic factors on risk for suicide in the immigrant population may differ from that for the native population; however, few studies have addressed this issue on a national basis. With a nested case-control design and data from Norwegian population registers we identified 11,409 suicide cases in the years 1992-2012 and 191,785 sex-birthdate-matched controls. The influence of socio-economic factors on the risk for completed suicide was assessed through conditional logistic regression. Among 11,409 suicides, 1139 (10%) were individuals with an immigration background of either themselves or their parent(s). Suicide cases, as well as the controls, with an immigration background differed in several aspects of their socio-economic status from those without such a background. Being single or separated, divorced or widowed, was, however, associated with an increased risk of suicide regardless to the subjects' immigration background. Low level of education and low annual income significantly increased the risk for suicide in almost all the study subgroups. Living in the capital area was associated with a reduced risk of suicide in first-generation immigrants but an increased risk in native Norwegians. In conclusion, persons with an immigration background, as well as native Norwegians, shared most common risk factors for suicide, but the strength of associations between socio-economic factors and risk for suicide can differ by immigration background.

AB Suicide is a serious public health problem, with more than 800,000 deaths taking place worldwide each year. Mental disorders are associated with increased risk of suicide. In schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, the lifetime risk of suicide death is estimated to be 5.6%. The risk is particularly high during the first year of the initial contact with mental health services, being almost twice as high as in the later course of the illness. The most consistently reported risk factor for suicide among people with psychotic disorders is a history of attempted suicide and depression. Suicide risk in psychosis in Denmark decreased over time, most likely because of improved quality of inpatient and outpatient services. There is a high proportion of young people with first-episode psychosis who attempted suicide before their first contact with mental health services. This finding suggests that the mortality rates associated with psychotic disorders may be underreported because of suicide deaths taking place before first treatment contact. However, currently, no data exist to confirm or refute this hypothesis. Attempted suicide can be an early warning sign of later psychotic disorder. Data from different studies indicate that the risk of suicide attempt during the first year of treatment is as high as 10%. The most important risk factors for attempted suicide after the first contact are young age, female sex, suicidal plans, and a history of suicide attempt. Early intervention services are helpful in first-episode psychosis, and staff members should, in collaboration with the patients, monitor the risk of suicide and develop and revise crisis plans.

AB Objective. - Patients with affective disorders are at high risk of suicide, especially during inpatient treatment and during the first year after discharge. Methods. - A blinded case-control design was used. The study included a total national sample of patients with affective disorder admitted during the period from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1995, who died because of suicide, either during admission or shortly after discharge.
   Results. - A history of suicide attempt was a significant risk factor (IRR 4.9; 95% CI 2.1-11.6). Loss of job during the year prior to the index admission was associated with an increase in suicide risk (IRR: 2.9; 95% CI 1.2-7.5). Clinical improvement during the index admission (IRR: 0.3; 95% CI 0.1-0.7), and treatment with antidepressant drugs at the censoring date (IRR: 0.3; 95% CI 0.1-0.7) were associated with a decrease in suicide risk.
   Conclusion. - Improved treatment may be a key factor in suicide prevention in patients during, and shortly after hospitalisation with affective disorders. Also, there is a need to be especially aware of suicide risk in patients with little or no improvement at discharge. (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB During the past decades, extensive reformatory changes in institutional psychiatric care have been implemented in Norway.
   The objective of the present study was to investigate whether these changes have resulted in shortened length of psychiatric hospital stays for suicide attempters. Further, to examine if length of hospital stay and time period in which the patients received treatment were related to the risk of a repeated suicide attempt and/or committing suicide.
   All cases of suicide attempters hospitalised between 1984 and 2006 in the municipality of B'rum, a suburb outside Oslo, were examined. The period of observation was further subdivided in two time intervals on the basis of the de-institutionalisation of psychiatric care, which started to plateau in 1996.
   Among 1,574 patients consecutively admitted to the local general hospital after a suicide attempt, 330 were admitted to inpatient psychiatric care. Patients admitted in the period 1996-2006 had significantly shorter hospital stays than patients in the preceding period 1984-1995 (Log Rank P < 0.001). Neither the time period of treatment variable nor the length of hospital stay variable was significantly associated with the risk of a repeated suicide attempt or suicide.
   Psychiatric de-institutionalisation appears as not having affected suicide attempt repetition. It is possible that reduced length of hospital stay has been compensated by improved mental health care in general and extended outpatient services in particular.

DT Article
ID FOLLOW-UP; JOB LOSS; MORTALITY; RISK; DURATION; DENMARK; TRENDS
AB Objectives. We tested 2 hypotheses found in studies of the relationship between suicide and unemployment: causal (stress and adversity) and selective interpretation (previous poor health).
   Methods. We estimated Cox models for adults (n = 3 424 550) born between 1931 and 1965. We examined mortality during the recession (1993-1996), postrecession (1997-2002), and a combined follow-up. Models controlled for previous medical problems, and social, family, and employer characteristics.
   Results. During the recession there was no excess hazard of mortality from suicide or events of undetermined intent. Postrecession, there was an excess hazard of suicide mortality for unemployed men but not unemployed women. However, for unemployed women with no health-problem history there was a modest hazard of suicide. Finally, there was elevated mortality from events of undetermined intent for unemployed men and women postrecession.
   Conclusions. A small part of the relationship may be related to health selection, more so during the recession. However, postrecessionary period findings suggest that much of the association could be causal. A narrow focus on suicide mortality may understate the mortality effects of unemployment in Sweden.

AB Objectives: Chronic and acute alcohol use are highly associated risk factors for suicides worldwide. Therefore, we examined suicide cases with and without alcohol use disorder (AUD) using data from the SNSF project "Suicide in Switzerland: A detailed national survey". Our investigations focus on correlations between acute and chronic alcohol use with reference to suicide and potential interactions with the methods of suicide.
   Methods: We used data from the SNSF project in which all cases of registered completed suicide in Switzerland reported to any of the seven Swiss institutes of legal and forensic medicine between 2000 and 2010 were collected. We extracted cases that were tested for blood alcohol to use in our analysis. We compared clinical characteristics, blood alcohol concentrations, and methods of suicide in cases with and without AUD.
   Results: Out of 6497 cases, 2946 subjects were tested for acute alcohol use and included in our analysis. Of the latter, 366 (12.4%) persons had a medical history of AUD. Subjects with AUD significantly had higher blood alcohol concentrations and were more often in medical treatment before suicide. Drug intoxication as method of suicide was more frequent in cases with AUD compared to NAUD.
   Conclusion: Overall, we found a high incidence of acute alcohol use at the time of death in chronic alcohol misusers (AUD). The five methods of suicide most commonly used in Switzerland differed considerably between individuals with and without AUD. Blood alcohol concentrations varied across different methods of suicide independently from the medical history in both groups.

AB Background: Safety plans have been suggested as an intervention for people at risk of suicide. Given the impulsive character of suicidal ideation, a safety plan in the format of a mobile phone application is likely to be more available and useful than traditional paper versions. Aims: The study describes MYPLAN, a mobile phone application designed to support people at risk of suicide by letting them create a safety plan. Method: MYPLAN was developed in collaboration with clinical psychiatric staff at Danish suicide preventive clinics. The mobile application lets the user create an individualized safety plan by filling in templates with strategies, actions, and direct links to contact persons. Results: MYPLAN was developed in 2013 and is freely available in Denmark and Norway. It is designed for iPhone and android platforms. As of December 2015, the application has been downloaded almost 8,000 times. Users at risk of suicide as well as clinical staff have provided positive feedback on the mobile application. Conclusion: Support via mobile phone applications might be particularly useful for younger age groups at risk of suicide as well as in areas or countries where support options are lacking. Yet, it is important to examine the effectiveness of this type of intervention.

TI Acute stress reaction and completed suicide
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Suicide; case-control studies; stress disorders; traumatic; acute
AB Background Acute stress reaction is a diagnosis given immediately following the experience of an exceptional mental or physical stressor. To the best of our knowledge, no study has examined the association between acute stress reaction diagnosis and suicide. The current study examined this association in a population-based sample. In addition, we examined comorbid psychiatric diagnoses as modifiers of this association.
   Methods Data for the current study were obtained from the nationwide Danish health and administrative registries, which include data for all 5.4 million residents of Denmark. All suicides between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 2006 were included and controls were selected from a sample of all Danish residents. Using this nested case-control design, we examined 9612 suicide cases and 199 306 controls matched to cases with respect to gender, date of birth and time.
   Results In total, 95 cases (0.99%) and 165 controls (0.08%) had a diagnosis of acute stress reaction. Those diagnosed with acute stress reaction had 10 times the rate of completed suicide compared with those without this diagnosis, adjusting for the control to case matching, depression and marital status (95% confidence interval 7.7-14). Additionally, persons with acute stress reaction and depression, or acute stress reaction and substance abuse, had a greater rate of suicide than expected based on their independent effects.
   Conclusions Acute stress reaction is a risk factor for completed suicide.

AB Background: The risk of suicide is increased among people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, most of the evidence regarding this association comes from studies of all-cause mortality, with small numbers of people who have committed suicide, or from clinical case reports. The current study examined the association between the two forms of IBD: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and completed suicide in a population-based sample.
   Methods: Data for this nested case control study were obtained from the Danish national healthcare and social registries. We included 27,053 cases who completed suicide between January 1, 1981, and December 31, 2006. Controls were selected from the general population and matched to cases on gender, date of birth, and calendar time (n = 551,060).
   Results: There was an increased rate of suicide among participants with both CD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1, 2.3) and UC (OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.4, 2.4), when adjusting for the matched factors and identified confounders.
   Conclusions: The current study suggests that physicians treating IBD patients should be vigilant about expressions of suicidal ideation or signs and symptoms of self-harm.

   SEASONALITY; ASSOCIATION; SUNSHINE; VICTIMS; QUALITY; SLEEP
AB Objectives: Since the well-observed spring peak of suicide incidents coincides with the peak of seasonal aeroallergens as tree-pollen, we want to document an association between suicide and pollen exposure with empirical data from Denmark.
   Design: Ecological time series study.
   Setting: Data on suicide incidents, air pollen counts and meteorological status were retrieved from Danish registries.
   Participants: 13 700 suicide incidents over 1304 consecutive weeks were obtained from two large areas covering 2.86 million residents.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures: Risk of suicide associated with pollen concentration was assessed using a time series Poisson-generalised additive model.
   Results: We noted a significant association between suicide risk and air pollen counts. A change of pollen counts levels from 0 to '10-<30' grains/m(3) air was associated with a relative risk of 1.064, that is, a 6.4% increase in weekly number of suicides in the population, and from 0 to '30-100' grains, a relative risk of 1.132. The observed association remained significant after controlling for effects of region, calendar time, temperature, cloud cover and humidity. Meanwhile, we observed a significant sex difference that suicide risk in men started to rise when there was a small increase of air pollen, while the risk in women started to rise until pollen grains reached a certain level. High levels of pollen had slightly stronger effect on risk of suicide in individuals with mood disorder than those without the disorder.
   Conclusions: The observed association between suicide risk and air pollen counts supports the hypothesis that aeroallergens, acting as immune triggers, may precipitate suicide.

ID SUICIDE RATES; STATISTICS; AUTOPSY; CLASSIFICATION; IRELAND
AB Background: National mortality statistics should be comparable between countries that use the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases. Distinguishing between manners of death, especially suicides and accidents, is a challenge. Knowledge about accidents is important in prevention of both accidents and suicides. The aim of the present study was to assess the reliability of classifying deaths as accidents and undetermined manner of deaths in the three Scandinavian countries and to compare cross-national differences.
   Methods: The cause of death registers in Norway, Sweden and Denmark provided data from 2008 for samples of 600 deaths from each country, of which 200 were registered as suicides, 200 as accidents or undetermined manner of deaths and 200 as natural deaths. The information given to the eight experts was identical to the information used by the Cause of Death Register. This included death certificates, and if available external post-mortem examinations, forensic autopsy reports and police reports.
   Results: In total, 69 % (Sweden and Norway) and 78 % (Denmark) of deaths registered in the official mortality statistics as accidents were confirmed by the experts. In the majority of the cases where disagreement was seen, the experts reclassified accidents to undetermined manner of death, in 26, 25 and 19 % of cases, respectively. Few cases were reclassified as suicides or natural deaths. Among the extracted accidents, the experts agreed least with the official mortality statistics concerning drowning and poisoning accidents. They also reported most uncertainty in these categories of accidents. In a second re-evaluation, where more information was made available, the Norwegian psychiatrist and forensic pathologist increased their agreement with the official mortality statistics from 76 to 87 %, and from 85 to 88 %, respectively, regarding the Norwegian and Swedish datasets. Among the extracted undetermined deaths in the Swedish dataset, the two experts reclassified 22 and 51 %, respectively, to accidents.
   Conclusion: There was moderate agreement in reclassification of accidents between the official mortality statistics and the experts. In the majority of cases where there was disagreement, accidents were reclassified as undetermined manner of death, and only a small proportion as suicides.

   Aims To describe the pattern of mortality in patients with affective disorder and to study changes in suicide risk during the study period.
   Method All patients (n=54103) admitted for the first time to a psychiatric hospital in Denmark du ring the period 1973-1993 because of affective disorder were included in this study The mortality rate was compared with that of the general population.
   Results Mortality from natural and unnatural causes was elevated in all subgroups of affective disorder. The risk of suicide among patients ill for one year or less after first admission increased during the period 1973-1993.
   Conclusions More attention should be paid to the risk of suicide and to physical illness in patients with affective disorders.

AB Compared to the general population, the suicide risk among Danish cancer patients diagnosed in 1971-1986 was increased by 50% for men and 30% for women. We updated the earlier study to evaluate both long-term and recent trends in the suicide risk. Cancer patients with a first cancer diagnosed between 1971 and 1999 in Denmark were followed-up for completed suicide through 1999. Excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer, 564 508 cancer patients were included and 1241 suicides observed. Both the standardised mortality ratio (SMR) of suicide relative to the general population and the suicide rates were analysed with Poisson regression methods. The overall SMR was increased to 1.7 (95% CI. 1.6-1.9) for men and 1.4 (95% CI: 1.3-1.5) for women. Following the cancer diagnosis, the suicide risk was highest in the first 3 months for men and between months 3 and 12 for women. The risk was higher for nonlocalised cancer and for cancers with perceived poor prognosis. Breast cancer patients had a higher risk than other cancer patients with similar good prognosis. The suicide rates among cancer patients decreased with calendar time, but less so than the rates in the general population. The suicide risk among cancer patients has not decreased as much as in the Danish population and reasons for this should be explored. Breast cancer might be believed by patients to be more life threatening than it is. Assessment and treatment of depression could improve the quality of life for cancer patients who suffer from unrecognised depressions and in turn reduce the risk of suicide in cancer patients.

AB Background. - In the 1980s, suicide rates in Denmark were among the highest in the world. In 1992, a Suicide Prevention Centre was opened in Copenhagen with a 2-week programme of social and psychological treatment. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of the Suicide Prevention Centre.
   Methods. - In a quasi-experimental study, 362 patients in the Suicide Prevention Centre and a parallel comparison group of 39 patients were interviewed with European Parasuicide Study Interviewer Schedule I (EPSIS I), which is a comprehensive interview including several validated scales. All patients were invited to follow-up interviews with EPSIS II and followed in the National Patients Register and the Cause of Death Register.
   Results. - At the 1-year follow-up, 59% of patients in the intervention group and 53% of patients in the comparison groups were interviewed with EPSIS II. The intervention group obtained a significantly greater improvement in Beck's Depression Inventory, Hopelessness Scale, Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale and CAGE-score and a significantly lower repetition rate.
   Discussion. - Although the design cannot exclude selection bias, it seems likely that the improvement in the intervention group was facilitated by the treatment. (c) 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Background There is evidence of parental risk factors for suicidal behaviour in offspring, but research on variations in their effects with offspring's age at first exposure is sparse.
   Aims To explore the effects of age at exposure to parental mortality and markers of morbidity on the risks of suicide and attempted suicide in offspring.
   Methods This was a case-control study effected through record linkage between Swedish registers. Individuals born 1973-83 who committed suicide (n=1407) or were hospitalised due to an attempted suicide (n=17 159) were matched to <= 10 controls by sex, month and county of birth. ORs were measured in time windows representing age at first exposure.
   Results A general pattern of increasing risks of suicide and attempted suicide in offspring with decreasing age at exposure to parental risk factors emerged. Adjusted suicide risk (OR (95% CI)) was most pronounced in the youngest exposure window for parental psychiatric disability pension (3.1 (1.6 to 5.8)), somatic disability pension (1.9 (1.0 to 3.4)), psychiatric inpatient care (2.5 (2.0 to 3.1)), parental attempted suicide (2.9 (2.0 to 4.1)) and suicide (2.9 (1.7 to 5.2)). For parental non-suicidal deaths, the general pattern was the opposite. Patterns in offspring attempted suicide were similar to completed suicide for parental disability pension, psychiatric inpatient care and non-suicidal death. Attempted suicide risk after parental suicide showed an increasing trend with increasing age at exposure.
   Conclusion Parental morbidity and parental suicidal behaviour show the most detrimental effects on completed suicide among offspring when they appear early in life. Early interventions in families at risk are necessary to prevent suicide in offspring.

AB Objectives: This study investigated the association between continued mood-stabilizing treatment (lithium and anticonvulsants) in bipolar disorder (BD) and the risk of suicide.
   Methods: Using linkage of national registers, the association between continued mood-stabilizing treatment and suicide was investigated among all patients discharged nationwide from hospital psychiatry as an in- or outpatient in a period from 1995 to 2000 in Denmark with a diagnosis of BD.
   Results: A total of 5,926 patients were included in the study and among these 51 patients committed suicide eventually during the study period. Although the rate of suicide was higher during periods when patients purchased anticonvulsants (293 suicides per 100,000 person-years) than during periods with lithium (136 suicides per 100,000 person-years), the suicide rate decreased with the number of prescriptions in a rather similar way for patients first treated with lithium and patients first treated with anticonvulsants: patients who continued treatment with mood-stabilizing drugs had a decreased rate of suicide compared to patients who purchased mood stabilizers once only [rate ratio for anticonvulsants = 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.19-0.41; rate ratio for lithium = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.10-0.38]. Further, the rate of suicide decreased consistently with the number of additional prescriptions. Switch to or augmentation with lithium to patients initiated on anticonvulsants was associated with a significantly reduced rate of suicide (rate ratio = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.20-0.40), whereas a switch to or augmentation with anticonvulsants to patients first started on lithium showed no additional effect on the suicide rate.
   Conclusions: Although continued treatment with anticonvulsants and continued treatment with lithium was associated with a rather similar reduction in the rate of suicide, the results suggest that treatment with lithium may have some superiority in relation to prevention of suicide.

AB Background: while mortality among the oldest old has improved over recent decades, these improvements are not reflected in the suicide mortality of this age group. We do not know the reasons why the suicide mortality is still very high among the oldest old.
   Objective: the aim is to analyse the impact that loss of a partner has on the suicide risks of the oldest old (80+) compared to younger age groups.
   Subjects: the entire Danish population aged 50 during 1994-1998 (n = 1,978,527).
   Methods: we applied survival analysis to calculate the changes in relative risk of suicide after a loss by using individual-level data.
   Results: the majority of older persons who commit suicide are widowed, although only a relatively small proportion of the oldest old who commit suicide have experienced a recent loss of partner (men: 18%, women: 6%). In absolute terms, the oldest old men experience the highest increase in suicide risk immediately after the loss (15-fold; 95% CI 10.2-23.6) compared to middle-aged men who are still married. Oldest old men seem to suffer more from the loss and need longer time to recover than women.
   Conclusions: although a small proportion of oldest old who commit suicide have experienced a recent bereavement, there is a significant increase in the suicide risk during the first year after a bereavement, especially for men. However, the increased risk of suicide in the oldest old men may only in part be explained by the loss of a partner.

ID STATISTICS; RATES; AUTOPSIES; IRELAND; MANNER; US
AB Objective: Valid mortality statistics are important for healthcare planning and research. Suicides and accidents often present a challenge in the classification of the manner of death. The aim of this study was to analyse the reliability of the national suicide statistics by comparing the classification of suicide in the Scandinavian cause of death registers with a reclassification by 8 persons with different medical expertise (psychiatry, forensic pathology and public health) from each of the 3 Scandinavian countries.
   Methods: The cause of death registers in Norway, Sweden and Denmark retrieved available information on a sample of 600 deaths in 2008 from each country. 200 were classified in the registers as suicides, 200 as accidents or undetermined and 200 as natural deaths. The reclassification comprised an assessment of the manner and cause of death as well as the level of certainty.
   Results: In total, 81%, 88% and 90% of deaths registered as suicide in the official mortality statistics were confirmed by experts using the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish data sets, respectively. About 3% of deaths classified as accidents or natural deaths in the cause of death registers were reclassified as suicides. However, after a second reclassification based on additional information, 9% of the natural deaths and accidents were reclassified as suicides in the Norwegian data set, and 21% of the undetermined deaths were reclassified as suicides in the Swedish data set. In total, the levels of certainty of the experts were 87% of suicides in the Norwegian data set, 77% in the Swedish data set and 92% in Danish data set; the uncertainty was highest in poisoning suicides.
   Conclusions: A high percentage of reported suicides were confirmed as being suicides. Few accidents and natural deaths were reclassified as suicides. Hence, reclassification did not increase the overall official suicide statistics of the 3 Scandinavian countries.

AB To study the association between loss of an adult sibling due to suicide and mortality from various causes up to 18 years after bereavement.
   We conducted a follow-up study between 1981 and 2002, based on register data representing the total population of Swedes aged 25-64 years (n = 1,748,069).
   An elevated mortality rate from all causes was found among men (RR 1.26; 95 % CI: 1.14-1.40) and women (1.27; 1.11-1.45) who had experienced a sibling's suicide. The standardized rate ratio of suicide of bereaved to non-bereaved persons was 2.46 (1.86-3.24) among men and 3.25 (2.28-4.65) among women. We also found some indications of an interrelation between sibling suicide and subsequent deaths from external causes other than suicide in men (1.77; 1.34-2.34) and deaths from cardiovascular disease in women (1.37; 0.99-1.91). An elevated all-cause mortality rate was found after the first year of bereavement in men, while bereaved women experienced higher mortality rates during the first 2 years and after 5 years of bereavement.
   Our study provides support for adverse health effects among survivors associated with sibling loss due to suicide. Sibling suicides were primarily associated with suicide in bereaved survivors, although there was an increased mortality rate from discordant causes, which strengthens the possibility that the observed associations might not be entirely due to shared genetic causes.

AB Objective: The aims were first, to describe deaths in a cohort of homeless people compared to the general population and secondly, to compare deaths among the individuals with schizophrenia to those without schizophrenia.
   Method: Mortality was assessed in a cohort of 708 homeless subjects, 506 with schizophrenia who were referred 10 years previously to psychiatric outreach clinics. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated.
   Results: Eighty-three people (12%) had died, 19 from suicide. The SMR was 3.76 for homeless men and 3.14 for homeless women. There was a non-significant trend for higher excess mortality among men without schizophrenia compared to men with schizophrenia. SMRs for suicide were significantly elevated among homeless men.
   Conclusion: Homeless people in inner Sydney have death rates three to four times higher than people in the general population of New South Wales. Excess mortality was greatest for younger age groups.

AB Introduction: Strong evidence demonstrates a genetic susceptibility to suicidal behaviour and a relationship between suicide and mental disorders. The aim of this study was to test for association between suicide and five selected genetic variants, which had shown association with suicide in other populations.
   Method: We performed a nationwide case-control study on all suicide cases sent for autopsy in Denmark between the years 2000 and 2007. The study comprised 572 cases and 1049 controls and is one of the largest genetic studies in completed suicide to date. The analysed markers were located within the Serotonin Transporter (SLC6A4), Monoamine Oxidase-A (MAOA) and the Ttyptophan Hydroxylase I and II (TPH1 and TPH2) genes.
   Results: None of the genetic markers within SLC6A4, MAOA, TPH1 and TPH2 were significantly associated with completed suicide or suicide method in the basic association tests. Exploratory interaction test showed that the minor allele of rs1800532 in TPH1 has a protective effect for males younger than 35 years and females older than 50 years, whereas for the oldest male subjects, it tended to be a risk factor. We also observed a significant interaction between age-group and the 5-HTTLPR genotype (with and without rs25531) in SLC6A4. The long allele or high expression allele tends to have a protective effect in the middle age-group.
   Limitation: We only analysed a limited number of genetic variants.
   Conclusion: None of the analysed variants are strong risk factors. To reveal a better understanding of the genes involved in suicide, we suggest future studies should include both genetic and non-genetic factors. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Persons who are treated at hospital after attempted suicide comprise a high-risk group for suicide. The proposal for a National Programme for Prevention of Suicide and Suicide Attempt in Denmark recommends that all persons who attempt suicide should be offered treatment and that treatment should be implemented, using a supportive and guiding principle. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether patients receive psychiatric evaluation after a suicide attempt, and whether they receive the psychiatric treatment to which they are referred. In the Copenhagen Hospital Corporation in four emergency rooms and six intensive care units, we investigated all referrals in the period 1 February 2001 to 1 May 2001 with Contact Code 4 (self-harm) and selected diagnostic codes likely to be used in cases of self-poisoning, strangulation, drowning and wrist-cutting. We found that only 37% of the contacts to the emergency room were correctly coded with Reason for Contact Code 4 in Nomesco's classification of external causes of injuries. A psychiatric evaluation was planned for almost all patients, but 18% of the patients never reached the evaluation that had been planned to take place in a psychiatric emergency. Only few patients were not referred to any treatment at all, but among the patients referred to psychiatric treatment, only those admitted involuntarily received treatment in 100% of the planned cases. For outpatient treatment in the suicide prevention clinic, the percentage that attended planned treatment within the first week after the suicide attempt was especially low (57%). It is recommended that the quality of Reason for Contact Coding be improved, that patients who have attempted suicide be approached assertively, and that the supportive and guiding principle be used in securing them treatment.

   IMPACT
AB Background: Mental disorders are strongly associated with excess suicide risk, and successful treatment might prevent suicide. Since 1990, and particularly after 1998, there has been a substantial increase in mental health service resources in Norway. This study aimed to investigate whether these changes have had an impact on suicide mortality.
   Methods: We used Poisson regression analyses to assess the effect of changes in five mental health services variables on suicide mortality in five Norwegian health regions during the period 1990-2006. These variables included: number of man-labour years by all personnel, number of discharges, number of outpatient consultations, number of inpatient days, and number of hospital beds. Adjustments were made for sales of alcohol, sales of antidepressants, education, and unemployment.
   Results: In the period 1990-2006, we observed a total of 9480 suicides and the total suicide rate declined by 26%. None of the mental health services variables were significantly associated with female or male suicide mortality in the adjusted analyses (p > 0.05). Sales of antidepressants (adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.97-1.00) and sales of alcohol (adjusted IRR = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.18-1.72) were significantly associated with female suicide mortality; education (adjusted IRR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.79-0.94) and unemployment (adjusted IRR = 0.91; 95% CI = 0.85-0.97) were significantly associated with male suicide mortality.
   Conclusions: The adjusted analyses in the present study indicate that increased resources in Norwegian mental health services in the period 1990-2006 were statistically unrelated to suicide mortality.

AB Background: In Denmark, it is a political goal that 95% of all young people should complete an upper secondary education. For some young people, this goal can be difficult to achieve. An association has been established between suicidal behaviour and school performance.
   Aim: We hypothesise that young people who have attempted suicide have a lower chance of finishing secondary education.
   Methods: We used Danish historical population registers to perform a longitudinal cohort design and extended Cox regression modelling to estimate crude and adjusted estimates of the effect of suicide attempt on secondary education. We used the birth cohorts 1983-1989, and all subjects were followed from birth until the end of 2011 (n=355,725).
   Results: For suicide attempters, the likelihood of completing secondary education was one-third of non-attempters (crude hazard ratio=0.38). A part of the impact can be explained by confounding factors. Individuals with a suicide attempt at age 16-20years or with multiple suicide attempts were most likely not to complete secondary education. Compared to mentally ill non-attempters, suicide attempters with mental illness were more likely not to finish secondary education.
   Conclusion: A suicide attempt is not necessarily causal for not finishing secondary education, but it is a marker, and it predicts an increased likelihood of not finishing secondary education. We need to identify individuals at risk for suicide attempts and subsequently provide the necessary support. Completing secondary education is important, as it provides better chances of employment, higher wages and more opportunities for individuals in the future.

ID REGISTER; DENMARK; REGISTRATION; BEHAVIOR; ILLNESS; COHORT
AB Background. There is a lack of specific knowledge about the dose-response effect of multiple parental risk factors for suicide attempts among children and adolescents. The aim of this study was to determine the dose-response effect of multiple parental risk factors on an offspring's risk for suicide attempt.
   Method. We designed a population-based two-generation nested case-control study and used Danish register data. A population of 403 431 individuals born between 1983 and 1989 was sampled. Among these, 3465 (0.8%) were registered as having had a suicide attempt. Twenty controls were matched to each case and a link to the offspring's biological parents was established.
   Results. There was a dose-response relationship between the number of exposures and the risk of suicide attempts, with the increased risk seeming to be a multiplicative effect. Parental suicide, suicide attempt, psychiatric illness and low level of income were all significant independent risk factors for offspring's suicide attempts.
   Conclusions. Knowledge of the effect of multiple risk factors on the likelihood of suicide attempts in children and adolescents is important for risk assessment. Dose-response effects of multiple parental risk factors are multiplicative, but it is rare for children and adolescents to be exposed to multiple parental risk factors simultaneously. Nevertheless, they should be considered along with the offspring's own multiple risk factors in determining the overall risk of a suicide attempt. Further research incorporating both parental and offspring's risk factors is indicated to determine the overall dose-response effect of multiple risk factors.

   WOMEN
AB Background: Although some studies suggest that parenthood is associated with a reduced suicide risk, the impact of children on parental suicide has rarely been documented.
   Methods: This study investigates the impact of parental status on the risk of completed suicide in the context of other risk factors. A nested case-control design is used, matching for age, sex, and calendar time. The study is based on 4 Danish longitudinal registers, including 18 611 suicides of individuals aged 18 to 75 years from January 1, 1981, to December 31, 1997, and 372 220 matched control subjects., Information about children and subject's individual background is retrieved and merged. Data are analyzed using conditional logistic regression, yielding odds ratios interpreted as incidence rate ratios.
   Results: The presence of children is protective against suicide in parents in terms of-having children and, to a higher degree, having a young child; these effects exist even when adjusted for marital, socioeconomic, and psychiatric status; and their influences are much stronger in women than in men. At the same time, parents of children with a hospitalized psychiatric disorder and parents of children who have died are at an increased risk for suicide. A child dying during early childhood has a. strong effect on suicide in parents, and a suicidal death of a child increases the risk of parental suicide more than a nonsuicidal death. The suicide risk is particularly high in the first month after losing a child.
   Conclusions: The impact of children on parental suicide can be protective because of having children. It can also be negative, for example, when losing a child, particularly if the child dies during early childhood; the risk is particularly high during the first month after the loss.

AB Our aim was to characterize the incidence rates and cumulative incidence of anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS), and examine associations among eating disorder diagnoses, suicide attempts, and mortality. Individuals born in Denmark between 1989 and 2006 were included (N = 966,141, 51.3% male). Eating disorders diagnoses (AN, broad AN, BN, EDNOS) were drawn from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register (PCRR) and Danish National Patient Register (NPR). Suicide attempts and deaths were captured in the NPR, the PCRR, and the Danish Civil Registration System (CRS). In females, AN had a peak hazard at approximately age 15 years, BN at 22 years, and EDNOS had an extended peak that spanned 18 years-22 years. Eating disorder diagnoses predicted a significantly higher hazard for death and suicide attempt compared with the referent of individuals with no eating disorders. In males, peak hazard for diagnosis was earlier than in females. The present study represents one of the largest and longest studies of eating disorder incidence and suicide attempts and death in both females and males. Eating disorders are accompanied by increased hazard of suicide attempts and death even in young adults. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: There is abundant empirical evidence of a surplus risk of suicide among the unemployed, although few studies have investigated the influence of economic downturns on suicidal behaviours in an employment status-stratified sample.
   Aims: We investigated how economic inflation affected suicidal behaviours according to employment status in Italy from 2001 to 2008.
   Methods: Data concerning economically active people were provided by the Italian Institute for Statistical Analysis and by the International Monetary Fund. The association between inflation and completed versus attempted suicide with respect to employment status was investigated in every year and quarter-year of the study time frame. We considered three occupational categories: employed, unemployed who were previously employed and unemployed who had never worked.
   Results: The unemployed are at higher suicide risk than the employed. Among the PE, a significant association between inflation and suicide attempt was found, whereas no association was reported concerning completed suicides. No association was found between completed and attempted suicides among the employed, the NE and inflation. Completed suicide in females is significantly associated with unemployment in every quarter-year.
   Conclusion: The reported vulnerability to suicidal behaviours among the PE as inflation rises underlines the need of effective support strategies for both genders in times of economic downturns.

   Israel
AB Suicide has been honoured and respected in the Eastern culture, especially in Japan, with the famous tradition of Hara-kiri, or seppuku, while in most western societies suicide has been seen negatively. Many contemporary physicians tend to consider suicide the most self-destructive and evil thing a human being can do and something that should be avoided at all cost. Religions also have different viewpoints on suicide, but from a philosophical point of view we believe that considering the choice of life and death to be extremely relevant for a good living. The choice of life and dead is real, since responsibility for life is necessary in order to live life. Even the best physician cannot keep a patient alive who deep inside wants to die. In this chapter, we present parts of a story of a young girl who had experienced childhood sexual abuse. In holistic existential therapy, it is our experience that when the patient is well supported in the confrontation of the fundamental questions related to assuming responsibility for the coherence, that this confrontation will then almost always lead to a big YES to life. Without confronting the fundamental question of "to be or not to be", life can never be chosen 100% and thus never be lived fully.

AB Aim: This study explored the relationships between suicidal adolescents and their parents, siblings and friends. It examined how much adolescents talked to their parents before suicide attempts, the frequency of self-mutilation, the extent of suicidal ideation, previous suicide attempts and suicide attempts in the adolescent's surroundings.
   Methods: We performed a cross-sectional case-control study that focused on 381 adolescents aged 10-17 years who were admitted to hospitals across Denmark after suicide attempts with acetaminophen and 296 age- and gender-matched controls recruited from schools. The study used questionnaires and medical and child psychiatric records.
   Results: The study group were ten times more likely to report dissociated parental relationships than the control group (41.5% versus 4%), and there were significant relationships between these reports and feelings of not being heard (p < 0.0001), dissociated relationships with friends (p < 0.0001) and siblings (p < 0.0001) and self-mutilation (p = 0.009). Almost two-thirds (62.5%) of the suicidal adolescents who tried to talk to their parents about their problems felt unheard, and there was a significant relationship between this feeling and the duration of suicidal ideation (p = 0.01) and self-mutilation (p = 0.003).
   Conclusion: Early risk factors for suicide were dissociated relationships with parents, siblings and friends, feeling unheard, self-mutilation and extended suicidal ideation.

TI Frequency of health care utilization in the year prior to completed
   suicide: A Danish nationwide matched comparative study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PREVENTION STRATEGIES; PEOPLE; CONTACTS; REGISTERS; THERAPY; SYSTEM
AB Background
   Suicide accounts for more than 800,000 annual deaths worldwide. Some of these deaths may be preventable by timely identification of individuals at risk and effective intervention. General practitioners (GPs) may have the potential to play an important role in this process.
   Aim
   The present study aimed to assess the frequency of primary health care utilization in the year preceding suicide.
   Methods
   Using Danish national registers, we identified all persons who died by suicide in Denmark from 1997 through 2013 and assessed the frequency of their primary care utilization and compared it with that of an age- and sex-matched reference group sampled from the background population.
   Results
   We identified 11,191 persons who died by suicide (males: 8,095, females: 3,096). Compared with the reference group (N = 55,955), a greater proportion attended general practice in the year before index date (83% vs. 76%). In the last month before index date, these figures were 32.0% and 19.4%, respectively, corresponding to a difference of 12.0 95% CI: (11.1; 12.9) percentage points after adjustment for demographic characteristics and physical comorbidity. Suicide cases had a higher GP attendance in every week in the year before suicide, but the difference increased specifically in the last four months.
   Conclusion
   More than 30% attended the GP in the month before the suicide. This indicates that general practice could be a possible place to identify suicide cases and offer intervention. However, although this proportion represents a markedly higher GP attendance than seen in the reference group, almost 70% of those who died by suicide did not attend primary care in the month before the suicide. Our study suggests that it is important that the GPs have easy access to effective suicide prevention programs for patients at risk of suicide, and that persons with suicidal thoughts are encouraged to contact their GP.

AB Background: The purpose of the study was to research gender differences in suicides committed in Podgorica between 2000 and 2006, including sociodemographic variables (e.g. age, marital status, education etc.), methods of and motives for committing suicide. Data were taken from the Police Directorate of Montenegro.
   Subjects and methods: We used data on 220 males and 83 females who committed suicide. Statistical analysis was done by using the crude specific rate. Significance between two independent crude rates is constructed around their 95% confidence intervals and it utilizes the difference between the two rates (D) to determine significance.
   Results: The incidence of suicide in males was found to be higher than in females (the male to female suicide ratio is 2.6 to 1). Females were older than males. Females had completed elementary education more frequently, and they were single or divorced or widows. Males had completed secondary education more frequently and they were married. The most frequent employment status of both gender groups implied pensioner and unemployment statuses. There was a significant difference in suicide rates between the genders during the reporting period. Suicide rates increase with age in both genders. Males chose firearms, hanging, strangulation and suffocation and jumping. Females chose hanging, strangulation and suffocation, jumping and drowning as the most frequent methods of suicide. The most frequent motive for suicide in both gender groups was physical illness. The second most frequent motive was mental illness. Emotional and financial difficulties were motives which were more common in males, whereas family problems appeared to be motives two times more frequent in females.
   Conclusions: The complex multifactorial etiology of suicide suggests the need to consider gender differences when developing effective strategies fir the therapy and the prevention of suicide.

AB The number of the suicides is increasing all around the world. In this study, the cases autopsied between 2000 and 2007 in The Konya Branch of Forensic Medicine Council were retrospectively investigated. Fifty-seven shotgun suicides were determined. The cases were evaluated in terms of their demographic characters, site of entrance wound, the type of the cartridge used, shooting distance, the place of incident, the place of death, motive for suicide, and the presence of previous suicide attempts. The most preferred site of entrance wound was the head with 34 cases (59.7%). Of 34 cases in which the entrance wound was on the head, there was indirect mandibular fracture in 16 cases (47.1%). In 11 cases (19.3%), there observed small ecchymosed abrasions on the finger surfaces, which are thought to have resulted from the trigger kicking back during triggering or the finger having been stuck between the trigger and the trigger guard. It is concluded that there is a need for a legal regulation that makes obtaining of shotguns more difficult and the people who have them are to be educated not to keep them in easily accessible places.

AB Study objective: To describe gender specific suicide rates associated with partner's psychiatric disorder, loss of a spouse, or child by suicide or other causes, being a parent, and marital status.
   Design: Nested case-control study. Information on causes of death, psychiatric admission, marital status, children, and socioeconomic factors was obtained from routine registers.
   Setting: Denmark.
   Participants: 9011 people aged 25-60 years who committed suicide; 180 220 age-gender matched controls; 111 172 marital partners; 174 672 children.
   Main results: The suicide risk in women whose partner had been first admitted with a psychiatric disorder after 31 December two years earlier was 6.9 (95% CI 3.6 to 13.0), whereas their male counterpart experienced a risk of 3.9 (2.7 to 5.6); p value gender difference = 0.39. Men who had lost their partner by suicide or other causes of death experienced a suicide risk of 46.2 (18.3 to 116.4) and 10.1 (6.5 to 15.8), respectively; the analogous risk among women were about one third: 15.8 (6.6 to 37.4) and 3.3 (1.5 to 7.2), respectively. Child bereavement by suicide or other causes imposed an approximate twofold risk increase in their parents, whereas being a parent was protective in women. Except for widows (1.6, 1.2 to 2.0) and widowers (3.0, 2.3 to 3.9) the suicide risk associated with being separated (2.0, 1.8 to 2.3), divorced (1.8, 1.7 to 2.0), never married (1.4, 1.3 to 1.6), cohabitant (1.2, 1.1 to 1.3) was virtually the same in the two sexes.
   Conclusions: The suicide risk is associated with partner psychiatric illness. Conjugal bereavement is particularly indicative of suicide in men, and spousal suicide is particularly indicative of suicide. Child bereavement is associated with parental suicide, while being a parent is protective against suicide in women.

AB Suicidal behavior is an important clinical problem and a major cause of death in youth and adults. Consequently, there is a great interest in identifying risk factors and characteristics or personality traits of people with suicidal behavior in order to elaborate targeted preventing measures. In this context, the purpose of this research was to establish the socio-demographic and economic characteristics of patients with suicidal behaviour and mental disorders. We conducted a retrospective, observational study between January 1st 2010 and December 31st 2014. The statistical analyse revealed that more than half of total have an alcohol addiction, are unemployed, and have financial problems. The main psychiatric disorders which correlated with patient economic problems are major depression, bipolar disorder and anxious-depressive syndrome. Most suicide attempters were mature adults (45-54 years), followed by young adults (20-24 years). As a method of suicide, women choose mainly drug overdose ingestion, while men sharp object injury. It was also observed a seasonality of the suicide attempts.

ID RISK; EPILEPSY
AB Objective To examine whether prior suicidal behavior and familial predisposition to psychiatric disorders modify the association between antiepileptic drug use and completed suicide. Methods Using the Danish National Prescription Register, we identified all incident users of antiepileptic drugs aged 15 years or older in Denmark between July 1997 and December 2015. We carried out a nested case-control study and defined exposure to antiepileptic drugs at the index date (ie, time of suicide). Conditional logistic regressions were used to estimate mortality rate ratios (MRRs) of suicide in current versus previous users of antiepileptic drugs. We also analyzed suicide risk associated with the 9 most commonly used antiepileptic drugs. Results We identified 1,759 individuals completing suicide. Current versus previous use of any antiepileptic drug was associated with an increased risk of suicide (MRR = 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13-1.40). This excess risk was observed in individuals with a history of suicidal behavior (MRR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.07-1.54) and in those without (MRR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.11-1.43), and in individuals with a familial predisposition to psychiatric disorders (MRR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.18-1.87) and in those without (MRR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.07-1.35). Interpretation Use of antiepileptic drugs was associated with an increased risk of suicide. The findings do not support that the risk of suicide following treatment with antiepileptic drugs identified in randomized trials is explained by prior suicidality or familial predisposition to psychiatric disorders. The additional risk of suicide associated with use of antiepileptic drugs was generally low and should be balanced against benefits of treatment. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:951-961

AB Background: Only a. few studies have investigated how the type of first contact is associated with the risk of subsequent hospitalisation and the risk of committing suicide for patients with depressive or bipolar disorders. Method: All outpatients (patients in psychiatric ambulatories and community psychiatry centres) and in-patients (patients admitted during daytime or overnight to a psychiatric hospital) with a diagnosis of depressive or bipolar disorder at first contact ever in a period from 1995 to 1999 in Denmark were identified from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register (DPCRR). The risk of subsequent hospitalisation and the risk of suicide were compared according to type of first contact. Results: The risk of subsequent hospitalisation was significantly increased for patients who were admitted to inpatient facilities during first contact compared to patients with outpatient treatment as their first contact. Patients with depressive disorder who were admitted also had increased risk of committing suicide eventually. Limitations: The diagnoses are clinician based. Conclusions: Patients referred to inpatient treatment have a poorer long-term prognosis than patients treated as outpatients. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB AimTo estimate and test associations between substance use disorders (SUDs) and both completed suicides and suicide attempts in a population with severe mental illness.
   DesignRegister-based cohort study with adjusted Cox regression of substance use disorders as time-varying covariates.
   SettingDenmark.
   ParticipantsPeople born in Denmark since 1955 with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (n=35625), bipolar disorder (n=9279), depression (n=72530) or personality disorder (n=63958).
   MeasurementsTreated SUDs of alcohol and illicit substances identified in treatment registers; suicide attempt identified in treatment registers; and completed suicides identified in the Cause of Death register. Covariates were sex and age at diagnosis.
   FindingsHaving any SUD was associated with at least a threefold increased risk of completed suicide when compared with those having no SUD. Alcohol misuse was associated with an increased risk of completed suicide in all populations with hazard ratios (HR) between 1.99 [95% confidence interval (CI)=1.44-2.74] and 2.70 (95% CI=2.40-3.04). Other illicit substances were associated with a two- to threefold risk increase of completed suicide in all populations except bipolar disorder, and cannabis was associated with increased risk of attempted suicide only in people with bipolar disorder (HR=1.86, 95% CI=1.15-2.99). Alcohol and other illicit substances each displayed strong associations with attempted suicide, HR ranging from 3.11 (95% CI=2.95-3.27) to 3.38 (95% CI=3.24-3.53) and 2.13 (95% CI=2.03-2.24) to 2.27 (95% CI=2.12-2.43), respectively. Cannabis was associated with suicide attempts only in people with schizophrenia (HR=1.11, 95% CI=1.03-1.19).
   ConclusionSubstance use disorders are associated strongly with risk of completed suicides and suicide attempts in people with severe mental illness.

   TRENDS; WALES; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DEPRESSION; PREVALENCE
AB Background The extent to which the high suicide rate in urban areas is influenced by exposures to risk factors for suicide other than urbanicity remains unknown. This population-based study aims to investigate suicide risk in relation to the level of urbanicity in the context of other factors, and to study the risk variation in a sex, age, and calendar year perspective.
   Methods The study is a nested case-control study comprising 21 169 suicides and 423 128 population controls matched for age and sex. Personal data on place of residence, socioeconomic status and psychiatric history were retrieved from various Danish longitudinal registers. Data were analysed with conditional logistic regression.
   Results This study confirms that people living in more urbanized areas are at a higher risk of suicide than their counterparts in less urbanized areas. However, this excess risk is largely eliminated when adjusted for personal marital, income, and ethnic differences; it is even reversed when further adjusted for psychiatric status. Moreover, the impact of urbanicity on suicide risk differs significantly by sex and across age. Urban living reduces suicide risk significantly among men, especially young men, but increases the risk among women, especially women aged 24-35 or > 65 years. In addition, during 1981-1997, the suicide risk associated with urbanicity remained rather constant among women, whereas it dropped significantly among men, a trend that seemingly gained strength during the last part of this period.
   Conclusions Suicide risk associated with urbanicity varies significantly by sex and age groups and recent years have seen a decline in the urban-rural disparities among men. The increased risk in urban areas can largely be explained by the effects of marital status, ethnics, income, and psychiatric status.

AB Introduction: Little is known about the sexual and psychosocial health of non-heterosexual Danes. Based on a large population study, the aim of this article was to compare quality-of-life-related key variables of heterosexual and non-heterosexual men and women, aged 16-66. Materials and methods: Cross-sectional data from the nationwide, representative Health and Morbidity Survey (n = 8496) were used to compare variables concerning both general and sexual well-being of self-identified heterosexual and non-heterosexual respondents. Results: Nearly twice as many non-heterosexual than heterosexual men rated their sexual life as bad or very bad (22.5% versus 12.8%), while no statistical difference was seen among women (13.6% versus 10.6%). For both genders, significantly more non-heterosexuals than heterosexuals stated that their sexual needs were not met (17.9% versus 7.7% for men and 14.8% versus 6.9% for women), and significantly more non-heterosexuals reported acts of sexual violence (8.3% versus 2.1% for men and 35.8% versus 13.0% for women). Finally, non-heterosexual respondents had contemplated suicide more than twice as often as heterosexuals (15.9% versus 7.4% for men and 19.7% versus 8.3% for women). Actual suicide attempts were roughly three times more frequent in the non-heterosexual groups (8.3% versus 2.6 % for men and 11.8% versus 4.2% for women). Conclusions: Overall, non-heterosexual Danes reported higher degrees of sexual and/or psychosocial distress than heterosexuals. Further research is needed; but scientists, clinicians and public health workers should be aware that non-heterosexuals may pose specific health-related challenges and requirements.

AB Background: Several studies have concluded that some deaths classified as undetermined intent are in fact suicides, and it is common in suicide research in Europe to include these deaths. Our aim was to investigate if information on background variables would be helpful in assessing if deaths classified as undetermined intent should be included in the analyses of suicides.
   Methods: We performed a register study of 31,883 deaths classified as suicides and 9,196 deaths classified as undetermined intent in Sweden from 1987 to 2011. We compared suicide deaths with deaths classified as undetermined intent with regard to different background variables such as sex, age, country of birth, marital status, prior inpatient care for self-inflicted harm, alcohol and drug abuse, psychiatric inpatient care, and use of psychotropics. We also performed a multivariate analysis with logistic regression.
   Results: Our results showed differences in most studied background factors. Higher education was more common in suicides; hospitalization for self-inflicted harm was more common among female suicides as was prior psychiatric inpatient care. Deaths in foreign-born men were classified as undetermined intent in a higher degree and hospitalization for substance abuse was more common in undetermined intents of both sexes. Roughly 50% of both suicide and deaths classified as undetermined intent had a filled prescription of psychotropics during their last six months. Our multivariate analysis showed male deaths to more likely be classified as suicide than female: OR: 1.13 (1.07-1.18). The probability of a death being classified as suicide was also increased for individuals aged 15-24, being born in Sweden, individuals who were married, and for deaths after 1987-1992.
   Conclusion: By analyzing Sweden's unique high-validity population-based register data, we found several differences in background variables between deaths classified as suicide and deaths classified as undetermined intent. However, we were not able to clearly distinguish these two death manners. For future research we suggest, separate analyses of the two different manners of death.

AB Objective: To determine how psychological premorbidity affects the risk of depression in parents who lost a child through suicide.
   Design: Population-based survey.
   Setting: Sweden, between 2009 and 2010.
   Participants: All parents who lost a child, age 15-30, through suicide between 2004 and 2007 according to National population registries. Non-bereaved parents matched for age, sex, living area, marital status, number of children. Exclusion criteria: born outside a Nordic country, not Swedish speaking, contact details missing. Participants: 666 of 915 (73%) suicide-bereaved and 377 of 508 (74%) non-bereaved parents.
   Main outcome measures: Depression measured by the nine-item depression scale of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and study-specific questions to assess psychological premorbidity and experience of the child's presuicidal morbidity.
   Results: In all, 94 (14%) suicide-bereaved and 51 (14%) non-bereaved parents (relative risk 1.0; 95% CI 0.8 to 1.4) had received their first treatment for psychological problems or had been given a psychiatric diagnosis more than 10 years earlier. The prevalence of moderate-to-severe depression was 115 (18%) in suicide-bereaved versus 28 (7%) in non-bereaved parents (RR 2.3; 95% CI 1.6 to 3.5). For those without psychological premorbidity, the relative risk was 2.3 (95% CI 1.4 to 3.6). 339 (51%) suicide-bereaved parents expressed worry over the child's psychological health during the month preceding the suicide and 259 (39%) had anticipated the suicide.
   Conclusions: In parents who lost a child through suicide in Sweden we did not find a higher prevalence of long-term psychological premorbidity than among parents who had not lost a child; the more than twofold risk of depression among the bereaved can probably be explained by the suicide and the stressful time preceding the suicide.

AB The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that young people who perceive their parents to have alcohol problems are more likely to self-injure, have suicide ideation, and to attempt suicide than young people without parental alcohol problems. We also tested whether the association between parental alcohol problems and self-injury, suicide ideation, and suicide attempt among young people differed depending on the gender of the child and the parent. Data came from the Danish National Youth Study 2014, a web-based national survey. A total of 75,853 high school and vocational school students participated. Self-injury, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts were outcomes and the main exposure variables were perceived parental alcohol problems, gender of the parent with alcohol problems, cohabitation with a parent with alcohol problems, and severity of the parents' alcohol problems. Young people with parental alcohol problems had higher odds of self-injury [boys: OR = 1.59 (95% CI 1.40-1.82); girls: OR = 1.84 (95% CI 1.69-1.99)], suicidal ideation [boys: OR = 1.81 (95% CI 1.59-2.06); girls: OR 1.74 (95% CI 1.59-1.89)], and suicide attempt [boys: OR = 2.10 (95% CI 1.63-2.71); girls: OR = 2.09 (95% CI 1.80-2.42)] compared to young people without parental alcohol problems. Girls with parental alcohol problems had higher odds of self-injury than boys with parental alcohol problems, whereas no gender differences were found for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Also no differences were found depending on the gender of the parent with alcohol problems. This study shows that young people with parental alcohol problems have higher odds of self-injury, suicide ideation, and suicide attempts.

AB Background: Persons with cancer commit suicide more frequently than those without, and males generally commit suicide more frequently than females. A population-based analysis of cancer patients was carried out here, comparing suicide risk between the genders, to elucidate the features specific to each gender.
   Patients and methods: A total of 1.3 million cancer cases from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program were analyzed. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to personal, tumor-related, and social variates.
   Results: A total of 265 female and 1307 male suicides were enumerated, reflecting 0.04% and 0.19% from each gender, and providing an overall hazard ratio for male suicide of 6.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.4-7.1]. Females with colorectal (P = 0.01) and cervical (P < 0.0001) cancers showed decreased suicide rates. Males with head and neck cancers (P < 0.0001) and myeloma (P = 0.02) had increased rates, whereas rates were decreased in males with lung cancer (P = 0.01), liver (P = 0.01), brain tumors (P = 0.04), and leukemia (P = 0.007). The hazard ratio associated for male suicide with distant metastasis was 2.84 (95% CI 2.49-3.24); for married status, 0.46 (95% CI 0.39-0.54); and for African-American ancestry, 0.24 (95% CI 0.17-0.34)-comparable ratios were seen here for female suicides. In head and neck cancers, with both genders analyzed together, the suicide hazard was increased if surgery was contraindicated (3.0, 95% CI 1.3-6.8), but not if refused.
   Conclusions: The high-risk patient was male, with head and neck cancer or myeloma, advanced disease, little social or cultural support, and limited treatment options. Oncologists and allied health professionals should be aware of the potential for suicide in cancer patients and their associated risk factors.

AB This article investigates the prevalence of traumatization and mental distress in a sample of 1055 male European long-term prisoners as part of a wider study of the living conditions of prisoners serving sentences of at least five years in Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Germany, Lithuania, Poland, Spain and Sweden. Data were collected in a written survey using the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) as well as questions on attempted suicide and auto-aggressive behaviour. Participants experienced a mean of three traumatic events, with 14 per cent developing a Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) subsequently. In each national sample, more than 50 per cent of the participants were in need of treatment because of psychological symptoms and nearly one-third had attempted suicide.

AB Objective. To describe a method for identification, classification and assessment of maternal deaths in Denmark and to identify substandard care. Design. Register study and case audit based on data from the Registers of the Danish Medical Health Board, death certificates and hospital records. Setting. Denmark 2002-2006. Population. Women who died during a pregnancy or within 42 days after a pregnancy. Methods. Maternal deaths were identified by notification from maternity wards and data from the Danish National Board of Health. A national audit committee assessed hospital records of direct and indirect deaths. Main outcome measures. Maternal mortality ratio, causes of death and suboptimal care. Results. In the study period, 26 women died during pregnancy or within 42 days from direct or indirect causes, leading to a maternal mortality ratio of 8.0/100,000 live births. Causes of death were cardiac disease, thromboembolism, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, Streptococcus A infections, suicide, amniotic fluid embolism, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, asthma and diabetes. Conclusion. Our method proved valid and can be used for future research. Causes of death could be identified and learning points from the assessments could form the basis of focused education and guidelines. Future complementary 'near miss' studies and cooperation with other countries with comparable health systems are expected to improve the benefits of the enquiries, contributing to improved management of life-threatening conditions in pregnancy and childbirth.

AB Background Both individual and familial histories of mental illness are substantial risk factors for suicide in young people. Aim To explore suicide risk among adolescents and young adults according to detailed aspects of individual and parental psychiatric admission history. Methods A nested case-control study was undertaken using data from Danish population registers to include 4,142 suicide cases and 82,840 matched controls aged 9-35 years. Data were analyzed with conditional logistic regression. Results A history of hospitalized psychiatric illness was a strong risk factor for suicide in adolescents and young adults, and the effect of such a history was greater in females than males. The elevated risk peaked in the two periods immediately after admission and discharge for both sexes, and exceeded in females who had multiple admissions and in males who were diagnosed with schizophrenia, affective disorders or substance abuse disorders. At the same time, a parental psychiatric history constituted a substantial risk factor for suicide in young people, in particular, if having a mother admitted for psychiatric illness. The elevated risk associated with parental psychiatric history was greater in females than in males, and tended to be more prominent during the first few years after admission of a parent. Conclusion Prevention strategies should aim at improving treatment and care to young people with psychiatric problems and at providing social support and psychological consultation to children with parental psychiatric illness.

AB Stressful life events have been associated with high risk of suicidal behavior. The aim of this study was to examine whether persons who died by suicide in Denmark had more frequently been exposed to stressful life events, specifically divorce, death of a close relative, exposure to violence, and imprisonment, when compared to gender and age-matched controls. Data from Danish national registers were obtained for the period of 2000-2010 and a nested case-control design was applied. The association between exposure to stressful life events and suicide was examined using logistic regression analysis. In all, 7,115 suicides were identified during the 11 years of follow-up. For each of these, 20 age- and gender-matched controls were randomly selected (n=142,300). Cases who died by suicide had an odds ratio of 9.3 (CI-95%: 7.8-11.0) of having been exposed to imprisonment five or more times when compared to controls. People who died by suicide had 1.5-fold (CI-95%: 1.3-1.6) higher risk of having experienced a divorce. Stressful life events, such as divorce and imprisonment, were more frequent in temporal proximity to the date of death among the suicide cases than for end of exposure for controls (p<.001 and p<.001, respectively). Our findings confirm that, using nationwide data, stressful life events are positively associated to subsequent suicide. Causal pathways linking the two may, however, be indirect.

AB Background: Suicide risk may be elevated in 'medical' occupational groups, although results of studies are inconsistent. National data are required to examine this issue. It is also important to investigate the possible contribution of psychiatric disorder and access to specific suicide. methods.
   Methods: In a nested case-control design we used data from Danish national registers for 19812006 to examine risk of suicide in nurses, physicians, dentists, pharmacists and veterinary surgeons compared to teachers and the general population, and associations with psychiatric service contact and suicide methods.
   Results: Crude age- and gender-adjusted rate ratios for suicide compared to teachers were significantly elevated in nurses (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.63-2.21), physicians (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.55-2.26), dentists (RR 2.10,95% CI 1.58-2.79) and pharmacists (RR 1.91,95% CI 1.26-2.87), but not veterinary surgeons. Risk was also elevated in nurses, physicians and dentists compared with the rest of the general population, the relative risk increasing following adjustments for psychiatric service contact, marital status, gross income and labour market status. Results were similar in both genders. The elevated risk in nurses and dentists decreased during the study period. Elevated risks were not associated with greater psychiatric service contact. Medicinal drugs were commonly used for suicide by nurses, physicians and pharmacists.
   Limitations: The study was based in one country.
   Conclusions: Risk of suicide is increased in nurses, physicians, dentists and pharmacists in Denmark. This is not reflected in excess psychiatric service contact. Ready access to medicinal drugs may influence risk in nurses, physicians and pharmacists. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Repetition after attempted suicide is high with only limited research been put into effect studies. The Baerum-model from Norway offers a practical and affordable intervention. Our aim was to study the acceptability and effectiveness of a Baerum-model like intervention after attempted suicide using a quasi-experimental design. During a period in 2004, attempted suicide patients were offered follow-up care by a rapid-response outreach programme, an intervention lasting 6 months; a control group was established prospectively from a similar period in 2002. The design was an intent-to-treat analysis. The outcome was measured by: 1) participation by acceptance and adherence, 2) repetition of suicide attempt and suicide, and 3) including the number of repetitive acts in 1 year after the attempted suicide episode. Follow-up period was 1 year. Participation was 70%. There was a significant lower repetition rate in the intervention group, where the proportion of repetitive patients fell from 34% to 14%. There were also fewer suicidal acts, in total 37 acts in 58 patients in the control group and 22 acts in 93 patients for the intervention group. We have concluded that the outreach programme has a good feasibility because of high acceptability and adherence, and has an acceptable effectiveness in the follow up period of 1 year. We have therefore initiated a similar study using a randomization design in order to study efficacy.

AB Objective: In order to prevent suicidal behaviour among adolescents and young adults it would be valuable to know if altering the conditions of their upbringing could reduce their suicidal behaviour. The study surveys possible risk factors.
   Method: Population-based registers covering children born in Denmark in 1966 at the age span of 14 - 27 years and their parents for: health, education, family dissolution, suicidal behaviour, substance abuse, criminality and unemployment. A discrete-time proportional hazard modelling was used to analyse the longitudinal observations.
   Results: First-time suicide attempts were associated with parental psychiatric disorder, suicidal behaviour, violence, child abuse and neglect. Increased risks were also found among adolescents and young adults who suffered from psychiatric disorder or physical handicap, had been legally imprisoned, were addicted to drugs, or without graduation, vocational training or employment.
   Conclusion: Stigmatization, social exclusion, and mental disorders in the adolescents or young adults and parents increased risks for attempted suicide.

AB Background Suicide mortality is high among the unemployed, but the role of causation and selection models in producing employment status differences remains to be understood. This study analyses the association between unemployment and suicide during different levels of national unemployment adjusting for several factors that might explain or mediate the relationship.
   Methods The data comprised annual population-register and death-register information on 25-64-year-old Finns at the beginning of each year in the period 1988-2003; thus, forming 16 separate follow-up cohorts. Experience of unemployment was measured at baseline and during the previous year for each cohort. Suicide was followed for 12 months after each baseline giving a total of 7388 suicides.
   Results Overall, age-adjusted suicide mortality was two to three times higher among the unstably employed and almost fourfold among the long-term unemployed. Adjustment for social class and living arrangements had small effect on the HRs, but adjustment for household income per consumption unit decreased the differences by 13% and 31% among the long-term unemployed women and men, respectively. When the national unemployment level was high, excess suicide mortality among the unstably employed was lower than during low unemployment when those becoming unemployed might be more selected. No such differences were found among the long-term unemployed.
   Conclusion Long-term unemployment seems to have causal effects on suicide, which may be partly mediated by low income. As the effect of unstable employment is lower during the recessionary stage of the economic cycle some part of the excess suicide among the unstably employed is likely to be attributable to selection into unemployment.

AB Study objective: To describe the association between labour market status and death by suicide with focus on admission with a psychiatric disorder.
   Design: Nested case-control study. Data from routine registers.
   Setting: Entire Danish population.
   Participants: 9011 people aged 25 - 60 years who committed suicide during 1982 - 1997 and 180 220 matched controls.
   Main results: In the general population, not being fully employed is associated with a twofold to threefold increased relative risk of death by suicide, compared with being fully employed. In contrast, fully employed people who have been first admitted to a psychiatric hospital within the past year are at increased suicide risk. Patients who are unemployed, social benefits recipients, disability pensioners, or otherwise marginalised on the labour market have a suicide risk of 0.60 ( 95% CI: 0.46 to 0.78), 0.41 ( 0.23 to 0.74), 0.70 ( 0.45 to 1.08), and 0.86 (0.53 to 1.41), respectively. Although a similar risk decrease is found in women, men, people younger than 30 years, people older than 45 years, and in people who become unemployed, the reversed effect attenuates with time since admission, and little association is seen when a marginal structural model is applied.
   Conclusions: Although the results show an increased suicide mortality associated with unemployment and labour market marginalisation in the general population, the results suggest little or an inverse association between unemployment and suicide in people with psychiatric illness. The associations seen suggest the need to consider healthy worker selection effects when studying the causal pathway from unemployment and psychiatric illness to suicide.

AB Suicide is a major public health concern. High-dose lithium is used to stabilize mood and prevent suicide in patients with affective disorders. Lithium occurs naturally in drinking water worldwide in much lower doses, but with large geographical variation. Several studies conducted at an aggregate level have suggested an association between lithium in drinking water and a reduced risk of suicide; however, a causal relation is uncertain. Individual-level register-based data on the entire Danish adult population (3.7 million individuals) from 1991 to 2012 were linked with a moving five-year time-weighted average (TWA) lithium exposure level from drinking water hypothesizing an inverse relationship. The mean lithium level was 11.6 mu g/L ranging from 0.6 to 30.7 mu g/L. The suicide rate decreased from 29.7 per 100,000 person-years at risk in 1991 to 18.4 per 100,000 person-years in 2012. We found no significant indication of an association between increasing five-year TWA lithium exposure level and decreasing suicide rate. The comprehensiveness of using individual-level data and spatial analyses with 22 years of follow-up makes a pronounced contribution to previous findings. Our findings demonstrate that there does not seem to be a protective effect of exposure to lithium on the incidence of suicide with levels below 31 mu g/L in drinking water.

AB Background Prison suicide rates, rate ratios, and associations with prison-related factors need clarification and updating. We examined prison suicide rates in countries where reliable information was available, associations with a range of prison-service and health-service related factors, how these rates compared with the general population, and changes over the past decade.
   Methods We collected data for prison suicides in 24 high-income countries in Europe, Australasia, and North America from their prison administrations for 2011-14 to calculate suicide rates and rate ratios compared with the general population. We used meta-regression to test associations with general population suicide rates, incarceration rates, and prison-related factors (overcrowding, ratio of prisoners to prison officers or health-care staff or education staff, daily spend, turnover, and imprisonment duration). We also examined temporal trends.
   Findings 3906 prison suicides occurred during 2011-14 in the 24 high-income countries we studied. Where there was breakdown by sex (n=2810), 2607 (93%) were in men and 203 (7%) were in women. Nordic countries had the highest prison suicide rates of more than 100 suicides per 100 000 prisoners apart from Denmark (where it was 91 per 100 000), followed by western Europe where prison suicide rates in France and Belgium were more than 100 per 100 000 prisoners. Australasian and North American countries had rates ranging from 23 to 67 suicides per 100 000 prisoners. Rate ratios, or rates compared with those in the general population of the same sex and similar age, were typically higher than 3 in men and 9 in women. Higher incarceration rates were associated with lower prison suicide rates (b = -0 . 504, p = 0 . 014), which was attenuated when adjusting for prison-level variables. There were no associations between rates of prison suicide and general population suicide, any other tested prison-related factors, or differing criteria for defining suicide deaths. Changes in prison suicide rates over the past decade vary widely between countries.
   Interpretation Many countries in northern and western Europe have prison suicide rates of more than 100 per 100 000 prisoners per year. Individual-level information about prisoner health is required to understand the substantial variations reported and changes over time. Copyright (C) The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The increasingly punitive measures taken by European governments to deter people seeking asylum, including increased use of detention, internalised controls, reductions in in-country rights and procedural safeguards, have a hugely damaging impact on the lives and wellbeing of women survivors of torture, sexual and domestic violence. This article, based on a two-year research project examining Britain, Denmark and Sweden, involved more than 500 hours speaking with people seeking asylum, as well as interviews with practitioners. It highlights among other issues non-adherence to the Istanbul Convention (for Denmark and Sweden, who have ratified it); non-application of gender guidelines; and significant wholesale violations of refugee rights. It demonstrates some of the ways in which increasingly harsh policies impact on women seeking asylum and highlights the experiences relayed by some who are affected: those stuck in asylum systems and practitioners seeking to provide support. Indeed, it indicates that women seeking asylum in Britain, Denmark and Sweden are made more vulnerable to violence due to the actions or inactions of the states that are supposed to protect them.

AB The objective of the study was to examine the association between 39 physical diseases and death by suicide in older adults.
   Individual-level register data on all older adults aged 65 years and over living in Denmark during 1990-2009 (N = 1,849,110) were analysed. Rate ratios were calculated for 39 physical diseases while adjusting for period, age group, conjugal status, income, physical comorbidity, and psychiatric disorders.
   In all, 4792 older adults aged 65+ died by suicide during the follow-up of > 16 million person-years. Gastrointestinal cancer was linked to a rate ratio of 2.5 (95 % CI 1.9-3.5) in men while excess suicide risk for women with brain cancer was 3.5 (95 % CI 1.1-10.8) within three years of diagnosis. Men and women diagnosed with liver diseases within three years experienced a 2.7- (95 % CI 1.7-4.2) and 4.0- (95 % CI 2.5-6.4) fold higher risk of suicide, respectively, than those not diagnosed. Elevated risks of suicide were identified for lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, breast cancer, genital cancer, bladder cancer, lymph node cancer, epilepsy, cerebrovascular diseases, cataract, heart diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders (COPD), gastrointestinal disease, liver disease, arthritis, osteoporosis, prostate disorders, male genital disorders, and spinal fracture when compared to persons not diagnosed within three years.
   Multiple physical diseases were linked to increased risks of suicide in older adults. Increased attention to suicidal ideation and risk assessment might be warranted during the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

AB ObjectiveTo analyse mortality and life expectancy in people with alcohol use disorder in Denmark, Finland and Sweden.
   MethodA population-based register study including all patients admitted to hospital diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (1158486 person-years) from 1987 to 2006 in Denmark, Finland and Sweden.
   ResultsLife expectancy was 24-28years shorter in people with alcohol use disorder than in the general population. From 1987 to 2006, the difference in life expectancy between patients with alcohol use disorder and the general population increased in men (Denmark, 1.8years; Finland, 2.6years; Sweden, 1.0years); in women, the difference in life expectancy increased in Denmark (0.3years) but decreased in Finland (-0.8years) and Sweden (-1.8years). People with alcohol use disorder had higher mortality from all causes of death (mortality rate ratio, 3.0-5.2), all diseases and medical conditions (2.3-4.8), and suicide (9.3-35.9).
   ConclusionPeople hospitalized with alcohol use disorder have an average life expectancy of 47-53years (men) and 50-58years (women) and die 24-28years earlier than people in the general population.

AB People with a psychiatric illness are at high risk for suicide; however, variation of the risk by patients' sex and age and by specific diagnosis needs to be explored in a more detail. This large population study systematically assesses suicide incidence rate ratio (IRR) and population attributable risk (PAR) associated with various psychiatric disorders by comparing 21,169 suicides in Denmark over a 17-year period with sex-age-time-matched population controls. The study shows that suicide risk is significantly increased for persons with a hospitalized psychiatric disorder and the associated risk varies significantly by diagnosis and by sex and age of subjects. Further adjustment for personal socioeconomic differences eliminates the IRRs associated with various disorders only to a limited extend. Recurrent depression and borderline personality disorder increase suicide risk the strongest while dementia increases the risk the least for both males and females. The influence of various disorders generally weakens with increasing age; however, there are important exceptions. Schizophrenia affects people aged <= 35 years the strongest in terms of both IRR and PAR. Recurrent depression increases suicide risk particularly strong in all age groups and the associated PAR increases steadily with age. Borderline personality disorder has a strong effect in young people, especially those <= 35 years. Alcohol use disorder accounts the highest PAR of suicides in males of 36-60 years old. For the elderly above 60 years old, reaction to stress and adjustment disorder increases the risk for suicide the most in both sexes. These findings suggest that approaches to psychiatric suicide prevention should be varied according to diagnosis and sex and age of subjects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID PREVENTING SUICIDE; ATTRIBUTABLE RISK; SWEDISH SUICIDE; UNEMPLOYMENT;
   MORTALITY
AB Background Several risk factors for suicide have been identified, We assessed the relative risks and population attributable risks of suicide associated with various socioeconomic factors and with previous mental illness that necessitated hospital admission. Our aim was to assist in the choice of potential strategies for preventing suicide in the general population.
   Methods We did a population-based nested case-control study based on register data. Data were collected on a random 5% sample of the Danish population aged 16-78 years during a 15-year period (1980-94) and analysed with conditional logistic regression.
   Findings 811 cases of suicide were found and 79 871 controls were chosen in this population. Unemployment, tow income, being single, and a history of mental illness necessitating hospital admission were associated With increased risk of suicide. However, in the multivariate analysis, the strongest risk factor was mental illness necessitating hospital admission; risk of suicide was especially high during admission (relative risk 62.6 [95% CI 41.1-95.4]) and during the year after discharge (6.51 [5.03-8.44]). The effect of socioeconomic variables decreased after adjustment for history of mental illness. The population attributable risk associated with mental illness necessitating admission to hospital was 44.6% (43.6-45.5); the attributable risks associated with the other factors were 3.0% (1.4-6.6) for unemployment and 10.3% (6.13-16.9) for being single.
   Interpretation Suicide prevention aimed at patients who are admitted to hospital with mental disorders and improved detection and treatment of mental disorders in the general population may be the most efficient strategy to decrease risk of suicide. Reports of high relative risk and attributable risk associated with unemployment and other socioeconomic risk factors may be confounded and overestimated owing to the lack of adjustment for the association with mental disorders.

AB Introduction: The objective of the study was to estimate the risk of adolescent and early adulthood suicide related to adverse family and individual backgrounds.
   Material and methods: The 496 young people aged 10-21 years who committed suicide during the period 1981-1997 in Denmark and 24,800 gender-age-time-matched controls.
   Results: Parental suicide, early death, hospitalised mental illness, unemployment, low income, educational underachievement, parental divorce, mental illness in siblings, as well as mental illness and shorter schooling in the adolescents themselves were associated with increased. risk of suicide. In the multivariate analysis, the odds ratios associated with suicide or mental illness in father or mother were 2.30 (95% Cl 1.10-4.80), 1.56 (1.12-2.19), 4.75 (2.10-10.8) and 1.73 (1.29-2.32), respectively. The strongest risk factor was mental illness in the adolescents themselves with risk ratios 33.1 (16.5-66.5), 24.3 (6.64-88.7), 84.9 (7.17-1006) and 10.8 (7.75-15.0) for individuals hospitalised with schizophrenia, affective disorders, eating disorders or other psychiatric diagnoses and with an overall attributable risk of 15% (12-17%). The effect of parental socioeconomic variables decreased after adjustment for family history of mental illness.
   Discussion: Important targets in youth suicide prevention could be to decrease the prevalence of or ameliorating the negative effects of psychiatric illness including early recognition and optimal treatment. Reports of high relative risk associated with parental low socioeconomic status may be confounded and overestimated if not adjusted for the association with mental disorder and suicide in the family.

AB The aim of this study is to consider whether parents' abuse of alcohol has an impact on children during their formative years. The research is based on data from 84,765 children born in Denmark in 1966. These children and their parents were followed between 1979 and 1993. Information was analyzed from government registers covering health, education, family separation, suicidal behavior, criminality, and unemployment, using a discrete time Cox-regression model.
   Results showed that the parents' alcohol abuse may frame the childhood with parental violence, very high occurrence of family separations, and often foster care. The parental abuse of alcohol may influence several long-term consequences for their 15- to 27-year-old children such as increased mortality, self-destructive behaviors (e.g. attempted suicide or drug addiction). Hospitalization due to violence, an increased risk of teenage pregnancy and unemployment were also seen more frequently among cases where the parents were alcohol abusers. Mothers' alcohol abuse seemed to be associated with higher occurrences of all the mentioned disadvantages. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Little research has been conducted into the physical health implications of suicide bereavement compared to other causes of death. There is some evidence that suicide bereaved parents have higher morbidity, particularly in terms of chronic illness. This systematic review aims to examine the physical and psychosomatic morbidities of people bereaved by a family member's suicide and compare them with family members bereaved by other modes of death.
   Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched from 1985 to February 2016. The search was re-run in March 2017. Peer-reviewed English language articles comparing suicide-bereaved family members to non-suicide bereaved family members on measures of physical or psychosomatic health were eligible for inclusion. Cohort, cross-sectional, case-control and cohort-based register studies were eligible for inclusion. A modified version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used for quality assessment. Results were synthesised using narrative synthesis.
   Results: The literature search located 24 studies which met the inclusion criteria. Seven studies found statistically significant associations between physical health and suicide bereavement. Five of the studies found that suicide-bereaved family members were more likely to experience pain, more physical illnesses and poorer general health. They were also at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In contrast, another study in Denmark found that those bereaved by suicide had a lower risk of a number of physical health disorders, including cancers, diabetes, cardiovascular and chronic lower respiratory tract disorders compared to those bereaved by other causes of death. Additionally, a further study conducted in the United States found that suicide-bereaved children visited a GP less frequently than non-suicide bereaved children.
   Conclusions: Review findings are relevant for clinicians working with people bereaved by suicide as they highlight that such clients are at increased risk of several adverse physical health outcomes. Future research should examine health risk behaviours of suicide-bereaved and non-suicide bereaved family members as they may confound the association between exposure and outcome.

AB Background: Stress-related mental disorders (SRMD), which correspond to the diagnostic code F43 in the International Classification of Diseases, version 10, rank among the leading causes of sickness absence in several European countries. Despite the size of this health problem, research on risk factors for severe medical outcomes, like suicidal behavior, is lacking to date. The aim of this study was to investigate predictors of suicide attempt and suicide among sickness absentees with SRMD.
   Methods: A cohort of 36,304 non-retired individuals, aged 16-64 years on 31.12.2004, with at least one sickness absence spell due to SRMD, initiated in 2005, was followed up with regard to suicide attempt (2006-2009) and suicide (2006-2008). Univariate and multivariate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for a number of predictors.
   Results: During the follow-up period, 266 individuals attempted suicide and 34 committed suicide. In the multivariate analyses, the following factors increased the risk of suicide attempt: =<25 years of age, low educational level, lone parenthood, > 1 sickness absence spell, long duration of the first spell of sickness absence due to SRMD (> 180 days), > 4 and > 8 days of inpatient care due to somatic or mental diagnoses (2000-2005), and > 4 and > 1 outpatient visits due to somatic or mental diagnoses (2001-2005), respectively. Hazard ratios ranged from 1.4 to 4.2. Health care due to mental diagnoses and > 1 spell of sickness absence regardless of diagnosis were predictive of suicide.
   Conclusions: Several predictors related to socio-demographics, sickness absence and health-care consumption were identified as risk factors for suicidal behavior. Consideration of these risk factors is of both clinical and public health importance.

AB Objective: To estimate the Danish epidemiological long-term incidence rates for suicide attempts in the general population of children and adolescents, and to analyze the impact from single and multiple risk factors on the risk of suicide attempts.
   Method: We used longitudinal register data from a total cohort of all individuals born between 1983 and 1989 and living in Denmark to calculate incidence rates. From the cohort, we identified all who have attempted suicide, and matched 50 controls to each case. A nested case control design was used to estimate the impact from risk factors on the risk for index suicide attempts. We established a link to the biological parents and identified risk factors for two generations. Risk factors were analyzed in a conditional logistic regression model.
   Results: We identified 3718 suicide attennpters and 185,900 controls (189,618 individuals, aged 10-21 years). We found increasing incidence rates during the period 1994-2005, and higher incidence rates for girls and the oldest adolescents. Mental illness was the strongest independent risk factor (IRR = 4.77, CI = (4.35-5.23), p < 0.0001), but parental mental illness (psychopharmacological drugs: IRR = 1.27, CI = (1.18-1.37), p < 0.0001) and socio-demographic factors (parents not living together: IRR = 1.38, CI = (1.28-1.48), p < 0.0001) were also significant independent risk factors. Exposure to multiple risk factors increased the risk significantly.
   Conclusions: Suicide attempt is a multi-factorial problem, and a problem on the increase in the period studied. Individuals exposed to multiple risk factors are at the highest risk for suicide attempts, and when spotted or in contact with authorities they should be given proper care and treatment to prevent suicide attempts and death.

AB Objective: To examine if the suicide rate of older adults prescribed antidepressants varies with age and to assess the proportion of older adults who died by suicide that had recently been prescribed antidepressants. Methods: A population-based cohort study using a nationwide linkage of individual-level records was conducted on all persons aged 50+ living in Denmark during 1996-2006 (1,215,524 men and 1,343,568 women). Suicide rates by treatment status were calculated using data on all antidepressant prescriptions redeemed at pharmacies. Results: Individual-level data covered 9,354,620 and 10,720,639 person-years for men and women, respectively. Men aged 50-59 who received antidepressants had a mean suicide rate of 185 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 160-211) per 100,000, whereas for those aged 80+ the rate was 119 (95% CI: 91-146). For women, the corresponding values were 82 (95% CI: 70-94) and 28 (95% CI: 20-35). Logistic regression showed a 2% and 3% decline in the rate for men and women, respectively, considered in treatment with antidepressants, with each additional year of age. An opposite trend was found for persons not in treatment. Fewer persons aged 80+ dying by suicide had received antidepressant prescriptions during the last months of life than younger persons. Conclusion: An age-dependent decline in suicide rate for antidepressant recipients was identified. One reason could be that older adults respond better to antidepressants than younger age groups. Still, the increasing gap with age between estimated prevalence of depression and antidepressant prescription rate in persons dying by suicide underscores the need for assessment of depression in the oldest old.

AB Aims To examine the risk of suicide in users of beta -adrenoceptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.
   Methods We conducted a cohort study based on linkage of a population-based prescription registry in North Jutland County, Denmark, and the nation, vide Death Registry. From 1989 to 1995 there were 58 529 users of beta -adrenoceptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The mortality rates from suicides in the cohort members were compared with the rates in the general population.
   Results One hundred and four suicides occurred in the cohorts. The standardized mortality ratio for suicide in users of beta -adrenoceptor blockers was 1.6 (95% confidence interval: 1.2-2.1), in users of calcium channel blockers 1.2 (95% confidence interval: 0.8-1.7), and in users of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors 1.2 (95% confidence interval: 0.7-1.8). In users of beta -adrenoceptor blockers, the risk of suicide was increased during the first 12 months after the start of therapy, standardized mortality ratio 2.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.2-3.5). There was a trend in the standardized mortality ratio of suicide from 0.9 (95% confidence interval: 0.4-1.9) in users of beta -adrenoceptor blockers with low lipid solubility, to 1.6 (0.8-2.8) and 2.7 (1.7-4.1) in users of beta -adrenoceptor blockers with medium and high lipid solubility, respectively.
   Conclusions Users of medium and high lipid soluble beta -adrenoceptor blockers may have an increased risk of suicide. Users of calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors do not seem to have a significantly increased risk of suicide.

AB P>Background:
   With increasing research suggesting a role of allergy on suicidality, this study, on a population level, delved into how allergy affects risk for suicide completion in the context of mood disorder and other factors.
   Methods:
   Based on the entire population of Denmark, we included 27 096 completed suicides and 467 571 live controls matched on sex and age with a nested case-control design. We retrieved personal information on hospital contacts for allergy and other variables from various Danish longitudinal registries and analyzed the data with conditional logistic regression.
   Results:
   We noted that 1.17% suicide victims, compared with 0.79% matched controls, had a history of hospital contact for allergy and that a history of allergy predicted an increased risk for suicide completion; however, the effect was confined to allergy that led to inpatient treatment (IRR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.41-1.80). The increased risk was attenuated somewhat but remained significant when adjusted for personal psychiatric history and socioeconomic status. Meanwhile, we observed a nonsignificantly stronger effect in women than in men, and a significant age difference with a stronger effect for individuals at high ages. Moreover, we detected a significant interaction between allergy and mood disorder - even an antagonism effect of the two exposures. Allergy increased suicide risk only in persons with no history of mood disorder, whereas it eliminated suicide risk in those with a history of mood disorder.
   Conclusions:
   The findings support a link between allergy and suicidality, with a possible mediating role of mood disorder.

AB Objective During the past 30 years, various cardiovascular drugs have been implicated as causes of depression or suicide. Although the evidence for causal relationships has generally been conflicting, both beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) have been related to depression. Lipid-lowering therapies and calcium-channel blockers have also been linked to an increased risk of suicide. In this study, we investigated the possible association between the use of cardiovascular drugs and suicide using population-based register data.
   Methods We performed a nested case-control study in the county of Funen, Denmark, that consisted of 743 cases of completed suicide identified in a Death Registry for the period 1991-1998 and 14,860 age- and sex-matched controls. Information on previous drug use was retrieved from prescription data and the association between suicide and use of cardiovascular drugs was analysed by conditional logistic regression. Previous exposures to other drugs were used as proxies for potential confounding co-morbidities, including the use of psychotropic drugs to indicate psychiatric illness.
   Results The risk of suicide was not associated with current exposure to lipid-lowering drugs [odds ratio (OR): 1.21; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.45-3.28), calcium-channel blockers (OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.63-1.48), beta-blockers (OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.47-1.25) or ACE-inhibitors (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.68-1.83). Suicide risk was associated with current angiotensin-receptor antagonist use (OR: 3.52; 95% CI: 1.33-9.30) based on five of the cases exposed.
   Conclusion With the exception of the imprecise risk associated with current use of angiotensin-receptor antagonists, the results from our study do not support the hypothesis that other cardiovascular drugs are associated with an increased the risk of suicide.

AB Using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), we examined the predictive and incremental predictive validity of past-month suicidal behavior and ideation for short-term suicidal behavior among adolescents at high risk of suicide. The study was conducted in 2014 on a sample of 85 adolescents (90.6% females) who participated at follow-up (85.9%) out of the 99 (49.7%) baseline respondents. All adolescents were recruited from a specialized suicide-prevention clinic in Denmark. Through multivariate logistic regression analyses, we examined whether baseline suicidal behavior predicted subsequent suicidal behavior (actual attempts and suicidal behavior of any type, including preparatory acts, aborted, interrupted and actual attempts; mean follow-up of 80.8 days, SD = 52.4). Furthermore, we examined whether suicidal ideation severity and intensity incrementally predicted suicidal behavior at follow-up over and above suicidal behavior at baseline. Actual suicide attempts at baseline strongly predicted suicide attempts at follow-up. Baseline suicidal ideation severity and intensity did not significantly predict future actual attempts over and above baseline attempts. The suicidal ideation intensity items deterrents and duration were significant predictors of subsequent actual attempts after adjustment for baseline suicide attempts and suicidal behavior of any type, respectively. Suicidal ideation severity and intensity, and the intensity items frequency, duration and deterrents, all significantly predicted any type of suicidal behavior at follow-up, also after adjusting for baseline suicidal behavior. The present study points to an incremental predictive validity of the C-SSRS suicidal ideation scales for short-term suicidal behavior of any type among high-risk adolescents.

AB Suicide is an important cause of death among patients with epilepsy. In this report, we describe two patients with epilepsy whose brain examinations revealed cystic degeneration areas.
   The first case was a 42-year-old man who had been treated for epilepsy for five years. It was reported that his epilepsy attacks had increased over the six months prior to his suicide, and that he had severe conflicts with his wife during the last two months. He committed suicide by hanging. An autopsy revealed two cystic degeneration areas on the left temporal lobe, and one cystic degeneration area on the right parietal lobe.
   The second case was a 30-year-old man who had been receiving epilepsy treatment for 10 years. It was reported that his epilepsy attacks had increased in the four months prior to his suicide, and his wife had left home because of continuous arguments. He committed suicide by drinking rodenticide (aluminum phosphide). An autopsy revealed a cystic degeneration area on the right temporal lobe.
   Neither of the two cases had a history of head injury, and the cystic areas are evaluated as border zone infarcts due to prolonged hypoxemia caused by recurrent status epilepticus attacks. In conclusion, in case of the determination of the cystic degeneration areas in patients with epilepsy in computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging examinations, it will be beneficial to follow these patients in terms of epileptic attacks and psychiatric defects.

AB Knowledge of the epidemiology of suicide is a necessary prerequisite for developing prevention programs. The aim of this study was to analyze the risk of completed suicide among individuals with alcohol use disorders (AUD), and to assess the role of other psychiatric disorders in this association. A prospective cohort study was used, containing three updated sets of lifestyle covariates and 26 years follow-up of 18,146 individuals between 20 and 93 years of age from the Copenhagen City Heart Study in Denmark. The study population was linked to four different registers in order to detect: Completed suicide, AUD, Psychotic disorders, Anxiety disorders, Mood disorders, Personality disorders, Drug abuse, and Other psychiatric disorders. Individuals registered with AUD were at significantly increased risk of committing suicide, with a crude hazard ratio (FIR) of 7.98 [Confidence interval (CI): 5.27-12.07] compared to individuals without AUD. Adjusting for all psychiatric disorders the risk fell to 3.23 (CI: 1.96-5.33). In the stratified sub-sample of individuals without psychiatric disorders, the risk of completed suicide was 9.69 (CI: 4.88-19.25) among individuals with AUD. The results indicate that individuals registered with AUD are at highly increased risk of completed suicide, and that registered co-morbid psychiatric disorders are neither sufficient nor necessary causes in this association.

AB The studies presented compare two methodologies for categorizing suicidal patients based on clinical data. Discussion follows regarding implications for risk assessment and treatment. In these studies, 52 outpatient subjects were placed into different groups based on coding their suicidal motivation (Study 1) and their internal struggle ratings (Study 2) using data collected at intake. Self-report ratings of 6 Suicide Status Form (SSF) Core Constructs (Psychological Pain, Stress, Agitation, Hopelessness, Self-Hate, and Overall Risk of Suicide) recorded both at intake and at completion of treatment were then compared to determine differences in Core Construct ratings among groups at different time points. In Study 1, overall differences among motivation groups (Life-motivated, Ambivalent, and Death-motivated) were significant for ratings at treatment completion of Overall Risk of Suicide, Self-Hate, and Psychological Pain. In Study 2, overall differences among groups (Wish to live, Ambivalent, and Wish to die) were significant for ratings at intake of Overall Risk of Suicide. At completion of treatment, overall differences among groups were significant for ratings of Overall Risk of Suicide, Hopelessness, and Self-Hate. In addition, significant interactions were found between test time and group for Overall Risk of Suicide and Self-Hate. Results suggest that categorizing suicidal patients by motivation and by the nature of their internal struggle could be beneficial to differential risk assessment with implications for clinical treatment.

AB Restricting means for suicide is a key element in suicide prevention strategies of all countries where these have been introduced. Preventing deaths from analgesic overdoses is highlighted in the National Suicide Prevention Strategy for England. The problem of self-poisoning with the prescription-only drug co-proxamol (dextropropoxyphene plus paracetamol) has received attention in several countries. We have conducted a review of the international literature related to possible strategies to tackle this problem. In England and Wales in 1997-1999, 18% of drug-related suicides involved co-proxamol; these constituted 5% of all suicides. Death usually results from the toxic effects of dextropropoxyphene on respiration or cardiac function. Death from co-proxamol overdose may occur rapidly, the lethal dose can be relatively low, and the effects are potentiated by alcohol and other CNS depressants. The majority of co-proxamol overdose deaths occur before hospital treatment can be received. The risk can extend to others in the household of the person for whom the drug is prescribed. While there is limited evidence that educational strategies have been effective in reducing deaths from co-proxamol poisoning, initiatives in Scandinavia, Australia and the UK to restrict availability of co-proxamol have produced promising results. Given the paucity of evidence for superior therapeutic efficacy of co-proxamol over other less toxic analgesics, there are good reasons to question whether it should continue to be prescribed.

AB OBJECTIVES: To compare the effect of hospitalization with medical illnesses on the suicide risk in the oldest old (>= 80) with that in the old (65-79) and middle-aged (52-64) using nationwide data.
   DESIGN: Event-history analysis using time-varying covariates based on prospective individual-level register data.
   SETTING: Population-based record linkage.
   PARTICIPANTS: All persons aged 52 and older living in Denmark during 1996 to 1998 (N=1,684,205).
   MEASUREMENTS: The studied event is completed suicide. The following time-varying variables are included in the analysis: current age, hospitalization with medical illnesses within previous 2 years, and number of different medical diagnoses given at hospitalizations within previous 2 years. Relative suicide risks were calculated using event-history analysis. The proportional attributable risk was calculated to assess to which extent hospitalization can explain the increased suicide risk in the oldest old.
   RESULTS: During the 3-year study period, 1,184 persons committed suicide. Hospitalization with medical illnesses was associated with an increased suicide risk in the study population. The highest suicide rates were found in the oldest-old men who had been hospitalized during the previous 2 years: 113 per 100,000 versus 80 per 100,000 in the general population of men aged 80 and older. Also, the oldest-old women with a history of hospitalization had a higher suicide rate than their peer group. Nevertheless, the oldest old experienced a lower increase in risk after hospitalization than the middle-aged. Experiencing three or more different diagnoses increased the risk further. Almost two-thirds of the oldest old who committed suicide had experienced a medical hospitalization during a 2-year period preceding the suicide. A substantial part of the greater suicide rate in the oldest old than in the middle-aged can be attributed to the increased prevalence of medical hospitalization.
   CONCLUSION: The oldest old who have been hospitalized with medical illnesses have a significantly higher suicide risk than people in the same age range with no hospitalization, although they experience a lower increase in risk after hospitalization than the middle-aged. The increased prevalence of medical illnesses explains a part of the greater suicide risk with age, especially for the oldest old women. Considering that hospitalization with medical illness often precedes suicide in the oldest old, hospitalization may play an important role in identification of suicidal ideation in older people.

TI Frequent Change of Residence and Risk of Attempted and Completed Suicide
   Among Children and Adolescents
SO ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY

DT Article
ID SOCIAL INTEGRATION; MOBILITY; HEALTH; REGISTER
AB Context: In contemporary society, people change their place of residence frequently. However, large-scale population studies documenting the influence of frequent moves on mental health among children and adolescents are limited.
   Objective: To evaluate the influence of frequent change of residence on risk of attempted and completed suicide among children and adolescents.
   Design, Setting, and Participants: We used data from Danish longitudinal population registries to identify all children born from 1978 to 1995 in Denmark; 4160 of these children attempted suicide, and 79 completed suicide at ages 11 to 17 years. We adopted a nested case-control design and recruited 30 controls per case, matched individually on sex, age, and calendar time.
   Main Outcome Measure: We used conditional logistic regression to compute the incidence rate ratio for attempted and/or completed suicide associated with the number of previous changes of residence.
   Results: We observed a significantly increased risk of attempted suicide associated with changes of living address, and there was an apparent dose-response trend for this association-the more frequent incidence of moving, the higher the risk for attempted suicide. This trend remained the same after controlling for possible confounding factors at birth, ie, birth order, birthplace, link to a father, and parental age at birth. However, it was somewhat attenuated, but still significant, after controlling for the child's own psychiatric morbidity and loss of a mother or father, as well as parental psychiatric history. The observed association was neither modified by sex nor age at the time of moving. Further analyses of suicide completers demonstrated a similar association between change of residence and completed suicide.
   Conclusions: Frequent change of residence may induce distress among children and, therefore, increase their risk of suicidal behavior. More research is needed to explore this association.

AB Background: Few studies have investigated how area-level deprivation influences the relationship between individual disadvantage and suicide mortality. The aim of this study was to examine individual measures of material and social disadvantage in relation to suicide mortality in Canada and to determine whether these relationships were modified by area deprivation.
   Methods: Using the 1991-2001 Canadian Census Mortality Follow-up Study cohort (N = 2,685,400), measures of individual social (civil status, family structure, living alone) and material (education, income, employment) disadvantage were entered into Cox proportional hazard models to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for male and female suicide mortality. Two indices of area deprivation were computed one capturing social, and the other material, dimensions - and models were run separately for high versus low deprivation.
   Results: After accounting for individual and area characteristics, individual social and material disadvantage were associated with higher suicide mortality, especially for individuals not employed, not married, with low education and low income. Associations between social and material area deprivation and suicide mortality largely disappeared upon adjustment for individual-level disadvantage. In stratified analyses, suicide risk was greater for low income females in socially deprived areas and males living alone in materially deprived areas, and there was no evidence of other modifying effects of area deprivation.
   Conclusions: Individual disadvantage was associated with suicide mortality, particularly for males. With some exceptions, there was little evidence that area deprivation modified the influence of individual disadvantage on suicide risk. Prevention strategies should primarily focus on individuals who are unemployed or out of the labour force, and have low education or income. Individuals with low income or who are living alone in deprived areas should also be targeted.

AB Background: Previous studies have suggested that early parental death may be associated with the emergence of bipolar disorder in later life. However, it remains unknown whether this association applies specifically to parental death due to suicide or only to early parental death. The present study aimed to explore whether suicide as well as the non-suicidal death of father, mother, or siblings are associated with an increased risk for bipolar disorder, and whether the possible association is modified by the age at which the subject experiences such a death in the family.
   Methods: The subjects were born in 1960 or later and were first admitted to or had first contact with Danish psychiatric facilities between 1981 and 1998 with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and fifty age-matched controls per case were extracted. The effects of the deaths of relatives were estimated by means of a conditional logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Among 947 subjects with bipolar disorder and 47,350 controls, those having experienced the parental suicide were significantly associated with an increased risk for BPD (incidence rate ratios: 1.83 [95% confidence interval: 1.07 to 3.12] for paternal suicide, 3.44 [1.97 to 6.00] for maternal suicide), whereas the non-suicidal death of parents showed no such association. Those having experienced maternal suicide at some point before reaching 10 years of age were seven times as likely to develop bipolar disorder.
   Limitations: The cohort members were followed until, but not exceeding, the age of 38.
   Conclusion: Early parental, particularly maternal, suicide increases the risk for bipolar disorder in the offspring. Possible explanations include a family history of mental disorders as well as psychosocial factors. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Study objective: Suicides cluster in both families and persons with psychiatric disorders and socioeconomic disadvantages. This study compares these factors between suicide cases, their siblings, and population based controls in an attempt to evaluate both the familial and the individual element of these factors.
   Design: Nested case-control study. Information on causes of death, psychiatric admission, marital status, children, and socioeconomic factors was obtained from routine registers.
   Setting: Denmark.
   Participants: 985 suicide cases, 1104 sex-age (+/- 3 years) matched siblings, and 16619 controls.
   Main results: The suicide rate ratios obtained from the case-sibling and the case-control analysis, respectively, were of similar magnitude. For example, in the case-sibling analysis the adjusted suicide rate ratios associated with discharge from a psychiatric hospital within the previous 365 days, being unemployed the previous year, having a postgraduate degree and being single were 42.13 (95% CI 17.75 to 100.02), 1.78 (1.35 to 2.36), 0.51 (0.21 to 1.26), and 2.69 (1.91 to 3.79), respectively. The corresponding rate ratios obtained from the case-control analysis were 47.91 (35.41 to 64.83), 1.76 (1.49 to 2.08), 0.45 (0.26 to 0.76), and 2.39 (1.87 to 3.07). Moreover, the analogous ratios when comparing siblings and controls were 1.98 (1.08 to 3.63), 1.22 (1.06 to 1.41), 0.65 (0.44 to 0.95), and 0.89 (0.75 to 1.06).
   Conclusions: People who commit suicide deviate similarly from siblings and controls in exposure to hospitalised psychiatric disorders and socioeconomic disadvantages, although these factors contribute to the familial aggregation of suicides.

AB We investigate whether job loss due to plant closure causes an increased risk of (cause-specific) mortality and hospitalization for male workers having strong labour market attachment. We use administrative data: a panel of all persons in Denmark in the period 1980-2006, containing records on health and work status, and a link from workers to plants. We use propensity score weighting combined with non-parametric duration analysis. We find that job loss increases the risk of overall mortality and mortality caused by circulatory disease: of suicide and suicide attempts; and of death and hospitalization due to traffic accidents, alcohol-related disease, and mental illness.

AB Background Studies have linked epilepsy with an increased suicide risk, but the association might be modified by psychiatric, demographic, and socioeconomic factors.
   Methods Suicide cases were identified in the Cause of Death Register in Denmark from 1981 to 1997. Up to 20 controls, matched by sex, birth year, and calendar date, were assigned to each suicide case.
   Findings We identified 21169 cases of suicide and 423 128 controls. 492 (2 center dot 32%) individuals who committed suicide had epilepsy compared with 3140 (0 center dot 74%) controls, corresponding to a three times higher risk (rate ratio [RR] 3 center dot 17 [95% CI 2 center dot 88-3 center dot 50]; p<0 center dot 0001). The RR remained high after excluding those with a history of psychiatric disease and adjusting for socioeconomic factors (1 center dot 99, 1 center dot 71-2 center dot 32; p<0 center dot 0001). The highest risk of suicide was identified in patients with epilepsy and comorbid psychiatric disease, even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors (13 center dot 7, 11 center dot 8-16 center dot 0; p<0 center dot 0001). In individuals with epilepsy, the highest risk of suicide was found during the first half year after diagnosis was made (5 center dot 35, 3.43-8 center dot 33; p<0 center dot 0001), and was especially high in those with a history of comorbid psychiatric disease (29 center dot 2, 16 center dot 4-51 center dot 9; p<0 center dot 0001).
   Interpretation Individuals with epilepsy have a higher risk of suicide, even if coexisting psychiatric disease, demographic differences, and socioeconomic factors are taken into account. Our study identifies people with newly diagnosed epilepsy as a vulnerable group that require special attention.

TI Paracetamol poisoning among immigrants in a department of hepatology
SO DANISH MEDICAL BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
ID SUICIDE; METABOLISM; BORN
AB Introduction: An increased incidence of suicides and suicidal behaviour among immigrants has been described in other countries. In Denmark, misuse of paracetamol is suspected in some foreign-born minority groups, although no data have been produced to substantiate this suspicion.
   Methodology. A retrospective study of the incidence of paracetamol poisoning in patients admitted to a specialised department of hepatology from 1994 to 1999 was carried our.
   Results: Of a total of 580 patients, 56 (9.7%; 95%-conridrnce interval 7.2-12.1%)were immigrants, among whom a significant overrepresentation was found of immigrants from Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, and Lebanon (Observed/ Expected-ratios of 1.95, 4.14, 2.67, and 2.45 respectively: p <0.05). The immigrants differed from the Danish-born patients being younger(21 vs 35 years of age; p<0.05), having a lower level of alcohol consumption (3% vs 30% with regular alcohol abuse; p<less than>0.05), and in general being less severely intoxicated (3% vs 22% developing hepatic encephalopathy; p<0.05). Compared to the Danish-born patients, the immigrants more frequently stated socio-economic problems as the reason for their self-poisoning (29% vs 10%; p<less than>0.05).
   Conclusions: The study demonstrates an overrepresentation of immigrants among patients admitted with paracetamol poisoning in Denmark.

TI The relationship between sales of SSRI, TCA and suicide rates in the
   Nordic countries
SO BMC PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID ANTIDEPRESSANTS; ASSOCIATION; PREVENTION
AB Background: In the period 1990-2006, strong and almost equivalent increases in sales figures of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were observed in all Nordic countries. The sales figures of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) dropped in Norway and Sweden in the nineties. After 2000, sales figures of TCAs have been almost constant in all Nordic countries. The potentially toxic effect of TCAs in overdose was an important reason for replacing TCAs with SSRIs when treating depression. We studied whether the rapid increase in sales of SSRIs and the corresponding decline in TCAs in the period 1990-98 were associated with a decline in suicide rates.
   Methods: Aggregated suicide rates for the period 1975-2006 in four Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) were obtained from the national causes-of-death registries. The sales figures of antidepressants were provided from the wholesale registers in each of the Nordic countries. Data were analysed using Fisher's exact test and Pearson's correlation coefficient.
   Results: There was no statistical association (P = 1.0) between the increase of sales figures of SSRIs and the decline in suicide rates. There was no statistical association (P = 1.0) between the decrease in the sale figures of TCAs and change in suicide rates either.
   Conclusions: We found no evidence for the rapid increase in use of SSRIs and the corresponding decline in sales of TCAs being associated with a decline in the suicide rates in the Nordic countries in the period 1990-98. We did not find any inverse relationship between the increase in sales of SSRIs and declining suicide rates in four Nordic

AB Background. Little is known about suicide risk among offspring of parents hospitalized for schizophrenia and the mechanisms behind this association.
   Method. We applied a nested case-control design based on linkage of Swedish population-based registers. Among 12- to 30-year-old offspring, we identified 68 318 offspring with suicidal behavior (attempted and completed suicide) and their parents. Five healthy control-parent pairs were matched to each suicidal case-parent pair and conditional logistic regression used to obtain odds ratios (ORs). Further, to disentangle familial confounding from causal environmental mechanisms, we compared the population-based suicide risk with the risk found within full-cousins and half-cousins differentially exposed to parental schizophrenia.
   Results. Offspring of parents with schizophrenia had significantly increased suicide risk after accounting for socio-economic status, parental suicidal behavior and offspring mental illness [OR 1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.53-1.85]. Suicide risks in offspring of schizophrenic mothers and fathers were similar in magnitude; so were risks across different developmental periods. Importantly, offspring suicide risk remained essentially unchanged across genetically different relationships; offspring of siblings discordant for schizophrenia had equivalent risk increases within full-cousins (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.66-2.31) and half-cousins (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.17-2.44).
   Conclusions. Parental schizophrenia was associated with increased risk of offspring suicidal behavior, independent of gender of the schizophrenic parent, and persisting into adulthood. The suicide risk in offspring remained at a similar level when comparing genetically different relationships, which suggests that at least part of the association is due to environmental mechanisms. These findings should inspire increased attention to suicidal ideation and prevention efforts in offspring of parents with schizophrenia.

AB Background: Excess mortality among patients with severe mental disorders has not previously been investigated in detail in large complete national populations.
   Objective: To investigate the excess mortality in different diagnostic categories due to suicide and other external causes of death, and due to specific causes in connection with diseases and medical conditions.
   Methods: In longitudinal national psychiatric case registers from Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, a cohort of 270,770 recent-onset patients, who at least once during the period 2000 to 2006 were admitted due to a psychiatric disorder, were followed until death or the end of 2006. They were followed for 912,279 person years, and 28,088 deaths were analyzed. Life expectancy and standardized cause-specific mortality rates were estimated in each diagnostic group in all three countries.
   Results: The life expectancy was generally approximately 15 years shorter for women and 20 years shorter for men, compared to the general population. Mortality due to diseases and medical conditions was increased two-to three-fold, while excess mortality from external causes ranged from three-to 77-fold. Mortality due to diseases and medical conditions was generally lowest in patients with affective disorders and highest in patients with substance abuse and personality disorders, while mortality due to suicide was highest in patients with affective disorders and personality disorders, and mortality due to other external causes was highest in patients with substance abuse.
   Conclusions: These alarming figures call for action in order to prevent the high mortality.

AB Suicide rates doubled in males aged < 45 in England and Wales between 1950 and 1998, in contrast rates declined in older males and females of all ages. Explanations for these divergent trends are largely speculative, but social changes are likely to have played an important role. We undertook a time-series analysis using routinely available age- and sex-specific suicide, social, economic and health data, focussing on the two age groups in which trends have diverged most-25-34 and 60 + year olds. Between 1950 and 1998 there were unfavourable trends in many of the risk factors for suicide: rises in divorce, unemployment and substance misuse and declines in births and marriage. Whilst economic prosperity has increased, so too has income inequality. Trends in suicide risk factors were generally similar in both age-sex groups, although the rises in divorce and markers of substance misuse were most marked in 25-34 year olds and young males experienced the lowest rise in antidepressant prescribing. Statistical modelling indicates that no single factor can be identified as underlying recent trends. The factors most consistently associated with the rises in young male suicide are increases in divorce, declines in marriage and increases in income inequality. These changes have had little effect on suicide in young females. This may be because the drugs commonly used in overdose-their favoured method of suicide-have become less toxic or because they are less affected by the factors underlying the rise in male suicide. In older people declines in suicide were associated with increases in gross domestic product, the size of the female workforce, marriage and the prescribing of antidepressants. Recent population trends in suicide appear to be associated with by a range of social and health related factors. It is possible that some of the patterns observed are due to declining levels of social integration, but such effects do not appear to have adversely influenced patterns in older generations.

AB Objectives: To investigate whether first admission with mania is associated with the occurrence of death in the family or with major stressful life events and to explore whether the associations change with age.
   Methods: Case register study with linkage of the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register, including data on all admissions at psychiatric wards in Denmark from 1981 to 1998, and the Civil Registration System, including data on death and on socio-demographic variables. All patients who got a diagnosis of mania/mixed episode at the first ever admission at a psychiatric ward and a random gender- and age-matched control group of subjects who had never been admitted to psychiatric ward were identified.
   Results: A total of 1565 patients and 31 300 control subjects were identified. Suicide of a mother or of a sibling was associated with a highly increased risk of being admitted for the first time ever at a psychiatric ward with a diagnosis of mania/mixed episode. Death of a relative by other causes than suicide was not associated with increased risk of getting hospitalized with mania. Recent unemployment, recent divorce, but also a recent marriage showed moderate effects. No interaction was found on the association between life events and the first admission with mania, totally, or for men or women, separately regarding ageing.
   Conclusions: The occurrence of death in the family and the experience of major life events are associated with increased risk of first admission with bipolar disorder. The susceptibility to major life stressors of inducing mania does not seem to change throughout life.

TI Long-Term Unemployment and Suicide: A Systematic Review and
   Meta-Analysis

   DENMARK; LENGTH; HEALTH; IMPACT
AB Purpose: There have been a number of reviews on the association+ between unemployment and suicide, but none have investigated how this relationship is influenced by duration of unemployment.
   Method: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of those studies that assessed duration of unemployment as a risk factor for suicide. Studies considered as eligible for inclusion were population-based cohort or case-control designs; population-based ecological designs, or hospital based clinical cohort or case-control designs published in the year 1980 or later.
   Results: The review identified 16 eligible studies, out of a possible 10,358 articles resulting from a search of four databases: PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Scopus and Proquest. While all 16 studies measured unemployment duration in different ways, a common finding was that longer duration of unemployment was related to greater risk of suicide and suicide attempt. A random effects meta-analysis on a subsample of six cohort studies indicated that the pooled relative risk of suicide in relation to average follow-up time after unemployment was 1.70 (95% CI 1.22 to 2.18). However, results also suggested a possible habituation effect to unemployment over time, with the greatest risk of suicide occurring within five years of unemployment compared to the employed population (RR = 2.50, 95% CI 1.83 to 3.17). Relative risk appeared to decline in studies of those unemployed between 12 and 16 years compared to those currently employed (RR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.33).
   Conclusion: Findings suggest that long-term unemployment is associated with greater incidence of suicide. Results of the meta-analysis suggest that risk is greatest in the first five years, and persists at a lower but elevated level up to 16 years after unemployment. These findings are limited by the paucity of data on this topic.

AB Objective To assess whether an assertive outreach intervention after suicide attempt could reduce the frequency of subsequent suicidal acts, compared with standard treatment.
   Design Randomised, parallel group, superiority trial with blinded outcome assessment.
   Setting Outpatient intervention at one location at Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark.
   Participants Patients older than 12 years admitted to regional hospitals in Copenhagen with a suicide attempt within the past 14 days. We excluded patients diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and patients living in institutions.
   Intervention Case management through assertive outreach that provided crisis intervention and flexible problem solving. This approach incorporated motivational support and actively assisted patients to scheduled appointments to improve adherence with after-treatment as an add on to standard treatment.
   Main outcome Repeated suicide attempt and death by suicide, recorded in medical records and death register at 1-year follow-up.
   Results 243 patients were included. During 12 months of follow-up, 20/123 (16%) patients in the intervention group had been registered in hospital records with subsequent suicide attempt, compared with 13/120 (11%) in the control group (odds ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 3.38; P = 0.22). By contrast, self reported data on new events showed 11/95 (12%) in the intervention group versus 13/74 (18%) in the control group (0.61, 0.26 to 1.46; P = 0.27). By imputing missing data on the selfreported outcomes, we estimated 15/123 (12%) events in the intervention group and 23/120 (19%) in the control group (0.69, 0.34 to 1.43; P = 0.32).
   Conclusion Assertive outreach showed no significant effect on subsequent suicide attempt. The difference in rates of events between register data and self reported data could indicate detection bias.

AB Objective: This study analyzed trends in suicides occurring after a psychiatric hospitalization during more than a decade of significant structural changes in mental health services in Finland-that is, deinstitutionalization, downsizing of inpatient care, and decentralization. Methods: Retrospective register data on completed suicides and psychiatric inpatient treatments were collected for the periods 1985-1991 and 1995-2001, representing service provision before and after significant structural changes. The data were used to produce an estimate for a change in postdischarge suicide risk. Results: In both periods, a fifth of suicide victims had been psychiatrically hospitalized within the preceding year. Among persons hospitalized, the risk of suicide was greater in 1985-1991 than in 1995-2001 for both one week after discharge (risk ratio [RR]=1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]= 1.38-1.62) and one year after discharge (RR=1.25, CI=1.19-1.30). When types of disorders were analyzed separately, the relative risk of suicide one year postdischarge for those hospitalized in the earlier period was greater for patients with schizophrenia (RR=1.26, CI=1.17-1.36) and patients with affective disorders (RR=1.60, CI=1.48-1.73). In parallel with general development of inpatient psychiatric services, in 1995-2001 the inpatient treatment periods preceding suicides were significantly shorter (a mean +/- SD of 45 +/- 340 days in 1995-2001, compared with a mean of 98 +/- 558 days in 1985-1991), the number of individual patients treated in the hospital for schizophrenia spectrum disorders was lower (26% compared with 36%), and the number treated for affective disorders was higher (45% compared with 35%). Conclusions: The restructuring and downsizing of mental health services was not associated with any increase in suicides immediately (one week) or one year postdischarge. Instead, the risk of these suicides decreased significantly between the two time periods among several diagnostic categories. Although the role of psychiatric hospitalization in general may have changed over time, patients who are hospitalized now may be less suicidal after discharge. Our results indicate, in terms of postdischarge suicides, that the downsizing of psychiatric hospitals has been a success. However, there is still a substantial need for better recognition of suicidal risk among psychiatric patients.

AB The overall importance of a risk factor for suicide in a population is determined not only by the relative risk (RR) of suicide but also the prevalence of the risk factor in the population, which can be combined with the RR to calculate the population attributable risk (PAR). This study compares risk factors from two well studied domains of suicide research - socio-economic deprivation (relatively low RR, but high population prevalence) and mental disorders (relatively high RR risk, but low population prevalence). RR and PAR associated with suicide was estimated for high prevalence ICD-10/DSM-IV psychiatric disorders and measures of socio-economic status (SES) from individual-level, population-based studies. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of population-based case-control and cohort studies of suicide where relative risk estimates for males and females could be extracted. RR for any mental disorder was 7.5 (6.2-9.0) for males and 11.7 (9.7-14.1) for females, compared to RR for the lowest SES groups of 2.1 (1.5-2.8) for males and 1.5 (1.2-1.9) for females. PAR in males for low educational achievement (41%, range 19-47%) and low occupational status (33%, range 21-42%) was of a similar magnitude to affective disorders (26%. range 7-45%) and substance use disorders (9%, range 5-24%). Similarly in females the PAR for low educational achievement (20%, range 19-22%) was of a similar magnitude to affective disorders (32%, range 19-67%), substance use disorder (25%, range 5-32%) and anxiety disorder (12%, range 6-22%). The findings of the present study suggest that prevention strategies which focus on lower socio-economic strata (more distal risk factors) have the potential to have similar population-level effects as strategies which target more proximal psychiatric risk factors in the prevention and control of suicide.

AB Background: Selected groups of patients with bipolar and unipolar disorder have an increased mortality rate from suicide and natural causes of death. However, there has been no population-based study of mortality of patients followed up from the onset of the illness.
   Methods: All patients with a hospital diagnosis of bipolar (n = 15386) or unipolar (n = 39182) disorder in Sweden from 1973 to 1995 were identified from the inpatient register and linked with the national cause-of-death register to determine the date and cause of death. Overall and cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and numbers of excess deaths were calculated by 5-year age classes and 5-year calendar periods.
   Results: The SMRs for suicide were 15.0 for males and 22.4 for females with bipolar disorder, and 20.9 and 27.0, respectively, for unipolar disorder. For all natural causes of death, SMRs were 1.9 for males and 2.1 for females with bipolar disorder, and 1.5 and 1.6, respectively, for unipolar disorder. For bipolar disorder, most excess deaths were from natural causes, whereas for unipolar disorder, most excess deaths were from unnatural causes. The SMR for suicide was especially high for younger patients during the first years after the first diagnosis. Increasing SMR for suicide during the period of study was found for female patients with unipolar disorder.
   Conclusions: This population-based study of patients treated in the hospital documented increased SMRs for suicide in patients with bipolar and unipolar disorder. The SMR for all natural causes of death was also increased, causing about half the excess deaths.

AB We conducted a national epidemiological study to determine how mental illness and criminal offending combine to influence suicide risk in younger adults.
   Using completely interlinked registers, we generated a nested case-control study from the cohort of all Danish people born 1965 and onwards. We identified 2,384 suicides aged 15-41 years during 1981-2006, and 56,016 age and sex-matched living controls. We examined all criminal charges from 1980, and all psychiatric admissions from 1969 and outpatient episodes from 1995. Exposure odds ratios were estimated using conditional logistic regression models.
   A quarter of male and 17 % of female suicides had histories of both criminal justice system contact and secondary care psychiatric treatment, with a marked elevation in risk seen compared with having neither risk factor: male odds ratio (OR) 34.0, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 29.1-39.6; female OR 72.7, CI 49.4-107.1. Among those treated for psychiatric illness, contact with the criminal justice system predicted higher risk: male OR 1.4, CI 1.1-1.7; female OR 1.7, CI 1.1-2.4, although these effects were attenuated and became non-significant with adjustment for socio-demographic risk factors. In men, risk was especially high if first criminal justice system contact occurred before first psychiatric treatment episode, and if these two challenging life events coalesced within a year of each other.
   These younger age adults should be monitored carefully for signs of suicidal behaviour. The need for well coordinated multiagency care is indicated, and a broad range of psychiatric illnesses should be considered carefully when assessing their suicide risk.

TI A Life-Course Study on Effects of Parental Markers of Morbidity and
   Mortality on Offspring's Suicide Attempt
SO PLOS ONE

   DENMARK; DEATH
AB Background: Research on the temporal relationship of parental risk factors with offspring's suicide attempt is scarce and a life course approach has not been applied to date. We investigated the temporal relationship of parental morbidity and mortality with offspring's suicide attempt and whether any such association was modified by offspring's age at attempt.
   Methods: We designed a case-control study through linkage of Swedish registers. Cases comprised all individuals in Sweden born 1973-1983 with inpatient care due to suicide attempt (15-31 years of age) and with information on both biological parents (N = 15 193). Ten controls were matched to each case (National Patient register with national complete coverage). Conditional logistic and spline regressions were applied.
   Results: Particularly for women, most parental markers showed the strongest effect sizes if exposure was short-term (within 2 years after exposure) and related to the mother. Especially short-term exposure to maternal inpatient care due to psychiatric diagnoses had a significantly stronger effect on suicide attempt risk in women compared to men. Regarding exposure to parental inpatient care due to psychiatric diagnoses, short-term as opposed to long-term (exceeding 2 years after exposure) effects were highest during adolescence and decreased significantly with age for female and male offspring, respectively.
   Conclusions: Although limited by the fact that data on parental morbidity and the outcome of suicidality were based on inpatient data only, the data suggest that the high risks of suicide attempt in case of exposure to parental psychopathology and suicidal behavior particularly during adolescence and the strong short-term effects associated with maternal psychopathology for female offspring are of direct clinical importance.

AB IMPORTANCE Bereavement after spousal suicide has been linked to mental disorders; however, a comprehensive assessment of the effect of spousal suicide is needed.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether bereavement after spousal suicide was linked to an excessive risk of mental, physical, and social health outcomes when compared with the general population and spouses bereaved by other manners.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This nationwide, register-based cohort study conducted in Denmark of 6.7 million individuals aged 18 years and older from 1980 to 2014 covered more than 136 million person-years and compared people bereaved by spousal suicide with the general population and people bereaved by other manners of death. Incidence rate ratios were calculated using Poisson regressions while adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and the presence of mental and physical disorders.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mental disorders (any disorder, mood, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, alcohol use disorders, drug use disorders, and self-harm); physical disorders (cancers, diabetes, sleep disorder, cardiovascular diseases, chronic lower respiratory tract diseases, liver cirrhosis, and spinal disc herniation); causes of mortality (all-cause, natural, unintentional, suicide, and homicide); social health outcomes; and health care use.
   RESULTS The total study population included 3 491 939 men, 4814 of whom were bereaved by spousal suicide, and 3 514 959 women, 10 793 of whom were bereaved by spousal suicide. Spouses bereaved by a partner's suicide had higher risks of developing mental disorders within 5 years of the loss (men: incidence rate ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.6-2.0; women: incidence rate ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.6-1.8) than the general population. Elevated risks for developing physical disorders, such as cirrhosis and sleep disorders, were also noted as well as the use of more municipal support, sick leave benefits, and disability pension funds than the general population. Compared with spouses bereaved by other manners of death, those bereaved by suicide had higher risks for developing mental disorders (men: incidence rate ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.5-1.9; women: incidence rate ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.9-2.2), suicidal behaviors, mortality, and municipal support. Additionally, a higher level of mental health care use was noted.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Exposure to suicide is stressful and affects the bereaved spouse on a broad range of outcomes. The excess risks of mental, physical, and social health outcomes highlight a need for more support directed toward spouses bereaved by suicide.

TI Death and suicide among former child and adolescent psychiatric patients
SO BMC PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID EXCESS MORTALITY; BEHAVIOR; DENMARK
AB Background: Increased mortality rates among previous child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) patients have been found in Scandinavian studies up to the 1980s. The suicide risk in this group has been estimated to be almost five times higher than expected. This article addresses two questions: Do Swedish CAP patients continue to risk premature death and what kind of information related to psychiatric symptoms and/or behavior problems can predict later suicide?
   Methods: Hospital files, Sweden's census databases (including immigration and emigration) and administrative databases (including the Swedish Hospital Discharge register and the Persons Convicted of Offences register), and the Cause of Death register were examined to determine the mortality rate in a group of 1,400 former CAP inpatients and outpatients over a period of 12-33 years. Observed and expected numbers of deceased were calculated with the prospective method and the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) method. The relative risk or the risk ratio (RR) is presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Significance level tests were made using two-by-two tables and chi-square tests. The Cox proportional-hazards regression model was used for survival analysis.
   Results: Twenty-four males and 14 females died. Compared with the general population, the standardized mortality ratio in this group of CAP patients was significantly higher in both sexes. Behavioral problems, school problems, and co-morbid alcohol or drug abuse and criminality (including alcohol-related crimes) were found to be important predictors. Thirty-two deaths were attributed to suicide, intoxication, drug overdose, or accident; one patient died of an alcohol abuse-related disorder, and five patients died of natural causes. Suicide was the most common cause of death, but only 2 of these 19 cases were initially admitted for attempted suicide.
   Conclusion: We suggest that suicide and death prevention among CAP patients may not be a psychiatric issue per se but a future function of society's juvenile social-welfare investments and juvenile-delinquency prevention programs.

AB Background. Poisoning with weak analgesics is a major public health problem because of easy accessibility of the compounds; however, few studies have investigated their influence on subsequent suicide in the context of subjects' psychiatric status and other factors.
   Method. This nested case-control study was based on the entire Danish population including all 21169 suicide cases and 423128 matched population controls. Data on hospital admissions for poisoning and confounding factors were retrieved from national medical and administrative registries. Conditional logistic regression was used to compute relative risk.
   Results. A prior hospital admission for poisoning with weak non-opioid analgesics significantly increased the risk Of Subsequent suicide [crude incidence rate ratio (IRR) 24.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 22.1-27.6], and the effect of paracetamol poisoning was substantially stronger than that of poisoning with salicylates or non-steriodal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This association could not be explained by confounding from socio-economic or psychiatric factors. The elevated risk was extremely high during the first week following the overdose (adjusted IRR 738.9, 95%, CI 173.9-.1139.1), then declined over time but still remained significantly high 3 years later (adjusted IRR 4.2, 95% CI 3.5-5.0). Moreover, a history of weak analgesic poisoning significantly interacted with a person's psychiatric history, increasing the risk for Subsequent suicide substantially more for persons with no history of psychiatric hospitalization than did it for those with such a history.
   Conclusions. A history of non-fatal poisoning with weak analgesics is a strong predictor for subsequent Suicide. These results emphasize the importance of intensive psychiatric care of patients following overdose.

AB Background: Homeless people have elevated mortality, especially due to external causes. We aimed to examine suicide and unintentional injury mortality levels and identify predictors in the homeless population. Methods: A nationwide, register-based cohort study of homeless people aged 16 years and older was carried out using the Danish Homeless Register, 1999-2008. Results: In all, 32 010 homeless people (70.5% men) were observed. For men, the mortality rate was 174.4 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 150.6-198.1] per 100 000 person-years for suicide and 463.3 (95% CI = 424.6-502.0) for unintentional injury. For women, the corresponding rates were 111.4 (95% CI = 81.7-141.1) for suicide and 241.4 (95% CI = 197.6-285.1) for unintentional injury. Schizophrenia spectrum, affective, personality and substance use disorders were strongly associated with increased risk of suicide; the highest risk estimates were found for schizophrenia spectrum disorders among both men [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.1, 95% CI = 2.0-4.9] and women (HR = 15.5, 95% CI = 4.5-54.0). Alcohol and drug use disorders were predictors of death by unintentional injury for both men and women, whereas schizophrenia spectrum disorders and personality disorders were only significant predictors among men; the highest risk estimates were found for drug use disorders among men (HR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.8-2.8) and women (HR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.8-5.4). A history of psychiatric admission and emergency room contact were predictors for dying by suicide and unintentional injury. Conclusion: People in the homeless shelter population with a history of a psychiatric disorder constitute a high-risk group regarding the elevated suicide and unintentional injury mortality.

   Our nationwide register-based cohort study comprises 1,225,660 people born in Denmark in 1970-1990, of whom 138,893 experienced the death of a parent before the age of 30 years. Follow-up for hospitalization for an affective disorder in the period 1990-2009 yielded 15,261,058 person-years and 19,867 hospitalizations for affective disorder (bereaved n = 2,644; nonbereaved n = 17,223). A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess hazard ratios (HRs) for hospitalization with an affective disorder according to early parental death.
   Results:
   People who experienced early parental death had an increased risk of hospitalization for a unipolar disorder (men: HR= 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23-1.44; women: 1.23; 1.17-1.30). Stronger associations were observed for parental death caused by suicide than for other causes. For bipolar affective disorder, an increased risk of hospitalization was observed only after suicide.
   Conclusions:
   People who had lost a parent had an increased risk of hospitalization for unipolar affective disorder. Although this was particularly true for bereavement due to parental suicide, it was also found for parental death from other causes. In contrast, an increased risk of hospitalization for bipolar affective disorder was observed only after parental suicide.

TI Persistent suicide risk in clinically improved schizophrenia patients:
   challenge of the suicidal dimension
SO NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT

ID MENTAL-DISORDERS; LIFETIME RISK; MORTALITY; DENMARK
AB Background: Suicide is a major problem in schizophrenia, estimated to affect 9%-13% of patients. About 25% of schizophrenic patients make at least one suicide attempt in their lifetime. Current outcome measures do not address this problem, even though it affects quality of life and patient safety. The aim of this study was to assess suicidality in long-term clinically improved schizophrenia patients who were treated in a nongovernmental psychiatric treatment centre in Mumbai, India.
   Method: Participants were 61 patients out of 200 consecutive hospitalized first-episode patients with schizophrenia diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders who were much improved on the Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement (CGI-I) scale at the endpoint of a 10-year follow-up. Clinical assessment tools included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia, CGI-I, Global Assessment of Functioning, and suicidality.
   Results: Many of the patients, although clinically improved, experienced emerging suicidality during the 10-year follow-up period. All of the patients reported significant suicidality (ie, suicide attempts, suicidal crises, or suicidal ideation) at the end of the study, whereas only 83% had reported previous significant suicidality at baseline. No sociodemographic and clinical variables at baseline were predictive of suicidal status at the end of the 10-year follow-up.
   Conclusion: Schizophrenia is a complex neurobehavioral disorder that appears to be closely associated with suicidal behavior. Adequate assessment and management of suicidality needs to be a continual process, even in patients who respond well to treatment.

AB Study objective-To establish whether there are increased rates of suicide after a stroke and the degree to which any increase is related to gender, age at stroke, diagnosis, duration of hospitalisation, and time since stroke.
   Design-Cross linkage of national registers for hospitalisations and causes of death.
   Setting The population of Denmark, 1979-1993.
   Patients-A study cohort was defined comprising all 114098 stroke patients discharged alive from hospital during the period 1979-1993. These patients were then screened in a register of causes of death over the same time period, and 359 cases of suicide were identified.
   Main results-Annual incidence rates, both observed and expected, together with standardised mortality ratios (SMR) were computed based on annual population and suicide statistics, stratified by age and gender. The overall annual incidence rate of suicide in the cohort was 83 per 100000 per year compared with an expected figure of 45 (difference=38, 95% CI=27, 49). Correspondingly, SMR were increased for stroke patients. Across all age bands the SMR for mens was 1.88 (95%CI 1.66, 2.13) and for women 1.78 (1.48, 2.14). SMR were greatest (2.85; 2.17, 3.76) for patients under 50 years of age group and were least for patients 80 years or older (1.3; 0.95, 1.79). There was no clear relation to stroke diagnosis. Suicides were negatively related to duration of hospitalisation, being lowest for those hospitalised for more than three months (0.88; 0.65, 1.19) and highest for those hospitalised for less than two weeks (2.32; 1.92, 2.80). Survival analysis suggested that the risk for suicide is greatest up to about five years after a stroke.
   Conclusions-Stroke patients are at an approximately doubled risk for suicide. This risk is greater among younger patients and among patients hospitalised for a relatively shorter time. The risk appears to decline with time after a stroke, being greatest within the first five years.

ID OF-LIFE DECISIONS; UNITED-STATES; ATTITUDES; END; ETHICS; OREGON
AB This article analyses and compares recent research on Scandinavian physicians' attitudes towards, as well as their practice of, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. The studies discussed are quite dissimilar in their design, resulting in considerable difficulties as far as comparability is concerned. Such difficulties are common in these fields of research. As an intended contribution to the amendment of future research, we suggest what we take to be detailed and precise definitions of the terms euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide for use internationally. Our definitions, or interpretations, basically draw on the Dutch experience and understanding of these terms. The Dutch approach implies that acts of abstention from life-prolonging treatment, i.e., withholding and withdrawing treatment, and pain and symptom treatment that theoretically could shorten life (including terminal sedation) are to be considered,normal medical practice'. Furthermore, death is seen as having natural causes in all of these acts. That, however, is not the case with euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. When a physician performs either of these acts, he or she is required to state 'unnatural death' in the patient's death certificate. Our conceptual suggestions do not address the ethical status of the various medical decisions that are made with regard to the death of patients; our aim is conceptual clarity only, As far as euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in Scandinavia is concerned, even though comparisons prove difficult, we do think some observations may be made: physicians from Norway, Denmark and Sweden display differences in both attitude and practice concerning these phenomena. Norwegian physicians are most restrictive with regard to attitude. Danish and Swedish physicians display a more liberal attitude, the latter being the most liberal. These findings did not fit the physicians' practice. Danish physicians have performed euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide more often than Norwegian physicians. Swedish physicians, even though they are the most liberal when it comes to attitude, appear never to have performed euthanasia and very seldom physician-assisted suicide.

AB Background The ICD-10 categorisation of severity of depression into mild, moderate and severe depressive episodes has not been validated.
   Aims To validate the ICD-10 categorisation of severity of depression by estimating its predictive ability on the course of illness and suicidal outcome.
   Method All psychiatric in-patients in Denmark who had received a diagnosis of a single depressive episode at their first discharge between 1994 and 1999 were identified. The risk of relapse and the risk of suicide were compared for patients discharged with an ICD-10 diagnosis of a single mild, moderate or severe depressive episode.
   Results At their first discharge, 1103 patients had an ICD-10 diagnosis of mild depressive episode, 3182 had a diagnosis of moderate depressive episode and 2914 had a diagnosis of severe depressive episode. The risk of relapse and the risk of suicide were significantly different for the three types of depression - increasing from mild to moderate to severe depressive episode.
   Conclusions The ICD-10 way of grading severity is clinically useful and should be preserved in future versions.

   REGISTER; DENMARK; STRESS
AB Background: Stressful life events have been shown to be associated with altered risk of various health consequences. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the emotional stress evoked by a prostate cancer diagnosis increases the immediate risks of cardiovascular events and suicide.
   Methods and Findings: We conducted a prospective cohort study by following all men in Sweden who were 30 y or older (n = 4,305,358) for a diagnosis of prostate cancer (n = 168,584) and their subsequent occurrence of cardiovascular events and suicide between January 1, 1961 and December 31, 2004. We used Poisson regression models to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of cardiovascular events and suicide among men who had prostate cancer diagnosed within 1 y to men without any cancer diagnosis. The risks of cardiovascular events and suicide were elevated during the first year after prostate cancer diagnosis, particularly during the first week. Before 1987, the RR of fatal cardiovascular events was 11.2 (95% CI 10.4-12.1) during the first week and 1.9 (95% CI 1.9-2.0) during the first year after diagnosis. From 1987, the RR for cardiovascular events, nonfatal and fatal combined, was 2.8 (95% CI 2.5-3.2) during the first week and 1.3 (95% CI 1.3 1.3) during the first year after diagnosis. While the RR of cardiovascular events declined, the RR of suicide was stable over the entire study period: 8.4 (95% CI 1.9-22.7) during the first week and 2.6 (95% CI 2.1-3.0) during the first year after diagnosis. Men 54 y or younger at cancer diagnosis demonstrated the highest RRs of both cardiovascular events and suicide. A limitation of the present study is the lack of tumor stage data, which precluded possibilities of investigating the potential impact of the disease severity on the relationship between a recent diagnosis of prostate cancer and the risks of cardiovascular events and suicide. In addition, we cannot exclude residual confounding as a possible explanation.
   Conclusions: Men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer are at increased risks for cardiovascular events and suicide. Future studies with detailed disease characteristic data are warranted.

TI Excess Mortality Rate During Adulthood Among Danish Adoptees
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES; PREMATURE DEATH; SOCIAL-CLASS; ADOPTION;
   BEHAVIOR; COHORT
AB Background and objective: Adoption studies have been used to disentangle the influence of genes from shared familial environment on various traits and disease risks. However, both the factors leading to adoption and living as an adoptee may bias the studies with regard to the relative influence of genes and environment compared to the general population. The aim was to investigate whether the cohort of domestic adoptees used for these studies in Denmark is similar to the general population with respect to all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality rates.
   Methods: 13,111 adoptees born in Denmark in 1917, or later, and adopted in 1924 to 1947 were compared to all Danes from the same birth cohorts using standardized mortality ratios (SMR). The 12,729 adoptees alive in 1970 were similarly compared to all Danes using SMR as well as cause-specific SMR.
   Results: The excess in all-cause mortality before age 65 years in adoptees was estimated to be 1.30 (95% CI 1.26-1.35). Significant excess mortality before age 65 years was also observed for infections, vascular deaths, cancer, alcohol-related deaths and suicide. Analyses including deaths after age 65 generally showed slightly less excess in mortality, but the excess was significant for all-cause mortality, cancer, alcohol-related deaths and suicides.
   Conclusion: Adoptees have an increased all-cause mortality compared to the general population. All major specific causes of death contributed, and the highest excess is seen for alcohol-related deaths.

AB Background: The long-term predictive ability of the ICD-10 subtypes of depression with melancholic syndrome and depression with psychosis has not been investigated. Sampling and Methods: All patients in Denmark who had a diagnosis of a single depressive episode at their first ever discharge during a period from 1994 to 1999 were identified. The risk of relapse leading to readmission and the risk of committing suicide were compared for patients discharged with an ICD-10 diagnosis of a single depressive episode with and without melancholic syndrome and for patients with and without psychotic symptoms, respectively. Results: In all, 1,639 patients had a diagnosis of depressive episode without psychotic symptoms, 1,275 patients a diagnosis with psychotic symptoms, 293 a diagnosis without melancholic syndrome, and 248 a diagnosis with melancholic symptoms at first discharge. The risk of relapse leading to readmission was greater for patients with psychotic symptoms than for patients without, but no difference was found between the two groups in the risk of committing suicide during follow-up. No differences were found in the risk of relapse leading to readmission or suicide between patients with and without melancholic syndrome. Conclusions: The ICD-10 categorization into depression with and without psychotic symptoms seems to be clinically and prognostically useful, whereas the ICD-10 subtyping into melancholic and non-melancholic syndrome does not seem to have any long-term predictive value.

AB IMPORTANCE Findings suggest that infections might be linked to the development of psychiatric disorders and suicidal behavior. Large-scale studies are needed to investigate the effect of infection on the risk of suicide.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate the association between hospitalization with infection and the risk of death by suicide.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Nationwide, population-based, prospective cohort study with more than 149 million person-years of follow-up. Data were analyzed with survival analysis techniques and were adjusted for sex, age, calendar period, cohabitation status, socioeconomic status, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Individual data were drawn from Danish longitudinal registers. A total of 7.22 million individuals 15 years or older living in Denmark between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2011, were observed during a 32-year follow-up period.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The risk of death by suicide was identified in the Danish Cause of Death Register. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and accompanying 95% CIs were used as measures of relative risk.
   RESULTS In 7 221 578 individuals (3 601 653 men and 3 619 925 women) observed for a total of 149 061 786 person-years, 32 683 suicides were observed during the follow-up period. Among the suicides, 7892 (24.1%) individuals had previously been diagnosed as having an infection during a hospitalization. Hospitalization with infection was linked to an elevated risk of suicide, with an IRR of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.38-1.46) compared with those without prior infection. Dose-response relationships were observed with respect to the number of hospital contacts for different infections. For example, having 7 or more infections was linked to an IRR of 2.90 (95% CI, 2.14-3.93). The number of days of treatment for infections was associated with an elevated risk of suicide in a dose-response relationship. More than 3 months of hospital treatment was linked to an IRR of 2.38 (95% CI, 2.05-2.76). The population-attributable risk associated with hospitalization with infection accounted for 10.1% of suicides.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE An increased risk of death by suicide was found among individuals hospitalized with infection in prospective and dose-response relationships. These findings indicate that infections may have a relevant role in the pathophysiological mechanisms of suicidal behavior.

TI Cost-consequence analysis of cause of death investigation in Finland and
   in Denmark

DE Manner of death; Cause of death; Autopsy rate; Finland; Denmark;
   Cost-consequence analysis
ID MEDICOLEGAL AUTOPSY; CARE; DISCREPANCIES; DIAGNOSES
AB The 1990s 12-16% total autopsy rate in Denmark has until now declined to 4%, while in Finland, it has remained between 25 and 30%. The decision to proceed with a forensic autopsy is based on national legislation, but it can be assumed that the financing of autopsies influences the decision process. Only little is known about the possible differences between health economics of Finnish and Danish cause of death investigation systems.
   The aims of this article were to analyse costs and consequences of Finnish and Danish cause of death investigations, and to develop an alternative autopsy practice in Denmark with another cost profile.
   Data on cause of death investigation systems and costs were derived from Departments of Forensic Medicine, Departments of Pathology, and the National Police. Finnish and Danish autopsy rates were calculated in unnatural (accident, suicide, homicide and undetermined intent) and natural (disease) deaths, and used to develop an alternative autopsy practice in Denmark. Consequences for society were analysed.
   The estimated unit cost (sic) for one forensic autopsy is 3.2 times lower in Finland than in Denmark ((sic)1400 versus (sic)4420), but in Finland the salaries for forensic pathologists working at the National Institute for Health and Welfare are not included in the unit cost. The unit cost for one medical autopsy is also lower in Finland than in Denmark; (sic)700 versus (sic)1070. In our alternative practice in Denmark, the forensic autopsy rate was increased from 2.2% to 8.5%, and the medical autopsy rate from 2.4% to 5.8%. Costs per 10,000 deaths were estimated to be 50% (+/- 25%) higher than now; i.e. (sic)3,678,724 (2,759,112-4,598,336), but would result in a lower unit cost for forensic autopsies (sic)3,094 (2,320-3,868) and for medical autopsies (sic)749 (562-936). This practice would produce a higher accuracy of national mortality statistics, which, consequently, would entail higher quality in public health, an accurate basis for decision-making in health politics, and better legislative safety in society.
   The implementation of this alternative practice in Denmark requires that legislation demands that forensic autopsy be performed if causality between unnatural death and cause of death cannot be clarified or if cause of death remains unknown. The Danish Health and Medicines Authority should provide guidelines that request a medical autopsy in natural deaths where more information about disease as a cause of death is needed. Our study results warrant similar health economic analyses of different cause of death investigations in other countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB IMPORTANCE Parental death from suicide is associated with increased risk of suicide in the bereaved child, but little is known about the long-term risks of suicide after parental death from other causes. A better understanding of this association may improve suicide prevention efforts.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the long-term risks of suicide after parental death and how the risk trajectories differed by cause of parental death while accounting for major potential confounding variables.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A population-based matched cohort study was performed using information from nationwide registers (data from 1968 to 2008) in 3 Scandinavian countries (for a total of 7 302 033 persons). We identified 189 094 children (2.6%) who had a parent who died before the child reached 18 years of age (ie, the bereaved cohort). Each bereaved child was matched by sex and age to 10 children who did not have a parent who died before they reached 18 years of age (for a total of 1 890 940 children) (ie, the reference cohort). Both cohorts were followed for up to 40 years. Poisson regression was used to calculate the incidence rate ratio (IRR), while accounting for age at parental death, sex, time since bereavement, maternal/paternal death, birth order, family history of psychiatric illness, and socioeconomic status. Data analyses were finalized June 24, 2015.
   EXPOSURE The main exposure was death of a parent within the first 18 years of life.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incidence of suicide among persons who had a parent who died during their childhood.
   RESULTS During follow-up, 265 bereaved persons (0.14%) and 1342 nonbereaved persons (0.07%) died of suicide (IRR = 2.02 [95% CI, 1.75-2.34]); IRR = 3.44 (95% CI, 2.61-4.52) for children who had a parent who died of suicide, and IRR = 1.76 (95% CI, 1.49-2.09) for children who had a parent who died of other causes. The IRR tended to be higher for children who had a parent who died before they reached 6 years of age, and the IRR remained high for at least 25 years. During 25 years of follow-up, the absolute risk of suicide was 4 in 1000 persons for boys who experienced parental death and 2 in 1000 persons for girls who experienced parental death.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Parental death in childhood is, irrespective of cause, associated with an increased long-term risk of suicide. The consequences of parental death in childhood are far-reaching, and suicide risk trajectories may be influenced by early-life conditions. Future public health efforts should consider helping highly distressed children to cope with bereavement.

AB Background: The Addiction Severity Index (ASI) is a widely used assessment instrument for substance abuse treatment that includes scales reflecting current status in seven potential problem areas, including psychiatric severity. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of the psychiatric composite score to predict suicide and psychiatric care after residential treatment for drug use disorders after adjusting for history of psychiatric care.
   Methods: All patients treated for drug use disorders in residential treatment centers in Denmark during the years 2000-2010 with complete ASI data were followed through national registers of psychiatric care and causes of death (N = 5825). Competing risks regression analyses were used to assess the incremental predictive validity of the psychiatric composite score, controlling for previous psychiatric care, length of intake, and other ASI composite scores, up to 12 years after discharge.
   Results: A total of 1769 patients received psychiatric care after being discharged from residential treatment (30.3%), and 27 (0.5%) committed suicide. After adjusting for all covariates, psychiatric composite score was associated with a higher risk of receiving psychiatric care after residential treatment (subhazard ratio [SHR] = 3.44, p < 0.001), and of committing suicide (SHR = 11.45, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The ASI psychiatric composite score has significant predictive validity and promises to be useful in identifying patients with drug use disorders who could benefit from additional mental health treatment.

AB Background: It is unknown whether an increased genetic liability to schizophrenia influences the risk of dying early. The aim of the study was to determine whether the genetic predisposition to schizophrenia is associated with the risk of dying early and experience a suicide attempt.
   Method: Case control study, Denmark. The main measure was the mortality rate ratios (MRR) for deaths and odds ratios (OR) for multiple suicide attempts, associated with one standard deviations increase of the polygenic risk-score for schizophrenia (PRS).
   Results: We replicated the high mortality MRR = 9.01 (95% CI: 3.56-22.80), and high risk of multiple suicide attempts OR = 33.16 (95% CI: 20.97-52.43) associated with schizophrenia compared to the general population. However, there was no effect of the PRS on mortality MRR = 1.00 (95% CI 0.71-1.40) in the case-control setup or in cases only, MRR = 1.05 (95% CI 0.73-1.51). Similar, no association between the PRS and multiple suicide attempts was found in the adjusted models, but in contrast, family history of mental disorders was associated with both outcomes.
   Conclusions: A genetic predisposition for schizophrenia, measured by PRS, has little influence on the excess mortality or the risk of suicide attempts. In contrast there is a strong significant effect of family history of mental disorders. Our findings could reflect that the common variants detected by recent PRS only explain a small proportion of risk of schizophrenia, and that future, more powerful PRS instruments may be able to predict excess mortality within this disorder.

AB The first-generation antihistamine, promethazine, became a prescription-only drug in Denmark as of December 2014. First-generation antihistamines are known to have a higher toxic potential than second-generation antihistamines. The aim of this study was to provide a nationwide description of the antihistamine use and poisoning pattern from 2007 to 2013 in Denmark based on two independent databases. There were 1049 antihistamine exposures in the national, advisory telephone service specialized in poisonings, the Danish Poison and Information Centre (DPIC), and 456 exposures in the three registers used within the State Serum Institute of Denmark (SSI), a department under the Danish Ministry of Health dealing with research-based health surveillance in Denmark. First-generation antihistamines constitute 61% and 73% of antihistamine registrations in DPIC and SSI, respectively. Antihistamine exposures increased by 7 exposures/10,000 enquiries per year in DPIC and six admissions per year in SSI -this increase is not significant due to a sudden decrease in 2012. Intentional exposures constituted 65% in DPIC of which 82% was due to suicide attempts, and 78% of the involved antihistamines were first-generation antihistamines. Accidental exposures constituted 33% of which 61% were due to play and 29% involved first-generation antihistamines. Single antihistamine exposures constituted 65% of DPIC exposures of which 98% involved only one brand of antihistamine. Multidrug exposures constituted 35% of DPIC exposures with equally distributed coingestants. Hospitalization was recommended in 78% of DPIC exposures. Admissions required only 1-day of treatment in 91% of the SSI exposures. One of the 14 identified deaths in the SSI study population was directly related to antihistamine poisoning. Results support the limited disclosure of promethazine in Denmark and illustrate a generation-specific pattern indicating a suspected replacement of promethazine with other first-generation antihistamines.

AB IMPORTANCE Self-directed and interpersonal violence share some common risk factors such as a parental history of mental illness. However, relationships between the full spectrum of parental psychiatric disease and these 2 related outcomes are unclear.
   OBJECTIVE To examine associations between the full spectrum of parental psychiatric disease and risks of attempted suicide and violent offending among offspring.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Population-based cohort study of all persons born in Denmark 1967 through 1997, followed up from their 15th birthday until occurrence of adverse outcome or December 31, 2012, whichever came first.
   EXPOSURES Array of parental psychiatric disorders and parental suicide attempt, delineated from records of secondary care treatments.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Using survival analyses techniques, incidence rate ratios were estimated for offspring suicide attempt and violent offending.
   RESULTS We examined 1 743 525 cohort members (48.7% female; total follow-up, 27.2 million person-years). Risks for offspring suicide attempt and violent offending were elevated across virtually the full spectrum of parental psychiatric disease. Incidence rate ratios were the most elevated for parental diagnoses of antisocial personality disorder (suicide attempt, 3.96; 95% CI, 3.72-4.21; violent offending, 3.62; 95% CI, 3.41-3.84) and cannabis misuse (suicide attempt, 3.57; 95% CI, 3.25-3.92; violent offending, 4.05; 95% CI, 3.72-4.39), and for parental suicide attempt (suicide attempt, 3.42; 95% CI, 3.29-3.55; violent offending, 3.31; 95% CI, 3.19-3.44). Parental mood disorders (and bipolar disorder in particular) conferred more modest risk increases. A history of mental illness or suicide attempt in both parents was associated with double the risks compared with having just 1 affected parent. Associations between parental psychiatric disease and offspring violent offending were stronger for female than for male offspring, whereas little sex difference in risk was found for offspring suicide attempt.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The similarities in risk patterns observed between the 2 outcomes may evidence a shared etiology. Early interventions to tackle parental mental disorders may be beneficial to both parents and children.

AB Background. It is unclear whether there is an interaction of ageing on the association between major life events and onset of depression.
   Method. This was a population-based nested case-control study with linkage of the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register and the Integrated Database for Longitudinal Labour Market Research. The study includes data on all admissions at psychiatric wards in Denmark from 1981 to 1998 and data on sociodemographic variables and death/suicide of first-degree relatives.
   Results. A total of 13 006 patients who received a diagnosis of depression at the first ever admission at a psychiatric ward and a gender- and age-matched control group of 260108 subjects were identified. A recent divorce and recent unemployment and suicide of a relative (mother, father, sibling, child, spouse) were associated with increased risk of being admitted for the first time ever at a psychiatric ward with a diagnosis of depression whereas death of a relative by causes other than suicide had no significant effect. In general, no interaction was found with age with any of the variables, totally, or for men or women, separately.
   Conclusions. The susceptibility to major life stressors does not seem to change throughout life.

AB Background Those with first-episode psychosis are at high-risk of suicide.
   Aims To identify predictive factors for suicidal thoughts, plans and attempts, and to investigate the rate of suicides and other deaths during the 5 years after first diagnosis and initiation of treatment.
   Method A longitudinal, prospective, 5-year follow-up study of 547 individuals with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum psychosis. Individuals presenting for their first treatment in mental health services in two circumscribed urban areas in Denmark were included in a randomised controlled trial of integrated v. standard treatment. All participants were followed in the Danish Cause of Death Register for 5 years. Suicidal behaviour and clinical and social status were assessed using validated interviews and rating scales at entry, and at 1- and 2-year follow-ups.
   Results Sixteen participants died during the follow-up.We found a strong association between suicidal thoughts, plans and previous attempts, depressive and psychotic symptoms and young age, and with suicidal plans and attempts at 1- and 2-year follow-up.
   Conclusions In this first-episode cohort depressive and psychotic symptoms, especially hallucinations, predicted suicidal plans and attempts, and persistent suicidal behaviour and ideation were associated with high risk of attempted suicide.

AB Background: The validity and reliability of suicide statistics have been questioned and few nationwide studies of deliberate self-harm have been presented. Aim: To calculate rates of deliberate self-harm in Denmark in order to investigate trends and assess the reliability of hospital records. Method: A register study based on all individuals recorded with an episode of deliberate self-harm or probable deliberate self-harm in nationwide registers during 1994-2011. Results: A substantial difference in the rates of deliberate self-harm and probable deliberate self-harm was noted for both genders. The average incidence rate of deliberate self-harm for women and men was 130.7 (95% CI = 129.6-131.8) per 100,000 and 86.9 (95% CI = 86.0-87.8) per 100,000, respectively. The rates of deliberate self-harm for women increased from 137.6 (95% CI = 132.9-142.3) per 100,000 in 1994 to 152.7 (95% CI = 147.8-157.5) in 2011. For a subgroup of younger women aged 15-24 years, an almost threefold increase was observed, IRR = 2.5 (95% CI = 2.4-2.7). The most frequently used method was self-poisoning. Conclusion: The rates of deliberate self-harm and probable deliberate self-harm differed significantly. An increased incidence of deliberate self-harm among young Danish women was observed, despite detection bias. An improved registration procedure of suicidal behavior is needed.

AB Introduction
   Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is frequent worldwide but knowledge regarding the epidemiology is insufficient. The aim of this study was to clarify the extent of this intoxication, its mortality and factors associated with mortality.
   Materials and methods
   National databases from Statistics Denmark were used to identify individuals who suffered from CO-poisoning during 1995-2015, as well as information regarding co-morbidities, mortality and manner of death.
   Results
   During the period from 1995 to 2015, 22,930 patients suffered from CO-poisoning in Denmark, and 21,138 of these patients (92%) were hospitalized. A total of 2,102 patients died within the first 30 days after poisoning (9.2%). Among these, 1,792 (85% of 2,102) were declared dead at the scene and 310 (15% of 2,102) died during hospitalization. Deaths due to CO-poisoning from smoke were intentional in 6.3% of cases, whereas deaths due to CO containing gases were intentional in 98.0% of cases. Among patients who survived > 30 days, there was no significant difference in survival when comparing hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) treatment with no HBO treatment after adjustment for age and co-morbidities such as drug abuse, psychiatric disease, stroke, alcohol abuse, arterial embolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease and atrial fibrillation. Several co-morbidities predicted poorer outcomes for patients who survived the initial 30 days.
   Conclusions
   Poisoning from smoke and/or CO is a frequent incident in Denmark accounting for numerous contacts with hospitals and deaths. Both intoxication and mortality are highly associated with co-morbidities interfering with cognitive and physical function. Treatment with HBO was not seen to have an effect on survival.

AB The association between alcohol dependence and suicidal behaviour is well established and patients with suicidal behaviour in treatment for alcohol dependence present a considerable challenge for clinical services. The aim of this study is to identify risk factors for suicide attempts and to evaluate the outcome of treatment in patients in treatment for alcohol dependence. Semistructured, detailed interviews were administered at baseline and at three sequential follow-up interviews with a large sample of 1692 patients at an outpatient treatment centre in the county of Funen in Denmark. Characteristics of, predictors for and outcome among suicidal patients were studied. Alcohol-dependent patients with a history of suicide attempts were found to constitute a highly selected group in alcohol abuse treatment as they often had a more severe course of alcohol dependence, were unemployed, younger, were more often lowly educated, and had more physical and psychiatric problems. Traumatic childhood experience related to physical or sexual abuse was found as a major predictor for suicidal behaviour among alcohol-dependent patients. We found no significant difference in the effect of treatment in patients with and without suicidal behaviour. These results support the hypothesis that alcohol-dependent patients with a history of suicide attempts are a selected group in respect to a number of demographical and psychosocial factors, but we found no difference in the outcome of treatment. This may imply that suicidal patients in treatment for alcohol abuse are treated effectively within the present treatment settings.

AB Context: Estimates of lifetime risk of suicide in mental disorders were based on selected samples with incomplete follow-up.
   Objective: To estimate, in a national cohort, the absolute risk of suicide within 36 years after the first psychiatric contact.
   Design: Prospective study of incident cases followed up for as long as 36 years. Median follow-up was 18 years.
   Setting: Individual data drawn from Danish longitudinal registers.
   Participants: A total of 176 347 persons born from January 1, 1955, through December 31, 1991, were followed up from their first contact with secondary mental health services after 15 years of age until death, emigration, disappearance, or the end of 2006. For each participant, 5 matched control individuals were included.
   Main Outcome Measures: Absolute risk of suicide in percentage of individuals up to 36 years after the first contact.
   Results: Among men, the absolute risk of suicide (95% confidence interval [CI]) was highest for bipolar disorder, (7.77%; 6.01%-10.05%), followed by unipolar affective disorder (6.67%; 5.72%-7.78%) and schizophrenia (6.55%; 5.85%-7.34%). Among women, the highest risk was found among women with schizophrenia (4.91%; 95% CI, 4.03%-5.98%), followed by bipolar disorder (4.78%; 3.48%-6.56%). In the nonpsychiatric population, the risk was 0.72% (95% CI, 0.61%-0.86%) for men and 0.26% (0.20%-0.35%) for women. Comorbid substance abuse and comorbid unipolar affective disorder significantly increased the risk. The co-occurrence of deliberate self-harm increased the risk approximately 2-fold. Men with bipolar disorder and deliberate self-harm had the highest risk (17.08%; 95% CI, 11.19%-26.07%).
   Conclusions: This is the first analysis of the absolute risk of suicide in a total national cohort of individuals followed up from the first psychiatric contact, and it represents, to our knowledge, the hitherto largest sample with the longest and most complete follow-up. Our estimates are lower than those most often cited, but they are still substantial and indicate the continuous need for prevention of suicide among people with mental disorders.

AB Background Although deliberate self-harm is a strong predictor of suicide, evidence for effective interventions is missing. The aim of this study was to examine whether psychosocial therapy after self-harm was linked to lower risks of repeated self-harm, suicide, and general mortality.
   Methods In this matched cohort study all people who, after deliberate self-harm, received a psychosocial therapy intervention at suicide prevention clinics in Denmark during 1992-2010 were compared with people who did not receive the psychosocial therapy intervention after deliberate self-harm. We applied propensity score matching with a 1: 3 ratio and 31 matching factors, and calculated odds ratios for 1, 5, 10, and 20 years of follow-up. The primary endpoints were repeated self-harm, death by suicide, and death by any cause.
   Findings 5678 recipients of psychosocial therapy (followed up for 42.828 person-years) were matched with 17 034 individuals with no psychosocial therapy in a 1: 8 ratio. During 20 year follow-up, 937 (16.5%) recipients of psychosocial therapy repeated the act of self-harm, and 391 (6.9%) died, 93 (16%) by suicide. The psychosocial therapy intervention was linked to lower risks of self-harm than was no psychosocial therapy (odds ratio [OR] 0.73, 95% CI 0.65-0.82) and death by any cause (0.62, 0.47-0.82) within a year. Long-term effects were identified for repeated self-harm (0.84, 0.77-0.91; absolute risk reduction [ARR] 2.6%, 1.5-3.7; numbers needed to treat [NNT] 39, 95% CI 27-69), deaths by suicide (OR 0.75, 0.60-0.94; ARR 0.5%, 0.1-0.9; NNT 188, 108-725), and death by any cause (OR 0.69, 0.62-0.78; ARR 2.7%, 2.0-3.5; NNT 37, 29-52), implying that 145 self-harm episodes and 153 deaths, including 30 deaths by suicide, were prevented.
   Interpretation Our findings show a lower risk of repeated deliberate self-harm and general mortality in recipients of psychosocial therapy after short-term and long-term follow-up, and a protective effect for suicide after long-term follow-up, which favour the use of psychosocial therapy interventions after deliberate self-harm.

AB Background Childhood cancer survivors have been reported to be vulnerable to psychiatric morbidities and risky health behavior. Suicides, substance abuse, accidents, and violence as causes of death can be regarded as an extreme manifestation of risky health behavior. In the current study, the authors studied the risk of suicide and other risky health behavior-related deaths among childhood cancer patients in Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Methods Using linkage between national cancer, population, and cause-of-death registries, the authors investigated the causes of death in 29,285 patients diagnosed with cancer before age 20 years between 1971 and 2009 compared with a cohort of 146,282 age-matched, sex-matched, and country-matched population comparisons. Rate ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs were estimated using Poisson regression models, adjusting for demographic factors. Results The overall risk of dying of a risky health behavior was found to be increased among childhood cancer patients (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.06-1.47) when compared with population comparisons. The elevated risk was statistically significant among patients with central nervous system tumors (RR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.08-2.05) and patients diagnosed at ages 5 to 9 years and 15 to 19 years (RR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.01-2.24] and RR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.03-1.67], respectively). The overall risk of suicide was found to be increased (RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.02-1.83), and statistically significantly so when patients were diagnosed between ages 15 and 19 years (RR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.09-2.39). Conclusions Childhood cancer patients appear to have an increased risk of risky health behavior-related causes of death compared with the general population. The results of the current study suggest the importance of integrating psychosocial support into the follow-up care of these individuals.

AB Background Anorexia nervosa is a mental disorder with high mortality.
   Aims To estimate standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and to investigate potential prognostic factors.
   Method Six thousand and nine women who had in-patient treatment for anorexia nervosa were followed-up retrospectively using Swedish registers.
   Results The overall SMR for anorexia nervosa was 6.2 (95% CI 5.5-7.0). Anorexia nervosa, psychoactive substance use and suicide had the highest SMR. The SMR was significantly increased for almost all natural and unnatural causes of death. The SMR 20 years or more after the first hospitalisation remained significantly high. Lower mortality was found during the last two decades. Younger age and longer hospital stay at first hospitalisation was associated with better outcome, and psychiatric and somatic comorbidity worsened the outcome.
   Conclusions Anorexia nervosa is characterised by high lifetime mortality from both natural and unnatural causes. Assessment and treatment of psychiatric comorbidity, especially alcohol misuse, may be a pathway to better long-term outcome.

AB Anorexia nervosa (AN) is reported to have the highest premature mortality of any psychiatric disorder, but recent meta-analyses may have inflated estimates. We sought to re-estimate mortality after methodological corrections and to identify predictors of mortality. We included 41 cohorts from 40 peer-reviewed studies published between 1966 and 2010. Methods included double data extraction, log-linear regression with an over-dispersed Poisson model, and all-cause and suicide-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), with 95% Poisson confidence intervals. Participants with AN were 5.2 [3.7-7.5] times more likely to die prematurely from any cause, and 18.1 [11.5-28.7] times more likely to die by suicide than 15-34 year old females in the general population. Our estimates were 10% and 49% lower, respectively, than previously reported SMRs. Risk of premature mortality was highest in studies with older participants, although confounding by treatment was present. Gender, ascertainment, and diagnostic criteria also impacted risk.

AB Background The excess mortality of schizophrenia is well recognised, but its precise causes are not, well understood.
   Aims To measure the standardised mortality ratio (SMR) and examine the reasons for any excess mortality in a community cohort with schizophrenia.
   Method We carried out a 13-year follow-up of 370 patients with schizophrenia, identifying those who died and their circumstances.
   Results Ninety-six per cent of the cohort was traced. There were 79 deaths. The SMRs for all causes (298), for natural (232) and for unnatural causes (1273), were significantly higher than those to be expected in-the general population, as were the SMRs for disease of the circulatory, digestive, endocrine, nervous and respiratory systems, suicide and undetermined death. Smoking-related fatal disease was more prominent than in the general population.
   Conclusions Some of the excess mortality of schizophrenia could be lessened by reducing patients' smoking and exposure to other environmental risk factors and by improving the management of medical disease, mood disturbance and psychosis.

AB Background Persons diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been found to have an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, but the pathway remains to be thoroughly explored. Aims To determine whether persons with ADHD are more likely to present with suicidal behaviour (i.e. suicide attempts and deaths by suicide) if they have a comorbid psychiatric disorder. Method Using nationwide registers covering the entire population of Denmark, this cohort study of 2.9 million individuals followed from 1 January 1995 until 31 December 2014, covers more than 46 million person-years. All persons aged >= 10 years with Danish-born parents were identified and persons with a diagnosis of ADHD were compared with persons without. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated by Poisson regression, with adjustments for sociodemographics and parental suicidal behaviour. Results Persons with ADHD were followed for 164 113 person-years and 697 suicidal outcomes were observed. This group was found to have an IRR of suicidal behaviour of 4.7 (95% CI, 4.3-5.1) compared with those without ADHD. Persons with ADHD only had a 4.1-fold higher rate (95% CI, 3.5-4.7) when compared with those without any psychiatric diagnoses. For persons with ADHD and comorbid disorders the IRR was higher yet (IRR: 10.4; 95% CI, 9.5-11.4). Conclusions This study underlines the link between ADHD and an elevated rate of suicidal behaviour, which is significantly elevated by comorbid psychiatric disorders. In sum, these results suggest that persons with ADHD and comorbid psychiatric disorders are targets for suicide preventive interventions. Declaration of interest None.

AB Background The risk for schizophrenia has been associated with a family history of this and other psychiatric disorders. The relationship between age at first contact and family history of psychiatric illness is not certain.
   Aims To estimate the risks for schizophrenia associated with a range of psychiatric diagnoses in family members and to investigate the relationship between these risks and age at first contact for schizophrenia.
   Method A nested case-control study design was employed. Psychiatric admission data and socio-economic data were available for 7704 cases admitted between 1981 and 1998 in Denmark, 192 590 gender- and age-matched controls, and for the parents and siblings of all subjects.
   Results Controlling for socio-economic factors, risk for schizophrenia was associated with a family history of all psychiatric disorders except substance misuse and independently with a family history of suicide. The risk for schizophrenia associated with a family history of psychiatric disorders decreased as age at first contact increased.
   Conclusions Risk for schizophrenia is associated with a range of psychiatric disorders in family members and these risks are not constant across the risk period.,

AB A small proportion of deaths result from,the use of drugs with the intention to hasten death without an explicit request of the patient. Additional insight into its characteristics is needed for evaluating this practice. In the Netherlands in 2001, questionnaires were mailed to physicians that addressed the decision making that preceded their patient's death. Cases of ending life without an explicit request of the patient were compared with similar cases from 1995 and with cases from Belgium, Denmark, and Switzerland. In the Netherlands in 2001, patients receiving life-ending drugs without their explicit request were most Often 80+ years old and had cancer. Most of them were incompetent patients nearing death. Characteristics of this practice in 7995 were quite comparable, as were characteristics of this practice in Belgium, Denmark, and Switzerland. The use of drugs with the intention to hasten death without an explicit request of the patient is part of medical end-of-life practice in the studied countries, regardless of their legal framework, and it occurs in similar fashion.

AB The purpose of this investigation was to provide an analysis of the 166 homicidal deaths that occurred in Southern Denmark during 25 years. The inspiration came from increased press coverage of certain homicides that I as a forensic pathologist felt did not mirror the real situation. Extensive press coverage of a few serious cases has left the public with the impression that the number of homicides was escalating, and this has been cause for public concern, and has prompted various harsh legislative steps. A lot of public interest has been focused on knife homicides, on honor killings among Muslims, on gang homicides and on homicides committed by psychotic individuals. The political response to public opinion has to some degree been focused on increased punishment for violence. With this in mind, the aim of the investigation was to answer the following research questions: :
   Research Question 1: What was the homicide rate in the study area, and has it changed during the 25-year study period?
   Research Question 2: How were the homicides distributed according to motive?
   Research Question 3: How often was the homicide motivated by a psychosis?
   Research Question 4: Has the ratio between intra- and extra-family homicides changed?
   Research Question 5: How often were weapons used?
   Research Question 6: Is it possible to identify some important social factors characterizing homicide victims?
   Research Question 7: Has the homicide pattern described changed over time?
   Research Question 8: What are the implications of this study for homicide prevention strategies?.

ID READMISSION
AB Aim of database: The purpose of the Danish Depression Database (DDD) is to monitor and facilitate the improvement of the quality of the treatment of depression in Denmark. Furthermore, the DDD has been designed to facilitate research.
   Study population: Inpatients as well as outpatients with depression, aged above 18 years, and treated in the public psychiatric hospital system were enrolled.
   Main variables: Variables include whether the patient has been thoroughly somatically examined and has been interviewed about the psychopathology by a specialist in psychiatry. The Hamilton score as well as an evaluation of the risk of suicide are measured before and after treatment. Whether psychiatric aftercare has been scheduled for inpatients and the rate of rehospitalization are also registered.
   Descriptive data: The database was launched in 2011. Every year since then similar to 5,500 - inpatients and 7,500 outpatients have been registered annually in the database. A total of 24,083 inpatients and 29,918 outpatients have been registered. The DDD produces an annual report published on the Internet.
   Conclusion: The DDD can become an important tool for quality improvement and research, when the reporting is more complete.

AB Introduction - The claim of detection of several environmental risk factors for multiple sclerosis (MS), some of them new, makes the research of population-based MS registers for critical review or confirmation of alleged associations more relevant than ever before. Aims - To present examples of the use and important contributions from the Danish MS Registry (DMSR) over decades. Methods - The DMSR has through more than six decades registered virtually all patients with MS in Denmark, using multiple sources of notification and has been used for descriptive epidemiology, follow-up studies, studies of comorbidity and 'historical prospective' studies of proposed risk factors for MS. Results - Based on research from DMSR, we have found that female incidence of multiple sclerosis in Denmark has increased considerably; that patients with MS loose their working ability and their spouses/partners at a much higher rate than the background population; that patients with MS have a considerable excess mortality which seem to have decreased over several centuries decades - not centuries, also before the era of disease modifying treatment; that fewer patients with MS than expected from the population get diagnosed with or die from cancer; that infectious mononucleosis increases the risk of MS; that head trauma and a number of occupational exposures, for example, nurses, utility workers, exposure to solvents do not carry an enhanced risk of MS. Conclusion - The DMSR has, as an example of long-lasting population-based registers, proven to be an effective tool for studying MS epidemiology. In future, the need for this kind of registers will continue, as biology or immunology cannot stand alone.

AB Introduction: Denmark has been pioneering international psychiatric register research for decades. In this article we review central publications, by Danish and international authors, based on data from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register and other related registers. Research topics: Our aim was to describe the history, development and achievements of psychiatric research, based on the Danish national registers. The studies considered in this review can be categorized as follows: i) health service research, mainly studies on prevalence and incidence, ii) studies on the outcome of mental disorders, iii) studies on the aetiology of mental disorders. Conclusion: Studies based on Danish registers have provided significant contributions to international psychiatric research. The major advantage of the registers is that they cover the entire population, which makes the conduction of nationwide population-based studies possible. Furthermore, all information in the registers is connected to each citizen's unique personal identification number, which enables linkage between various registers and biobanks. Such linkage studies have provided important knowledge on the aetiology of mental disorders. Despite inherent limitations about internal and external validity, the Danish national registers have been extremely valuable to international psychiatric research and will continue to play an important role in years to come.

AB Background: Epidemiologic studies indicate that women with cosmetic breast implants have a significantly increased risk of suicide. Our objectives were to examine mortality among Danish women who underwent cosmetic breast implant surgery and to evaluate the baseline prevalence of psychopathological disorders as measured by admission to a psychiatric hospital among women seeking cosmetic surgery.
   Methods: Cohort study of 2761 women who underwent cosmetic breast implant surgery at private clinics of plastic surgery or public hospitals, 7071 women who underwent breast reduction surgery at public hospitals, and 1736 women who attended private clinics for cosmetic surgery other than breast implantation, between 1973 and 1995. Causes of death through 1999 were identified through the Danish Mortality Files. Information on admission to psychiatric hospitals prior to cosmetic surgery was obtained from the Danish Psychiatric Central Register.
   Results: Women with cosmetic breast implants had significantly elevated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for death overall (SMR, 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.7), nonmalignant lung disease (3.4; 95% CI, 1.46.9), and suicide (SMR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.7-5.2). Women who underwent breast reduction exhibited low SMRs for death overall (0.7; 95% CI, 0.7-0.8) and several specific causes, including breast cancer (0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.6), whereas death from suicide was moderately above expectation (SMR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0-2.5). The prevalence of psychiatric admission prior to cosmetic surgery was higher among women who underwent cosmetic breast implant surgery (8.0%; 95% CI, 7.0%-9.0%) than among women who underwent breast reduction (4.7%; 95% CI, 4.2%-5.2%) or other cosmetic procedures (5.5%; 95% CI, 4.5%-6.7%). When compared with all control groups, women with cosmetic implants had an odds ratio for prior psychiatric admission of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.4-2.0).
   Conclusions: Danish women with cosmetic breast implants experienced higher overall mortality compared with women in the general population owing in part to a 3-fold increase in suicide. Women with breast reduction had a low total and cause-specific mortality but a moderate excess risk of suicide. For the first time, to our knowledge, we found evidence of an increased prevalence of mental illness as measured by admission to a psychiatric hospital prior to implant surgery among women receiving cosmetic breast implants. Studies are needed to clarify the underlying reasons for the consistently reported 2- to 3-fold excess of suicide among women with cosmetic breast implants.

AB Background People with mental disorders have higher mortality rates than the general population and more detailed estimates of mortality differences are needed to address this public health issue. We aimed to assess whether differences in cause-specific mortality between people with and without mental disorders have changed between 1995 and 2014 by quantifying life-years lost and assessing differences over time.
   Methods Using a cohort design, we linked nationwide population data from the Danish Civil Registration System to information about hospital contacts from the Psychiatric Central Research Register and deaths from the Danish Cause of Death register. All linked data sources contained longitudinal information covering all individuals aged 15-94 years living in Denmark between 1995 and 2014. We assessed cause-specific mortality differences using rate ratios and average life-years lost.
   Findings Between 1995 and 2014, 6 107 234 individuals (3 026 132 men and 3 081 102 women) aged 15-94 years were living in Denmark. The study population was observed over 89 216 177 person-years (men: 43 914 948; women 45 301 229). Cause-specific mortality rates were higher for people with mental disorders than those without (total mortality rate per 1000 person-years in men 27.1 vs 11.4, respectively, and in women 21.2 vs 11.0). When compared with individuals without mental disorders, men and women with mental disorders had 10.20 and 7.34 excess lifeyears lost, respectively. The largest cause-specific differences between those with and without mental disorders in terms of excess life-years lost were for respiratory diseases (men: 0.9; women: 1.4) and alcohol misuse (men: 2.8; women: 1.2). Between 1995 and 2014, we noted an increase in excess life-years lost for neoplasms (men: 0.7; women: 0.4), heart diseases (men: 1.2; women: 0.3), and respiratory diseases (men: 0.3; women: 0.2), and a decrease for suicide (men: -0.7; women: -0 .5) and accidents (men: -0.9; women: -0.5).
   Interpretation By applying a novel approach, more precise estimates of life-years lost were obtained. The increase in excess mortality due to medical diseases and disorders among people with mental disorders emphasises the need for future interventions to address these aspects as well as the continued high shares of excess mortality due to alcohol misuse, suicide, and accidents.

AB Introduction: Links between childhood residential mobility and multiple adverse outcomes through to maturity, and effect modification of these associations by familial SES, are incompletely understood.
   Methods: A national cohort of people born in Denmark in 1971-1997 were followed from their 15th birthdays until their early forties (N = 1,475,030). Residential moves during each age year between birth and age 14 years were examined, with follow-up to 2013. Incidence rate ratios for attempted suicide, violent criminality, psychiatric illness, substance misuse, and natural and unnatural deaths were estimated. The analyses were conducted during 2014-2015.
   Results: Elevated risks were observed for all examined outcomes, with excess risk seen among those exposed to multiple versus single relocations in a year. Risks grew incrementally with increasing age of exposure to mobility. For violent offending, attempted suicide, substance misuse, and unnatural death, sharp spikes in risk linked with multiple relocations in a year during early/mid-adolescence were found. With attempted suicide and violent offending, the primary outcomes, a distinct risk gradient was observed with increasing age at exposure across the socioeconomic spectrum.
   Conclusions: The links between childhood residential mobility and negative outcomes in later life appear widespread across multiple endpoints, with elevation in risk being particularly marked if frequent residential change occurs during early/mid-adolescence. Heightened vigilance is indicated for relocated adolescents and their families, with a view to preventing longer-term adverse outcomes in this population among all socioeconomic groups. Risk management will require close cooperation among multiple public agencies, particularly child, adolescent, and adult mental health services. (C) 2016 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

TI Paraplegia after suicidal attempt
SO PSYCHIATRISCHE PRAXIS
LA German
DT Article
ID SPINAL-CORD INJURY; DIALYSIS; DENMARK
AB For the first time in Switzerland, patients were followed up who had become paraplegic after a suicidal attempt, and who had to spend a certain time in a center for paraplegics (corresponding to 3% of all traumatically induced cases of myeloparalysis). Records and catamnestic data of patients with paraplegia after suicidal attempt during the years 1982-1996 (n = 38) - all being or having been patients of the centers for paraplegics of Basel and Nottwil (canton of Lucerne) - were evaluated. Catamnestic investigations performed from one month to 14 years after the suicidal attempt, based on a structured dialogue with a standardized, computerized questionnaire, led, among others, to the following conclusions: The average age of these patients (20 males and 18 females) was 38 years. The most frequently encountered suicidal method, leading to the paraplegic lesion, was a fall from a window of a building (89,6%). In 55% of the cases, psychiatric disease, especially depression, alcohol and drug dependence, had been diagnosed prior to the suicidal attempt. 37% of patients hat attempted suicide at least once before the attempt leading to the paraplegic condition. 34% had been hospitalized for psychiatric reasons on an earlier occasion. In 26%, a farewell letter was written. As far as the level of the paraplegic lesions is concerned, patients were equally distributed (50% each) between thoracal/cervical and lumbar lesions. The associated sexual impairment was experienced by each one of the 38 patients as a most disturbing problem. Despite the limited number of cases and the partially short time interval between the suicidal attempt and the follow-up investigation, results seem to indicate that such patients are not likely to commit suicide on a later occasion. One single patient had tried to commit suicide several times after the suicidal attempt event under discussion.

AB IMPORTANCE Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) can have serious long-term consequences, including psychiatric disorders. However, few studies have assessed the association between TBI and risk of suicide.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the association between TBI and subsequent suicide.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study using nationwide registers covering 7 418 391 individuals (>= 10 years) living in Denmark (1980-2014) with 164 265 624 person-years' follow-up; 567 823 (7.6%) had a medical contact for TBI. Data were analyzed using Poisson regression adjusted for relevant covariates, including fractures not involving the skull, psychiatric diagnoses, and deliberate self-harm.
   EXPOSURE Medical contacts for TBI recorded in the National Patient Register (1977-2014) as mild TBI (concussion), skull fracture without documented TBI, and severe TBI (head injuries with evidence of structural brain injury).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Suicide recorded in the Danish Cause of Death register until December 31, 2014.
   RESULTS Of 34 529 individuals who died by suicide (mean age, 52 years [SD, 18 years]; 32.7% women; absolute rate 21 per 100 000 person-years [95% CI, 20.8-21.2]), 3536 (10.2%) had medical contact: 2701 with mild TBI, 174 with skull fracture without documented TBI, and 661 with severe TBI. The absolute suicide rate was 41 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI, 39.2-41.9) among those with TBI vs 20 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI, 19.7-20.1) among those with no diagnosis of TBI. The adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) was 1.90 (95% CI, 1.83-1.97). Compared with those without TBI, severe TBI (absolute rate, 50.8 per 100 000 person-years; 95% CI, 46.9-54.6) was associated with an IRR of 2.38 (95% CI, 2.20-2.58), whereas mild TBI (absolute rate, 38.6 per 100 000 person-years; 95% CI, 37.1-40.0), and skull fracture without documented TBI (absolute rate, 42.4 per 100 000 person-years; 95% CI, 36.1-48.7) had an IRR of 1.81 (95% CI, 1.74-1.88) and an IRR of 2.01 (95% CI, 1.73-2.34), respectively. Suicide risk was associated with number of medical contacts for TBI compared with those with no TBI contacts: 1 TBI contact, absolute rate, 34.3 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI, 33.0-35.7; IRR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.68-1.83); 2 TBI contacts, absolute rate, 59.8 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI, 55.1-64.6; IRR, 2.31; 95% CI, 2.13-2.51); and 3 or more TBI contacts, absolute rate, 90.6 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI, 82.3-98.9; IRR, 2.59; 95% CI, 2.35-2.85; all P < .001 for the IRR's). Compared with the general population, temporal proximity since the last medical contact for TBI was associated with risk of suicide (P <. 001), with an IRR of 3.67 (95% CI, 3.33-4.04) within the first 6 months and an incidence IRR of 1.76 (95% CI, 1.67-1.86) after 7 years.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this nationwide registry-based retrospective cohort study individuals with medical contact for TBI, compared with the general population without TBI, had increased suicide risk.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between early parental death before the child reaches age 30 years and subsequent use of antidepressants.
   Methods: Our nationwide population-based cohort of persons born in Denmark in 1970-1990 with follow-up in the period 1997-2009 comprised 1,124,215 persons, of whom 71,380 were bereaved. We used Poisson models to assess rate ratios for use of antidepressants according to early parental death.
   Results: Follow-up yielded 13,074,146 person-years at risk during which 93,347 persons used antidepressants. Persons who experienced early parental death had an increased risk for use of antidepressants (men: risk ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.16, 1.26; women: 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.19, 1.27). We observed stronger associations for women whose parent died by suicide than from other causes, who lost their mother rather than their father, and who lost a parent early rather than later. The increased risk remained more than 2 years from the loss.
   Conclusions: Persons who lost a parent had an increased risk of use of antidepressants. Subgroups with particularly increased risk, included women, who were bereaved by suicides, who experienced loss of a mother, and who were bereaved when young. The risk of initiating antidepressant use was increased both immediately after the loss and later. Our results support that early parental death severely affects children's psychological well-being.

AB Background Discharged psychiatric inpatients are at elevated risk of serious adverse outcomes, but no previous study has comprehensively examined an array of multiple risks in a single cohort.
   Methods We used data from the Danish Civil Registration System to delineate a cohort of all individuals born in Denmark in 1967-2000, who were alive and residing in Denmark on their 15th birthday, and who had been discharged from their first inpatient psychiatric episode at age 15 years or older. Each individual in the discharged cohort was matched on age and sex with 25 comparators without a history of psychiatric admission. Data linked to each individual were also obtained from the Psychiatric Central Research Register, Register of Causes of Death, National Patient Register, and the National Crime Register. We used survival analysis techniques to estimate absolute and relative risks of all-cause mortality, suicide, accidental death, homicide victimisation, homicide perpetration, non-fatal self-harm, violent criminality, and hospitalisation following violence, until Dec 31, 2015.
   Findings We included 62 922 individuals in the discharged cohort, and 1 573 050 matched comparators. Risks for each of all eight outcomes examined were markedly elevated in the discharged cohort relative to the comparators. Within 10 years of first discharge, the cumulative incidence of death, self-harm, committing a violent crime, or hospitalisation due to interpersonal violence was 32.0% (95% CI 31.6-32.5) in the discharged cohort (37.1% [36.5-37.8] in men and 27.2% [26.7-27.8] in women). Absolute risk of at least one adverse outcome occurring within this timeframe were highest in people diagnosed with a psychoactive substance use disorder at first discharge (cumulative incidence 49.4% [48.4-50.4]), and lowest in those diagnosed with a mood disorder (24.4% [23.6-25.2]). For suicide and nonfatal self-harm, risks were especially high during the first 3 months post-discharge, whereas risks for accidental death, violent criminality, and hospitalisation due to violence were more constant throughout the 10-year follow-up.
   Interpretation People discharged from inpatient psychiatric care are at higher risk than the rest of the population for a range of serious fatal and non-fatal adverse outcomes. Improved inter-agency liaison, intensive follow-up immediately after discharge, and longer-term social support are indicated. Copyright (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Younger or older parental age has been linked with a range of adverse offspring endpoints. We investigated associations between parental age and nine adverse offspring outcomes in three correlated domains: (i) Premature death: suicide, unnatural death, natural death; (ii) Psychiatric morbidity: any mental illness, suicide attempt, substance misuse; (iii) Criminality: violent offending, imprisonment, driving whilst intoxicated.
   Methods: Persons born in Denmark 1966-1996 were followed from their 15th until 40th birthday or December 2011 (N=1,793,681). Incidence rate ratios were estimated.
   Results: Offspring of teenage mothers had the greatest risks for all nine adverse outcomes, especially for imprisonment, violent offending, substance misuse, and attempted suicide. Teenage fatherhood was also associated with elevated risks for offspring adverse psychiatric and criminality outcomes, but not premature mortality (at ages 15-39 years). For the psychiatric and criminality outcomes there was a U-shape trend linked with paternal age, but risks for premature mortality tended to increase with rising paternal age. On the contrary, maternal age 30 years and over was not linked with raised risks for any of the outcomes examined. Limitations: Parental links are based on legal and not biological relationships.
   Conclusions: The substantially elevated risks linked with teenage motherhood for a variety of poor offspring outcomes is a concern for clinicians and policymakers. The associations observed across such a wide array of adverse outcomes also suggest that multiple causal mechanisms may be implicated.

AB Aim of database: To systematically monitor and improve the quality of treatment and care of patients with schizophrenia in Denmark. In addition, the database is accessible as a resource for research.
   Study population: Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and receiving mental health care in psychiatric hospitals or outpatient clinics. During the first year after the diagnosis, patients are classified as incident patients, and after this period as prevalent patients.
   Main variables: The registry currently contains 21 clinical quality measures in relation to the following domains: diagnostic evaluation, antipsychotic treatment including adverse reactions, cardiovascular risk factors including laboratory values, family intervention, psychoeducation, postdischarge mental health care, assessment of suicide risk in relation to discharge, and assessment of global functioning.
   Descriptive data: The recorded data are available electronically for the reporting clinicians and responsible administrative personnel, and they are updated monthly. The registry publishes the national and regional results of all included quality measures in the annual audit reports. External researchers may obtain access to the data for use in specific research projects by applying to the steering committee.
   Conclusion: The Danish Schizophrenia Registry represents a valuable source of informative data to monitor and improve the quality of care of patients with schizophrenia in Denmark. However, continuous resources and time devoted is necessary to maintain the integrity of the registry and the validity of the data.

AB We created a registry of Danish-born citizens of Denmark with incident International Classification of Diseases (10th ed.; ICD-10) severe stress and adjustment disorder diagnoses between 1995 and 2011. A unique personal identifier was used to retrieve and merge data on demographic characteristics and diagnoses (ICD-10 codes F43.x). Here we report on the incidence of these disorders and the demographic characteristics of the subset of the Danish population who have received 1 of these diagnoses: 111,844 adults and children received a first diagnosis between 1995 and 2011. More women than men (60.1% vs. 39.9%) received a diagnosis. Diagnoses increased during the late teens through early 30s. Adjustment disorder was the most common diagnosis (65.7% of adults and 64% of children). Reaction to severe stress unspecified was the second most common (19.8% of adults and 23.8% of children), and there was a large increase in both, as well as acute stress reaction diagnoses, in 2007 (3,717-5,141, 1,248-2,520, and 348-1,024 in 2006 to 2007, respectively). Findings regarding gender and age of onset are similar to other westernized countries. This registry can be used for future research programs, contributing to the study of stress and trauma.

AB Continuous deep sedation (CDS) is sometimes used to treat refractory symptoms in terminally ill patients. The aim of this paper was to estimate the frequency and characteristics of CDS in six European countries: Belgium, Denmark, Italy, The Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. Deaths reported to death registries were sampled and the reporting doctors received a mailed questionnaire about the medical decision making that preceded the death of the patient. The total number of deaths studied was 20,480. The response rate ranged between 44 % (Italy) and 75 % (The Netherlands). Of all deaths, CDS was applied in 2.5 % in Denmark and up to 8.5 % in Italy. Of all patients receiving CDS, 35 % (Italy) and up to 64 % (Denmark and The Netherlands) did not receive artificial nutrition or hydration. Patients who received CDS were more often male, younger than 80 years old, more likely to have had cancer, and died more often in a hospital compared to nonsudden deaths without CDS. The high variability of frequency and characteristics of CDS in the studied European countries points out the importance of medical education and scientific debate on this issue.

TI Depression as a prognostic factor for breast cancer mortality

AB It is unclear if depression or depressive symptoms have an effect on mortality in breast cancer patients. In this population-based, nationwide, retrospective cohort study in Denmark, depression was defined as effective or anxiety disorders that necessitated psychiatric hospital admission. All the affective and anxiety disorders were divided and categorized into five ordinal diagnostic groups. Early-stage (N= 10,382) and late-stage (N= 10,211) breast cancer patients were analyzed separately with Cox's regression adjusted,for well-documented somatic prognostic variables. The authors used survival analysis of data from three central registers and found that breast cancer patients with depression had a modestly but significantly higher risk of mortality depending on stage of breast cancer and time of depression. The same result was found after censoring unnatural causes of death such as accident, suicide, or homicide.

AB Aims: This study seeks to describe the impact of AIDS on the city of Copenhagen by estimating potential years of life lost (PYLL) before the age of 65 years and to estimate the impact of AIDS deaths on life expectancy for males and females. Methods: All AIDS cases reported to the national AIDS surveillance register for residents in the city of Copenhagen in the period 1983 - 98 were included. For comparative purposes data were obtained on six other causes of death: accidents, suicide, lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease, testicular cancer, and breast cancer. Results: Overall, deaths from AIDS accounted for 8% of all PYLL in men and showed an increasing tendency from 1983 to 1991, when it became the leading cause of PYLL. AIDS had most impact in men in the age group 25 - 44 years and accounted for 29% of all PYLL in this group at the peak in 1993, decreasing significantly after the introduction of anti-retroviral treatments to 5% of PYLL in 1998. Other leading causes of PYLL, accidents and suicide, also showed a decreasing tendency over the years, but of a much smaller magnitude than AIDS. The impact of AIDS in women was more modest. In the entire study period suicide, accidents, and breast cancer were the leading causes of PYLL in women. It was shown that AIDS deaths at the top of the epidemic in 1991 - 95 were responsible for a loss of 0.76 years in life expectancy for men and 0.08 years for women. Conclusions: AIDS has had a considerable impact on potential years of life lost. A significant decline in AIDS deaths has been seen since 1995 with an effect on life expectancy for men in the city of Copenhagen.

AB Background. Psychosocial therapy after deliberate self-harm might be associated with reduced risk of specific causes of death.
   Method. In this matched cohort study, we included patients, who after an episode of deliberate self-harm received psychosocial therapy at a Suicide Prevention Clinic in Denmark between 1992 and 2010. We used propensity score matching in a 1: 3 ratio to select a comparison group from 59 046 individuals who received standard care. National Danish registers supplied data on specific causes of death over a 20-year follow-up period.
   Results. At the end of follow-up, 391 (6.9%) of 5678 patients in the psychosocial therapy group had died, compared with 1736 (10.2%) of 17 034 patients in the matched comparison group. Lower odds ratios of dying by mental or behavioural disorders [0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37-0.79], alcohol-related causes (0.63, 95% CI 0.50-0.80) and other diseases and medical conditions (0.61, 95% CI 0.49-0.77) were noted in the psychosocial therapy group. Also, we found a reduced risk of dying by suicide as well as other external causes, however, not by neoplasms and circulatory system diseases. Numbers needed to treat were 212.9 (95% CI 139.5-448.4) for mental or behavioural disorders as a cause of death, 111.1 (95% CI 79.2-210.5) for alcohol-related causes and 96.8 (95% CI 69.1-161.8) for other diseases and medical conditions.
   Conclusions. Our findings indicate that psychosocial therapy after deliberate self-harm might reduce long-term risk of death from select medical conditions and external causes. These promising results should be tested in a randomized design.

AB Background: The effect of safety planning for people in suicidal crisis is not yet determined, but using safety plans to mitigate acute psychological crisis is regarded as best practice. Between 2016 and 2017, Australian and Danish stakeholders were involved in revising and updating the Danish MYPLAN mobile phone safety plan and translating the app into a culturally appropriate version for Australia.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the negotiation of stakeholders' suggestions and contributions to the design, function, and content of the MYPLAN app and to characterize significant developments in the emerging user-involving processes.
   Methods: We utilized a case study design where 4 focus groups and 5 user-involving workshops in Denmark and Australia were subjected to thematic analysis.
   Results: The analyses identified 3 consecutive phases in the extensive development of the app: from phase 1, Suggesting core functions, through phase 2, Refining functions, to phase 3, Negotiating the finish. The user-involving processes continued to prevent closure and challenged researchers and software developers to repeatedly reconsider the app's basic user interface and functionality. It was a limitation that the analysis did not include potentially determinative backstage dimensions of the decision-making process.
   Conclusions: The extended user involvement prolonged the development process, but it also allowed for an extensive exploration of different user perspectives and needs.

DE Radicalization awareness; working practice; PSP cooperation;
   radicalization
AB The police, social services, and psychiatry (PSP) is a structured cooperation between the police, social services, and the psychiatric system in Denmark. The aim of PSP is to ensure that relevant information is shared and supportive measures enhanced concerning citizens at risk, and it involves PSP representatives from each sector meeting frequently. PSP is implemented nationwide by law. In recent years, dealing with radicalization and the threat of terrorism have become key issues in society. The PSP cooperation already facilitates the identification of citizens at many kinds of risk (e.g. suicide, substance abuse, social decline, mental illness), and coordinates relevant intervention and treatment. The existing PSP cooperation is, therefore, an obvious forum for identifying and handling concerns of radicalization and extremism. The new working model includes an upgrade of all local PSP groups and an implementation of a nationwide evaluation of the initiative. This is a presentation of the working model and the experiences in practice.

DT Article
ID EVENT-RELATED FMRI; RETRIEVAL; RECALL
AB Tip-of-the-tongue states (TOTs) are judgments of the likelihood of imminent retrieval for items currently not recalled. In the present study, the relation of emotion to the experience of TOTs is explored. Emotion-inducing questions (e.g., "What is the term for ritual suicide in Japan?") were embedded among neutral questions (e.g., "What is the capital of Denmark?"). Participants attempted to recall the answers and, if unsuccessful, were asked if they were in a TOT and given a recognition test. For turecalled items, there were significantly more TOTs for the emotional items than for the neutral items, even though the recognition performance was identical. There were more TOTs for questions that followed emotional questions than TOTs for questions that followed neutral questions, suggesting the emotional arousal lasts beyond the specific question. These findings suggest that emotional cues increase the likelihood of TOTs. These data are consistent with a metacognitive view of TOTs.

AB Objectives: To determine the direction and magnitude of participation bias in end-of-life research.
   Methods: Within the framework of a European survey on medical end-of-life decisions, a non-response study was conducted among physicians in Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. People were asked about their attitudes and experiences in the area of medial end-of-life decision. The response rates ranged from 12.8% (Netherlands) to 39.4% (Switzerland). The responders (n = 5403) and the non-responders (n = 866) were compared regarding socio-demographic characteristics, experiences with terminal patients and agreement with attitudes towards "end-of-life decisions". The reasons for non-participation to the study were analyzed.
   Results: Non-response did not cause socio-demographic distortion, but non-responders had statistically significantly fewer terminal patients than responders. Agreement rates were statistically significantly higher among responders than among non-responders for euthanasia, non-treatment decision and life-preserving statements. Neutral answers were statistically significantly more frequent among non-responders than among responders for life-preserving and euthanasia statements. The most commonly mentioned reason for non-participation was "lack of time".
   Conclusion: Non-participation does cause an overestimation of proponents of life-shortening, as well as of life-preserving end-of-life decisions. Non-responders more often have ambiguous attitudes towards end-of-life decisions than responders.

AB The current study is based on a retrospective investigation of firearm deaths in Diyarbakir, which were autopsied by the Diyarbakir Branch of the Council of Forensic Medicine during the 6- year period. Four hundred-forty four deaths were investigated from January 1996 through December 2001, including homicide (296 cases, 66.7%), suicide (120 cases, 27%) and accidental shootings (28 cases, 6.3%). The age range of all firearm deaths in the study period was 5 to 75 years with a median age of 29.8 years. The majority were in the groups aged 16-25 years (38.7%). In the homicide group, 248 subjects (83.8%) were male, and 48 (16.2%) were female. The 31.1% of the homicide victims were in the group aged at 20-30 years. Of the 120 suicide victims, 56 (46.7%) were in the group aged 1620 years. The head was by far the favoured site, accounting for 82 (68.3%) deaths: entry wounds in the right temple accounted for 72 of these. Twenty-eight cases were accidental shootings and 18 of them were male (64.3%). Twelve of the 28 accidental victims (42.9%) were in the group aged 0-10 years. The eight cases were due to their own accidental shootings, and the remaining 20 cases were shot by others. Our findings show that the contributing factors for increasing death by firearm are terrorists' activities, traditional habits of obtaining and using guns and blood feuds.

TI National cohort study of absolute risk and age-specific incidence of

ID DELIBERATE SELF-HARM; MENTAL-DISORDERS; SUBSTANCE USE;
   GENERAL-POPULATION; COMPLETED SUICIDE; ACCIDENTAL DEATH; BIRTH COHORT;
   VIOLENCE; ALCOHOL; GENDER
AB Background: Psychiatric illness, substance misuse, suicidality, criminality and premature death represent major public health challenges that afflict a sizeable proportion of young people. However, studies of multiple adverse outcomes in the same cohort at risk are rare. In a national Danish cohort we estimated sex- and age-specific incidence rates and absolute risks of these outcomes between adolescence and early middle age.
   Methods: Using interlinked registers, persons born in Denmark 1966-1996 were followed from their 15th until 40th birthday or December 2011 (N = 2,070,904). We estimated sex-and age-specific incidence rates of nine adverse outcomes, in three main categories: Premature mortality (all-causes, suicide, accident); Psychiatric morbidity (any mental illness diagnosis, suicide attempt, alcohol or drug misuse disorder); Criminality (violent offending, receiving custodial sentence, driving under influence of alcohol or drugs). Cumulative incidences were also calculated using competing risk survival analyses.
   Results: For cohort members alive on their 15th birthday, the absolute risks of dying by age 40 were 1.99 % for males [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.95-2.03 %] and 0.85 % for females (95 % CI 0.83-0.88 %). The risks of substance misuse and criminality were also much higher for males, especially younger males, than for females. Specifically, the risk of a first conviction for a violent offence was highest amongst males aged below 20. Females, however, were more likely than males to have a hospital-treated psychiatric disorder. By age 40, 13.25 % of females (95 % CI 13.16-13.33 %) and 9.98 % of males (95 % CI 9.91-10.06 %) had been treated. Women aged below 25 were also more likely than men to first attempt suicide, but this pattern was reversed beyond this age. The greatest gender differentials in incidence rates were in criminality outcomes.
   Conclusions: This is the first comprehensive assessment of the incidence rates and absolute risks of these multiple adverse outcomes. Approximately 1 in 50 males and 1 in 120 females who are alive on their 15th birthday will die by age 40. By examining the same cohort at risk, we compared risks for multiple outcomes without differential inter-cohort biases. These epidemiological profiles will inform further research into the pathways leading to these adverse events and future preventive strategies.

AB Background: Immigration to the Nordic countries has increased in the last decades and foreign-born inhabitants now constitute a considerable part of the region's population. Several studies suggest poorer self-reported health among foreign-born compared to natives, while results on mortality and life expectancy are inconclusive. To date, few studies have summarized knowledge on mortality differentials by country of birth. This article aims to systematically review previous results on all-cause and cause-specific mortality by country of birth in the Nordic countries.
   Methods: The methodology was conducted and documented systematically and transparently using a narrative approach. We identified 43 relevant studies out of 6059 potentially relevant studies in August 2016, 35 of which used Swedish data, 8 Danish and 1 Norwegian.
   Results: Our findings from fully-adjusted models on Swedish data support claims of excess mortality risks in specific categories of foreign-born. Most notably, immigrants from other Nordic countries, especially Finland, experience increased risk of mortality from all causes, and specifically by suicide, breast and gynaecological cancers, and circulatory diseases. Increased risks in people from Central and Eastern Europe can also be found. On the contrary, decreased risks for people with Southern European and Middle Eastern origins are found for all-cause, suicide, and breast and gynaecological cancer mortality. The few Danish studies are more difficult to compare, with conflicting results arising in the analysis. Finally, results from the one Norwegian study suggest significantly decreased mortality risks among foreign-born, to be explored in further research.
   Conclusions: With new studies being published on mortality differentials between native and foreign-born populations in the Nordic countries, specific risk patterns have begun to arise. Regardless, data from most Nordic countries remains limited, as does the information on specific causes of death. The literature should be expanded in upcoming years to capture associations between country of birth and mortality more clearly.

AB We aimed to examine whether early life bereavement, as indicator of severe stress, was associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia later in life.
   Based on population registers, we established a cohort of all children born in Denmark (N = 1 686 416) and Sweden (N = 2 563 659) from 1973 to 1997. Children were categorized as exposed if they lost a first-degree relative during the first 18 years of life. Outcome is the first diagnosis of schizophrenia as either inpatient or outpatient. Log-linear Poisson regression models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs).
   A total of 188,850 children (4.6%) experienced death of a first-degree relative from birth to 18 years of age. Compared with unexposed children, those exposed had overall a 39% higher risk of schizophrenia (= 1.39, 95% CI [confidence interval]: 1.32-1.47). The IRR was particularly high if the family member committed suicide (aIRR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.90-2.34) or died due to an injury or accident (aIRR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.27-1.63). The IRR of schizophrenia decreased with increasing child's age at bereavement (P < 0.0001). Children who experienced >1 death during the first 18 years of life (aIRR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.46-2.19) had a higher risk than those with a single death (aIRR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.30-1.45).
   The study suggested that exposure to death of a first-degree relative before 18 years was associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia in later life. The complex mechanisms behind these associations remain to be elucidated.

AB In the context of an European collaborative research project (EURELD), a study on attitudes towards medical end-of-life decisions was conducted among physicians in Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Australia also joined the consortium. A written questionnaire with structured questions was sent to practising physicians from specialties frequently involved in the care of dying patients. 10,139 questionnaires were studied. Response rate was equal to or larger than 50% in all countries except Italy (39%). Apart from general agreement with respect to the alleviation of pain and symptoms with possible life-shortening effect, there was large variation in support-between and within countries-for medical decision that may result in the hastening of death. A principal component factor analysis found that 58% of the variance of the responses is explained by four factors. 'Country' explained the largest part of the variation of the standardized factor scores. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Involuntary treatment in the prevention of fatal anorexia nervosa (AN) is still controversial.
   Method: Five fatal cases of AN were identified out of 1,160 patients who attended a specialized eating disorder unit between 1994 and 2006. Information on inpatient, ambulatory, and emergency room treatment was extracted from a population-based registration system.
   Results: Personality disorders were diagnosed in all five patients and substance abuse in three patients. In all cases, illness duration was more than 10 years and late onset was seen in two cases. None of the deaths were due to suicide. Involuntary hospital admission was instituted for three patients, but only one patient was compulsory detained more than once. Four patients died after having discontinued treatment.
   Discussion: Compulsory treatment may be of crucial importance in the prevention of fatalities in patients with long-standing AN and psychiatric comorbidity who discontinue treatment. (C) 2011 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB A major issue in the care of terminally ill patients is communication and information provision. This paper reports the extent to which physicians in Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland discuss topics relevant to end of life care with terminally ill patients and their relatives (without first informing the patient), and possible associations between physician-specific characteristics and such discussions. Response rates to the postal survey ranged from 39% to 68% (n = 10139). Physicians in most of the countries except Italy in principle, always' discuss issues related to terminal illness with their patients but not with patients' relatives without first informing the patient, unless the relatives ask. Cross-national differences remained strong after controlling for physician characteristics. The majority of physicians appeared to support the principle of patient-centred care to terminally ill patients, consistent with palliative care philosophy and with the law and/or professional guidelines in most of the countries studied.

AB Background The authors studied injury mortality in Denmark among refugees and immigrants compared with that among native Danes.
   Method A register-based, historical prospective cohort design. All refugees (n=29 139) and family reunited immigrants (n=27 134) who between 1 January 1993 and 31 December 1999 received residence permission were included and matched 1:4 on age and sex with native Danes. Civil registration numbers were cross-linked to the Register of Causes of Death, and fatalities due to unintentional and intentional injuries were identified based on ICD-10 diagnosis. Sex-specific mortality ratios were estimated by migrant status and region of birth, adjusting for age and income and using a Cox regression model after a median follow-up of 11-12 years.
   Results Compared with native Danes, both female (RR=0.44; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.83) and male (RR=0.40; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.56) refugees as well as female (RR=0.40; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.76) and male (RR=0.22; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.42) immigrants had significantly lower mortality from unintentional injuries. Suicide rates were significantly lower for male refugees (RR=0.38; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.61) and male immigrants (RR=0.24; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.59), whereas their female counterparts showed no significant differences. Only immigrant women had a significantly higher homicide rate (RR=3.09; 95% CI 1.11 to 8.60) compared with native Danes.
   Conclusions Overall results were advantageous to migrant groups. Research efforts should concentrate on investigating protective factors among migrants, which may benefit injury prevention in the majority population.

AB Being able to form and maintain intimate relationships is an essential part of development and the early loss of a parent may negatively affect this ability. This study investigates the association between parental loss before the age of 18 years and the formation and dissolution of marriage and cohabitation relationships in adulthood, in relation to factors that may help identify potentially vulnerable subgroups of bereaved children, that is, sex of the deceased parent, cause of death and child's age at the time of death. Using data from national registries, we followed all children born in Denmark between 1970 and 1995 (n = 1,525,173) and used Poisson regression models to assess rate ratios by gender for relationship formation and separation according to early parental loss. We stratified the analyses by sex of the deceased parent, cause of death and child's age at the time of death, and adjusted for the confounding effects of parental income, education level, and psychiatric illness. We found that parental loss was associated with a higher rate of relationship formation for young women, but not young men, and higher rates of separation for both men and women. The associations with separation were stronger for persons who lost a parent to suicide than to other causes. The effects were relatively small, a possible testimony to the resilience of developmental processes in most children. However, as long-term relationships are associated with physical and psychological health, interventions for bereaved children and families are important, especially in the subgroup bereaved by suicide.

AB Context: Persons suffering from severe mental disorder have an excess mortality compared to persons with no mental disorder. However, the magnitude of the excess mortality differs from one mental disorder to another, and the impact on mortality if a first-degree family member suffers from a mental disorder has never been examined in a population-based study.
   Objective: Our objective was to examine and compare mortality rates after admission with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, unipolar depressive disorder, or bipolar affective disorder and to examine the impact of family history of psychiatric admission on mortality.
   Method: We established a register-based cohort study of 5.5 million persons born in Denmark who were alive on or born after January 1, 1973 and alive on their 15th birthday. Mortality rate ratios were estimated by survival analysis, using Poisson regression.
   Results: Unipolar depressive disorder, bipolar affective disorder, and schizoaffective disorder were associated with the same pattern of excess mortality. Schizophrenia had a lower mortality from unnatural causes of death and a higher mortality from natural causes compared to the 3 other disorders. Family history of psychiatric admission was associated with excess mortality.
   Conclusion: Patients suffering from the 4 disorders all had an excess mortality, but the pattern of excess mortality was not the same. There was an excess mortality associated with mental disorder in a first-degree family member, but this only explained a small part of the general excess mortality associated with the 4 mental disorders examined.

AB Early onset schizophrenia (EOS) begins in childhood or adolescence. EOS is associated with poor treatment response and may benefit from timely use of clozapine. This study aimed to identify the predictors of clozapine use in EOS and characterize the clinical profile and outcome of clozapine-treated youths with schizophrenia. We conducted a nationwide population-based study using linked data from Danish medical registries. We examined all incident cases of EOS (i.e., cases diagnosed prior to their 18th birthday) between December 31st 1994 and December 31st 2006 and characterized their demographic, clinical and treatment profiles. We then used multivariable cox proportional hazard models to identify predictors of clozapine treatment in this patient population. We identified 662 EOS cases (1.9% of all schizophrenia cases), of whom 108 (17.6%) had commenced clozapine by December 31st 2008. Patients had on average 3 antipsychotic trials prior to clozapine initiation. The mean interval between first antipsychotic treatment and clozapine initiation was 3.2 (2.9) years. Older age at diagnosis of schizophrenia [HR=1.2, 95% Cl (1.05-1.4), p=0.01], family history of schizophrenia [HR=2.1, 95% CI (1.1-3.04), p=0.02] and attempted suicide [HR=1.8, 95% Cl (1.1-3.04), p=0.02] emerged as significant predictors of clozapine use. The majority of patients (n=96, 88.8%) prescribed clozapine appeared to have a favorable clinical response as indicated by continued prescription redemption and improved occupational outcomes. Our findings support current recommendations for the timely use of clozapine in EOS. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The incidence of disability pension (DP) is high in several European countries. However, knowledge on associations of cause-specific DP and premature death is limited. The aims were to: 1) investigate the association between cause-specific DP and all-cause and cause-specific mortality among women and men and 2) examine period effects of this association.
   Methods: Three prospective population-based cohort studies were conducted, the first including all individuals aged 16-64 years who lived in Sweden all of 1995 and who were not on DP before 1995 (N = 5 006 523, 48.8% women). Those granted DP in 1995 were compared to those not granted DP regarding mortality during 1996-2009. Two other cohorts were created in a similar fashion, for 2000 and 2005, respectively, and in comparisons each of the three cohorts were followed up for four years with regard to all-cause mortality as well as death due to cancer, circulatory disorders, or suicide. All analyses were stratified by sex and we controlled for a number of socio-demographic factors and inpatient care.
   Results: Individuals with granted DP had a higher mortality risk, women (HR 1.75; 95% CI 1.68-1.82) and men (HR 1.66; 95% CI 1.61-1.71) and highest for cancer. People on DP with some diagnoses had higher risk of premature death in other causes of death than their DP diagnoses. All-cause mortality risk varied with DP-diagnosis and was lowest for musculoskeletal diagnoses. The mortality HR decreased among women with DP between the cohort 1995, HR 2.07 (1.92-2.24) and the cohort 2005, 1.84 (1.71-1.99). Here, temporal decreases in mortality risk occurred particularly in DP due to mental diagnoses and cancer.
   Conclusions: All DP diagnoses were associated with a higher mortality risk. Even individuals granted DP due to diagnoses with low mortality risk displayed a higher risk for premature death. This warrants close monitoring of disability pensioners and further studies on consequences of being on disability pension.

AB Objectives A population-based, nested, case-control study was carried out to quantify the risk of affective and stress-related disorders according to occupation in the entire Danish workforce.
   Methods All incident hospital patients and out-patients aged 18-65 years who received a first-time-ever diagnosis of an affective disorder (ICD-10, F 30-39) or stress-related condition (ICD-10, F 40-48) in Denmark from I January 1995 through 31 December 1998 were identified in the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register (N=28 971). For each case, five randomly selected referents of the same age and gender were drawn from a 5% sample of the Danish population (N=144 855). The occupation held I year before a person became a case was obtained from Denmark's Integrated Database for Labour Market Research. Occupation was classified according to the Danish version of the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ICD). Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for 25 occupational categories with clerical staff as the reference were calculated using a conditional logistic regression adjusted for sociodemographic covariates.
   Results Eight occupations were associated with significantly elevated risks (RR range 1.20-1.58) among the women, while eight occupations were associated with a significantly reduced risk (RR range 0.50-0.76) among the men. The risks were highest for the teaching (RR 1.58) and health (RR 1.53) professions. Only social workers and professionals caring for mentally and physically disabled persons faced an elevated risk irrespective of gender (women RR 1.72, 95% Cl 1.38-2.16; men RR 2.09, 95% Cl 1.38-3-15).
   Conclusions Major depression and stress-related psychiatric disorders are related to occupation. Risk profiles vary strongly according to gender.

DE crisis; emergency; hospitalization; mental disorder; suicidal behaviour
AB The purpose of the study was to evaluate psychiatric emergency outreach after functioning for a period of 2 years in Copenhagen, Denmark. Psychiatric emergency outreach was staffed by a psychiatrist and an ambulance driver, and the target group was defined as mentally ill and persons in severe crisis. For each of 935 calls covering 777 different patients, a registration form with social and clinically relevant data was filled out. After the 2-year period, patients were looked up in the National Cause of Death Register and the National Psychiatric Case Register. A total of 66% were previously registered as psychiatric patients, and in 37% of all calls, the patient had psychotic symptoms. In 25% of the calls, the patient was admitted to psychiatric hospital; 38% of the admissions were involuntary. Forty-eight per cent of the calls were initiated by relatives, friends or neighbours. Suicidal behaviour was frequent. There were significantly more calls in socially deprived areas. Standard Mortality Rates were high for all causes of death (5.00), and especially for suicide (31.98). In conclusion, psychiatric emergency outreach seems to fulfill some of its purpose.

AB In this paper we analyse how risk factors in highly industrialised agriculture are connected to animal neglect. With Danish agriculture as a case study, we use two types of data. First, we use register data from Statistics Denmark to map how risk factors such as farmers' financial and social troubles are connected to convictions of neglect. Second, we analyse narratives where interviewed farmers, involved in cases of neglect, describe how they themselves experienced the incidents. We find that while livestock farmers in general have a low risk of animal neglect problems, a small percentage of them face severe financial difficulties, divorce and psychiatric problems, which are connected to an increased risk of being convicted for the neglect of farm animals. The narratives bring forward themes of pressure related to financial trouble, technological break down, family problems, stress and a growing concern among the farmers towards the governmental control in farm animal production. We discuss how these factors can be used to identify and help farmers with a high risk of being convicted of livestock neglect.

AB In recent years, the European euthanasia debate has become more intense, and the practice was legalized in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. We aimed to determine the current degree of public acceptance of euthanasia across Europe and investigate what factors explain differences.
   Data were derived from the 2008 wave of the European Values Survey (EVS), conducted in 47 European countries (N = 67,786, response rate = 69 %). Acceptance of euthanasia was rated on a 1-10 scale.
   Relatively high acceptance was found in a small cluster of Western European countries, including the three countries that have legalized euthanasia and Denmark, France, Sweden and Spain. In a large part of Europe public acceptance was relatively low to moderate. Comparison with the results of the previous EVS wave (1999) suggests a tendency towards a polarization in Europe, with most of Western Europe becoming more permissive and most of Eastern Europe becoming less permissive.
   There is roughly a West-East division in euthanasia acceptance among the European public, making a pan-European policy approach to the issue difficult.

AB The Danish Multiple Sclerosis Registry was formally established in 1956 but started operating in 1949 with a nationwide prevalence survey. Since then, the Registry has continued collecting data on new and old cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) or suspected MS from multiple sources. The Registry reclassifies cases according to standardized diagnostic criteria (currently those of Poser et al). A total of 14,441 cases fulfilling the diagnostic criteria had been registered at the most recently completed follow-up by 1 January 1997; 10,851 had onset from 1948 to 1996 and 3560 before 1948. The completeness has formerly been estimated at about 90%, higher for cohorts with older onset and lower for cohorts with onset close to follow-up. The estimated validity of the diagnosis for autopsy cases classified as definite MS in the Registry is 94%. A long-term nationwide Registry has proved to be a valuable instrument for monitoring incidence and prevalence, analysing survival, performing genetic analysis, providing unselected patient samples for clinical analyses, performing case-control studies and prospective studies and estimating the need for treatment and care.

AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: Treatments for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) have changed over time, with unclear effects on prognosis. We assessed overall and cause-specific mortality in a Danish cohort of patients with IBD during a 30-year time period. METHODS: We compared data from 36,080 patients with UC and 15,361 with CD, who were diagnosed in Denmark from 1982 to 2010, and compared them with data from 2,858,096 matched individuals from the general population (controls). Overall and cause-specific mortality were estimated by Cox regression analysis, adjusted for age, sex, disease duration, and known comorbidities before IBD diagnosis. Results were presented as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Mortality greatly increased in the first year after individuals were diagnosed with IBD; intermediate-term and long-term mortalities increased by approximately 10% among individuals with UC and 50% among those with CD, compared with the general population. Compared with the time period of 1982-1989, overall mortalities decreased among patients diagnosed with UC from 1990 to 1999 (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.90-1.02) and from 2000 to 2010 (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82-0.95). These reductions were mainly due to decreased mortality from colorectal cancer, gastrointestinal disorders, and suicide. For individuals with CD, mortality did not change among these time periods because of long-term increases in mortality from infections, cancer, respiratory diseases, and gastrointestinal diseases. CONCLUSIONS: In a Danish cohort, mortality from UC decreased from 1982 to 2010, largely because of reduced mortalities from gastrointestinal disorders and colorectal cancer. People with CD had 50% greater mortality than the general population, and this value did not change during this time period.

AB In the period 1992-1996 a total of 89 unidentified bodies/skulls found in Danish waters were investigated at the three University Institutes of Forensic Medicine in Denmark. Males constituted 79% of the total material. Open water was the finding place in half the cases. about one-fourth was found on shore and another fourth in a harbor basin. Totally 73 bodies and one skull were identified. Danes constituted 57% of the material. Almost all non-Danes originated from countries with borders to the waters surrounding Denmark. The cause of death was in 71% stated as presumably/possibly drowning, in 5% as severe lesions (precipitation) and in 25% it could not be solved. The manner of death was in non-Danes most often stated as an accident (56%), and according to this the finding place in non-Danes most frequently was the open water (66%). In Danes suicide predominated (71%) and the finding place in Danes was almost equally distributed among open water, shores and harbors. respectively, Among the totally 74 identified cases, 83% of the total material, an initial suggestion of the identity based on effects found on the body was possible in 43 cases (58%). The final identification was performed by means of forensic dental examination in total 58 cases (78%). in Danes in 93% and in non-Danes in 59%. In the remaining 16 cases one or more of the following contributed to the final identification: information about dental condition, clothing, personal papers, X-ray photos. jewelry, tattoos/scars and fingerprints. The importance of a close collaboration between the police, the forensic pathologist and the forensic dental expert in order to reach a fair number of positive identifications is emphasized.

AB Objective: To examine differences in end-of-life decision-making in patients dying at home, in a hospital or in a care home.
   Design: A death certificate study: certifying physicians from representative samples of death certificates, taken between June 2001 and February 2002, were sent questionnaires on the end-of-life decision-making preceding the patient's death.
   Setting: Four European countries: Belgium (Flanders), Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland (German-speaking part).
   Main outcome measures: The incidence of and communication in different end-of-life decisions: physician-assisted death, alleviation of pain/symptoms with a possible life-shortening effect, and non-treatment decisions.
   Results: Response rates ranged from 59% in Belgium to 69% in Switzerland. The total number of deaths studied was 12 492. Among all non-sudden deaths the incidence of several end-of-life decisions varied by place of death. Physician-assisted death occurred relatively more often at home (0.3-5.1%); non-treatment decisions generally occurred more often in hospitals (22.4-41.3%), although they were also frequently taken in care homes in Belgium (26.0%) and Switzerland (43.1%). Continuous deep sedation, in particular without the administration of food and fluids, was more likely to occur in hospitals. At home, end-of-life decisions were usually more often discussed with patients. The incidence of discussion with other caregivers was generally relatively low at home compared with in hospitals or care homes.
   Conclusion: The results suggest the possibility that end-of-life decision-making is related to the care setting where people die. The study results seem to call for the development of good end-of-life care options and end-of-life communication guidelines in all settings.

AB Purpose
   The aim of this nationwide, register-based cohort study was to determine whether women treated for depression before primary early-stage breast cancer are at increased risk for receiving treatment that is not in accordance with national guidelines and for poorer survival.
   Material and Methods
   We identified 45,325 women with early breast cancer diagnosed in Denmark from 1998 to 2011. Of these, 744 women (2%) had had a previous hospital contact (as an inpatient or outpatient) for depression and another 6,068 (13%) had been treated with antidepressants. Associations between previous treatment of depression and risk of receiving nonguideline treatment of breast cancer were assessed in multivariable logistic regression analyses. We compared the overall survival, breast cancer-specific survival, and risk of death by suicide of women who were and were not treated for depression before breast cancer in multivariable Cox regression analyses.
   Results
   Tumor stage did not indicate a delay in diagnosis of breast cancer in women previously treated for depression; however, those given antidepressants before breast cancer had a significantly increased risk of receiving nonguideline treatment (odds ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.27) and significantly worse overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.28) and breast cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.20). Increased but nonsignificant estimated risks were also found for women with previous hospital contacts for depression. In subgroup analyses, the association of depression with poor survival was particularly strong among women who did not receive the indicated adjuvant systemic therapy.
   Conclusion
   Women previously treated for depression constitute a large subgroup of patients with breast cancer who are at risk for receiving nonguideline breast cancer treatment, which probably contributes to poorer overall and breast cancer-specific survival.

TI Third-wave cognitive therapy versus mentalisation-based treatment for
   major depressive disorder: a randomised clinical trial
SO BMJ OPEN

DT Article
ID RATING-SCALE; PSYCHODYNAMIC THERAPY; SEQUENTIAL-ANALYSIS; 3RD WAVE; BECK
AB Objective: To compare the benefits and harms of third-wave cognitive therapy versus mentalisation-based therapy in a small sample of depressed participants.
   Setting: The trial was conducted at an outpatient psychiatric clinic for non-psychotic patients in Roskilde, Denmark.
   Participants: 44 consecutive adult participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder.
   Interventions: 18 weeks of third-wave cognitive therapy (n=22) versus 18 weeks of mentalisation-based treatment (n=22).
   Outcomes: The primary outcome was the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HDRS) at end of treatment (18 weeks). Secondary outcomes were: remission (HDRS <8), Beck's Depression Inventory, Symptom Checklist 90 Revised and The WHO-Five Well-being Index 1999.
   Results: The trial inclusion lasted for about 2 years as planned but only 44 out of the planned 84 participants were randomised. Two mentalisation-based participants were lost to follow-up. The unadjusted analysis showed that third-wave participants compared with mentalisation-based participants did not differ significantly regarding the 18 weeks HDRS score (12.9 vs 17.0; mean difference -4.14; 95% CI -8.30 to 0.03; p=0.051). In the analysis adjusted for baseline HDRS score, the difference was favouring third-wave cognitive therapy (p=0.039). At 18 weeks, five of the third-wave participants (22.7%) were in remission versus none of the mentalisation-based participants (p=0.049). We recorded no suicide attempts or suicides during the intervention period in any of the 44 participants. No significant differences were found between the two intervention groups on the remaining secondary outcomes.
   Conclusions: Third-wave cognitive therapy may be more effective than mentalisation-based therapy for depressive symptoms measured on the HDRS. However, more randomised clinical trials are needed to assess the effects of third-wave cognitive therapy and mentalisation-based treatment for depression.

AB Objectives. To study. prospectively, in young adult patients, the mortality during the first years after the diagnosis of diabetes.
   Design. The Diabetes Incidence Study in Sweden (DISS) aims to register all incident cases aged 15-34 years. During a 10-year period all deaths were identified by record linkage to the national Cause of Death Registry.
   Subjects. During the period, 4097 new cases were registered and classified as type 1 diabetes (73%). type 2 (16%), secondary (2%) and unclassified (9%). The median follow-up was 5 years (21 001 person-years).
   Main outcome measures. Calculation of the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Evaluation of all deceased by scrutiny of clinical records, death certificates and autopsy protocols.
   Results. Fifty-eight patients died, corresponding to an SMR of 3.5 (CI = 2.7-4.5), which increased from 1.5 at 15-19 years to 4.1 at 30-34 years, SMR was 2.7 in primary diabetes: 2.3 (1.6-3.3) in type 1 and 4.1 (2.6-6.7) in type 2. In secondary diabetes, alcohol-associated pancreatitis a common cause, SMR was 32 (CI = 24-45). Evidence of alcohol or drug misuse, mental dysfunction or suicide was found in 40 of all 58 deceased cases. Less often, hypoglycaemia (n = 7) or hyperglycaemia-ketoacidosis (n = 11) was present at death. Unexplained 'dead in bed' was found once.
   Conclusions. In the investigated population-based cohort the early mortality was about threefold increased. Hypoglycaemia and ketoacidosis per se played a relatively small role compared with a heavy impact from social and mental dysfunction, and from careless use of alcohol or drugs.

AB BACKGROUND: After a child's death, parents may experience depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and increased risk for cancers, diabetes, psychiatric hospitalization, and suicide. Racial/ethnic differences are unknown. This longitudinal study investigated health and functioning of Hispanic, black, and white parents through 13 months after NICU/PICU death.
   METHODS: Parents (176 mothers, 73 fathers) of 188 deceased infants/children were recruited from 4 NICUs, 4 PICUs, and state death certificates 2 to 3 weeks after death. Deaths occurred after limiting treatment/withdrawing life support (57%), unsuccessful resuscitation (32%), or brain death (11%). Data on parent physical health (hospitalizations, chronic illness), mental health (depression, PTSD, alcohol use), and functioning (partner status, employment) were collected in the home at 1, 3, 6, and 13 months after death.
   RESULTS: Mean age for mothers was 32 +/- 8, fathers 37 +/- 9; 79% were Hispanic or black. Thirteen months after infant/child death, 72% of parents remained partnered, 2 mothers had newly diagnosed cancer, alcohol consumption was below problem drinking levels, parents had 98 hospitalizations (29% stress related) and 132 newly diagnosed chronic health conditions, 35% of mothers and 24% of fathers had clinical depression, and 35% of mothers and 30% of fathers had clinical PTSD. At 6 months after infant/child death, 1 mother attempted suicide. Week 1 after infant/child death, 9% of mothers and 32% of fathers returned to employment; 7 parents took no time off. More Hispanic and black mothers than white mothers had moderate/severe depression at 6 months after infant/child death and PTSD at every time point.
   CONCLUSIONS: Parents, especially minority mothers, have negative physical and mental health outcomes during the first year after NICU/PICU death.

AB Background: Patients with schizophrenia requiring long-term institutionalization represent those with the worst outcome, leading to personal costs for patients and relatives and constituting a large economical burden for society. Aim: To identify characteristics and predictors of outcome of institutionalized patients with schizophrenia.
   Method: One-year follow-up cohort study, utilizing the Danish national registers, of all institutionalized and non-institutionalized patients with schizophrenia in Denmark with an ICD-10 lifetime diagnosis of schizophrenia (F20.0-F20.9) since 1969 and alive at the index date of January 1st 2006 (total number 22,395).
   Results: Compared with non-institutionalized patients, institutionalized patients (n = 2188; 9.8%) had earlier onset of schizophrenia and lower scholastic achievements, were more often diagnosed with a hebephrenic subtype (odds ratio (OR), 234; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.95-2.80; p<0.001), received higher dosages of antipsychotics, more antipsychotic polypharmacy and more concomitant medications, and had more substance misuse and early retirement pension. In a logistic regression model adjusted for sex and age, institutionalized patients with schizophrenia had an increased risk of type II diabetes (AOR, 1.22; CI, 1.01-1.42; p<0.001), but the mean age of onset of type II diabetes did not differ. The mean patient age was higher in the institutionalized group (62.7 vs. 58.7 years; p = 0.027), which was mainly driven by absence of death from suicide in the institutionalized group. Multivariate predictors of institutionalization included hebephrenic subtype, a diagnosis of epilepsy, early retirement pension, male sex, a greater proportion of prior hospitalization, and substance misuse.
   Conclusions: Institutionalized patients with schizophrenia had a more complex and worse outcome of the disorder, except for less suicide, illustrated by lower scholastic achievement, receiving higher dosages of antipsychotic medications, more concomitant medications and more prior bed-days.

AB This study aimed to investigate the risk of death, development of cancer, and hospital inpatient admissions resulting from injuries and toxicity/poisoning among opioid users with chronic noncancer pain. A population-based cohort of 13,127 adults, who have participated in the Danish Health Interview Surveys in 2000 or 2005 and have been followed up prospectively by registers until the end of 2011, were classified according to the absence or presence of chronic pain (ie, pain lasting >= 6 months) and long-term or short-term opioid use (individuals using at least 1 prescription per month for 6 months in the previous year and at least 1 prescription in the previous year, respectively). The risk of all-cause mortality was 1.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23-2.41) times higher among long-term opioid users than among individuals without chronic pain. The risk of death was lower, but still significantly higher in short-term (1.36, 95% CI = 1.07-1.72) and non-opioid users with chronic pain (1.39, 95% CI = 1.22-1.59) than in the background population. There was no statistically significant association between long-term opioid use and cardiovascular and cancer mortality. No deaths among opioid users were caused by accidents or suicides, although opioid users had higher risks of injuries and toxicity/poisoning resulting in hospital inpatient admissions than individuals without chronic pain. The risk of all-cause mortality was significantly higher among long-term opioid users, but no obvious associations between long-term opioid use and cause-specific mortality were observed. However, opioid use increased the risk of injuries and toxicity/poisoning resulting in hospital inpatient admissions. (c) 2014 International Association for the Study of Pain.

AB Background. - Schizophrenia is characterized by profound disruption in cognition and emotion, affecting the most fundamental human attributes: language, thought, perception, affect and sense of self. The clinical picture is further complicated by the multiple secondary consequences of the disorder; notably disrupted education, unemployment, impoverished social relationships, isolation, legal difficulties, family stress and substance abuse. Not surprisingly, the disorder is also associated with suicidal behaviour. The management of schizophrenia is thus extremely difficult with high rates of relapse, treatment refusal and poor treatment outcome. In Europe and the United States there has been a general trend towards decreasing the former long duration of hospital care in favour of short-term pharmacological stabilization in the hospital setting, followed by longer multidisciplinary follow-up within the community. This change reflects, on the one hand, the evolution in aetiological conceptions towards a predominantly neurobiological model of the disorder, with complex social consequences and also social and economic constraints. The clinical consequences of these changes were not, however, evaluated prior to the implementation of these changes.
   Literature findings. - Several studies have shown a clear relationship between reductions in duration of stay and increases in readmission rates and suggest that the development of community services may not in fact significantly improve clinical outcome, and may also possibly increase relapse rates due to the instability of the clinical condition at first discharge. There has been some unsettling evidence to suggest that shortening hospital stays may not be a general panacea. Authors reported in 1999 that deinstitutionalization policies in Denmark had led to premature discharge and subsequently a 100% increase in suicide, a doubling of the rates of criminal acts committed by psychotic patients, and increases of 80 to 100% in acute admission rates. A large follow-up study of psychotic patients in the USA found that hospital stays of less than 14 days were significantly associated with increased suicide risk; on the other hand, shortening hospital stays appears to be linked to higher rates of care satisfaction.
   Conclusion. - Indeed, studies of patients returning to the community compared to those remaining in institutions show not only better quality of life and larger friendship networks, but also reductions in dependence on pharmacotherapy and lower mortality rates. The essential question of whether shortened hospital care may lead to premature discharge or, on the other hand, decreased patient dependency and social deviance, has not been adequately addressed.

AB Objective: To evaluate long-term mortality rate of anorexia nervosa (AN) patients in a southern Italy population compared to the most recent literature.
   Design: Retrospective and review setting.
   Patients and interventions: One hundred and forty-seven female AN patients, consecutively admitted from 1994 to 1997 to the Outpatient Unit, were re-examined between June and November 2003. Our data are compared with 10 other studies published since 1988.
   Results: One hundred and twenty-three deaths in 2240 patients, amounting to a total mortality rate of 5.25% were reported in the literature. Deaths due to suicide, AN-related and AN-unrelated diseases were 1.20, 3.07 and 0.98%, respectively. After correcting for unrelated deaths, mortality rate was 4.27%. In our 8-year follow-up, we found a mortality rate of 2.72% (1.82% after correcting for unrelated deaths). Standardized mortality ratio was 9.7.
   Conclusion: We interpret our favourable findings as a consequence of an integrated, clinical-nutritional and psychiatric approach. Finally, considering AN demographic characteristics, that is young female subjects in Westernized societies, mortality rate is confirmed to be dramatically high.

AB Data on adult risk factors associated with drug or chemical poisonings in Malaysia are scarce. The objective of the study was to identify possible risk factors associated with adult admissions to the Penang General Hospital (PGH) due to chemical poisoning and/or drug overdose. The present study was a case-control study, conducted over 18 weeks. One hundred acutely poisoned adult patients admitted to PGH during the period from September 2003 to February 2004 were considered as cases. Two hundred patients admitted to the same medical wards for other illnesses, during the same period, were matched for age and gender with the poisoned cases and thus selected as controls. McNemar test and binary logistic were used for univariate analysis and logistic regression analysis for multivariate analyses. The odds ratio ( OR) and its 95% confidence interval ( 95% CI) were calculated for each predictor variable. Positive histories of psychiatric illness and previous poisoning, problems in boy/girl friend relationships, family problems, marital problems, Indian ethnicity, Chinese ethnicity, living in rented houses and living in a household with less than five people were significant risk factors associated with adult admissions due to poisoning.

AB Background: The long-term predictive ability of the ICD-10 subtypes of hypomania, mania without psychosis and mania with psychosis has not been investigated. Methods: All patients who got a diagnosis of a single hypomanic episode, single manic episode without psychosis or single manic episode with psychosis in a period from 1994 to 1999 at the first discharge ever in Denmark were identified. The time to discharge from first admission and the risk of relapse leading to readmission were compared for the three groups of patients. Results: Totally, 41 patients with a hypomanic episode, 149 patients with a manic episode without psychotic symptoms and 202 patients with a manic episode with psychotic symptoms at first discharge ever were identified. Patients with mania and psychotic symptoms were admitted longer than patients with mania without psychosis, and patients with mania without psychosis were admitted longer than patients with hypomania. No differences were found in the risk of relapse leading to readmission between the three groups of patients. Limitations: The results apply to hospitalised patients only. Conclusions: The ICD-10 subclassification of manic episodes does only partially predict long-term outcome. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aims: The aim of this study was to describe emergency admissions in Greenland's healthcare system, and the extent to which admissions were associated with alcohol abuse or violence. Furthermore, we aimed to test whether data on emergencies in Greenland could be registered in a reliable way by simple means. Methods: Registration of all emergencies presented in 15 out of 17 of Greenland's health districts in the period 21 May to 7 June 2010. Results: In the 17-day registration period, 2403 emergencies were registered. In 10% of cases the patients were clinically alcohol intoxicated. When reason for presentation were mental or social problems, attempted suicide, accidents, or violence, 24, 50, 15, and 59% respectively were intoxicated. Alcohol intoxication was statistically significantly more often associated with advanced treatment (e.g. evacuation, hospitalisation, or follow up by doctor or nurse). Conclusions: This study confirms that violence- and alcohol-related emergencies put a considerable strain on Greenland's healthcare system. Due to the short observation period, we have not been able to describe the actual extent of the problem in detail, nor was it possible to estimate whether this problem is more pronounced in Greenland than in other countries, for example Denmark.

AB Islamist extremism is often explained by the suffering endured by Muslims in Islamic countries as a result of Western-led wars. However, many terrorist attacks have been carried out by European Muslims with no personal experiences of war. Across two studies among Danish Muslims, we tested if what we call victimization-by-proxy processes motivate behavioral intentions to commit acts of violence. We used Muslim identification, perceived injustice of Western foreign policies, and group-based anger to predict violent and nonviolent behavioral intentions. More importantly, we compared path models of Danish Muslims from conflict zones with those without direct personal experience of Western-led occupation. We found similar effects among the participants in each category, that is, vicarious psychological responses mimicked those of personally experienced adversity. In fact, participants born in Western Europe were, on average, more strongly identified with Muslims, more likely to perceive Western foreign policy as more unjust, reported greater group-based anger, and were more inclined to help Muslims both by nonviolent and violent means.

AB Major findings of the Survey of Living Conditions in the Arctic (SLiCA) are: (1) A combination of traditional activities and cash employment is the prevailing lifestyle of Arctic indigenous peoples; (2) family ties, social support of each other, and traditional activities have a lot to do with why indigenous people choose to remain in Arctic communities; (3) well-being is closely related to job opportunities, locally available fish and game, and a sense of local control. Well-being and depression (and related problems like suicide) are flip sides of the same coin. Improving well-being may reduce social problems; and, (4) health conditions vary widely in the Arctic: three-in-four Greenlandic Inuit self-rate their health as at least very good compared with one-in-two Canadian and Alaska Inuit and one-in-five Chukotka indigenous people. Findings are based on 7,200 interviews in a probability sample of Inupiat settlement regions of Alaska, the four Inuit settlement regions of Canada, all of Greenland, and the Anadyrskij, Anadyr, Shmidtovs, Beringovskij, Chukotskij, Iujl'tinskij, Bilibinskij, Chaunskij, Providenskij, Uel'Kal' districts of Chukotka. Indigenous people and researchers from Greenland, Russia, Canada, the United States, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland collaborated on all phases of the study.

AB We investigated the drugs used in the alleviation of pain and symptoms (APS) with a possible life-shortening side effect in six European countries' end-of-life care. We sent mail questionnaires to physicians who signed a representative sample of death certificates in each country. APS with a possible life-shortening effect occurred from 19 % of all deaths in Italy to 26 % in Denmark. Physicians usually administered opioids (from 76 % of APS cases in Italy to 96 % in The Netherlands), but the type of opioids and administration Practice differed markedly between countries. The doses of opioids given in the last 24 hours also varied signifcantly and were usually lower than 300 mg oral morphine equivalent (from 83 % of cases in Belgium to 93 % in Sweden). The highly variable results bring into question whether existing guidelines for pain relief were applied appropriately and to what extent unfounded concerns about the possible life-shortening effect of opioids resulted in less than optimal Symptom management in end-of-life care.

AB Objective: This article illustrates the development of psychiatric register research and discusses the strengths, limitations, and possible directions for future activities.
   Method: Examples illustrating the development from the post-World War II introduction of psychiatric register research until today are selected.
   Results: The strengths of register research are seen especially within health service. Until recently, when starting linking registers to biobanks, register research had limited value in cause-seeking. Register research benefits from the possibilities for following identifiable persons over long time (lifelong) and the possibilities for linking to other registers and databases. Important limitations of register research are the heterogeneity and questionable validity of the clinical data collected.
   Conclusion: Future register research can go in the direction of big is beautiful collecting data from all possible sources creating giga-registers. In that case, low data quality will still be an unsolved problem. Or it can take the direction of smaller local clinical databases which has many advantages, for example, integrating clinical knowledge and experience into register research. However, in that case, registers will not be able to deal with rare conditions and diseases.

AB Background Living arrangements have changed markedly in recent decades, so we wanted to provide an up-to-date assessment of mortality as a function of marital status and cohabitation status in a complete population.
   Methods We studied mortality in a national cohort of 6.5 million Danes followed for 122.5 million person-years during 1982-2011, using continuously updated individual-level information on living arrangements, socio-demographic covariates and causes of deaths. Hazard ratios (HRs) estimated relative mortality in categories of marital status, cohabitation status and combinations thereof.
   Results HRs for overall mortality changed markedly over time, most notably for persons in same-sex marriage. In 2000-2011, opposite-sex married persons (reference, HR = 1) had consistently lower mortality than persons in other marital status categories in women (HRs 1.37-1.89) and men (HRs 1.37-1.66). Mortality was particularly high for same-sex married women (HR = 1.89), notably from suicide (HR = 6.40) and cancer (HR = 1.62), whereas rates for same-sex married men (HR = 1.38) were equal to or lower than those for unmarried, divorced and widowed men. Prior marriages (whether opposite-sex or same-sex) were associated with increased mortality in both women and men (HR = 1.16-1.45 per additional prior marriage).
   Conclusion Our study provides a detailed account of living arrangements and their associations with mortality over three decades, thus yielding accurate and statistically powerful analyses of public health relevance to countries with marriage and cohabitation patterns comparable to Denmark's. Of note, mortality among same-sex married men has declined markedly since the mid-1990s and is now at or below that of unmarried, divorced and widowed men, whereas same-sex married women emerge as the group of women with highest and, in recent years, even further increasing mortality.

AB Background: Few population-based studies provide data on mortality after bariatric surgery. We hypothesized that hypoglycemia could be an underdiagnosed cause of death.
   Objectives: To examine perioperative, all-cause, and cause-specific long-term mortality in Rouxen-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) patients versus population comparisons.
   Setting: Danish nationwide population-based cohort study.
   Methods: We included all 9895 patients who underwent RYGB during 2006-2010, and a 1:25 age- and gender-matched comparison cohort (n = 247,366) (0.3% lost to follow up). We compared mortality rates and computed mortality rate ratios (MRR) for all-cause and cause-specific mortality using Cox regression analysis. For deceased RYGB patients (n = 91), we conducted a detailed medical record audit.
   Results: The perioperative (30-days) mortality after RYGB was.04% (4/9895). After 4.2 years, RYGB-related mortality (deaths due to intestinal obstruction/intra-abdominal leakage) was.15% (16/9895). All-cause mortality was very similar in the 2 cohorts (median age, 40.2 years; 21.7% men): RYGB cohort,.89% (n = 91); comparison cohort,.92% (n = 2204); MRR = 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI],.84-1.27). Mortality due to suicide (2.78; 95% CI, 1.44-5.33), accidents (2.29; 95% CI, 1.16-4.54), gastrointestinal diseases (2.01; 95% CI, 1.06-3.84), and infectious diseases (1.75; 95% CI,.98-3.17) was higher in the RYGB cohort versus comparison groups, but mortality from cancer was lower (0.43; 95% CI,.27.70). Our medical record audit indicated that 8% of deaths after RYGB (n = 7) were possibly hypoglycemia related.
   Conclusion: Perioperative mortality after RYGB is low in Denmark, and subsequent all-cause mortality is similar to that of matched comparisons. After RYGB, patients have substantially increased mortality due to external causes such as suicide, accidents, and possibly hypoglycemia.

TI Cause-specific mortality of patients with severe chronic pain referred
   to a multidisciplinary pain clinic: a cohort register-linkage study

LA English
DT Article

ID CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN; SMOKING; RISK; HEALTH;
   PREVALENCE; CANCER
AB Background and aims: Almost 20% of the adult population suffers from chronic pain. Chronic pain may be linked to an elevated mortality; however, results from previous studies are inconsistent. Some studies find similar mortality levels in chronic pain patients and pain-free controls while other studies show elevated mortality levels among chronic pain patients, primarily with respect to cancer, diseases of the circulatory and respiratory systems, and suicide. These conflicting results are potentially due to different population samples and different operational definitions of chronic pain. Further research on overall and cause-specific mortality in patients with severe chronic pain is needed to inform clinical practice. The objective of this register-linkage study was to investigate whether patients with severe chronic pain referred to multidisciplinary pain treatment have higher cause-specific mortality rates than the general population.
   Methods: In this register-linkage cohort study, data from 6,142 chronic pain patients (female: n = 3,941, male: n = 2,201, mean age: 48.2 +/- 14.2; range: 16-97 years) attending an interdisciplinary Pain Center in Odense, Denmark from 2005 to 2014 were linked to the Danish Register of Causes of Death. Age and gender standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and compared with those of the general population. Data from the general population was extracted from the Danish Register of Causes of Death, and Causes of death were classified according to national Classification of Disease (ICD-10).
   Results: In all, 276 deaths (women: n = 152, men: n = 124) were observed among the chronic pain patients, and a six-fold higher overall mortality rate was found [SMR: 6.2 (95% CI: 5.5-7.0)] compared with the general population. Elevated cause-specific mortality rates were noted for chronic patients with respect to cancer and neoplasms [4.7 (95% CI: 3.7-5.9)], diseases of the circulatory system [5.7 (95% CI: 4.3-7.3)], diseases of the respiratory system [8.7 (95% CI: 6.2-11.9)], and suicide [7.3 (95% CI: 2.7-15.9)].
   Conclusions: The overall mortality rate of patients with severe chronic pain in this study was six-fold higher than the rate of the general population in this region. This was reflected in select specific causes of death (cancer and neoplasms, diseases of the circulatory system, diseases of the respiratory system, and suicide). The results are in agreement with previous studies and emphasize the need to understand which factors causally affect this increased mortality allowing for targeted interventions in similar chronic pain populations.

AB Aim: The aim of this study was to examine Danish emergency nurses' attitudes toward people hospitalized after an acetaminophen poisoning. Furthermore, the study examined the relationship between attitudes and factors such as age, gender, and education on self-harm.
   Methods: A cross-sectional design was applied. Nurses from seven emergency departments (EDs) in a region in Denmark were asked to complete the Danish version of Attitudes towards Deliberate Self-Harm Questionnaire (ADSHQ).
   Results: Of the 254 eligible nurses working in the ED, 122 returned the questionnaires, leaving the response rate at 48%. Results show that the emergency nurses generally held positive attitudes toward patients with acetaminophen poisoning. Nurses with longer ED experience held more positive attitudes, and women scored significantly higher than men on the whole scale. Only 19% of the respondents had received education on self-harm, and this education seems to produce more positive attitudes and a greater self-efficacy in relation to managing the patient group.
   Conclusion: Nurses working in the ED generally hold positive attitudes toward patients with acetaminophen poisoning. It is suggested that education on self-harm is a worthwhile endeavor with the potential to strengthen and improve attitudes, for the benefit of both the nurses and the patients.

   STROKE; RISK
AB Background: Depression is a common psychiatric disorder, with a lifetime prevalence of 10-15% in the Danish population. Although depression is associated with excess mortality, it is not yet understood how this affects life expectancy. Our aim was to examine mortality rates and life expectancy in patients with unipolar depression compared to the general population, and to assess the impact of comorbid somatic illness and substance abuse.
   Methods: We followed a Danish population -based cohort from 1995-2013 (N=5,103,699). The cohort included all residents in Denmark during the study period. Mortality rate ratios (MRRs) and life expectancy in persons with unipolar depression were calculated using survival analysis techniques.
   Results: The overall MRR was 2.07 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 2.05-2.09) in people with a previous unipolar depression diagnosis compared to the general Danish population. This excess mortality translated into a reduced life expectancy of 14.0 years in men and 10.1 years in women (assuming onset at age 15). The MRR was highest for death due to suicide and accidents (MRR: 4.66; 95% CI: 4.53-4.79), but the absolute number of deaths was highest for natural causes.
   Conclusion: People with unipolar depression have a significant shorter life expectancy, especially men. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is a growing public health problem among Caucasians, thus mortality data that may provide insight into the clinical course and foster our understanding of NMSC are important.
   Objectives We examined total and cause-specific mortality among patients with NMSC registered in the Danish Cancer Registry from 1978 to 2001.
   Methods A total of 82 837 patients with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and 13 453 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were followed through the National Death Registry for specific causes of death. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed based on mortality rates in the general population.
   Results Among patients with BCC, we found a slightly reduced total mortality [SMR 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96-0.98] with decreased SMRs seen for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes mellitus. The SMR for suicide was increased. Among patients with SCC, we found an increased total mortality (SMR 1.30, 95% CI 1.26-1.33) due primarily to excess deaths from cancers, COPD, CVD and infectious diseases.
   Conclusions We found markedly different mortality patterns among patients with BCC and those with SCC, suggesting important differences in the clinical course of these patients.

AB Background: There is a growing interest in examining death rates associated with different pregnancy outcomes for time periods beyond one year. Previous population studies, however, have failed to control for complete reproductive histories. In this study we seek to eliminate the potential confounding effect of unknown prior pregnancy history by examining mortality rates associated specifically with first pregnancy outcome alone. We also examine differences in mortality rates associated with early abortion and late abortions (after 12 weeks).
   Material/Method: Medical records for the entire population of women born in Denmark between 1962 and 1991 and were alive in 1980, were linked to death certificates. Mortality rates associated with first pregnancy outcomes (delivery, miscarriage, abortion, and late abortion) were calculated. Odds ratios examining death rates based on reproductive outcomes, adjusted for age at first pregnancy and year of women's births, were also calculated.
   Results: A total of 463,473 women had their first pregnancy between 1980 and 2004, of whom 2,238 died. In nearly all time periods examined, mortality rates associated with miscarriage or abortion of a first pregnancy were higher than those associated with birth. Compared to women who delivered, the age and birth year adjusted cumulative risk of death for women who had a first trimester abortion was significantly higher in all periods examined, from 180 days (OR=1.84; 1.11 <95% CI <3.71) through 10 years (1.39; 1.22 <95% CI <1.61), as was the risk for women who had abortions after 12 weeks from one year (OR=4.31; 2.18 <95% CI <8.54) through 10 years (OR=2.41; 1.56 <95% CI <2.41). For women who miscarried, the risk was significantly higher for cumulative deaths through 4 years (OR=1.75; 1.34 <95% CI <2.27) and at 10 years (OR=1.48; 1.18 <95% CI <1.85).
   Conclusions: Compared to women who delivered, women who had an early or late abortion had significantly higher mortality rates within 1 through 10 years. A lesser effect may also be present relative to miscarriage. Recommendations for additional research are offered.

AB Objective: To estimate long-term survival of unselected patients with anorexia nervosa from Rochester, Minn.
   Patients and Methods: In this population-based retrospective cohort study, all 208 Rochester residents who presented with anorexia nervosa (193 Women and 15 men) for the first time from 1935 through 1989 were monitored for up to 63 years. Subsequent survival was compared with that expected for Minnesota white residents of similar age and sex, and standardized mortality ratios were determined on the basis of age- and sex-specific death rates for the US population in 1987.
   Results: Survival was not worse than expected in this cohort (P=.16). The estimated survival 30 years after the initial diagnosis of anorexia nervosa was 93% (95% confidence interval, 88%-97%) compared with an expected 94%. During 5646 person-years of follow-up (median, 22 years per patient), 17 deaths occurred (14 women and 3 men) compared with an expected 23.7 deaths (standardized mortality ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-1.09). One woman died of complications of anorexia nervosa, 2 women committed suicide, and 6 patients (5 women and 1 man) died of complications of alcoholism. Other causes of death were not-increased.
   Conclusions: Long-term survival of Rochester patients with anorexia nervosa did not differ from that expected. This finding suggests that overall mortality was not increased among the spectrum of cases representative of the community.

AB Objective Method It is largely unknown how depression prior to and following somatic diseases affects mortality. Thus, we examined how the temporal order of depression and somatic diseases affects mortality risk. Data were from a Danish population-based cohort from 1995 to 2013, which included all residents in Denmark during the study period (N = 4 984 912). Nineteen severe chronic somatic disorders from the Charlson Comorbidity Index were assessed. The date of first diagnosis of depression and somatic diseases was identified. Multivariable Cox proportional Hazard models with time-varying covariates were constructed to assess the risk for all-cause and non-suicide deaths for individual somatic diseases. Results Conclusion For all somatic diseases, prior and/or subsequent depression conferred a significantly higher mortality risk. Prior depression was significantly associated with a higher mortality risk when compared to subsequent depression for 13 of the 19 somatic diseases assessed, with the largest difference observed for moderate/severe liver disease (HR = 2.08; 95% CI = 1.79-2.44), followed by metastatic solid tumor (HR = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.39-1.58), and myocardial infarction (HR = 1.40; 95% CI = 1.34-1.49). A particularly high mortality risk was observed in the presence of prior depression for most somatic diseases. Future studies that assess the underlying mechanisms are necessary to adequately address the excessive mortality associated with comorbid depression.

SO PLOS ONE

AB Background: Suicide and death by accidents in persons with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are common, but excess mortality from natural death accounts for even more years of life lost. The impact of somatic comorbidity, however, often is not duly considered in analyses and explanations of excess mortality in patients with psychotic disorders.
   Objective/Methods: This study investigates and evaluates the impact of 19 severe chronic diseases on excess mortality due to diseases and medical conditions (natural death) in individuals with psychotic disorders compared with the general population using a population-based cohort study in Denmark. Incidence/mortality rate ratios of admission/mortality were calculated using survival analysis.
   Results: Cohort members with psychotic disorders had higher incidence rates of hospital contacts for almost all of the 19 disorders than the general population. The mortality rate ratio (MRR) of natural death was 7.10 (95% CI 6.45, 7.81) for schizophrenic men, decreasing to 4.64 (95% CI 4.21, 5.10) after adjustment for the somatic disorders. The same pattern existed in women and in both genders with bipolar disorder. Highest MRRs were observed for psychotic patients without hospital admissions with the investigated somatic disorders.
   Conclusion: Chronic somatic diseases accounted for half of the excess mortality in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Chronic disorders investigated in this paper seem to be under-treated or under-detected among such patients.

AB Social and economic policies are inextricably linked with population health outcomes in Europe, yet few datasets are able to fully explore and compare this relationship across European countries. The European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey aims to address this gap using microdata on income, living conditions and health. EU-SILC contains both cross-sectional and longitudinal elements, with nationally representative samples of individuals 16 years and older in 28 European Union member states as well as Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. Data collection began in 2003 in Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Greece, Luxembourg and Austria, with subsequent expansion across Europe. By 2011, all 28 EU member states, plus three others, were included in the dataset. Although EU-SILC is administered by Eurostat, the data are output-harmonized so that countries are required to collect specified data items but are free to determine sampling strategies for data collection purposes. EU-SILC covers approximately 500 000 European residents for its cross-sectional survey annually. Whereas aggregated data from EU-SILC are publicly available [http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/income-and-living-conditions/data/main-tables], microdata are only available to research organizations subject to approval by Eurostat. Please refer to [http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/microdata/eu_silc] for further information regarding microdata access.

AB Objectives: Persons with schizophrenia have a shorter life expectancy by 15-20 years compared to the background population, but little is known about deaths caused by accidents. We aimed to investigate the rates of accidental death among persons with schizophrenia and compare these rates with those of the background population.
   Methods: We conducted a national register-based cohort study of all persons born in Denmark between 1955 and 2011. The cohort included 2,703,307 persons, representing 56,845,085 person years at risk. We compared rates of accidental death between persons with schizophrenia and those without by using Cox regression analysis. The main outcome measure was hazard ratio (HR) for accidental death.
   Results: A total of 12,425 accidental deaths were identified, including 371 accidental deaths among persons with schizophrenia. We found an increased HR for both women with schizophrenia (10.47; 95% CI=8.07-13.58) and men with schizophrenia (8.33; 95% CI=7.44-9.33) compared to the background population. After adjusting for substance abuse, we found attenuated HRs for both women (HR=3.22; 95% CI=2.46-4.20) and men (HR=3.23; 95% CI=2.87-3.63).
   Conclusions: Schizophrenia is a strong independent risk factor for accidental deaths. Substance abuse seems to constitute a substantial part of the association. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: In this study we investigated (a) to what extent physicians have experience with performing a range of end-of-life decisions (ELDs), (b) if they have no experience with performing an ELD, would they be willing to do so under certain conditions and (c) which background characteristics are associated with having experience with/or being willing to make such ELDs.
   Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was sent to 16,486 physicians from specialities in which death is common: Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland.
   Results: The response rate differed between countries (39-68%). The experience of foregoing life-sustaining treatment ranged between 37% and 86%: intensifying the alleviation of pain or other symptoms while taking into account possible hastening of death between 57% and 95%, and experience with deep sedation until death between 12% and 46%. Receiving a request for hastening death differed between 34% and 71%, and intentionally hastening death on the explicit request of a patient between 1% and 56%.
   Conclusion: There are differences between countries in experiences with ELDs, in willingness to perform ELDs and in receiving requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. Foregoing treatment and intensifying alleviation of pain and symptoms are practiced and accepted by most physicians in all countries. Physicians with training in palliative care are more inclined to perform ELDs, as are those who attend to higher numbers of terminal patients. Thus, this seems not to be only a matter of opportunity, but also a matter of attitude.

TI Twin-singleton differences in intelligence: A meta-analysis

ID TRANSFUSION SYNDROME; COGNITIVE COST; LANGUAGE; SUICIDE; PERFORMANCE;
   ABILITIES; CHILDREN; ERROR; RISK
AB Since the emergence of twin studies in the 1920s, time and again the question of possible twin-singleton differences in intelligence has been posed. This study addressed the issue through a meta-analysis Of published studies on this theme. Twins on the average seem to have lower IQs than singletons. The best estimate I-or this group difference is 4.2 IQ points (less than one-third of a standard deviation), with a great divide between Study Outcomes of less vs more recent birth cohorts (5.1 vs 0.5 IQ points, respectively). The evidence is based on studies from Six Countries (including population-based ones of entire birth cohorts), a massive database (comparisons of more than 30,000 twins with nearly 1.6 million singletons), a variety of intelligence tests, and birth cohorts spanning most of the 20th century, but, for the most part, on an age range limited to children and adolescents. The effect shows considerable between-study heterogeneity but appears robust (fail-safe N calculations), not due to influential individual studies (sensitivity analysis) or publication bias, was present since the very first published Studies (Cumulative meta-analysis), and appears generalizable across sex, zygosity, and other intelligence domains beyond the verbal. There are insufficient data as to whether the effect persists over the lifespan, exists as well within families, or has ceased in recent birth cohorts of highly developed countries (Denmark and The Netherlands). Likely causes of the effect appear to be prenatal and perinatal factors (reduced fetal growth and shorter gestation for twins).

AB This study aimed to describe the level of off-label treatment with psychotropic drugs at a child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinic in Denmark. We performed a cross-sectional study assessing records on patients treated with medicine at two outpatient clinics at the child and adolescent psychiatric ward, on 1 day in 2014. Prescriptions of drugs from ATC group N05-N06 were classified according to label status. Six hundred and fifteen drug prescriptions distributed on nine different drugs were prescribed to 503 children eligible for this study. Overall results showed that 170 of the 615 prescriptions were off-label, which corresponds to 27.6 %. Attention deficit hyperkinetic disorder (ADHD) drugs were prescribed 450 times (73.2 %) of which 11 prescriptions were off-label (2.4 %). Other psychotropic drugs comprised 165 (26.8 %) prescriptions and of these 159 (96.4 %) were off-label. With 106 prescriptions, melatonin was the most prescribed of these drugs; all prescriptions were off-label. The main reasons for classifying prescriptions as off-label were age and indication of treatment. This cross-sectional study reveals that medical treatment of children with other psychotropic drugs than ADHD drugs is usually off-label. ADHD drugs were, as the only drug group, primarily prescribed on-label. Although off-label prescription may be rational and even evidence based, the responsibility in case of, e.g. adverse drug reactions is a challenge, and clinical trials in children should be incited.

AB Objectives To investigate mortality among users of hostels for homeless people in Copenhagen, and to identify predictors of death such as conditions during upbringing, mental illness, and misuse of alcohol and drugs.
   Design Register based follow up study.
   Setting Two hostels for homeless people in Copenhagen, Denmark
   Participants 579 people who stayed in one hostel in Copenhagen in 199 1, and a representative sample of 185 people who stayed in the original hostel and one other in Copenhagen.
   Main outcome measure Cause specific mortality.
   Results The age and sex standardised mortality ratio for both sexes was 3.8 (95% confidence interval 3.5 to 4.1); 2.8 (2.6 to 3.1) for men and 5.6 (4.3 to 6.9) for women. The age and sex standardised mortality ratio for suicide for both sexes was 6.0 (3.9 to 8.1), for death from natural causes 2.6 (2.3 to 2.9), for unintentional injuries 14.6 (11.4 to 17.8), and for unknown cause of death 62.9 (52.7 to 73.2). Mortality was comparatively higher in the younger age groups. It was also significantly higher among homeless people who had stayed in a hostel more than once and stayed fewer than 11 days, compared with the rest of the study group. Risk factors for early death were premature death of the father and misuse of alcohol and sedatives.
   Conclusion Homeless people staying in hostels, particularly young women, are more likely to die early than the general population. Other predictors of early death include adverse experiences in childhood, such as death of the father, and misuse of alcohol and sedatives.

AB Background: Caring for a chronically ill spouse is stressful, but the health effects of caregiving are not fully understood. We studied the effect on mortality of being married to a person with Parkinson disease.
   Methods: All patients in Denmark with a first-time hospitalization for Parkinson disease between 1986 and 2009 were identified, and each case was matched to five population controls. We further identified all spouses of those with Parkinson disease (n = 8,515) and also the spouses of controls (n = 43,432). All spouses were followed in nationwide registries until 2011.
   Results: Among men, being married to a Parkinson disease patient was associated with a slightly higher risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 1.06 [95% confidence interval = 1.00-1.11]). Mortality was particularly high for death due to external causes (1.42 [1.09-1.84]) including suicide (1.89 [1.05-3.42]) and death from undefined symptoms/abnormal findings (1.25 [1.07-1.47]). Censoring at the time of death of the patient attenuated the findings for all-cause mortality in husbands (1.02 [0.95-1.09]), indicating that part of the association is with bereavement. Still, living with a person with Parkinson disease 5 years after first Parkinson hospitalization was associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality for both husbands (1.15 [1.07-1.23]) and wives (1.11 [1.04-1.17]).
   Conclusions: Caring for a spouse with a serious chronic illness is associated with a slight but consistent elevation in mortality risk.

AB Background
   People with mental disorders evince excess mortality due to natural and unnatural deaths. The relative life expectancy of people with mental disorders is a proxy measure of effectiveness of social policy and health service provision.
   Aims
   To evaluate trends in health outcomes of people with serious mental disorders.
   Method
   We examined nationwide 5-year consecutive cohorts of people admitted to hospital for mental disorders in Denmark, Finland and Sweden in 1987-2006. In each country the risk population was identified from hospital discharge registers and mortality data were retrieved from cause-of-death registers. The main outcome measure was life expectancy at age 15 years.
   Results
   People admitted to hospital for a mental disorder had a two-to threefold higher mortality than the general population in all three countries studied. This gap in life expectancy was more pronounced for men than for women. The gap decreased between 1987 and 2006 in these countries, especially for women. The notable exception was Swedish men with mental disorders. In spite of the positive general trend, men with mental disorders still live 20 years less, and women 15 years less, than the general population.
   Conclusions
   During the era of deinstitutionalisation the life expectancy gap for people with mental disorders has somewhat diminished in the three Nordic countries. Our results support further development of the Nordic welfare state model, i.e. tax-funded community-based public services and social protection. Health promotion actions, improved access to healthcare and prevention of suicides and violence are needed to further reduce the life expectancy gap.

AB Drug utilization studies have applied different methods to various data types to describe medication use, which hampers comparisons across populations. The aim of this study was to describe the time trends in antidepressant prescribing in the last decade and the variation in the prevalence, calculated in a uniform manner, in seven European electronic healthcare databases.
   Annual prevalence per 10,000 person-years (PYs) was calculated for 2001-2009 in databases from Spain, Germany, Denmark, the United Kingdom (UK), and the Netherlands. Prevalence data were stratified according to age, sex, antidepressant type (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors [SSRIs] or tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs]) and major indications.
   The age- and sex-standardized prevalence was lowest in the two Dutch (391 and 429 users per 10,000 PYs) and highest in the two UK (913 and 936 users per 10,000 PYs) populations in 2008. The prevalence in the Danish, German, and Spanish populations was 637, 618, and 644 users per 10,000 PY respectively. Antidepressants were prescribed most often in 20- to 60-year-olds in the two UK populations compared with the others. SSRIs were prescribed more often than TCAs in all except the German population. In the majority of countries we observed an increasing trend of antidepressant prescribing over time. Two different methods identifying recorded indications yielded different ranges of proportions of patients recorded with the specific indication (15-57 % and 39-69 % for depression respectively).
   Despite applying uniform methods, variations in the prevalence of antidepressant prescribing were obvious in the different populations. Database characteristics and clinical factors may both explain these variations.

AB Male adolescents and young men benefit when their mental health care is specialized to match their unique gendered and developmental needs. Sensitivity to the social circumstances of this population is important; additionally, the emerging ability to tailor care through knowledge gleaned from the intersection of psychiatry, neurology, and endocrinology informs care.
   This article summarized the views of six experts in the area of the adolescent and young adult male mental health. These experts were select members of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry's Task Force on Men's Mental Health. They convened to present two symposia on the topic of men's mental health at the 13th World Congress of Biological Psychiatry (WCBP) in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2017.
   In these works, a special focus is paid to addictive disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, aggression, and brain development. Collectively, the authors present an argument for the merits of a male-specific model of mental health care to advance the overall well-being of this population.
   Men's mental health should be recognized as a social issue as much as a medical issue, with special attention paid to problems such as unemployment, familial disruption, and substance abuse. These problems, and especially those of major societal impact including violence and suicide which are much more frequently the product of male youth and men, should have more male-tailored options for service provision that respond to men's mental health needs.

AB The triple and parallel loss of quality of life, health, and ability without an organic reason is what we normally recognize as a life crisis, stress, or a burnout. Not being in control is often a terrible and unexpected experience. Failure on the large existential scale is not a part of our expectations, but most people will experience it.
   The key to getting well again is to get resources and help, which most people experience with shame and guilt. Stress and burnout might seem to be temporary problems that are easily handled, but often the problems stay. It is very important for the physician to identify this pattern and help the patient to realize the difficulties and seriousness of the situation, thus helping the patient to assume responsibility and prevent existential disaster, suicide, or severe depression. As soon as the patient is an ally in fighting the dark side of life and works with him/herself, the first step has been reached. Existential pain is really a message to us indicating that we are about to grow and heal. In our view, existential problems are gifts that are painful to receive, but wise to accept. Existential problems require skill on the part of the holistic physician or therapist in order to help people return to life - to their self-esteem, self-confidence, and trust in others. In this paper, we describe how we have met the patients soul to soul and guided them through the old pains and losses in order to get back on the track to life.

AB Background: We aimed at describing the trends in antidepressants use (AD) by age and sex, during 2007-2011, in 5 European settings (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Catalonia and Veneto), and to assess whether the differences found across settings could be related to economic, social and cultural determinants.
   Methods: We collected data of AD use expressed in defined daily doses (DDD). Data were retrieved from population-based databases. We calculated DDD/1000 inhabitants/day. We analysed which economic, social, and cultural covariates determined between-settings differences in AD consumption.
   Results: The use of AD showed an increasing trend during the study period, being Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors the most consumed, followed "others AD". Women and the elderly showed the highest AD consumption. Between-settings variability in AD consumption showed a positive correlation with pharmaceutical expenditure and a negative one with general practitioner's rate. After adjusting by pharmaceutical expenditure and general practitioners rate Masculinity, Long-Term Orientation and Individualism cultural dimensions were associated with AD use by using the Hofstede's cultural dimensions model.
   Limitations: This study has been conducted in administrative databases, with no information on AD use by indication; differences among AD use could be related to their prescription for other disorders. Analyses were based on a small dataset and none of the results reached statistical significance.
   Conclusions: AD use increased through 2007-2011. Pharmaceutical expenditure and General Practitioners rate, Masculinity, Long-Term Orientation and Individualism explained the differences in AD use between countries. People's attitude should be considered when designing national campaigns to improve antidepressant use.

ID DANISH; GUIDELINES; REGISTER
AB ObjectiveAnimal data suggest that subtherapeutic doses, including micro doses, of lithium may influence mood, and lithium levels in drinking water have been found to correlate with the rate of suicide. It has never been investigated whether consumption of lithium may prevent the development of bipolar disorder (primary prophylaxis). In a nation-wide population-based study, we investigated whether long-term exposure to micro levels of lithium in drinking water correlates with the incidence of bipolar disorder in the general population, hypothesizing an inverse association in which higher long-term lithium exposure is associated with lower incidences of bipolar disorder.
   MethodsWe included longitudinal individual geographical data on municipality of residence, data from drinking water lithium measurements and time-specific data from all cases with a hospital contact with a diagnosis of mania/bipolar disorder from 1995 to 2013 (N=14820) and 10 age- and gender-matched controls from the Danish population (N= 140311). Average drinking water lithium exposure was estimated for all study individuals.
   ResultsThe median of the average lithium exposure did not differ between cases with a diagnosis of mania/bipolar disorder (12.7g/L; interquartile range [IQR]: 7.9-15.5 g/L) and controls (12.5g/L; IQR: 7.6-15.7 g/L; P=.2). Further, the incidence rate ratio of mania/bipolar disorder did not decrease with higher long-term lithium exposure, overall, or within age categories (0-40, 41-60 and 61-100years of age).
   ConclusionHigher long-term lithium exposure from drinking water was not associated with a lower incidence of bipolar disorder. The association should be investigated in areas with higher lithium levels than in Denmark.

TI 'It proves falsehood absolutely ... ' The lost notebook of Dr. Frederick
   A. Cook
SO POLAR RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB With the completion of a careful study of a photographic copy of the original notebook Frederick Cook kept on his attempt to reach the North Pole in 1908, now in Copenhagen, Denmark, many new details have been added that allow a more accurate account of his actual movements and timetable than has been possible previously. Because some records were altered or destroyed by Cook, however, a complete account still necessarily contains an element of speculation, which must be the case when based on the only records that exist of an unwitnessed assertion. But this uncertainty can be controlled to a reasonable degree by the notebook's remaining content in concert with the several other accounts Cook wrote of his expedition. One thing is sure, however: Cook was far behind his published timetable. At the outset, he set his start date back by one full week. He failed to report a number of delays in his journey and left out a lengthy detour that prevented him from reaching land's end at Cape Thomas Hubbard until well past 1 April 1908. This ruled out any chance to reach the North Pole in 1908. Frederick Cook was no fool; he was a veteran explorer. He knew any attempt that late in the season would be suicide. Furthermore his efforts to lay caches that would separate his own return route from that of his Inuit support party indicate that not only had he already given up the idea of making a serious attempt, but also that he was preparing for his eventual hoax of claiming to have reached the North Pole on 21 April 1908 long before he reached the Arctic Ocean.

AB Lingering grief associated with the death of a loved one has been hypothesized to precipitate acute health events among survivors on anniversary dates. We sought to study excess mortality risk in parents around the death date and birth date of a deceased child as an indication of a "bereavement effect". We conducted a population based follow-up study using Swedish registries including links between children and parents. All biological and Swedish-born parents who experienced the death of a minor child born were observed during the period 1973-2008 (n = 48,666). An increased mortality risk was found during the week of a child's death among mothers who lost a child aged 0-17 years (SMRR = 1.46, 95 % CI 0.98-2.17). The association was stronger among mothers who lost a child aged 1-17 years (SMRR = 1.89, 95 % CI 0.97-3.67) as compared to those who lost an infant (SMRR = 1.29, 95 % CI 0.78-2.12). Cardiovascular diseases and suicides were overrepresented as causes of death in mothers who died around the anniversary. We found no significant increase in the mortality risk around the date of child's birth, nor any suggestion of excess mortality risk among fathers, but rather a depression of paternal death (SMRR = 0.60, 95 % CI 0.34-1.03). Our study indicates an anniversary reaction among mothers who lost a young child. These results suggest that bereavement per se could have an effect on health and mortality which should be acknowledged by public health professionals working with bereaved people.

AB Background: Long-term health characteristics and quality of life in patients with breast implants are important issues in plastic surgery.
   Methods: The authors evaluated characteristics of women who had breast implant surgery in the Women's Health Initiative observational study between 1993 and 1998. Most women in this study cohort had breast implant surgery 20 or more years before recruitment into the study. The women who were in the study who had not undergone breast implant surgery served as the comparison group. There were 86,686 women in the study who did not have breast implant surgery and an absent history of breast cancer, and 1257 women who had breast implant surgery and no prior breast cancer.
   Results: Total mortality rates were substantially lower among women with breast implants, as was the incidence of coronary heart disease. Women with breast implants in this study had a lower body mass index throughout adult life and were more physically active than control subjects. After adjustment for these variables, differences in total mortality were no longer statistically significant. Women who had breast implants reported overall poorer quality of life and emotional well-being. These differences were small, but statistically significant. Among women with breast implant surgery, 7 percent of deaths were due to suicide (n = 3) versus 0.4 percent (n = 20) in controls.
   Conclusions: Significant differences in health characteristics and quality-of-life measures are seen in a cohort of women with breast implants decades after implant surgery. Further longitudinal studies need to focus on both physical and psychological health among women undergoing breast implant surgery. (Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 125: 799, 2010.)

ID FULL RECOVERY; SCHIZOPHRENIA
AB We believe that holistic medicine can be used for patients with mental health disorders. With holistic psychiatry, it is possible to help the mentally ill patient to heal existentially. As in holistic medicine, the methods are love or intense care, winning the trust of the patient, getting permission to give support and holding, and daring to be fully at the patient's service. Our clinical experiences have led us to believe that mental health patients can heal if only you can make him or her feel the existential pain at its full depth, understand what the message of the suffering is, and let go of all the negative attitudes and beliefs connected with the disease. Many mentally ill young people would benefit from a few hours of existential holistic processing in order to confront the core existential pains.
   To help the mentally ill patient, you must understand the level of responsibility and help process the old traumas that made the patient escape responsibility for his or her own life and destiny. To guide the work, we have developed a responsibility scale going from (1) free perception over (2) emotional pain to (3) psychic death (denial of life purpose) further down to (4) escape and (5) denial to (6) destruction of own perception and (7) hallucination further down to (8) coma, suicide, and unconsciousness. This scale seems to be a valuable tool to understand the state of consciousness and the nature of the process of healing that the patient must go through.

ID SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS; PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION; ADOLESCENTS;

AB Background: In 2003, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) warned against the treatment of childhood depression with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) due to increased risk of suicide. This study examined the effect of this warning on the prevalence of anti-depressants in Irish children and compared age and gender trends and international comparisons of prescription rates.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study of the Irish Health Service Executive (HSE) pharmacy claims database for the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme for dispensed medication. Data were obtained for 2002-2011 for those aged = 15 years. Prevalence of anti-depressants per 1000 eligible population, along with 95 % confidence intervals, were calculated. A negative binomial regression analysis was used to investigate trends and compare rates across years, sex and age groups (0-4, 5-11, 12-15 years). International prescribing data were retrieved from the literature.
   Results: The prevalence of anti-depressants decreased from 4.74/1000 population (95 % CI: 4.47-5.01) in 2002 to 2.61/1000 population (95 % CI: 2.43-2.80) in 2008. SSRI rates decreased from 2002 to 2008. Prescription rates for contra-indicated SSRIs paroxetine, sertraline and citralopram decreased significantly from 2002 to 2005, and, apart from paroxetine, only small fluctuations were seen from 2005 onwards. Fluoxetine was the most frequently prescribed anti-depressant and rates increased between 2002 and 2011. Anti-depressant rates were higher for younger boys and older girls. The Irish prevalence was lower than the US, similar to the U.K. and higher than Germany and Denmark.
   Conclusions: The direction and timing of these trends suggest that medical practitioners followed the IMB advice.

   SUICIDE; GRIEF
AB BACKGROUND:
   The loss of a child is considered one of the most stressful events in the life of a parent. We hypothesized that parental bereavement increases the risk of hospital admission for a psychiatric disorder, especially for affective disorders.
   METHODS:
   We studied a cohort of 1,082,503 persons identified from national registers in Denmark who were born between 1952 and 1999 and had at least one child under 18 years of age during the follow-up period, from 1970 to 1999. Parents who lost a child during follow-up were categorized as ``bereaved'' from the date of death of the child.
   RESULTS:
   As compared with parents who did not lose a child, parents who lost a child had an overall relative risk of a first psychiatric hospitalization for any disorder of 1.67 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.53 to 1.83). Bereaved mothers had a higher relative risk of being hospitalized for any psychiatric disorder than bereaved fathers (relative risks, 1.78 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.60 to 1.98] and 1.38 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.17 to 1.63], respectively; P value for interaction, 0.01). The relative risks of hospitalization specifically for affective disorders were 1.91 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.59 to 2.30) and 1.61 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.15 to 2.27) for bereaved mothers and fathers, respectively. Among mothers, the relative risk of being hospitalized for any psychiatric disorder was highest during the first year after the death of the child but remained significantly elevated five years or more after the death.
   CONCLUSIONS:
   The risk of psychiatric hospitalization was increased among parents, especially mothers, who lost a child.

AB Background: Patients with severe mental illness have a shortened lifespan, and substance use disorder (SUD) is an especially important diagnosis in this respect. There have been no studies comparing directly SUD to other diagnoses in a nationwide cohort. Aims: To directly compare differences in mortality rates of psychiatric inpatients with a discharge diagnosis of SUD versus other psychiatric diagnoses. Methods: A register-based study was made of all patients admitted to psychiatric hospitals in Iceland between 1983 and 2007. Patients were grouped according to discharge diagnoses. Survival with respect to SUD was compared using Cox-proportional hazard ratio, excluding those with an organic mental disorder. Furthermore, the survival of patients with SUD and co-morbid diagnoses was evaluated. Results: A total of 14,281 patients (over the age of 18 years) were admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Iceland during the study period, with a total of 156,356 years of follow-up. For both men and women, a diagnosis of SUD conferred similar mortality as a diagnosis of schizophrenia without SUD, while individuals with a diagnosis of a mood disorder or "other disorders" had significantly lower mortality than SUD. For men with SUD, a co-occurring mental disorder was associated with an increased risk of dying, however, this was not found for women. Conclusions: SUD was the psychiatric diagnosis that had the highest mortality rate among psychiatric inpatients, in both men and women. An additional psychiatric diagnosis on a pre-existing SUD diagnosis did increase the risk for men but not women.

AB To study the use and misuse (poisonings) of baclofen in the time period of 2007-2012 and to evaluate the severity and clinical symptoms of poisonings including ingested baclofen. The National Patient Register (NPR) was searched for admissions due to baclofen poisonings from 2007 to 2012. The search was conducted with ICD-10 codes for poisoning, self-harm and suicide, and coupled with the baclofen ATC code. All enquiries about baclofen to the Danish Poison Information Centre (DPIC) in the same period were evaluated. Demographic and clinical data were extracted, and the poisonings were classified according to the Poison Severity Score. The number of baclofen poisonings did not increase from 2007 to 2012. Thirty-eight admissions with baclofen poisoning were registered at the NPR; however, only one-third of the reviewed DPIC cases were registered at the NPR with the correct coding. In the group of severely poisoned patients (PSS 3), three patients had only ingested baclofen (mean 2000mg; SD 500mg) and eight patients had ingested baclofen together with alcohol or psychotropic drugs (mean 900mg; SD 641mg). All patients presented with deep coma and respiratory depression. Additionally, seizures and cardiovascular events (mild hypo- or hypertension and bradycardia) occurred. There is a substantial degree of underreporting of baclofen poisonings in Denmark. Symptoms of baclofen poisoning progress very fast, and toxicity was observed even with doses as low as 150mg. We therefore recommend that observation and treatment of these patients should be carried out in an intermediate- or intensive care unit. The most important treatment is the maintenance of a protected airway and respiration.

AB The Danish Multiple Sclerosis Registry contains information about all Danish patients in whom multiple sclerosis has been diagnosed since 1948. The purpose of this study was to analyse trends in survival and causes of death of these patients and to compare them with those of the general population. The study comprised all patients with onset in the period 1949-1996. All case records were validated and classified according to standardized diagnostic criteria. Data on emigration and death were obtained by record linkage to official registers. The end of follow-up was 1 January 2000 for emigration and death, and 1 January 1999 for cause-specific deaths. Standardized mortality ratios and excess death rates were calculated for various causes of death and periods after multiple sclerosis onset, and time trends in survival probability were analysed by Cox regression. The study comprised 9881 patients, of whom 4254 had died before end of follow-up. The median survival time from onset was similar to10 years shorter for multiple sclerosis patients than for the age-matched general population, and multiple sclerosis was associated with an almost threefold increase in the risk for death. According to death certificates, more than half (56.4%) of the patients had died from multiple sclerosis. They also had excess mortality rates from other diseases, except cancer, and from accidents and suicide. The probability for survival improved significantly during the observation period. Thus, the 10-year excess mortality was almost halved in comparison with that in the middle of the 1900s.

AB To compare the characteristics of dextropropoxyphene (DXP) poisoning victims with those of victims of poisonings by antidepressants and sedatives, we examined all fatal poisonings due to DXP, antidepressants or sedatives among autopsies performed at one department of forensic medicine in Sweden during the six-year period from 1992 to 1997.
   In 202 cases, death was classified as fatal poisonings by DXP, antidepressants or sedatives. DXP caused death in 78 cases (39%), antidepressants in 49 (24%), and sedatives in 75 (37%). DXP as a single preparation was predominant in causing death. The second compound, flunitrazepam, caused death in 30 cases (15%).
   The victims of poisonings by DXP, antidepressants, or sedatives shared a similar history of alcohol/drug abuse, depression and somatic illness. They were mostly living alone at the time of death (>60%), the majority died at home (81%), and suicide was the most frequent manner of death (73%).
   Age seemed to be an important characteristic regarding the choice of drug. Younger people predominantly died of DXP (mean age 43 years, 95% confidence interval, CI 39-47), and elderly people of sedatives (mean age 59 years, CI 55-63). Antidepressants were found mainly in middle-aged victims (mean age 51 years, CI 48-54).
   The predominance of sedatives among the elderly might be explained by a very high prescription rate of such drugs in older age groups, but prescription rate could not explain the DXP predominance among younger people. We hypothesize that younger people are more prone to abuse therapeutic drugs for euphoric reasons than elderly people, and that because of its high toxicity, DXP leads to accidental deaths more often than sedatives.

AB Background We compared mortality inequalities by occupational class in Japan and South Korea with those in European countries, in order to determine whether patterns are similar. Methods National register-based data from Japan, South Korea and eight European countries (Finland, Denmark, England/Wales, France, Switzerland, Italy (Turin), Estonia, Lithuania) covering the period between 1990 and 2015 were collected and harmonised. We calculated age-standardised all-cause and cause-specific mortality among men aged 35-64 by occupational class and measured the magnitude of inequality with rate differences, rate ratios and the average inter-group difference. Results Clear gradients in mortality were found in all European countries throughout the study period: manual workers had 1.6-2.5 times higher mortality than upper non-manual workers. However, in the most recent time-period, upper non-manual workers had higher mortality than manual workers in Japan and South Korea. This pattern emerged as a result of a rise in mortality among the upper non-manual group in Japan during the late 1990s, and in South Korea during the late 2000s, due to rising mortality from cancer and external causes (including suicide), in addition to strong mortality declines among lower non-manual and manual workers. Conclusion Patterns of mortality by occupational class are remarkably different between European countries and Japan and South Korea. The recently observed patterns in the latter two countries may be related to a larger impact on the higher occupational classes of the economic crisis of the late 1990s and the late 2000s, respectively, and show that a high socioeconomic position does not guarantee better health.

AB Aims: The Nordic countries have a strong tradition of using nationwide social and health registers for research purposes. The aim of the current paper is to provide an overview of the Danish population-based registers in public health and health-related research, and to discuss their strengths and limitations. Methods: Danish registers on somatic and psychiatric hospital contacts as well as care provided by general practitioners were reviewed. The availability of demographic, individual-level variables of relevance for health-related research was summarized. Results: Since 1968, every person living in Denmark has a unique identifier. This identifier is listed in Danish registers enabling linkage of information from a range of registers on an individual level. The nationwide coverage of all patient contacts at somatic and psychiatric hospitals, consultations with general practitioners, purchases of prescribed medications, and a complete follow-up with respect to causes of death support public health studies surveying trends of prevalence and incidence. Historical data on psychiatric and somatic hospitalizations since 1969 and 1977, respectively, allow an in-depth assessment of the burden of disease and time trends. Demographic characteristics of individuals and family units, together with information on education, employment, income, place of residence and migration, are provided by social registers. Conclusions: Register data are fully representative of the entire population with no loss to follow-up. Nationwide coverage also ensures a large sample to investigate events and conditions with low base rates. Clinical observations are limited and often only available for select patient populations. However, the opportunities available for public health research through linkage of register data with the increasing number of nationwide clinical databases, bio-banks and surveys entail promising perspectives for future research.

AB Objective: The relationship between admission volume and the quality of mental health care remains unclear. This study examined the association between admission volume of psychiatric hospital units and quality of mental health care among patients with recently diagnosed schizophrenia (past year) admitted to units in Denmark.
   Methods: In a nationwide population-based cohort study, 3,209 patients admitted to psychiatric hospital units between 2004 and 2011 were identified from the Danish Schizophrenia Registry. Admission volume was categorized into four quartiles according to the individual unit's average caseload volume per year during the study period: low volume (quartile 1, <75 admissions per year), medium volume (quartile 2, 76-146 admissions per year), high volume (quartile 3, 147-256 admissions per year) and very high volume (quartile 4, >256 admissions per year). Quality of mental health care was defined as having received processes of care recommended in guidelines.
   Results: Compared with patients admitted to low-volume psychiatric hospital units, patients admitted to very-high-volume units were more likely to receive high overall quality of mental health care (>= 80% of recommended processes of care) (risk ratio [RR]=1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.03-1.91) and to receive several specific processes of care, including assessment of psychopathology by a specialist in psychiatry (RR=1.05, CI=1.01-1.10) and psychoeducation (RR=1.16, CI=1.05-1.28). Moreover, patients admitted to high-volume units were more likely to have a suicide risk assessment at discharge (RR=1.14, CI=1.07-1.21).
   Conclusions: Admission to very-high-volume and high-volume psychiatric hospital units was associated with a greater chance of receiving guideline-recommended processes of care among patients admitted with recently diagnosed schizophrenia.

AB In many European countries, the last decade has been marked by an increasing debate about the acceptability and regulation'of euthanasia and other end-of-life decisions in medical practice. Growing public sensibility to a 'right to die' for terminally ill patients has been one of the main constituents of these debates. Within this context. we sought to describe and compare acceptance of euthanasia among the general public in 33 European countries. We used the European Values Study data of 1999-2000 with a total of 41 125 respondents (63% response rate) in 33 European countries. The main outcome measure concerned the acceptance of euthanasia (defined as 'terminating the life of the incurably sick', rated on a scale from I to 10).
   Results showed that the acceptance of euthanasia tended to be high in some Countries (e.g. the Netherlands, Denmark, France, Sweden), while a markedly low acceptance was found in others (e.g. Romania. Malta and Turkey). A multivariate ordinal regression showed that weaker religious belief was the most important factor associated with a higher acceptance: however, there were also socio-demographic differences: younger cohorts. people from non-manual social classes, and people with a higher educational level tended to have a higher acceptance of euthanasia. While religious belief. sociodemographic factors, and also moral values (i.e. the belief in the right to self-determination) could largely explain the differences between countries, our findings suggest that perceptions regarding euthanasia are probably also influenced by national traditions and history (e.g. Germany). Thus, we demonstrated clear cross-national differences with regard to the acceptance of euthanasia, which can serve as an important basis for further debate and research in the specific countries.

AB Background Recent studies report increased risks of both cancer and mortality in paediatric onset inflammatory bowel disease (pIBD) but the reproducibility of this is unknown. Aim To estimate the risk of cancer and mortality in the Danish and Finnish pIBD population in a 23-year period compared to the general population. Methods The pIBD population was defined as individuals registered in the national patient registries with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) or IBD-unclassified before their 18th birthday from 1992 to 2014. This cohort was cross referenced with the national cancer and mortality registries identifying all pIBD patients who subsequently developed cancer and/ or died and followed up to the end of 2014. Risk estimates are presented as standardised incidence ratios calculated based on incidence figures from the populations. Results Six thousand six hundred and eight-nine patients with pIBD were identified (median age at follow-up 22.3 years; median follow-up: 9.6 years [interquartile range: 4.8-16.0]). Seventy-two subsequently developed cancer and 65 died. The standardised incidence ratio of cancer in general was 2.6 (95% CI: 1.8-3.7) and 2.5 (95% CI: 1.8-3.4) in CD and UC, respectively. The standardised mortality ratios were 2.2 (95% CI: 1.4-3.4) and 3.7 (95% CI: 2.7-5.0) in CD and UC, respectively. The leading causes for mortality were cancer, suicide and infections. Conclusions We found an increased risk of cancer and mortality in pIBD. This underlines the importance of cancer surveillance programs and assessment of mental health in the standard of care in adolescent pIBD patients.

AB This study aimed to examine differences in all-cause mortality and main causes of death across different migrant and local-born populations living in six European countries. We used data from population and mortality registers from Denmark, England & Wales, France, Netherlands, Scotland, and Spain. We calculated age-standardized mortality rates for men and women aged 0-69 years. Country-specific data were pooled to assess weighted mortality rate ratios (MRRs) using Poisson regression. Analyses were stratified by age group, country of destination, and main cause of death. In six countries combined, all-cause mortality was lower for men and women from East Asia (MRRs 0.66; 95 % confidence interval 0.62-0.71 and 0.76; 0.69-0.82, respectively), and Other Latin America (0.44; 0.42-0.46 and 0.56; 0.54-0.59, respectively) than local-born populations. Mortality rates were similar for those from Turkey. All-cause mortality was higher in men and women from North Africa (1.09; 1.08-1.11 and 1.19; 1.17-1.22, respectively) and Eastern Europe (1.30; 1.27-1.33 and 1.05; 1.01-1.08, respectively), and women from Sub-Saharan Africa (1.34; 1.30-1.38). The pattern differed by age group and country of destination. Most migrants had higher mortality due to infectious diseases and homicide while cancer mortality and suicide were lower. CVD mortality differed by migrant population. To conclude, mortality patterns varied across migrant populations in European countries. Future research should focus both on migrant populations with favourable and less favourable mortality pattern, in order to understand this heterogeneity and to drive policy at the European level.

AB Background: When vaccinations with vaccinia against smallpox and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) against tuberculosis were phased out in some high-income countries around 1980, the impact on overall mortality was not examined. Recent studies from low-income countries have suggested that these vaccines are associated with mortality reductions, not explained by specific disease protection. We examined whether vaccinia and BCG administered in childhood were associated with long-term mortality reductions in a high-income population.
   Methods: In this case-cohort study, we followed 47 622 schoolchildren from Copenhagen, Denmark, born 1965 to 1976, from their first health examination to 2010. This cohort experienced the phase-out of vaccinia and BCG vaccination programmes.
   Results: A sub-cohort of 5 316 individuals (699 excluded) was followed for 164 450 person-years (0.2% were lost to follow-up), and 401 deaths due to natural causes (841 deaths in total) occurred in the full cohort. Compared with individuals who had not received vaccinia or BCG, those who had received both vaccinia and BCG had an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 0.54 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.36-0.81] for mortality due to natural causes of death; those who only received BCG had an aHR of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.39-0.85). Vaccinia and BCG were not associated with any protection against deaths by accidents, suicide or murder, the combined aHR being 0.94 (95% CI: 0.62-1.42).
   Conclusions: Vaccinia and BCG vaccinations were associated with better long-term survival, which was not explained by specific protection. Vaccines with beneficial non-specific effectsmay reduce overall mortality even after the target diseases are eradicated.

AB Background: Experience of child-parent separation predicts adverse outcomes in later life. We conducted a detailed epidemiological examination of this complex relationship by modelling an array of separation scenarios and trajectories and subsequent risk of self-harm.
   Methods: This cohort study examined persons born in Denmark during 1971-1997. We measured child-parent separations each year from birth to 15th birthday via complete residential address records in the Civil Registration System. Self-harm episodes between 15th birthday and early middle age were ascertained through linkage to psychiatric and general hospital registers. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) from Poisson regression models were estimated against a reference category of individuals not separated from their parents.
   Results: All exposure models examined indicated an association with raised self-harm risk. For example, large elevations in risk were observed in relation to separation from both parents at 15th birthday (IRR 5.50, 95% CI 5.25-5.77), experiencing five or more changes in child-parent separation status (IRR 5.24, CI 4.88-5.63), and having a shorter duration of familial cohesion during upbringing. There was no significant evidence for varying strength of association according to child's gender.
   Limitations: Measuring child-parent separation according to differential residential addresses took no account of the reason for or circumstances of these separations.
   Conclusions: These novel findings suggest that self-harm prevention initiatives should be tailored toward exposed persons who remain psychologically distressed into adulthood. These high-risk subgroups include individuals with little experience of familial cohesion during their upbringing, those with the most complicated trajectories who lived through multiple child-parent separation transitions, and those separated from both parents during early adolescence.

DT Article
ID CIVIL REGISTRATION SYSTEM; BIRTH-WEIGHT; MORTALITY; ADULTHOOD; INFANTS;
   DISEASE
AB Background
   Little is known on long-term survival and causes of death among individuals born small or large for gestational age. This study investigates birth weight in relation to survival and causes of death over time.
   Methods
   A national cohort of 1.7 million live-born singletons in Denmark was followed during 19792011, using the Danish Civil Registration System, the Medical Birth Registry and the Cause of Death Registry. Cox proportional hazards were estimated for the impact of small (SGA) and large (LGA) gestation weight and mortality overall, by age group and birth cohort.
   Results
   Compared to normal weight children, SGA children were associated with increased risk of dying over time. Though most of the deaths occurred during the first year of life, the cumulative mortality risk was increased until 30 years of age. The hazard ratios [HR] for dying among SGA children ages < 2 years were: 3.47 (95% CI, 3.30-3.64) and 1.06 (95% CI, 0.60-1.87) in 30 years and older. HR for dying among SGA adults (20-29 years) were: 1.20 (95% CI, 0.99-1.46) in years 1979-1982 and 1.61 (95% CI, 1.04-2.51) in years 19891994. The SGA born had increased risk of dying from infection, heart disease, respiratory disease, digestive disease, congenital malformation, perinatal conditions, and accidents, suicide, and homicide. Individuals born LGA were associated with decreased mortality risk, but with increased risk of dying from malignant neoplasm.
   Conclusions
   Survival has improved independently of birth weight the past 30 years. However, children born SGA remain at significantly increased risk of dying up till they turn 30 years of age. Individuals born LGA have lower mortality risk but only in the first two years of life.

ID GUIDELINES; METAANALYSIS; MORTALITY; THERAPY
AB Objectives: From placebo-controlled studies of up to two years duration, it has been established that lithium has preventive efficacy in bipolar disorder (BD). However, the effectiveness of lithium under routine conditions seems less pronounced. In the present study, the overall 15.3-year outcome in BD patients commenced on lithium is described.
   Methods: Ninety-one patients with BD consecutively commenced on prophylactic lithium treatment during hospitalization at the Aarhus University Psychiatric Hospital from 1981 to 1983 were followed until death or censoring occurred during up to 15.3 years of observation. Register-based outcome measures, available for all patients, included accumulated duration of admission and number of admissions. In addition, serious attempts were made to collect detailed information on treatment during follow up. Simple descriptive statistics were applied; potential independent associations between baseline variables and outcome were examined using logistic regression models.
   Results: Of the 91 patients, 27 patients died (six from suicide) during the observation period, which was an excess mortality compared to the general population. Fifty percent of the patients were admitted for more than one month per 20 months of observation and admitted more than once for each four years of observation. Only 19 (21%) patients were not admitted to hospital during the observation period. No statistically significant predictors of poor outcome could be identified. In addition to lithium prophylaxis given for variable lengths of time, the majority of the 36 (40%) patients, from whom treatment data were available, received various other drug treatments during follow-up.
   Conclusions: The overall outcome in patients beginning prophylactic treatment is unsatisfactory. However, due to the observational design and the lack of detailed treatment information during the long follow-up period, inferences about the efficacy of lithium cannot be made from this study.

AB Background and Purpose-As part of the Danish contribution to the World Health Organization (WHO) MONICA (Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease) Project, a register of patients with stroke was established in 1982. The purpose of the present study was to analyze long-term survival and causes of death after a first stroke and to compare them with those of the background population.
   Methods-The study population comprised all subjects aged 25 years or older who were resident in a geographically defined region in Copenhagen County. All stroke events in the study population during 1982-1991 were ascertained and validated according to standardized criteria outlined for the WHO MONICA Project. After completion of the stroke registry at the end of 1991, all patients were followed up by record linkage to official registries. Standardized mortality ratios were calculated for various causes of death and periods after the stroke.
   Results-The estimated cumulative risks for death at 28 days, 1 year, and 5 years after onset were 28%, 41%, and 60%, respectively. Compared with the general population, nonfatal stroke was associated with an almost 5-fold increase in risk for death between 4 weeks and 1 year after a first stroke and a 2-fold increase in the risk for death subsequent to 1 year. The excess mortality rate in stroke patients was due mainly to cardiovascular diseases but also to cancer, other diseases, accidents, and suicide. The probability for long-term survival improved significantly during the observation period for patients with ischemic or ill-defined stroke.
   Conclusions-Stroke is a medical emergency associated with a very high risk for death in the acute and subacute phases and with a continuous excess risk of death. Better prevention and management of strokes may improve the long-term survival rate.

AB Background: Unemployment is associated with increased risk of mortality. It is, however, not clear to what extent this is causal, or whether other risk factors remain uncontrolled for. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between unemployment and all-cause and cause-specific mortality, adjusting for indicators of mental disorder, behavioural risk factors and social factors over the life course.
   Methods: This study was based on a cohort of 49321 Swedish males, born 1949/51, tested for compulsory military conscription in 1969/70. Data on employment/unemployment 1990-4 was based on information from the Longitudinal Register of Education and Labour Market Statistics. Information on childhood circumstances was drawn from National Population and Housing Census 1960. Information on psychiatric diagnosis and behavioral risk factors was collected at conscription testing in 1969/70. Data on mortality and hospitalisation 1973-2004 were collected in national registers.
   Results: An increased risk of mortality 1995-2003 was found among individuals who experienced 90 days or more of unemployment during 1992-4 compared with those still employed (all-cause mortality HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.31. Adjustment for risk factors measured along the life course considerably lowered the relative risk (all cause mortality HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.58). Statistically significant increased relative risk was found during the first 4 years of follow up (all-cause mortality, adjusted HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.18, but not the following 4 years (all cause mortality, adjusted HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.50).
   Conclusion: The results suggest that a substantial part of the increased relative risk of mortality associated with unemployment may be attributable to confounding by individual risk factors.

AB IMPORTANCE Nationwide cohorts provide sufficient statistical power for examining premature, cause-specific mortality in patients recently discharged from inpatient psychiatric services.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate premature mortality in a nationwide cohort of patients recently discharged from inpatient psychiatric treatment at ages 15 to 44 years.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This single-cohort design included all persons born in Denmark (N = 1 683 385) between January 1, 1967, and December 31, 1996. Exactly 48 599 of these Danish residents were discharged from an inpatient psychiatric unit or ward on or after their 15th birthday, which took place during this study's observation period from January 1, 1982, through December 31, 2011. This group of patients was followed up beginning on their 15th birthday until their death, emigration, or December 31, 2011, whichever came first. Individuals discharged from inpatient psychiatric care at least once before their 15th birthday (n = 5882) were excluded from the study. All data were obtained from the Danish Civil Registration System, Psychiatric Central Research Register, and Register of Causes of Death. Data analysis took place between February 1, 2016, and December 10, 2016.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incidence rates and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for all-cause mortality and for an array of unnatural and natural causes of death among patients recently discharged from an inpatient psychiatric unit vs persons not admitted to a psychiatric facility. Primary analysis considered risk within the year of first discharge.
   RESULTS Of the 48 599 discharged patients who were included in the study, 25 006 (51.4%) were female, 35 660 (73.4%) were aged 15 to 29 years, and 33 995 (70.0%) had a length of stay of 30 days or less. Compared with persons not admitted, patients discharged had an elevated risk for all-cause mortality within 1 year (IRR, 16.2; 95% CI, 14.5-18.0). The relative risk for unnatural death (IRR, 25.0; 95% CI, 22.0-28.4) was much higher than for natural death (IRR, 8.6; 95% CI, 7.0-10.7). The highest IRR found was for suicide at 66.9 (95% CI, 56.4-79.4), followed by alcohol-related death at 42.0 (95% CI, 26.6-66.1). Among the psychiatric diagnostic categories assessed, psychoactive substance abuse conferred the highest risk for all-cause mortality (IRR, 24.8; 95% CI, 21.0-29.4). Across the array of cause-specific outcomes examined, risk of premature death during the first year after discharge was markedly higher than the risk of death beyond the first year of discharge.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Clinicians may help protect patients after discharge by serving as a liaison between primary and secondary health services to ensure they are receiving holistic care. Early intervention programs for drug and alcohol misuse could substantially decrease the greatly elevated mortality risk among these patients.

AB Objective: To examine rates of acute inpatient hospital admissions patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery and a matched population-based comparison cohort.
   Summary Background Data: Little is known about the admission rates before and after RYGB.
   Methods: Nationwide population-based cohort study, including all 9985 patients undergoing RYGB in Denmark during 2006 to 2010, and 247,375 matched general population comparisons. We calculated cumulative incidence of surgical complications after RYGB and incidence rate ratios (RRs) of hospital admission in RYGB patients versus comparisons before and after RYGB.
   Results: Admissions for surgical complications occurred in 3.3% (n = 328) of RYGB patients <30 days after surgery and in 23.9% (n = 2367) during entire follow-up (median 4.2 yrs). Fifteen percent (n = 1486) were admitted with abdominal pain, 5.2% (n = 518) with intestinal obstruction during follow-up. Overall admission rates in RYGB patients versus comparisons were 11.5 versus 5.9 per 100 person-years before RYGB [RR = 1.95 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.89-2.01)], increasing to 24.9 versus 7.1 per 100 person-years after RYGB [RR = 3.38 (95% CI; 3.30, 3.47)]. RRs of cardiovascular and chronic pulmonary disease admissions decreased considerably. RRs increased for alcohol abuse [0.59 (95% CI; 0.39-0.88) to 2.17 (95% CI; 1.72-2.72)], self-harm (suicide attempts, medication overuse) [1.72 (95% CI; 1.32-2.25) to 3.61 (95% CI; 2.88-4.52)], anemia [0.84 (95% CI; 0.39-1.78) to 17.92 (95% CI; 14.94-21.48)], and osteoporosis [1.19 (95% CI; 0.93-1.53) to 1.65 (95% CI; 1.35-2.02)].
   Conclusions: Short-term surgical complications occurred in 3% and long-term complications in one-fourth of RYGB patients. Compared with the general population, the RR for any inpatient admission increased after RYGB.

TI Mortality after Parental Death in Childhood: A Nationwide Cohort Study
   from Three Nordic Countries
SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article

   SUICIDE; RISK; STRESS; ABUSE; HOSPITALIZATION; CONSEQUENCES
AB Background: Bereavement by spousal death and child death in adulthood has been shown to lead to an increased risk of mortality. Maternal death in infancy or parental death in early childhood may have an impact on mortality but evidence has been limited to short-term or selected causes of death. Little is known about long-term or cause-specific mortality after parental death in childhood.
   Methods and Findings: This cohort study included all persons born in Denmark from 1968 to 2008 (n = 2,789,807) and in Sweden from 1973 to 2006 (n = 3,380,301), and a random sample of 89.3% of all born in Finland from 1987 to 2007 (n = 1,131,905). A total of 189,094 persons were included in the exposed cohort when they lost a parent before 18 years old. Log-linear Poisson regression was used to estimate mortality rate ratio (MRR). Parental death was associated with a 50% increased all-cause mortality (MRR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.43-1.58). The risks were increased for most specific cause groups and the highest MRRs were observed when the cause of child death and the cause of parental death were in the same category. Parental unnatural death was associated with a higher mortality risk (MRR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.71-2.00) than parental natural death (MRR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.24-1.41). The magnitude of the associations varied according to type of death and age at bereavement over different follow-up periods. The main limitation of the study is the lack of data on post-bereavement information on the quality of the parent-child relationship, lifestyles, and common physical environment.
   Conclusions: Parental death in childhood or adolescence is associated with increased all-cause mortality into early adulthood. Since an increased mortality reflects both genetic susceptibility and long-term impacts of parental death on health and social well-being, our findings have implications in clinical responses and public health strategies.

   PARENT; GRIEF
AB IMPORTANCE The death of a close relative is associated with an increased mortality risk among the bereaved, but much less is known about the potential association of the death of a sibling in childhood with mortality in this population.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the association between sibling death in childhood and subsequent mortality risk.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based cohort study of 5 005 029 participants evaluated linked national registers in Denmark (January 1, 1973, through December 31, 2009) and Sweden (January 1, 1973, through December 31, 2008). A total of 2 060 354 Danish and 2 944 675 Swedish children who survived the first 6 months of their life were included. We excluded 14 children who died of the same external cause as their siblings within 30 days. Data were analyzed from November 2, 2015, through October 14, 2016.
   EXPOSURES Participants were classified as exposed if a sibling died in childhood (age <18 years).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Poisson regression was used to estimate mortality rate ratio (MRR) with the exposure as a time-varying variable.
   RESULTS Among the 55 818 participants who experienced sibling death in childhood (51.5% male and 48.5% female; median age at loss, 7.0 [interquartile range, 3.3-12.1] years), all-cause mortality risk was increased by 71%(MRR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.57-1.87) during the follow-up of 37 years. The excess mortality risk was observed for groups with specific causes of death, and the higher MRRs were found when the sibling pairs died of the same cause (death due to disease [MRR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.87-2.49]; death due to external cause [MRR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.54-2.37]). The increased mortality risk after sibling death was seen across the follow-up period, regardless of the age at bereavement and the type of death among bereaved siblings, but the magnitude of association was stronger during the first year after sibling death (MRR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.79-3.54). Higher MRRs were found among sibling pairs with the same sex (MRR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.70-2.18) and close age (MRR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.58-2.37).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Bereavement in childhood because of the death of a sibling was associated with an increased risk for mortality in the short and long term. Health care professionals should be aware of individuals' vulnerability due to sibling death, especially for sibling pairs of close age or the same sex. Social and health care support may help to minimize the potential adverse effects on the bereaved sibling.

AB IMPORTANCE Evidence suggests that long-term trajectories of major depressive disorder (MDD) are heterogeneous. The Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register (DPCRR) provides a rare opportunity to examine patterns and correlates of long-term trajectories in a large sample of patients with moderate to severe MDD.
   OBJECTIVE To characterize patterns and correlates of 10-year course trajectories of MDD in the DPCRR.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cohort containing 11 640 individuals born in Denmark in 1955 or later with their first recorded MDD diagnosis in the DPCRR between 1995 and 2002 was established. Patients were followed for 10 years from the date of their initial MDD diagnosis. Data were obtained from Danish civil and psychiatric national registers in June 2013 and were analyzed from April 4, 2014, to December 17, 2015. Correlates of trajectory class membership were sex, characteristics of the first recorded MDD episode (ie, age, severity, inpatient treatment, and record of suicide attempt or self-harm), and psychiatric diagnoses in parents (ie, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, substance abuse, and anxiety or somatoform disorders).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The outcome variable was past-year contact at a psychiatric hospital with a main diagnosis of MDD during each of the 10 years following the initial MDD diagnosis. Trajectories were modeled using latent class growth analysis.
   RESULTS The sample included 11 640 individuals (7493 [64.4%] women) aged 18 to 48 years (mean [SD], 31.4 [7.3]) at their first recorded MDD diagnosis. Four trajectory classes were identified: brief contact (77.0%) (characterized by low probability of contact after 2 years); prolonged initial contact (12.8%) (characterized by high decreasing probability of contact during the first 5 years); later reentry (7.1%) (characterized by moderate probability of contact during the second 5 years); and persistent contact (3.1%) (characterized by high or moderate probability of contact throughout). Female sex (odds ratio [OR] range, 1.82-2.22), inpatient treatment (OR range, 1.40-1.50), and severity at first recorded MDD episode (OR range: moderate, 1.61-1.84; severe, 1.93-2.23; and psychotic, 2.73-3.07) were associated with more severe trajectories. Parental anxiety (OR, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.10-1.63]) and depression (OR, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.28-2.09]) were associated with the prolonged initial contact and later reentry classes, respectively. Parental schizophrenia was associated with the persistent contact class (OR range, 2.55-3.04).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Most people treated for moderate to severe MDD in Danish psychiatric hospitals do not receive additional MDD treatment after 2 years; however, a minority receive specialty treatment for up to a decade. Observable heterogeneity in the course may be indicative of underlying etiologic differences.

TI A comprehensive analysis of mortality-related health metrics associated
   with mental disorders: a nationwide, register-based cohort study
SO LANCET

ID LIFE-YEARS LOST; DIAGNOSES; VALIDITY; BURDEN
AB Background Systematic reviews have consistently shown that individuals with mental disorders have an increased risk of premature mortality. Traditionally, this evidence has been based on relative risks or crude estimates of reduced life expectancy. The aim of this study was to compile a comprehensive analysis of mortality-related health metrics associated with mental disorders, including sex-specific and age-specific mortality rate ratios (MRRs) and life-years lost (LYLs), a measure that takes into account age of onset of the disorder.
   Methods In this population-based cohort study, we included all people younger than 95 years of age who lived in Denmark at some point between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2015. Information on mental disorders was obtained from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register and the date and cause of death was obtained from the Danish Register of Causes of Death. We classified mental disorders into ten groups and causes of death into 11 groups, which were further categorised into natural causes (deaths from diseases and medical conditions) and external causes (suicide, homicide, and accidents). For each specific mental disorder, we estimated MRRs using Poisson regression models, adjusting for sex, age, and calendar time, and excess LYLs (ie, difference in LYLs between people with a mental disorder and the general population) for all-cause mortality and for each specific cause of death.
   Findings 7 369 926 people were included in our analysis. We found that mortality rates were higher for people with a diagnosis of a mental disorder than for the general Danish population (28 center dot 70 deaths [95% CI 28 center dot 57-28 center dot 82] vs 12 center dot 95 deaths [12 center dot 93-12 center dot 98] per 1000 person-years). Additionally, all types of disorders were associated with higher mortality rates, with MRRs ranging from 1 center dot 92 (95% CI 1 center dot 91-1 center dot 94) for mood disorders to 3 center dot 91 (3 center dot 87-3 center dot 94) for substance use disorders. All types of mental disorders were associated with shorter life expectancies, with excess LYLs ranging from 5 center dot 42 years (95% CI 5 center dot 36-5 center dot 48) for organic disorders in females to 14 center dot 84 years (14 center dot 70-14 center dot 99) for substance use disorders in males. When we examined specific causes of death, we found that males with any type of mental disorder lost fewer years due to neoplasm-related deaths compared with the general population, although their cancer mortality rates were higher.
   Interpretation Mental disorders are associated with premature mortality. We provide a comprehensive analysis of mortality by different types of disorders, presenting both MRRs and premature mortality based on LYLs, displayed by age, sex, and cause of death. By providing accurate estimates of premature mortality, we reveal previously underappreciated features related to competing risks and specific causes of death.

AB Background Previous trials have shown that pridopidine might reduce motor impairment in patients with Huntington's disease. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether higher doses of pridopidine than previously tested reduce motor symptoms in a dose-dependent manner while maintaining acceptable safety and tolerability.
   Methods PRIDE-HD was a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2, dose-ranging study in adults (aged >= 21 years) with Huntington's disease at outpatient clinics in 53 sites across 12 countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA). Eligible patients had clinical onset after age 18 years, 36 or more cytosine-adenine-guanine repeats in the huntingtin gene, motor symptoms (Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score [UHDRS-TMS] >= 25 points), and reduced independence (UHDRS independence score <= 90%). Patients were randomly assigned (1: 1: 1: 1: 1) with centralised interactive-response technology to receive one of four doses of pridopidine (45, 67.5, 90, or 112.5 mg) or placebo orally twice a day for 52 weeks. Randomisation was stratified within centres by neuroleptic drug use. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in the UHDRS-TMS from baseline to 26 weeks, which was assessed in all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment (full analysis set). Participants and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2013-001888-23) and ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT02006472).
   Findings Between Feb 13, 2014, and July 5, 2016, 408 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=82) or pridopidine 45 mg (n=81), 67.5 mg (n=82), 90 mg (n=81), or 112.5 mg (n=82) twice daily for 26 weeks. The full analysis set included 397 patients (81 in the placebo group, 75 in the 45 mg group, 79 in the 67.5 mg group, 81 in the 90 mg group, and 81 in the 112.5 mg group). Pridopidine did not significantly change the UHDRS-TMS at 26 weeks compared with placebo at any dose. The most frequent adverse events across all groups were diarrhoea, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, falls, headache, insomnia, and anxiety. The most common treatment-related adverse events were insomnia, diarrhoea, nausea, and dizziness. Serious adverse events occurred in the pridopidine groups only and were most frequently falls (n=5), suicide attempt (n= 4), suicidal ideation (n=3), head injury (n=3), and aspiration pneumonia (n=3). No new safety or tolerability concerns emerged in this study. One death in the pridopidine 112.5 mg group due to aspiration pneumonia was considered to be possibly related to the study drug.
   Interpretation Pridopidine did not improve the UHDRS-TMS at week 26 compared with placebo and, thus, the results of secondary or tertiary analyses in previous trials were not replicated. A potentially strong placebo effect needs to be ruled out in future studies.

AB Do women who don't succeed in giving birth after an infertility evaluation have a higher risk of psychiatric disorders compared with women who do?
   The results indicated that being unsuccessful in giving birth after an infertility evaluation could be an important risk factor for psychiatric disorders.
   Several studies have investigated the association between fertility treatment and psychological distress, but the results from these studies show substantial variation and lack of homogeneity that may be due to methodological limitations.
   A retrospective cohort study was designed using data from a cohort of 98 320 Danish women evaluated for fertility problems during 19732008 and linked to several Danish population-based registries. All women were followed from the date of first infertility evaluation until date of hospitalization for the psychiatric disorder in question, date of emigration, date of death or 31 December 2008, whichever occurred first. Owing to the precise linkage between the infertility cohort and the Danish population-based registries, using the unique Danish personal identification number, virtually no women were lost to follow-up.
   Information on reproductive status for all women in the infertility cohort was obtained by linkage to the Danish Medical Birth Registry. A total of 53 547 (54.5) women gave birth after the initial infertility evaluation, whereas 44 773 (45.5) women did not gave birth after the evaluation. To determine psychiatric disorders diagnosed in the women after enrolment in the infertility cohort, the cohort was linked to the Danish Psychiatric Central Registry. A total of 4633 women were hospitalized for a psychiatric disorder. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was applied to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95 confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between parity status after the initial infertility evaluation and risk of hospitalization for various groups of psychiatric disorders, including oall mental disorders' and six main discharge subgroups labelled: oalcohol and intoxicant abuse', oschizophrenia and psychoses', oaffective disorders', oanxiety, adjustment and obsessive compulsive disorders', oeating disorder' and oother mental disorders'.
   The incidence rate for all mental disorders was 393 cases per 100 000 person-years among women who did not succeed in giving birth after the infertility evaluation but only 353 cases per 100 000 person-years among women who succeeded in giving birth after the infertility evaluation. Women not giving birth after the infertility evaluation had an increased risk of hospitalization for all mental disorders (HR 1.17, 95 CI 1.11; 1.25), alcohol and intoxicant abuse (HR 2.02, 95 CI 1.69; 2.41), schizophrenia and psychoses (HR 1.46, 95 CI 1.17; 1.82) and other mental disorders (HR 1.42, 95 CI 1.27; 1.58) compared with women who gave birth after the infertility evaluation. In contrast, the risk of affective disorders (HR 0.90, 95 CI 0.81; 0.99) was decreased among women not giving birth after the infertility evaluation. Finally, the risk of anxiety, adjustment and obsessive compulsive disorders (HR 1.07, 95 CI 0.97; 1.17) as well as of eating disorders (HR 1.40, 95 CI 0.88; 2.22) was not significantly affected by parity status after the infertility evaluation.
   As only psychiatric conditions warranting hospitalization could be included in the present study, the true incidence of all psychiatric disorders among women with fertility problems is likely to be somewhat underestimated. Furthermore, since detailed information on fertility treatment was not available for all cohort members the association between different modalities of assisted reproductive techniques and risk of psychiatric disorders was not assessed.
   Clinicians and other healthcare personnel involved in diagnosis and treatment of women with fertility problems should be aware of the potential risk modification of psychiatric disorders associated with unsuccessful fertility treatment. Hence, our results may point to new aspects of follow-up of women with fertility problems who are unsuccessful in giving birth in order to prevent or identify and treat these possible psychological side effects.
