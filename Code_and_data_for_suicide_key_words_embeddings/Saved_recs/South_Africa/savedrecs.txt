AB Suicide remains a serious public health problem nationally and globally. Rates of completed suicide in South Africa are reported to be 13.25 per 100,000. Data are needed to assist in the understanding of suicide and to inform evidence-based prevention efforts. This article presents the first known thematic analysis of suicide notes from South Africa. A sample of 24 suicide notes was collected from three independent sites located in Johannesburg and Durban. Thematic analysis yielded 12 themes that showed marked similarity to themes reported in comparable international studies. Two themes - 'Expressions of love and gratitude' and 'Concern for those left behind' - were found to be unique in relation to the international literature. It is recommended that further research on suicide notes be conducted in South Africa, using a standard coding scheme.

AB This article offers a synthesis and critical overview of published studies on the prevalence and correlates of completed suicide in South Africa. It examines the evidence that suicide is a serious public health problem and highlights what remains unknown about suicide in South Africa. Reflections are offered on the implications of these studies for subsequent research. Focus areas are suggested for future research in order to provide the information needed to inform public health efforts to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with suicidal behaviour. This article is of interest to scholars who seek to plan suicide research in South Africa, public health officials who wish to design suicide prevention programmes, and others who wish to gain an overview of the prevalence and correlates of completed suicide in the country.

AB Aims: A study was undertaken to investigate suicide rates and proportional mortality trends in South Africa from 1968 to 1990. Methods: Suicide rates per 100,000 population per year and suicide proportional mortality rates per year were calculated. The analyses were stratified by race, sex, and age group. Trends were interpreted using graphs depicting smoothed sex/race-specific suicide rates and proportional mortality rates over time. Regression models for suicide rates were fitted within specific age groups to test the effects of race, sex, and time. Further analysis was done within the specific age and race groups, if any interaction was found with time. Results: There were increases in suicide rate in the young ( particularly for white males) and for whites aged 65 years and above ( particularly for males). Conclusions: The finding that suicide among the young and elderly in South Africa is increasing suggests that preventive efforts are indicated, especially for white males. Trends for young South Africans mirror those in Europe and the USA, and attention to trends in these countries may predict future trends in youth suicide in South Africa.

AB This study investigates the economics of suicide in South Africa using the Mortality and Causes of Death data from death notification as well as regional economic data for the 2006-2008 period. Using an inflation rate that varies by month and across province of residence as a proxy for economic performance, the results indicate a negative relationship between inflation and suicide, suggesting that suicides are countercyclical. When controlling for month and province fixed effects, however, the inflation coefficient, albeit remaining negative, is no longer significant, except in the female sample. Suicide is more prevalent among younger individuals, while the greatest proportion of suicide is seen among men. Suicides also exhibit a strong seasonal variation, with peaks in spring and summer, with December having the highest suicide prevalence. The overall results indicate a negative but insignificant relationship between economic performance and suicide in South Africa, with socio-economic differences and individual characteristics accounting for most of the variation in suicide.

AB Worldwide suicide is a deeply gendered phenomenon. In South Africa, approximately 80% of suicide completers are male. This study aimed to investigate how a group of young South African men understand and think about suicidal behavior. In-depth semistructured interviews and thematic analysis using a grounded theory approach revealed that this group of young South African men had permissive attitudes to suicide and viewed suicide as a morally defensible alternative in specific situations. They spoke of suicide as a goal-directed behavior that provides a means of regaining control, asserting power, communicating, and rendering oneself visible. From this perspective, suicide was understood as a brave act requiring strength and determination. These data have congruence with the Theory of Gender and Health, which proposes that constructions of masculinity may be implicated in the attitudes and beliefs young men in South Africa hold toward suicide.

AB This study investigated homicide-suicide in Durban, South Africa, for the years 2000 to 2001. The incidence was 0.89 per 100,000, higher than the international average. A majority of perpetrators (91%) and victims (87%) were Black African, proportional to their representation in the population. Perpetrators were typically men (in 95% of cases), older than, and intimate partners (in 75% of cases) of the female victims (in 100% of cases). Average ages of perpetrators and victims were 32 and 27, respectively. The security sector was overrepresented as an employment category for perpetrators. A firearm was used in 87% of the homicides and 80% of the suicides. The individuals involved in homicide-suicides in Durban are similar to homicide-suicide perpetrators and victims in industrialized countries. The fact that homicide-suicides in South Africa, as in most countries, involve almost exclusively men killing female intimates confirms the importance of examining and challenging social norms enabling male violence against women.

AB South Africa offers a valuable study environment to assess the impact of political and social changes on health. Increasing urbanisation has led to a focus on city development and its effect on its residents. The study assesses whether sex- and race-specific suicide rates differ across six of South Africa's major cities. Regional differences may reflect varying contextual and individual underlying mechanisms. Those need to be understood for appropriately targeted prevention efforts. Suicide mortality data (n=4,946) for the six cities between 2001 and 2003 were used to assess whether there are differences in rates for age-standardised race and sex groups across cities and whether these differences are constant across cities. The overall age-standardised rates for the six cities was 25.3/100,000 for men and 5.6/100,000 for women. Suicide rates are most often highest among whites and men, but both the magnitude and distribution of suicide vary considerably for different race and sex groups within and across cities. There is a strong association between the method of suicide used and the city. Despite some common trends in the suicide profile across South African cities, city does matter for the magnitude and distribution of suicide mortality across race and sex groups and for the method of suicide used. The need for locally based suicide research investigating possible reasons for these differences is highlighted.

AB In South Africa, one in five adolescents attempt suicide. Suicide attempts continue to rise. We aimed to identify psychosocial target points for future educational interventions. One-to-one semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore psychosocial factors associated with past suicide attempts among suicide survivors in Limpopo province, South Africa. A total of 14 adolescents (eight girls and six boys) who recently attempted suicide were interviewed. Lack of knowledge of available counsellors, conflicts in interpersonal relationships, perceived accusations of negative behaviour, inadequate social support, past family and peer suicide attempts and poor living circumstances were factors found to be related with suicide attempts. This study suggests that availability and access to counselling is essential in the prevention of suicide among young people, at both the individual level and family level.

AB Suicide is the leading cause of death among offenders in correctional facilities in many parts of the world. While epidemiological data have described the extent and scope of the problem, no research has documented the experiences and insights of health professionals who are tasked with providing care to suicidal offenders in South African correctional centres. It is within this context that we set out to document the experiences of a group of health professionals working in two correctional facilities in South Africa. We were interested in learning from them about their perceptions of the factors that contribute to suicidal behaviour among offenders and their suggestions for suicide prevention. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with a group of health professionals (N = 10). Data were analysed using thematic analysis and an inductive approach was adopted for coding the data. The participants describe a number of structural and contextual factors which they believe make correctional centres in South Africa unsafe, thus increasing the risk of suicidal behaviour among offenders and hindering suicide prevention efforts within the two correctional centres where data were collected. These factors include high levels of psychopathology, trauma, substance abuse, violence, gangsterism, overcrowding, inadequate mental health care resources, and problems relating to stigma. These findings highlight human rights and mental health issues facing offenders and draw attention to conditions within correctional centres that need attention as part of any national suicide prevention strategy in South Africa.

AB Practitioners of traditional African medicine (traditional healers) are an important part of the health care system in South Africa, yet their voices are often absent from discussions about public health. In this context, we set out to investigate how a group of traditional healers in South Africa understand suicide and suicide prevention. In-depth, semistructured interviews were conducted with 6 traditional healers and analysed using thematic content analysis. The traditional healers report they are frequently consulted by suicidal individuals and they are confident about their ability to help people in a suicidal crisis. Findings suggest that traditional healers understand suicidal behaviour as a symptom of social disconnection and cultural discontinuity. Traditional healers report that suicidal individuals can be helped by reestablishing interpersonal connections, reconnecting to family and ancestors, and renewing their cultural identities through rituals. These findings suggest that there is some congruence between the way traditional healers understand suicide and the Western scientific and biomedical literature. Our findings raise important questions about cultural approaches to suicide research which are commonly premised on dualistic thinking that constructs culture as something distinct from Western biomedicine.

SO CULTURE MEDICINE AND PSYCHIATRY

DE Suicide; Gender; Masculine domination; Bushbuckridge; South Africa
AB Durkheim's classical theory of suicide rates being a negative index of social solidarity downplays the salience of gendered concerns in suicide. But gendered inequalities have had a negative impact: worldwide significantly more men than women perpetrate fatal suicides. Drawing on narratives of 52 fatal suicides in Bushbuckridge, South Africa, this article suggests that Bourdieu's concepts of 'symbolic violence' and 'masculine domination' provide a more appropriate framework for understanding this paradox. I show that the thwarting of investments in dominant masculine positions have been the major precursor to suicides by men. Men tended to take their own lives as a means of escape. By contrast, women perpetrated suicide to protest against the miserable consequences of being dominated by men. However, contra the assumption of Bourdieu's concept of 'habitus', the narrators of suicide stories did reflect critically upon gender constructs.

LA English
DT Article
AB The first national toll free suicide crisis line for South Africa was launched in October 2003 with the aim of providing a service dedicated to the prevention of suicide in this country. The intervention was motivated by South Africas suicide rate which had risen higher than the global suicide rate, with the majority of attempted suicides occurring among people younger than 35 years of age (WHO, 2002). Demographic characteristics of callers were identified to evaluate the perceived helpfulness of this crisis line, so as to inform planning and implementation of future suicide prevention programs. Results showed that the majority of callers were female; between the ages of 16 and 18 years; and lived in the provinces of Gauteng, North West, or KwaZulu Natal. Callers were more likely to be from urban than rural areas; were still at school, unemployed, or studying at a tertiary institution; and had not previously attempted suicide. The majority of participants did perceive the crisis line as helpful. The continued collection of demographic data from the crisis line is recommended so that South Africa can create an updated database of areas and sectors,of the population that require suicide intervention, and for planning and implementing suicide prevention programs In this country.

AB Introduction Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth worldwide, but low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) account for 78% of all suicides. The LMICs South Africa and Guyana rank high in the global suicide rates. To better understand and prevent suicide among the youth, the present study targets youths at high risk for suicide, in an LMIC, to contextually and representatively identify clinical risk factors for suicide. Methods One hundred-ninety youths, aged 11-21, separated from biological parents at the time of assessment, in South Africa and Guyana, were administered the Child Behavior Checklist and Behavior Assessment System for Children to assess clinical symptoms. The youths were asked about current suicide ideation and previous attempt(s). Self-report responses to clinical items yielded scale scores for depression, social stress, atypicality, somatization, anxiety, and ADHD. Using an integrative data analytic technique, clinical scale scores were standardized and used to predict suicidal behaviors in a binary logistic regression analysis. Results Approximately 22% of Black South African youths and 60% of Guyanese youths endorsed suicide ideation and attempt or suicide attempt only. In fully adjusted analyses, the odds of atypicality and somatization were 1.96 and 1.67 times greater among the youths who endorsed suicidal ideation when compared with those who did not (p < .04). Youth social stress was significantly associated with the suicide attempt, controlling for model covariates (odds ratio [OR], 1.88, p = .05). Gender moderated the effect of somatization on youth suicide. Conclusion Our results contextualize how social stress, atypicality, and somatization relate to LMIC youth suicide. Further study on high-risk samples will contribute to generalizable suicide-prevention models.

AB The typical circumstances of suicide occurrence in post-apartheid urban South Africa are described. Data comprise suicide cases from all geographical locations (urban municipalities) where an injury surveillance system has full coverage. Typical patterns were identified by means of a classification technique applied to eight variables descriptive of the events, their victims, and the suicide level of the cities. Six suicide mortality patterns were identified, most being race-specific and each associated with particular suicide methods. Preventive strategies should target local communities and specific population subgroups, and be appropriate and responsive to their sociocultural needs.

TI Suicide prevention: a proposed national strategy for South Africa
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY

DT Review
DE Suicide; Prevention; National strategy; South Africa
AB Suicidal behaviour is an important public health problem globally and in Africa. A brief overview of the nature and severity of the problem is provided, but the primary aim of this paper is to identify priorities and prevention strategies for reducing suicidal behaviour in South Africa by discussing a framework for a proposed national prevention programme. South African suicide rates range from 11.5 per 100 000 to as high as 25 per 100 000 of the population, depending on sampling procedures and research methods. About 11% of all non-natural deaths are suicide related. On average 9.5% of non-natural deaths in young people are due to suicide. It is a complex phenomenon and risk factors are, therefore, multifactorial and multidimensional. Some of the most important ones are identified and several priorities and prevention possibilities for reducing suicidal behaviour are recommended. The outline and structure for such a national suicide prevention programme is underpinned by research undertaken locally and internationally. It requires a comprehensive multi-sectoral approach that involves both health care and non-health care sectors and action at various levels utilising a framework based on a set of guiding principles and a range of strategies with specific objectives as a national priority within an interdisciplinary context.

AB Self-immolation is an uncommon method of suicide, and its occurrence in South Africa is thus far unknown. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of self-immolation deaths and to establish a profile of these cases and the circumstances under which this condition occurs. A 5-year (1996-2000) retrospective review at a mortuary in Durban, South Africa, was conducted. Data were obtained from the Department of Forensic Medicine, the Medical Research Council's National Injury Mortality Surveillance System, and police and hospital records. During the study period, there were 12,339 nonnatural deaths, of which 696 (5.6%) were suicides. Self-immolation accounted for 69 (0.6%) of all nonnatural deaths and 69 (9.9%) of all suicides. The subjects had a mean age of 31.2 years and were predominantly female (76.8%) and black (81.2%). The mean burn surface area was 63.3%, and the mean injury severity score was 36.9. Accelerant use was documented in 53 (76.8%) of cases, and paraffin was preferred. All cases occurred indoors. The proportion of suicides due to self-immolation in our study is excessive when compared with -international studies that report figures between 0.9% and 2.2% of suicides. Additional studies are necessary to further elucidate the reasons for this discrepancy.

AB BackgroundPeople with substance use disorders (PWSUDs) are a clearly delineated group at high risk for suicidal behaviour. Expert consensus is that suicide prevention strategies should be culturally sensitive and specific to particular populations and socio-cultural and economic contexts. The aim of this study was to explore mental health care providers' context- and population-specific suggestions for suicide prevention when providing services for PWSUDs in the Western Cape, South Africa.MethodsQualitative data were collected via in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 18 mental health care providers providing services to PWSUDs in the public and private health care sectors of the Western Cape, South Africa. Data were analysed inductively using thematic analysis.ResultsParticipants highlighted the importance of providing effective mental health care, transforming the mental health care system, community interventions, and early intervention, in order to prevent suicide amongst PWSUDs. Many of their suggestions reflected basic principles of effective mental health care provision. However, participants also suggested further training in suicide prevention for mental health care providers, optimising the use of existing health care resources, expanding service provision for suicidal PWSUDs, improving policies and regulations for the treatment of substance use disorders, provision of integrated health care, and focusing on early intervention to prevent suicide.ConclusionsTraining mental health care providers in suicide prevention must be augmented by addressing systemic problems in the provision of mental health care and contextual problems that make suicide prevention challenging. Many of the suggestions offered by these participants depart from individualist, biomedical approaches to suicide prevention to include a more contextual view of suicide prevention. A re-thinking of traditional bio-medical approaches to suicide prevention may be warranted in order to reduce suicide among PWSUDs.

AB Background Suicide represents 1.8% of the global burden of disease, yet the prevalence and correlates of suicidal behavior in low income countries are unclear. This study examines the prevalence, age of onset and sociodemographic correlates of suicide ideation, planning, and attempts among South Africans. Method Nationally representative data are from the South Africa Stress and Health Study ( SASH), a national household probability sample of 4,351 South African respondents aged 18 years and older conducted between 2002 and 2003, using the World Health Organization version of the composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI). Bivariate and survival analyses were employed to delineate patterns and correlates of nonfatal suicidal behavior. Transitions are estimated using life table analysis. Risk factors are examined using survival analysis. Results The risk for attempted suicide is highest in the age group 18-34 and Coloureds had highest lifetime prevalence for attempts. Cumulative probabilities are 43% for the transition from ideation to a plan, 65% from a plan to an attempt, and 12% from ideation to an unplanned attempt. About 7.5% of unplanned and 50% of planned first attempts occur within 1 year of the onset of ideation. South Africans at higher risk for suicide attempts were younger, female, and less educated. Conclusions The burden of nonfatal suicidality in South Africa underscores the need for suicide prevention to be a national priority. Suicide prevention efforts should focus on planned attempts due to the rapid onset and unpredictability of unplanned attempts.

AB We explored the experiences of a racially mixed group of young men in post-apartheid South Africa to investigate how they conceptualised suicide and document their suggestions for suicide prevention. Data were collected via in-depth semi-structured interviews and analysed using thematic content analysis. Findings suggest that in spite of socio-political transformation, young men in South Africa may not feel liberated to deviate from traditional gender norms. Participants described restrictive heteronormative gender roles that are akin to hegemonic masculinity and that create a rigid gender regime that prevents authentic relating, disconnects young men from each other, and makes it difficult to receive emotional support. Participants attributed suicidal behaviour to feelings of disconnectedness, thwarted belonging, pressure to conform to the gender regime, and feelings of shame when unable to achieve masculine ideals. They suggested that suicide prevention should be aimed at fostering connectedness, relationship building, and disrupting the gender regime. Furthermore, they suggested that in cyberspace, the gender regime was less rigid and stated that they felt more liberated online to express distress and access support, which has implications for suicide prevention interventions.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate drug involvement (conceptualized as drug use frequency, drug access, drug use control, and adverse use consequences) in a sample of 1157 secondary school students at low and at high risk of suicide who completed a self-administered questionnaire in three schools in Cape Town, South Africa. Drug use frequency, access, control and consequences were compared among 366 students who scored at high risk of suicide on the Suicide Risk Screen (SRS) and 791 who score in the low risk range. Students at high rather than low risk of suicide endorsed a much greater breadth and depth of drug use, less drug use control, and greater adverse consequences due to drug use. Findings have implications for prevention programs, especially for students at risk of suicide.

AB Objective: This study explored mental health care providers' experiences of preventing suicide in people with substance use disorders and their perceptions of factors related to clinical practice that contributed to these experiences. Methods: In-depth, semistructured interviews were conducted with 18 mental health care providers working in South Africa. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data inductively with Atlas.ti software. Results: Participants described feeling hopeless, helpless, powerless and guilty and needed to debrief from their experiences of preventing suicide. They perceived their experiences to be related to the difficulties of treating substance use disorders, the difficulties of assessing and managing suicide risk and how treating substance use might increase suicide risk. Conclusions: The ways in which mental health care providers think about suicide and make sense of their experiences affects their perceived abilities to prevent suicide. Educating mental health care providers to transcend the limitations of risk factor approaches to suicide prevention and utilise evidence-based strategies for treating substance use disorders and associated problems, may be important to empower them and make them feel competent in suicide prevention. Empowering people with substance use disorders may help prevent suicide and may require collaboration between mental health care providers and allied professionals.

AB Background: Research on suicide attempts during pregnancy is limited as these are considered to be rare in the perinatal period.
   Aim: A retrospective pilot study was undertaken to establish what percentage of suicide attempters admitted to a hospital were pregnant and to identify their clinical and sociodemographic characteristics.
   Setting: The study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Durban, South Africa. Methods: A retrospective chart review was undertaken of all female patients admitted following suicide attempts over a period of 1 year. Clinical and sociodemographic data of pregnant suicide attempters were extracted.
   Results: Of 27 charts reviewed, 33% (n = 9) patients were pregnant at the time of the attempt. V Code diagnoses predominated, followed by major depressive disorder. Past psychiatric diagnoses and suicide attempts were also present
   Conclusion: Suicide attempts during pregnancy are not rare. Pregnant women should be routinely screened for prior suicide attempts, depression and stressors as part of perinatal assessments.

AB Background: Substance use is a well-established, and potentially modifiable, risk factor for suicide. Suicide prevention interventions are typically framed within the biomedical paradigm and focus on addressing individual risk factors, improving access to psychiatric care, and improving the skills of medical personnel to recognise at-risk individuals. Few studies have focused on contextual factors that hinder suicide prevention in people with substance use disorders, particularly in low-resource settings. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore mental health care providers' perceptions of barriers to suicide prevention in people with substance use disorders in South Africa.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 mental health care providers who worked with suicidal people with substance use disorders in Cape Town, South Africa. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and Atlas. ti software was used to code the data inductively.
   Results: Two superordinate themes were identified: structural issues in service provision and broad contextual issues that pose barriers to suicide prevention. Participants thought that inadequate resources and insufficient training hindered them from preventing suicide. Fragmented service provision was perceived to lead to patients not receiving the psychiatric, psychological, and social care that they needed. Contextual problems such as poverty and inequality, the breakdown of family, and stigma made participants think that preventing suicide in people with substance use disorders was almost impossible.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that structural, social, and economic issues serve as barriers to suicide prevention. This challenges individual risk-factor models of suicide prevention and highlights the need to consider a broad range of contextual and socio-cultural factors when planning suicide prevention interventions. Findings suggest that the responsibility for suicide prevention may need to be distributed between multiple stakeholders, necessitating intersectoral collaboration, more integrated health services, cautious use of task shifting, and addressing contextual factors in order to effectively prevent suicide in people with substance use disorders.

AB People who attend hospital following a suicide attempt represent a well-delineated high-risk group of patients who may be amenable to targeted interventions to reduce the risk of suicidal behaviour. Little is, however, known about how hospitals in South Africa respond to suicide attempters, what quality of care these patients receive or what possibilities exist for hospital-based suicide prevention interventions. We describe an ethnographic study conducted at a large hospital in South Africa to investigate the impact of current procedures and practices on the care received by those who attempt suicide. Findings suggest that the organisation of care within the hospital is a significant barrier to patients receiving optimal care and represents a lost opportunity for suicide prevention. Findings highlight the mismatch between the needs of suicide attempters and current services and call attention to the need for greater psychological input as well as hospital-based suicide prevention interventions that can be offered to patients without necessitating admissions.

AB Although young men are considered to be at particular risk of completing suicide in South Africa, very little is known about the reasons for this, or the way in which young men understand their own suicidal behaviour. In this study we set out to explore and describe the subjective experiences of four young South African men who had previously attempted suicide. Interviews were conducted and transcripts were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Participants' accounts of suicidal behaviour revealed a struggle for relatedness and autonomy. Two major themes were identified: (1) 'Turning away from others and self', which describes how participants disconnect from close others and from self, prior to attempting suicide as an act of autonomy; and (2) 'Returning to self and others', which describes the process of healing and recovery from being suicidal through re-connecting with others and gaining a healthy sense of autonomy. The findings are discussed using the framework of autonomy-relatedness proposed by Kagitcibasi.

TI Suicide and related health risk behaviours among school learners in

SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID PREVENTION DAY; IDEATION; ADOLESCENTS; STUDENTS; ASSOCIATIONS
AB Background: Attempted and completed suicide constitute a major public health problem among young people world-wide, including South Africa (SA). Suicide attempt and completed suicide increase during the adolescent period. One in 5 adolescents considers attempting suicide, but statistics are frequently unreliable.
   Methods: Data for this study were derived from the 2002 and 2008 South African Youth Risk Behaviour Surveys (YRBS). The study population comprised grades 8, 9, 10 and 11 students in governmental schools in the nine provinces of SA (N = 10,699 in 2002 and 10,270 in 2008). Key outcome measures were suicide ideation and suicide attempts.
   Results: Of the total sample, 18% of the students in 2002 and 19% in 2008 reported to have seriously considered and/or made a plan to commit suicide during the past six months (Suicide ideation), whereas 18.5% of students in 2002 and 21.8% in 2008 reported that they had attempted suicide at least 1 time during the past six months. On both suicide measures girls have higher prevalence scores than boys, and older school learners score higher than younger learners. In addition, 32% of the learners reported feelings of sadness or hopelessness. These feelings contributed significantly to the explanation of suicide ideation and suicide attempt next to being the victim or actor in violent acts and illegal substance use.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of suicide ideation and suicide attempts among South African adolescents is high and seems to be influenced by a wide spectrum of factors at the demographic, psychological and behavioural level. Hence, more research is needed to determine the behavioural and psychological determinants of suicide among youngsters in order to develop comprehensive intervention strategies for suicide prevention and care.

AB To describe the epidemiology of suicide by hanging, in Transkei region of South Africa. This is a record review of the autopsy register from 1993 to 2003. There is an increasing trend of hangings from 5.2 per 100,000 to 16.2 in 2003. The highest was in the 20- to 29-year age group. The least number of hangings of 2.2 per 100,000 was in those over 70 years of age. Males (86.4%) outnumber females. The ratio of male to female suicide is 6.4:1. The 2 youngest suicide victims were also males aged 9 years. Peak of these hangings is in May and November and least in September. There is increasing trend of banging especially among young adults between 20 and 29 years old.

AB The objective of this study is to determine whether suicide ideation among uniformed police officers of the South African Police Service could be predicted on the basis of occupational stress, personality traits, and coping strategies. Using a cross-sectional survey design, the Adult Suicide Ideation Questionnaire, the Police Stress Inventory, the Personality Characteristics Inventory, and the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced are administered to a stratified random sample of 1,794 police employees from eight South African provinces. A logistic regression analysis shows that low scores on conscientiousness, emotional stability, approach coping, and turning to religion as well as high scores on avoidance coping are associated with more suicide ideation.

AB Little information exists regarding the suicide ideation of uniformed members of the South African Police Service (SAPS). The objectives of this study were to determine the level of suicide ideation of police members and to determine the differences between the suicide ideation of various demographic groups. A cross-sectional survey design was used. Stratified random samples (N = 1781) were taken of police members of eight provinces in South Africa. The Adult Suicide Ideation Questionnaire and a biographical questionnaire were administered. The results indicated that 8.30% of the sample showed a high level of suicide ideation. Multiway frequency analyses showed that the observed frequencies of high suicide ideation (compared with low suicide ideation), statistically, were significantly higher than the expected frequencies in groups based on race, rank, gender, province, alcohol consumption, educational qualifications, medical problems and previous suicide attempts.

TI Intimate femicide-suicide in South Africa: a cross-sectional study
SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID MURDER-SUICIDE; HOMICIDE
AB Objective To examine the incidence and patterns of intimate femicide-suicide in South Africa and to describe the factors associated with an increase in the risk of suicide after intimate femicide (i.e. the killing of an intimate female partner).
   Methods A cross-sectional retrospective national mortuary-based study was conducted at a proportionate random sample of 25 legal laboratories to identify all homicides committed in 1999 of women aged over 13 years. Data were collected from the mortuary file, autopsy report and a police interview.
   Findings Among 1349 perpetrators of intimate femicide, 19.4% committed suicide within a week of the murder, Suicide after intimate femicide was more likely if the perpetrator was from a white rather than an African racial background (odds ratio, OR: 5.8; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.21-27.84); was employed as a professional or white-collar worker rather than a blue-collar worker (OR: 37.28; 95% CI: 5.82-238.93); and owned a legal gun rather than not owning a legal gun (OR: 45.26; 95% CI: 8.33-245.8). The attributable fraction shows that 91.5% of the deaths of legal gun-owning perpetrators and their victims may have been averted if this group of perpetrators did not own a legal gun.
   Conclusion South Africa has a rate of intimate femicide-suicide that exceeds reported rates for other countries. This study highlights the public health impact of legal gun ownership in cases of intimate femicide-suicide.

AB Background: There is relatively little data on the relationship between lifetime mental disorders and suicidal behaviour in low and middle income countries. This study examines the relationship between lifetime mental disorders, and subsequent suicide ideation, plans, and suicide attempts in South Africa. Method: A national survey of 4185 South African adults was conducted using the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) to generate psychiatric diagnoses and suicidal behaviour. Bivariate, multivariate and discrete-time survival analyses were employed to investigate the associations between mental disorders and subsequent suicide ideation, plans, and attempts. Results: Sixty-one percent of people who seriously considered killing themselves at some point in their lifetime reported having a prior DSM-IV disorder. Mental disorders predict the onset of suicidal ideation, but have weaker effects in predicting suicide plans or attempts. After controlling for comorbid mental disorders, PTSD was the strongest predictor of suicidal ideation and attempts. There is a relationship between number of mental disorders and suicidal behaviour, with comorbidity having significantly sub-additive effects. Conclusion: Consistent with data from the developed world, mental disorders are strong predictors of suicidal behaviour, and these associations are more often explained by the prediction of ideation, rather than the prediction of attempts amongst ideators. This suggests some universality of the relevant mechanisms underlying the genesis of suicidal thoughts, and the progression to suicide attempts.

ID MORTALITY DATA; HOMICIDE; RATES
AB This study describes the sociodemographic distribution of suicide deaths compared with other injury deaths in South Africa. Cross-sectional data for 26,354 cases were extracted from an injury surveillance database. These included all manners of injury death from 10 mortuaries for 1999-2000 (approximately 18-20% coverage of all injury deaths per year). They were used to examine the distribution of suicide across different sex, race and age groupings, and the relative involvement of alcohol, across manners of death.
   The share of suicide as a cause of death was comparable for mates and females, but varied considerably across races and age groups. It was twice as high for Whites as for Asians, and four times as high as for Coloureds and Blacks. For all races except Whites, suicides were concentrated in the younger age groups. Only among Whites was the proportion of alcohol-positive suicides higher or comparable with that for other manners of death.
   While homicides and unintentional injury deaths outnumbered suicides overall, the relative importance of suicide in some social groups is reason for concern. South Africa is a country undergoing profound transformations, and differences in the distribution of suicide across sociodemographic groups deserve attention.

AB Mental health is an integral part of health and it includes an individual's emotional, psychological and social well-being. However, mental health disorders remain underreported and underdiagnosed, particularly in low-and medium-income countries, including South Africa. South Africa carries a huge burden of mental illnesses with the most prevalent being depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse disorders and mood disorders. People with mental health conditions often face neglect in the healthcare system as well as stigma and discrimination. This has resulted in poor health outcomes, isolation and high suicide rates. In 2013, the South African government adopted the National Mental Health Policy Framework and Strategic Plan in an effort to integrate mental health into its health system and to reduce the mental health treatment gap and burden. This review aims to describe the prevalence, consequences and management of mental health disorders in South Africa, the incidental consequences of mental disorders, as well as the role of pharmacists in mental health.

AB Background: Suicidal ideation and attempted suicide are a huge problem in South Africa, especially in the rural areas. Previous research has emphasized the importance of the ability of school professionals to identify young people who are at risk of committing suicide. The objectives of this study were to assess the knowledge of teachers with regard to identifying the warning signs of suicidal behaviour, assessing the type of information they give to students in the class after a suicide of one of their class mates, and assessing their views and training needs on the prevention of suicidal behaviour in students.
   Methods: Five focus group discussions were conducted with 50 high school teachers in Limpopo Province, South Africa. All focus group discussions were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim, and then analysed using an inductive approach.
   Results: The results demonstrate that teachers lack knowledge of the warning signs of suicidal behaviour among students. They also report that they do not know how to support students in the event of attempted or completed suicide of another student. The school curriculum is perceived as lacking information on suicide and suicidal behaviour.
   Conclusions: Teachers in Limpopo Province need to be trained to identify students at risk, and to respond to situations by referring individuals at risk to appropriate mental health professionals. School-based suicide prevention programmes that are based on theory and evidence should be developed. These programmes should include teacher training to help teachers to identify symptoms of psychosocial problems that might lead to suicide, develop their skills in handling such problems, and help students to cope with their emotions after a suicide incident in the class or at school.

Results indicated that using the Suicide Risk Screen (SRS; Eggert, Herting, & Thompson, 1995) a high rate of learners screened in at possible suicide risk (31.6%). Anger control problems, low self-esteem, perceived stress and unmet school goals were identified as predictors for suicide risk, while gender, age, drug involvement (alcohol and drug use, drug control problems and adverse consequences from alcohol and drug abuse), parental alcohol and/or drug abuse problems, perceived school performance, serious conflicts and tension with parents and unmet family goals were not associated with suicide risk.

ID INTERPERSONAL-PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY
AB Proponents of the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide have theorized that an acquired capability for suicide is a key construct in the development of high-risk suicidal behavior. However, extant measures do not adequately capture the content domains of this construct. Using 239 psychiatric outpatients recruited from public and private psychiatry and psychology sites, we validated a measure of acquired capability derived from extant measures, the Death Inurement Scale (DIS) in the South African context. The results suggest that the DIS explains additional variance in suicide risk above the measures previously used and provide support for its incremental validity.

ID MURDER-SUICIDE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; JEALOUSY
AB Homicide committed by a person who subsequently commits suicide within one week of the homicide is a relatively rare event. The current study used an explanatory sequential design, including psychological autopsies, to identify psychiatric and other contributing factors in 35 homicide-suicide cases in northern Gauteng Province, South Africa. This research highlighted the complex multifactorial nature of these events. Identification of high-risk individuals and delineation of contributing factors is important. Early recognition and effective treatment of psychiatric illness, particularly depression and substance use problems, in people experiencing relationship issues (with pending/recent separations) and financial stressors, is an essential component in the prevention of homicide-suicide incidents. Evaluations should always include direct questioning about suicidal and homicidal ideations. Mental health practitioners have a definite role to play in offering comfort, support, and treatment to all those who remain behind after these devastating events. Urgent attention needs to be given to the availability of support and treatment for investigating police officers and surviving family and friends.

AB Although it is not a legal requirement in South Africa, medical practitioners determine the manner of injury death for a surveillance system that is currently the only source of epidemiological data on suicide. This study assessed the accuracy of suicide data as recorded in the system using the docket produced from standard medico-legal investigation procedures as the gold standard. It was conducted in one of three cities where the surveillance system had full coverage for the year 2000. In the medico-legal system, one-third of cases could not be tracked, had not been finalized, or had unclear outcomes. For the remaining cases, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were generally high, varying somewhat across sex and race groups. Poisoning, jumping, and railway suicides were more likely than other methods to be misclassified, and were more common among females and Whites. The study provides encouraging results regarding the use of medical practitioner expertise for the accurate determination of suicide deaths. However, suicides may still be underestimated in this process given the challenge of tracing disguised suicides and without the careful examination of potential misclassifications of true suicides as unintentional deaths.

DT Review
ID SOUTH-AFRICA; HOMICIDE; VICTIMS; BLOOD
AB Background. The World Health Organization has declared suicide a global health crisis, predicting that similar to 1.53 million people will commit suicide annually by 2020.
   Objective. A study from South Africa reviewed 1 018 suicide cases in Pretoria over 4 years (1997 - 2000). Our study was undertaken to establish whether there have been substantial changes in the profile of suicide victims who died in Pretoria a decade later.
   Methods. Case records at the Pretoria Medico-Legal Laboratory were reviewed retrospectively from 2007 to 2010.
   Results. A total of 957 suicide cases were identified. Hanging was the most common method of suicide, followed by self-inflicted firearm injury. The true incidence of suicidal intake of prescription drugs/medication was difficult to determine, because of a backlog at the state toxicology laboratories. White males and females appeared to be over-represented among suicide victims, but there has been an increase in suicide among blacks. There seems to have been a substantial decrease in the use of firearms to commit suicide - possibly reflecting a positive outcome of gun control legislation that has been introduced in the interim.
   Conclusion. Suicide continues to constitute almost 10% of all fatalities admitted to the Pretoria Medico-Legal Laboratory, confirming suicide as a major cause of mortality in our society. Further research is needed to clarify the profile of suicidal deaths, with a view to informing resource allocation and to improve preventive strategies.

TI Suicide by burning in the South Asian origin population in England and
   Wales a secondary analysis of a national data set
SO BMJ OPEN
LA English
DT Article
AB Objectives: A descriptive analysis of suicide by burning in England and Wales in the general population and in people of South Asian origin.
   Design: A cross-sectional secondary analysis of a national data set.
   Setting: A population study of all those who died by suicide in England and Wales between 1993 and 2003 inclusive.
   Participants: All cases of suicide and undetermined intent identified by the Office for National Statistics for England and Wales. A computer algorithm was used to identify people of the South Asian origin from their names. There were 55 140 suicides in the UK between 1993 and 2003. The ratio of male to female suicides was 3:1. There were 1455 South Asian suicides identified by South Asian Name and Group Recognition Algorithm.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures: Death by suicide and undetermined intent, as determined by Coroner's Inquest. ICD9 codes E958.1 and E988.1 and ICD10 codes X76 and Y26.
   Results: 1.77% of suicides in the general population and 8.45% of suicides in the South Asian origin population were by burning. The suicide rate by burning was 0.8/100 000 person-years for England and Wales and 2.9/100 000 person-years for the South Asian origin population. The odds of suicide by burning were increased in the South Asian group as a whole (OR 3.06, 95% CI 2.30 to 4.08). Those born in Asia and Africa were at higher risk than those born in the UK (OR 2.69, 95% CI 2.01 to 3.60 and OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.46 to 3.01, respectively). The increased risk was for those aged 25-64 years.
   Conclusion: Suicide by burning remains a significant issue in the South Asian origin working-age population in England and Wales. A prevention strategy could target working-age people of South Asian origin born abroad as they are at the highest risk. More in depth research on the reasons for using this method may help to identify possible prevention strategies.

ID ADOLESCENTS
AB The aim of this study was to investigate social support including daily activities in a sample of secondary school students at low and high risk for Suicide in Cape Town, South Africa. The sample included 1,157 students (Grade 9, 28.2%, Grade 10, 43.3%, and Grade 11, 28.4%); 30.9% were boys and 69.1%, were girls, M age = 15.8 yr. (SD-1.6). The racial background was mainly Coloured (from mixed descent) (84.6%) with a minority of African Black (10.5%), White, (2.1%), and Indian/Asian (1.8%). Bivariate analyses showed Low Risk more than High Suicide Risk students reported significantly more teacher support, peer support, parental support, and personal control. Stepwise logistic regression indicated for boys none of the four social support variables and personal control associated with suicide risk, while for girls lack of peer and parental Support were associated with high suicide risk. Among eight different activities, only for girls was lack of social activities associated with high suicide risk. Interventions influencing the posited mediating variables, i.e., social support resources and personal life skills competences, should be enhanced.

   CRIME
AB Background. Incidence rates of crime and alcohol abuse in South Africa are unacceptably high. Research suggests a relationship between alcohol and both crime and suicide. This study aims to add to the information base on this topic in South Africa.
   Methods. This is a cross-sectional record study of criminal offences and suicide attempts in 269 admissions to an alcohol-rehabilitation unit in-the Western Cape. Types of criminal offences and suicide attempts are described. Relationships are sought between crime, violent crime and suicide attempts on the one hand, and demographic and alcohol-related variables on the Other.
   Results. One hundred and four subjects (39%) had criminal convictions, the majority of which were committed while 'the subjects were intoxicated. The commonest alcohol related crimes were driving-related (17% of subjects)and crimes of violence (15%). Male gender, younger age at initiation of drinking, and earlier onset of problem drinking were significantly associated with criminal behaviour. Violent crime was associated with earlier onset of initial, regular:and problem drinking, and maternal alcohol abuse. suicide attempts (24% of subjects) were associated with female gender, white racial group,not being in a marital relationship,younger current age and early age of problem drinking.
   Conclusions. There was an association between intoxication and both violent crime and suicide attempts. The importance of population studies and the need for intervention programmes aimed at teenagers who are drinking, are emphasised.

AB Purpose The aim of this study was to assess the association between depressive symptoms and suicidal risk over time among perinatal women at risk for depression antenatally, and assess modifying effects of age, perinatal stage and depressive symptom trajectory.
   Methods A total of 384 adult pregnant women were recruited from two antenatal clinics in an informal settlement near Cape Town, South Africa, and followed up at eight months gestation, and at 3- and 12-month postpartum. The MINI 6.0 Suicidality module and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) were used to measure suicidal risk and depression, respectively. Generalised Estimating Equations were used to assess the association between change in depressive symptoms from one assessment to the next (predictor) and change in suicide score or change in suicidal risk (score >= 9) (outcomes).
   Results HDRS scores were positively correlated with suicide score (95% CI 0.35, 0.78; p<0.001), and with odds of being at moderate risk for suicide, after controlling for risk of suicide at the previous assessment (adjusted odds ratio=1.15; 95% CI 1.09, 1.22; p<0.001). Age was a significant effect modifier: change in HDRS scores was not associated with change in suicide scores among participants aged 35-45 years. Secondary analyses indicated that a decrease in HDRS score was associated with a decrease in suicide scores, but an increase in HDRS score was not associated with change in suicide score.
   Conclusions Depression and suicide are overlapping but relatively independent phenomena, especially among older or more chronically depressed perinatal women.

AB Background: Suicide is a major cause of premature mortality worldwide, but data on its epidemiology in Africa, the world's second most populous continent, are limited.
   Methods: We systematically reviewed published literature on suicidal behaviour in African countries. We searched PubMed, Web of Knowledge, PsycINFO, African Index Medicus, Eastern Mediterranean Index Medicus and African Journals OnLine and carried out citation searches of key articles. We crudely estimated the incidence of suicide and suicide attempts in Africa based on country-specific data and compared these with published estimates. We also describe common features of suicide and suicide attempts across the studies, including information related to age, sex, methods used and risk factors.
   Results: Regional or national suicide incidence data were available for less than one third (16/53) of African countries containing approximately 60% of Africa's population; suicide attempt data were available for < 20% of countries (7/53). Crude estimates suggest there are over 34,000 (inter-quartile range 13,141 to 63,757) suicides per year in Africa, with an overall incidence rate of 3.2 per 100,000 population. The recent Global Burden of Disease (GBD) estimate of 49,558 deaths is somewhat higher, but falls within the inter-quartile range of our estimate. Suicide rates in men are typically at least three times higher than in women. The most frequently used methods of suicide are hanging and pesticide poisoning. Reported risk factors are similar for suicide and suicide attempts and include interpersonal difficulties, mental and physical health problems, socioeconomic problems and drug and alcohol use/abuse. Qualitative studies are needed to identify additional culturally relevant risk factors and to understand how risk factors may be connected to suicidal behaviour in different socio-cultural contexts.
   Conclusions: Our estimate is somewhat lower than GBD, but still clearly indicates suicidal behaviour is an important public health problem in Africa. More regional studies, in both urban and rural areas, are needed to more accurately estimate the burden of suicidal behaviour across the continent. Qualitative studies are required in addition to quantitative studies.

AB The cultural turn in critical suicidology notes the limitations of dominant acontextual, biomedical, quantitative approaches to suicide prevention. Qualitative methods are idealized within this cultural turn as the only way to advance suicidology. Qualitative methods, however, also have limitations. Drawing on our research with traditional healers in South Africa, the authors explore tensions associated with making truth claims based on qualitative research. Turning the critical gaze on their work, they consider the question of what we can claim to know about suicide prevention when investigating culture using qualitative methods. The authors suggest a circumspect approach to making truth claims about what the cultural turn can achieve.

AB Research conducted predominantly in the developed world suggests that there is an association between trauma exposure and suicidal behavior. However, there are limited data available investigating whether specific traumas are uniquely predictive of suicidal behavior or the extent to which traumatic events predict the progression from suicide ideation to plans and attempts. A national survey was conducted with 4351 adult South Africans between 2002 and 2004 as part of the World Health Organization World Mental Health Surveys. Data on trauma exposure and subsequent suicidal behavior were collected. Bivariate and multivariate survival models tested the relationship between the type and number of traumatic events and lifetime suicidal behavior. A range of traumatic events are associated with lifetime suicide ideation and attempt; however, after controlling for all traumatic events in a multivariate model, only sexual violence (odds ratio - 4.7; confidence interval, 2.3 to 9.4) and having witnessed violence (odds ratio = 1.8; confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.9) remained significant predictors of lifetime suicide attempts. The disaggregation of the associations between traumatic events and suicide attempts indicates that they are largely caused by traumatic events predicting suicide ideation rather than by the progression from suicide ideation to attempt. This article highlights the importance of traumatic life events in the occurrence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors and provides important information about the nature of this association. Future research is needed to better understand how and why such experiences increase the risk of suicidal outcomes.

TI Suicidal ideation and behaviour among persons seeking HIV testing in

AB Suicidal ideation and behaviour (SIB) are among the psychiatric sequela of HIV/AIDS. Few studies have however examined the prevalence and correlates of SIB among persons seeking HIV testing. We set out to document the prevalence and correlates of SIB among people seeking HIV testing in peri-urban areas of Cape Town, South Africa (SA). A cross-sectional research design was used to recruit a sample (n=500) of individuals seeking HIV testing. Self-report measures were used to assess two-week prevalence of SIB as well as life-time prevalence of suicide attempt. A structured clinical interview was used to assess common mental disorders (CMDs). Regression analysis was used to determine if CMD and socio-demographic variables predicted suicidal ideation. The mean age of the sample was 36 years, 51.6% were female and 46.6% were unemployed. The two-week prevalence of suicidal ideation was 24.27% while the two-week prevalence of suicide attempt and suicide plans was 2.8%. Suicidal ideation was not associated with age, gender, employment status, family income or household food insecurity. CMDs were significantly associated with suicidal ideation; individuals with depressive disorders were approximately 5.5 times more likely to report suicidal ideation, while those with generalised anxiety disorder, trauma-related disorders and alcohol use disorder were approximately 7, 4.7 and 2.8 times more likely to report suicidal ideation, respectively. Results suggest that persons seeking HIV testing may be a well-delineated group of persons at risk of suicide in this region of SA. Contact with the health care system during HIV testing provides an opportunity for targeted suicide prevention interventions in what appears to be a high risk group.

AB Supplemental data for this article can be accessed on the publisher's website. We used a cross-sectional web-based survey and discrete-time survival analysis with person-year as unit of analysis and retrospective age-of-onset reports to estimate prevalence and predictors of suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt, and transitions from ideation to plan and attempt among South African university students (n = 1402). The lifetime prevalence of ideation, plan, and attempt were 46.4% (n = 650), 26.5% (n = 372), and 8.6% (n = 120), respectively. Multiple temporally primary mental disorders predicted subsequent onset of suicidality and transitions from ideation to plan and attempt. Results highlight the need for campus-based suicide prevention in South Africa, vulnerability of historically disadvantaged students, and the importance of promoting mental health in suicide prevention.

AB Homicide-suicide represents one of the rarest forms of lethal violence but often precipitates calls to revise social, health, and justice policies. However, there is little empirical information about this type of violence. The current study uses two unique data sets to examine a wide range of individual and situational characteristics of homicide-suicide, with particular emphasis on establishing whether and how homicide-suicide differs from homicide-only and suicide-only. Findings suggest homicide-suicide may have unique characteristics that set it apart from both homicide-only and suicide-only, as well as sharing certain other characteristics with those two types of events.

AB Background & objectives: In spite of the high prevalence of tuberculosis worldwide, there are only a few studies on its psychiatric complications such as suicidal behaviour. We undertook this study to assess the prevalence of suicidal behaviour and its associated factors among tuberculosis patients in public primary care in South Africa.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional survey conducted in three provinces of South Africa new TB and new retreatment patients were assessed within one month of anti-tuberculosis treatment. The sample included 4900 (54.5% men and women 45.5%) consecutively selected tuberculosis patients from 42 public primary care clinics in three districts in South Africa.
   Results: A total of 322 patients (9.0%) reported suicidal ideation and 131 (3.1%) had a history of a suicide attempt. In multivariate analysis female gender [Odds Ratio (OR)=0.56, Confidence Interval (CI)=0.43-0.74], psychological distress (OR=2.36, CI=1.04-2.29), post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) (OR=4.98, CI=3.76-6.59), harmful alcohol use (OR=1.97, CI=1.25-3.09) and being a TB re-treatment patient (OR=1.76, CI=1.32-2.34) were associated with suicidal ideation, and psychological distress (OR=3.27, CI=1.51-7.10), PTSD symptoms (OR=4.48, CI=3.04-6.61) and harmful alcohol use (OR=3.01, CI=1.83-4.95) were associated with a suicide attempt.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Our findings suggest that co-morbid illnesses of psychological distress, PTSD and harmful alcohol use and HIV infection should be assessed in TB patients under TB control programmes to prevent suicidal behaviour. Clinicians should be aware about suicidality in tuberculosis patients to reduce mortality.

   CRISIS; TRENDS
AB Aims: This study investigates the importance of sociodemographic and geographical characteristics for suicide risks in the South African urban context. Suicide epidemiology is under-researched in low- and middle-income countries, and such knowledge is important not only for local and national policy, but also for a global understanding of the phenomenon. Methods: Sex-specific crude and adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for suicide by age, race, and city are assessed using logistic regression. Cases aged 45+ years, classified as "Coloured'' ( a category denoting mixed racial origin), and living in Cape Town are used as reference groups. Additionally, the proportion of leading suicide methods within groups was estimated ( 95% confidence intervals). Results: For males, compared with each reference group, the odds of suicide are significantly higher during middle adulthood, among Asians and particularly among Whites, and among residents of all but one city. Patterns for women differ in magnitude and distribution. Suicide odds are significantly higher in all age groups, particularly 15 - 24 years, among Whites, and among residents of all other cities, particularly Nelson Mandela or Buffalo City. Males living in Tshwane and Black females have lower odds of suicide. The distribution of methods across age, race, and city groups varies little for males but substantially for females. Conclusions: Age, race, and city play independent roles in sex-specific suicide rates. As for high-income settings, age, race, method and city are important in sex-specific suicide in the urban South African context. Possible underlying mechanisms deserve greater attention for context-relevant preventive efforts.

AB Suicide, assisted suicide and euthanasia are elusive and controversial issues worldwide. To discuss such issues from only one perspective may be limiting. Therefore, this paper was written by authors from various regions, each of whom has been asked to reflect on the issues. The countries/cultures are: Australia, China, Cuba, Ireland, India, Japan, Russia, South Africa, The Netherlands, North America (Turtle Island) and United States. Historically and today, suicide is viewed differently. Assisted suicide and euthanasia are equally seen from multifarious perspectives. Highlighting development in the Netherlands, Australia's Northern Territory and Japan (ie. the famous Yamanouchi Case), the review shows growing re-examination of the right to die. There appear, however, to be no uniform legal and ethical positions. Further debate and discussion globally is needed to avoid myopic perspectives.

ID RISK BEHAVIOR; ADOLESCENTS; PREVENTION; ASSOCIATIONS; FAMILY; CAPE
AB Background: Suicide is a major public health problem for adolescents in South Africa, and also affects those associated with them. Peers become more important during adolescence and can be a significant source of social support. Because peers may be the first to notice psychological problems among each other, the present study's objectives were to assess students' knowledge about suicide, perceived risk factors, signs of poor mental health in adolescents who committed suicide, students' awareness of available mental health care and resources, and beliefs about prevention.
   Methods: This qualitative study used focus group discussions to elicit the thoughts and feelings of high school students who had a peer who committed or attempted suicide. Peers and class mates of suicide attempters and suicide completers were identified with the help of a social worker and school management and were invited to participate. All focus group discussions were audio taped and analyzed. A total of 56 adolescents (13-19 years of age) from Limpopo schools in South Africa participated in six focus group discussions. The data were analyzed by NVivo version 8, using an inductive approach.
   Results: Participants reported to be affected by the suicide attempt or completed suicide. They felt guilty about their failure to identify and prevent the suicide and displayed little knowledge of warning signs for suicidal behaviour. They identified several risk factors for the suicide of their peers, such as poor relationship issues, teenage pregnancy, punishment, and attention seeking behaviour. Resources for students with mental health problems and survivors of suicide attempts were not perceived to be available at schools and elsewhere.
   Conclusion: School-based suicide prevention programs based on theory and evidence are necessary. Such interventions should also focus on detection of mental health problems by peers. Counseling services for students with mental health problems and suicide survivors should be available and made known to students at risk and peers.

TI Injury-related mortality in South Africa: a retrospective descriptive
   study of postmortem investigations
SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM; QUALITY; BURDEN
AB Objective To investigate injury-related mortality in South Africa using a nationally representative sample and compare the results with previous estimates.
   Methods We conducted a retrospective descriptive study of medico-legal postmortem investigation data from mortuaries using a multistage random sample, stratified by urban and non-urban areas and mortuary size. We calculated age-specific and age-standardized mortality rates for external causes of death.
   Findings Postmortem reports revealed 52 493 injury-related deaths in 2009 (95% confidence interval, CI: 46 930-58 057). Almost half (25 499) were intentionally inflicted. Age-standardized mortality rates per 100 000 population were as follows: all injuries: 109.0 (95% CI: 97.1-121.0); homicide 38.4 (95% CI: 33.8-43.0; suicide 13.4 (95% CI: 11.6-15.2) and road-traffic injury 36.1 (95% CI: 30.9-41.3). Using postmortem reports, we found more than three times as many deaths from homicide and road-traffic injury than had been recorded by vital registration for this period. The homicide rate was similar to the estimate for South Africa from a global analysis, but road-traffic and suicide rates were almost fourfold higher.
   Conclusion This is the first nationally representative sample of injury-related mortality in South Africa. It provides more accurate estimates and cause-specific profiles that are not available from other sources.

   RELIABILITY; PATHWAYS
AB Background: Prior studies have demonstrated a link between parental psychopathology and offspring suicidal behavior. However, it remains unclear what aspects of suicidal behavior among adult offspring are predicted by specific parental mental disorders, especially in Africa. This study set out to investigate the association between parental psychopathology and suicidal behavior among their adult offspring in a South African general population sample.
   Method: Parental psychopathology and suicidal behavior in offspring were assessed using structured interviews among 4,315 respondents from across South Africa. The WHO CIDI was used to collect data on suicidal behavior, while the Family History Research Diagnostic Criteria Interview was used to assess prior parental psychopathology. Bivariate and multivariate survival models tested the associations between the type and number parental mental disorders (including suicide) and lifetime suicidal behavior in the offspring. Associations between a range of parental disorders and the onset of subsequent suicidal behavior (suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts) among adult offspring were tested.
   Results: The presence of parental psychopathology significantly increased the odds of suicidal behavior among their adult offspring. More specifically, parental panic disorder was associated with offspring suicidal ideation, while parental panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and suicide were significantly associated with offspring suicide attempts. Among those with suicidal ideation, none of the tested forms of parental psychopathology was associated with having suicide plans or attempts. There was a dose-response relationship between the number of parental disorders and odds of suicidal ideation.
   Conclusions: Parental psychopathology increases the odds of suicidal behavior among their adult offspring in the South African context, replicating results found in other regions. Specific parental disorders predicted the onset and persistence of suicidal ideation or attempts in their offspring. Further research into these associations is recommended in order to determine the mechanisms through which parent psychopathology increases the odds of suicidal behavior among offspring.

AB Poor mental healthinadolescentshas shown associations with engagement in other risk behaviours. However, evidence of this association in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly South Africa, is lacking.This study examinesthe associations between pertinent risk behaviours and feelings of sadness or hopelessness amongst a nationally representative sample of South African school going adolescents. Data was analysed from the South African Youth Risk Behaviour Survey 2011 (n=10,997), a cross-sectional nationalsurvey among grades 8-11 school learners. Logistic regression examined the association of demographic, substance use, violent behaviour, sexual activity and suicidal plans and attempts with the primary outcome, feelings of sadness or hopelessness. Having feelings of sadness or hopelessness was significantly associated with more senior grades, being bullied (AOR:1.67, 95% CI: 1.42-1.96), being assaulted by a partner (1.33 [1.05-1.68]), forced sex (1.78 [1.37-2.32]); gang membership (1.32 [1.06-1.65]), binge drinking (1.37 [1.14-1.65]), ever having sex (1.23 [1.02-1.47]), having 1 partner/s in preceding three months (1.25 [1.02-1.53]), having made a plan to attempt suicide (2.50 [1.95-3.21]) and suicide attempt (1.49 [1.21-1.85]). Adolescents in South Africa are experiencing a multiple burden of risk. Health promotion strategies targeting adolescentmental health and risk behaviours need to be developed and implemented in a timely and comprehensive manner.

The incidence of pesticide poisoning, which is high in developing countries, has doubled over the past 10 years. Aluminium phosphide is a deadly fumigant pesticide. A 21-year-old man committed suicide by ingesting aluminium phosphide, which he had available in his home. He had been charged with rape, and was to appear in court. Soon after ingestion, he told his grandmother about the suicide attempt. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was dead within an hour of arriving. The mechanism of action, symptoms and signs will be discussed in this report. The purpose of this case report is to highlight the problem of aluminium phosphide poisoning in the Transkei region of South Africa.

AB Ingestion of pesticides is the most common suicide method worldwide, accounting for one third of all suicides, predominantly in Asia, Africa, Central and South America. Case fatalities are high, particularly in rural areas. This high case fatality may explain the similar numbers of male and female suicides in Asia, since more women die from their attempts. In Asia, pesticide suicides are mostly impulsive acts with little advance planning and they are less often associated with mental illness than in Western countries. Pesticides are generally chosen for their easy access. Prevention strategies include treating the problems leading to suicidal behaviors involving pesticides; changing attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs about pesticides; controlling access to dangerous pesticides, including developing secure storage practices (which are currently being evaluated); and improving the medical treatment of poisonings. More research is needed to better understand suicides involving pesticides in their cultural contexts and to evaluate the effectiveness of intervention programs, including assessment of possible substitution of methods. Also, more knowledge about protective factors may help suggest innovative prevention strategies.

ID ADOLESCENT; PARASUICIDE; BEHAVIOR; YOUTH
AB Objective: To investigate the attitudes towards suicide among Grade II secondary school pupils among three cultural groups in South Africa.
   Design: Cross sectional study.
   Setting: Grade II Secondary school pupils chosen at random from three urban schools in Pietersburg.
   Participants: The sample included 366 pupils, 150 (41%) males and 216 (59%) females, the mean age was 19.3 years (SD = 2.6), with a range from 17 to 24 years. The three cultural groups were 142 blacks, 112 whites and 112 Asians.
   Main outcome Measures: Socioeconomic and family background (14 items), suicide data (4 items), and a 30-item Multi-Attitude Suicide Tendency Scale for Adolescents (MAST-12),
   Results: Suicide ideation and plans to commit suicide are the highest among Asians, closely followed by Whites and lowest among Black pupils. The frequency of attempted suicide was lower among Blacks (11.3%) than that among Asians (13.5%) and Whites (13%). Analysis of variance indicated a significantly higher score among suicide attempters on attraction to death and repulsion by life and a significantly lower score on attraction to life and repulsion by death. Furthermore, this study found a significant correlation between total MAST, suicide ideation, suicide intent, history of completed suicide in family or friend, parents divorced, family size and suicide attempt.
   Conclusion: This study found differential effects across diverse ethnocultural adolescent groups for suicidal ideation, plants and attempts. This gives indications on how suicide prevention programmes can be constructed in culture-congenial ways.

AB This qualitative study explored and described the psychosocial needs of parents of adolescents who had recently attempted suicide. Ten purposively selected parents (females = 10; age range 29 to 59) participated in semi-structured individual interviews on their lived experiences after their child attempted suicide. Thematic analysis of the data revealed the parents' psychological needs after the attempted suicide by their minor child to be characterised by emotional turmoil including feelings of regret, self-blame, guilt, fear, and anxiety. The parents' social needs included resources for rebuilding their disturbed family relationships and coping mechanisms. Mental healthcare providers to parents of adolescents who survive suicide attempts should aim to help parents manage the complex feelings they experience and improve their self-awareness and parenting skills to prevent future adolescent suicide attempts.

TI Suicide and Ambient Temperature: A Multi-Country Multi-City Study
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
LA English
DT Article
ID SOUTH-AFRICA; MORTALITY; SEASONALITY; RATES; ASSOCIATION; ENGLAND
AB BACKGROUND: Previous literature suggests that higher ambient temperature may play a role in increasing the risk of suicide. However, no multicountry study has explored the shape of the association and the role of moderate and extreme heat across different locations.
   OBJECTIVES: We examined the short-term temperature suicide relationship using daily time-series data collected for 341 locations in 12 countries for periods ranging from 4 to 40 y.
   METHODS: We conducted a two-stage meta-analysis. First, we performed location-specific time-stratified case-crossover analyses to examine the temperature suicide association for each location. Then, we used a multivariate meta-regression to combine the location-specific lag-cumulative nonlinear associations across all locations and by country.
   RESULTS: A total of 1,320,148 suicides were included in this study. Higher ambient temperature was associated with an increased risk of suicide in general, and we observed a nonlinear association (inverted J-shaped curve) with the highest risk at 27 degrees C. The relative risk (RR) for the highest risk was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.30, 1.36) compared with the risk at the first percentile. Country-specific results showed that the nonlinear associations were more obvious in northeast Asia (Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan). The temperature with the highest risk of suicide ranged from the 87th to 88th percentiles in the northeast Asian countries, whereas this value was the 99th percentile in Western countries (Canada, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the United Slates) and South Africa, where nearly linear associations were estimated. The country-specific RRs ranged from 1.31 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.44) in the United States to 1.65 (95% CI: 1.40, 1.93) in Taiwan, excluding countries where the results were substantially uncertain.
   DISCUSSION: Our findings showed that the risk of suicide increased with increasing ambient temperature in many countries, but to varying extents and not necessarily linearly. This temperature suicide association should be interpreted cautiously, and further evidence of the relationship and modifying factors is needed.

AB Background: During the era of apartheid in South Africa, a number of mental health professionals were vocal about the need for socio-economic and political reform. They described the deleterious psychological and social impact of the oppressive and discriminatory Nationalist state policies. However, they remained optimistic that democracy would usher in positive changes. In this article, we consider how mental health professionals working in post-apartheid South Africa experience their work.
   Methods: Our aim was to describe the experience of mental health professionals working in prisons who provide care to suicidal prisoners. Data were collected from in-depth semi-structured interviews and were analyzed using thematic content analysis.
   Results: Findings draw attention to the challenges mental health professionals in post-apartheid South Africa face when attempting to provide psychological care in settings where resources are scarce and where the environment is anti-therapeutic. Findings highlight the significant gap between current policies, which protect prisoners' human rights, and every-day practices within prisons.
   Conclusions: The findings imply that there is still an urgent need for activism in South Africa, particularly in the context of providing mental health care services in settings which are anti-therapeutic and inadequately resourced, such as prisons.

AB This study analysed suicide rates among first-generation immigrants in Australia from 1974 to 2006, and compared their suicide risks against the Australian-born population. It also examined the associations between the suicide rates of immigrants from 23 selected countries of birth during 2001-2006, and in their home countries.
   Age-standardised suicide rates (15+ years) and rate ratios, with a 95 % confidence interval, during 1974-2006 were calculated for country of birth (COB) groups. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was calculated between COB-specific immigrant suicide rates during 2001-2006 in Australia and in their homelands.
   Suicide rates showed a decreasing time-trend among all COB groups for both genders in Australia. The lowest suicide rates were found during 2004-2006, compared to other year groups. Throughout the study period, males born in Eastern, Northern and Western Europe and New Zealand had the highest suicide rates in Australia. For females, the highest rates were among those born in Western Europe and the UK (including Ireland). Male and female migrants born in North Africa and the Middle East, Southern and Central Asia and South East Asia showed the lowest suicide rates. There was a significant correlation between male immigrant suicide rates by COB and the rates of their home countries.
   The patterns of suicide rates in immigrants were influenced by the social and cultural norms of their COB. The overall decrease in suicide risk among immigrants was particularly evident in males.

SO JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH

AB Purpose: This is the first known prospective study of child suicidal behavior in sub-Saharan Africa. Aims were to determine whether (1) cumulative exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) predicts later suicidality and(2) heightened risks are mediated by mental health disorder and drug/alcohol misuse.
   Methods: Longitudinal repeated interviews were conducted 1 year apart (97% retention) with 3,515 adolescents aged 10-18 years in South Africa (56% female; <2.5% refusal). Random selection of census enumeration areas from urban/rural sites within two provinces and door-to-door sampling included all homes with a resident adolescent. Measures included past-month suicide attempts, planning, and ideation, mental health disorders, drug/alcohol use, and ACE, for example, parental death by AIDS or homicide, abuse, and exposure to community violence. Analyses included multivariate logistic regression and multiple mediation tests.
   Results: Past-month suicidality rates were 3.2% of adolescents attempting, 5.8% planning, and 7.2% reporting ideation. After controlling for baseline suicidality and sociodemographics, a strong, graded relationship was shown between cumulative ACE and all suicide behaviors 1 year later. Baseline mental health, but not drug/alcohol misuse, mediated relationships between ACE and subsequent suicidality. Suicide attempts rose from 1.9% among adolescents with no ACE to 6.3% among adolescents with > 5 ACEs (cumulative odds ratio [OR], 2.46; confidence interval [CI], 1.00-6.05); for suicide planning, from 2.4% to 12.5% (cumulative OR, 4.40; CI, 2.08-9.29); and for suicide ideation, from 4.2% to 15.6% (cumulative OR, 2.99; CI, 1.68-5.53).
   Conclusions: Preventing and mitigating childhood adversities have the potential to reduce suicidality. Among adolescents already exposed to adversities, effective mental health services may buffer against future suicidality. (C) 2015 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB As well as being a violation of human rights, violence against women can be regarded as an 'emerging health problem' of the late twentieth century not because it is new but because its prevalence and role in the aetiology of ill health has only recently been widely recognized. In this paper we discuss the epidemiology and health impact of violence against women, drawing particularly on data from research in South Africa. Here the prevalence of abuse is between 20% and 30%, which is in keeping with estimates for other countries and research has shown that 1% of women are raped each year. Gender-based violence is an appreciable cause of mortality from homicide and suicide. It is also associated with a range of other health problems, particularly injuries, HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy complications and mental health problems. Available estimates suggest that it is associated with considerable costs to the health sector. Roles for the health sector in breaking cycles of abuse are increasingly being recognized and there is a need for appropriate interventions, based on screening, homicide and suicide risk assessment, documentation, information giving and referral to be implemented more widely in health facilities.

AB Despite international studies into religion's protective mechanism against suicidal tendencies, within South Africa there is a paucity of research investigating this relationship. This quantitative study investigates the relationship between religiosity and suicidal tendencies in a sample of Muslim students (N = 111). Two scales were used to test the hypothesis that religion mediates suicidal tendency: the Religious Orientation Test and the Multi-Attitude Suicide Tendency Scale. The findings confirmed this hypothesis but disconfirmed our second hypothesis that there would be gender differences between the variables. We concluded that a high degree of religiosity acts as a protective mechanism against suicidal tendencies and discuss the implications of our findings.

AB The perceived family environmental factors that could correlate with adolescent suicidal behaviors in the Limpopo Province (South Africa) were investigated. The participants were 435 secondary school adolescents from the Pietersburg area in the Limpopo Province of whom 56% were female, and 44% were male, aged between 15-19 years. A questionnaire was used to determine demographic variables, family environmental factors (Moos & Moss, 1989), and suicidal behaviors. Logistic regression analysis showed that: conflict in a family was a significant correlate for three forms of suicidal behaviors studied; family independence, family cohesion, and family organization were also indicated as significant correlates for suicidal threats, however, family independence and organization correlate negatively with suicidal threat. Mental health workers and educators should consider these findings when planning preventive and therapeutic strategies for the minimization of suicidal behaviors among adolescents in the province.

ID IDEATION; INTERVIEW; BEHAVIOR
AB Background. The risk of suicidal tendencies in HIV-infected persons appears high and may parallel the increasing prevalence of suicidal behaviour in South Africa.
   Objective. To construct a brief suicide risk screening scale (SRSS) as a self-administered instrument to screen for suicidal ideation in recently diagnosed HIV-infected persons.
   Methods. An SASS was developed, drawing 14 items from two established screening tests, and assessed using a sample of 150 HIV-infected consenting adults identified at a voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) clinic at an academic district level hospital in Durban, South Africa. Participants returned three weeks after their initial assessment for a re-assessment.
   Results. The internal consistency of the SASS was good (Cronbach's alpha, 0.87), and its sensitivity (81%) was higher than its specificity (47%). The findings suggest that, despite certain limitations, the SRSS may be a valuable screening tool for suicidal ideation at VCT clinics.
   Conclusion. Screening for suicide risk and possible suicidal behaviour in HIV-positive persons may form a routine aspect of comprehensive patient care at VCT clinics to assist with effective prevention and treatment.

AB BackgroundSuicide is a serious public health problem in low- and middle-income countries. Understanding the context- and gender-specific risk factors for non-fatal suicidal behaviour is the cornerstone of evidence-based public health interventions to reduce suicide. Poverty and symptoms of depression are well established risk factors for suicidal behaviour. However, little is understood about how proximal economic factors (such as losing one's job, or food insecurity) may confound the effects of symptoms of depression to increase the risk of non-fatal suicidal behaviour in vulnerable populations, such as young men living under conditions of endemic poverty. The aim of this study was to explore the extent to which a wide range of poverty-related variables account for non-fatal suicidal behaviour independent of, or in addition to, symptoms of depression among young men living in low-resource communities in South Africa(SA).MethodsData were collected from a clustered sample of 647 young men living in low-resource communities in the Western Cape province of SA. Multivariate regressions were used to identify the associations between poverty-related measures, symptoms of depression, and past-month prevalence of non-fatal suicidal behaviour.ResultsNon-fatal suicidal behaviour in the last month was reported by 47 (6.13%) participants: suicidal ideation (n=43; 5.97%); suicide plan (n=5; 0.77%); suicide attempt (n=4; 0.62%), and deliberate self-harm without intent to die (n=4; 0.62%). Past-month prevalence of non-fatal suicidal behaviour was significantly associated with particular dimensions of poverty (living in a home without a toilet on the premises, having previously been fired, and food insecurity), but not with other dimensions of poverty (such as prolonged unemployment and low levels of income). However, symptoms of depression were a more significant predictor of non-fatal suicidal behaviour than any measure of poverty (aOR=1.093, 95% CI=1.058-1.129, p<.000).ConclusionsDepressive symptoms are more strongly associated with non-fatal suicidal behaviour than a range of proximal and distal economic factors among young men living under conditions of endemic poverty in South Africa. This has important public health implications and highlights the importance of increasing young men's access to psychiatric services and targeting depression as an integral component of suicide prevention in low resource communities.

AB Background: Mozambique was recently estimated to have the highest suicide rate in Africa. Aims: To fill a knowledge gap on suicide attempts and deaths in Mozambique. Method: We reviewed a census of 898 emergency psychiatric consultations from March 2013 to July 2014 and 1,173 violent death autopsy records from June 2011 to August 2014 at Beira Central Hospital in Sofala, Mozambique. Results: In all, 18.0% of emergency psychiatric consultations were suicide attempts. Females were disproportionately represented (68.3%, p <.001), and the mean age was 26.8 years. Rat poison was used in 66% of attempts, followed by unspecified methods (19.8%), and unspecified poisoning (6.8%). Of the violent death autopsies, 10% were suicides. Suicide deaths were more likely to be male (67.3%, p <.001), and the mean age was 30.8 years. Common methods were hanging (43.2%), unspecified substance (28.0%), or rat poison (26.3%). Common places of death were the hospital or hospital transit (46.4%) and the household (35.7%). Female suicide deaths more often involved toxic substances and males more often employed hanging. Conclusion: Females more often present with suicide attempts, but deaths due to suicide are more frequent among males. Females more often use toxic substances, whereas males more often use lethal methods, such as hanging. Policies to reduce the availability or toxicity of rat poison should be considered.

AB Background: Suicidal behavior receives considerable coverage in African media. Yet, there has been limited empirical research that focuses explicitly on suicidal behavior in African societies, while comprehensive and reliable official data on the phenomenon are limited. Aims: This article contributes to the empirical research on suicidal behavior in African societies by examining police-recorded data on suicidal behavior in Ghana, West Africa. Methods: Official law enforcement data on suicidal behavior spanning 2006-2008 were analyzed to identify current patterns of suicidal behavior in the country. Results: The results indicate that the persons most prone to suicidal behavior were male, young, and poor. The most frequent methods used were hanging, the ingestion of poisons, and shooting. Conclusions: The relatively low rate of recorded suicidal behavior in the society stems partly from the tabooed and criminal aspects of the phenomenon.

ID FARM-WORKERS; YOUTH; PESTICIDES; BEHAVIOR
AB International studies have documented the association between poverty, low education levels and poor mental health, including suicide attempts. Many farm worker communities in the Western Cape, South Africa, are exposed to poor living and working conditions throughout their lives. They also tend to suffer from chronic illness such as tuberculosis as well as widespread alcohol abuse. Many farm workers are also exposed to pesticides, which have been associated with affective disorders. Through in-depth, semi-structured interviews this qualitative study explored the life experiences of five suicide survivors and their carers to examine the factors that, according to them, predisposed them to and precipitated the suicide attempt. The impact of the suicide attempt on the family was also explored as well as shortcomings in terms of psychological support networks in the community. Contextual factors identified by the study participants that affected them included abject poverty as a result of unemployment and low education levels, childhood within dysfunctional family environments, early alcohol use and current alcohol dependence, previous and current interpersonal conflict and violence, a sense of hopelessness and the absence of coping mechanisms. Easy access to pesticides as a means for self-harm was also a common factor. Further research on the determinants of suicide attempts in this community is needed, as well as on effective and affordable interventions in remote and vulnerable communities such as these. Addressing structural problems would deal with the underlying reasons for suicidal feelings. In the meantime, shorter-term multi-sectoral interventions are needed by stakeholders such as government, civil society and faith-based organizations. These could include effective legislation and policies that regulate working and living conditions of farm workers, appropriate mental health care interventions, educational workshops, and nutrition schemes that address the unique needs of rural farming communities.

AB Suicidality is a growing mental health problem, with statistics for South Africa being in line with global estimates. There has, however, been relatively little empirical advancement in the conceptualization of suicidal behaviour in recent years. Joiner's interpersonal-psychological theory of suicidal behaviour is a relatively new theory that appears to hold promise for advancing our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie suicidal behaviour. The theory proposes that people die by suicide because they want to and because they can. This study sought to test two key hypotheses of the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicidal behaviour using a cross-sectional design and a sample of 239 mental health outpatients. Consistent with theoretical predictions, levels of suicidal ideation were significantly predicted by the interactive effects of high levels of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness in the presence of high levels of hopelessness in relation to both of these distressing states; with estimates of risk for suicide being most strongly predicted by the interactive effects of suicide ideation and an acquired capability for suicide. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for theory, practice, and future research.

AB Objective: Suicide and suicidal behaviours are significant public health problems and a leading cause of death worldwide and in South Africa. We examined the association between childhood adversities and suicidal behaviour over the life course.
   Methods: A national probability sample of 4351 South African adult participants (aged 18 years and older) in the South African Stress and Health (SASH) study was interviewed as part of the World Mental Health Surveys initiative. Respondents provided sociodemographic and diagnostic information, as well as an account of suicide-related thoughts and behaviours. Suicidality or suicidal behaviour were defined as were defined as suicide attempts and suicidal ideation in the total sample, and suicide plans and attempts among ideators. Childhood adversities included physical abuse, sexual abuse, parental death, parental divorce, other parental loss, family violence, physical illness and financial adversity. The association between suicidality and childhood adversities was examined using discrete-time survival models.
   Results: More than a third of the respondents with suicidal behaviour experienced at least one childhood adversity, with physical abuse, parental death and parental divorce being the most prevalent adversities. Physical abuse, sexual abuse and parental divorce were identified as significant risk markers for lifetime suicide attempts, while physical abuse and parental divorce were significantly correlated with suicidal ideation. Two or more childhood adversities were associated with a twofold higher risk of lifetime suicide attempts. Sexual abuse (OR 9.3), parental divorce (OR 3.1) and childhood physical abuse (OR 2.2) had the strongest associations with lifetime suicide attempts. The effect of childhood adversities on suicidal tendencies varied over the life course. For example, sexual abuse was significantly associated with suicide attempts during childhood and teen years, but not during young and later adulthood.
   Conclusions: Childhood adversities, especially sexual abuse, physical abuse and parental divorce, are important risk factors for the onset and persistence of suicidal behaviour, with this risk being greatest in childhood and adolescence.

AB Suicide is increasingly widespread in South Africa and is considered to constitute a serious public health problem. It is not only the most common emergency encountered by mental health care professionals but also has the distinction of being one of the few potentially fatal psychological conditions. The accurate determination of suicide risk in clinical practice is difficult. Despite vast amounts of research, no one assessment tool or method, when applied to individual clients, has been demonstrated to be ultimately superior in helping clinicians to accurately estimate risk. A clinician's failure to adequately assess suicide risk may result in morbidity or mortality, and has the added complication of leaving the clinician to face negative emotional, personal, professional, and legal consequences. This article illustrates how research findings and empirical studies have been utilised to formulate a Suicide Risk Assessment Interview Schedule (SRAIS) designed to assist the clinician to make a thorough assessment of suicide risk by avoiding errors of omission. Two case vignettes are included to illustrate how the SRAIS has been used to guide the process of risk assessment and management.

AB Homicide-suicides, the murder of one or several individuals followed by the suicide of the perpetrator, are rare but have devastating effects on families and communities. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing perpetrators of homicide-suicides with perpetrators of simple homicides and suicides and examined the proportion of firearm use and its correlation with firearm availability. We searched Medline and Embase from inception to July 2012 and identified 27 eligible studies. Perpetrators of homicide-suicides were older and more likely to be male and married to or separated from their victims than perpetrator of simple homicides or suicides. Influence of alcohol and a history of domestic violence or unemployment were less prevalent in homicide-suicides than in homicides. The proportion of firearm use in homicide-suicides varied across countries and was highest in the USA, Switzerland and South Africa, followed by Australia, Canada, The Netherlands and England and Wales, with a strong correlation between the use of firearms and the level of civilian gun ownership in the country. Our results indicate that homicide-suicides represent a distinct entity, with characteristics distinguishing them both from homicides and suicides. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Your petitioners are in mortal terror': The violent world of Chinese
   mineworkers in South Africa, 1904-1910
SO JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Sixty-three thousand Chinese indentured labourers helped resuscitate South Africa's ailing gold mining industry in the aftermath of the South African War of 1899-1902. This short-lived experiment - the first men arrived in 1904 and by 1910 all surviving labourers had been repatriated to China - has attracted the attention of various historians who have focused on the labour shortage that led to the employment of Chinese workers and the political consequences of importation for both Britain and South Africa. However, very little is known about the lives of the Chinese men who actually worked in the Witwatersrand gold mines. Much like African migrant labourers, Chinese mineworkers had to contend with oppressive labour practices, restrictive living conditions and various manifestations of violence. Africans and Chinese were routinely assaulted by white supervisors, and labour protests were often brutally suppressed by state police and mine security forces; but much of the violence took place within the labouring populations themselves. While African miners were 'notorious' for engaging in group confrontations known as 'faction fights', murder and suicide were the predominant forms of violence in the Chinese compounds. Powerful syndicates, directed by the Chinese police force, controlled gambling operations on all the mines that employed Chinese labourers. These syndicates mercilessly pursued debt defaulters, many of who were murdered or committed suicide to escape persecution. Vendettas were common and the violence spilled over into the surrounding countryside when deserters from the mines raided nearby farms and shops. Scholars have noted the ways in which management practices, economic fluctuations and changing political conditions generated violence on the South African gold mines. This article argues that migrant cultures also shaped the nature of mine violence.

AB Mobile bullying and victimization are major concern today. While studies have been conducted on pure bullies, the focus on bully-victims is limited. Bully-victims are both bullies and victims. They are more difficult to recognize and as such a clear picture of their behavior and how they evolve is difficult to establish. They are however said to experience depression, poor self-esteem, academic difficulties and suicidal tendencies the most.
   Researchers report that suicide is the fastest growing, and second leading cause of death in the 15 to 19 age groups in South Africa. While these reports do not directly associate suicidal tendencies or incidents with bully-victim behavior in South Africa, international evidence does. The present study focuses specifically on female mobile bully-victims and aims to create understanding of how they evolve. This is important in a country like South Africa, where the crime rate against the females is among the highest in the world.
   495 female mobile bully-victims, aged 14-18 years were surveyed. Structural Equation modelling technique was used to examine the evolution of female mobile bully-victim behaviour. This behaviour appears to begin with an experience of physical victimisation at an earlier age. As female bullyvictims become mature (i.e. from 15 - 17 years and above), lack of self-control and the desire to retaliate become significant predictors of their behavior. Implications for intervention are discussed.

AB This study explored urban-rural variations in the magnitude and patterns of fatal injuries in South Africa. The National Injury Mortality Surveillance System was utilised to select South African mortality cases for the 2007 period and a cross-sectional methodology was employed in order to comparatively analyse injury mortality rates in the urban province of Gauteng and the rural province of Mpumalanga. The results reveal several differences in urban-rural injury trends across the two South African provinces. Overall, homicide and unintentional (non-transport) injury death rates were significantly higher in the urban province (40.28/100,000 versus 28.48/100,000; (RR = 1.41 [1.32-1.51]) and 18.30/100,000 versus 13.19/100,000; (RR = 1.39 [1.25-1.54]), respectively), whilst transport-related injury mortality rates were significantly higher in the rural province (66.57/100,000 versus 45.83/100,000; (RR = 0.69 [0.66-0.71])). Such results could be attributed to economical, environmental, and infrastructural differences between urban-rural locations and suggest that injury control strategies could be better targeted to the needs of specific geographic populations in South Africa.

AB Intersectoral action is increasingly recognized as necessary to address the social determinants of mental health. This study aims to assess South Africa's progress in intersectoral collaboration for mental health, and provide recommendations for intersectoral collaboration, to generate lessons for other low- and middle-income countries. We conducted a survey of the existing mental health system in South Africa using the World Health Organization Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems. We also conducted 96 semi-structured interviews and 12 focus group discussions with a range of stakeholders at national, provincial and district level. Data were analysed thematically to understand the roles and responsibilities of different sectors in realizing the right to mental health. A range of key sectors were identified as having roles in mental health promotion, illness prevention and service delivery. In discussing South Africa's progress, respondents gave several suggestions about how to formulate an intersectoral response in this context, including increasing high level political commitment, and using leadership from the health sector. We outline roles and responsibilities for various sectors and lessons that can be learnt from this context. These include the importance of developing programmes alongside legislation, employing targeted awareness-raising to engage sectors, and developing a structured approach to intersectoral action.</.

AB This cross-cultural study investigates whether religiosity assessed in three dimensions has a protective effect against attempted suicide. Community controls (n = 5484) were more likely than suicide attempters (n = 2819) to report religious denomination in Estonia (OR = 0.5) and subjective religiosity in four countries: Brazil (OR = 0.2), Estonia (OR = 0.5), Islamic Republic of Iran (OR = 0.6), and Sri Lanka (OR = 0.4). In South Africa, the effect was exceptional both for religious denomination (OR = 5.9) and subjective religiosity (OR = 2.7). No effects were found in India and Vietnam. Organizational religiosity gave controversial results. In particular, subjective religiosity (considering him/herself as religious person) may serve as a protective factor against non-fatal suicidal behavior in some cultures.

TI Doctor-assisted suicide: What is the present legal position in South
   Africa?
SO SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB In the recent case I of Stransham-Ford v. the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, the North Gauteng High Court held that a terminally ill patient who was experiencing intractable suffering was entitled to commit suicide with the assistance of his doctor and that the doctor's conduct would not be unlawful. The court was careful to state that it was not making a general rule about doctor-assisted suicide. The latter should be left to the Parliament, the Constitutional Court and 'future courts'. The judge dealt specifically with the facts of the case at hand. In order to understand the basis of the decision it is necessary to consider: (i) the facts of the case; (ii) the question of causation; (iii) the paradox of 'passive' and 'active' euthanasia; (iv) the test for unlawfulness in euthanasia cases; and (v) the meaning of doctor-assisted suicide. It is also necessary to clarify the present legal position regarding doctor-assisted suicide.

AB The aim of the study was to investigate transcultural differences between schizophrenia spectrum disorder patients who did or did not attempt suicide. DSM-IV schizophrenia (N=609) or schizoaffective disorder (N=371) patients who participated in the multicentre International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT) were studied. Patients were sub-divided into 5 groups according to the different geographical regions of recruitment: North America (NA), Europe (EUR), East Europe (EEUR), South Africa (SAf), and South America (SA). The main lifetime clinical variables were compared, within each group, between attempters and nonattempters. The presence of comorbid substance abuse disorder and smoking was associated with suicide attempts in all the geographical groups considered (NA: chi(2)(1)=7.575, P < 0.01 and chi(1)(2)=69.549, p < 0.0001; EUR: chi(2)(1)=55.068, p < 0.0001, and chi(2)(1)=48.431, p < 0.0001; EEUR: chi(2)(1) = 164.628, p < 0.000, and chi(2)(1)=5.127, p < 0.01; SA: chi(2)(1)=30.204, p < 0.0001 and chi(2)(1) = 11.710, p=0.001) except for SAf For the other clinical variables various differences were found across the different groups. Variables related to suicide behavior were similar across the five groups investigated, with differences only in the age at the first suicide attempt (earlier in the NA sample) and the number of lifetime suicide attempts (higher in the NA sample). Results from this study show that, while some suicide-related clinical characteristics in schizophrenia patients are consistent worldwide suggesting the influence of stable biological traits, other variables may vary across different geographical areas suggesting environmental influences.

AB Background: Concerns about increased suicide risk among immigrants to European countries have been raised. We review the scientific literature on differences in suicide among immigrants compared with the majority populations in Europe's major immigration countries. Methods: We searched the databases PubMed and PsycINFO for peer-reviewed epidemiological studies published in 1990-2011, which compared suicide risks of adult immigrant groups with the risks of the majority population in European countries. Hits were screened by two researchers. Results: We included 24 studies in the review. No generalizable pattern of suicide among immigrants was found. Immigrants from countries in which suicide risks are particularly high, i.e. countries in Northern and Eastern Europe, experienced higher suicide rates relative to groups without migration background. Gender and age differences were observed. Young female immigrants from Turkey, East Africa and South Asia are a risk group. Conclusion: Immigrants 'bring along' their suicide risk, at least for the initial period they spend in the immigration country. Health-care planners and providers need to be aware of this 'imported risks'. However, most immigrant groups do not have an increased suicide risk relative to the local-born population; some may even experience substantially lower risks.

AB We aimed to obtain an emic perspective on the dynamics of non-fatal suicidal behaviour in a high risk population group in South African, viz, adolescent females of Indian origin. Interviews were conducted with 10 respondents admitted to a state hospital in the greater Durban area, following their intentional overdose of prescription medication. Interviews were tape recorded, transcribed, and thematically analysed in an attempt to identify influences on suicidal behaviour. Intrapersonal influences on suicidal behaviour included poor communication and problem-solving skills. Interpersonal influences included family conflict, rigid and inflexible parental attitudes, a family history of attempted or completed suicide and high parental expectations. Socio-cultural influences related largely to conflicting social roles and values in the context of contemporary acculturation pressures. The study findings are discussed in terms of their implications for prevention and future research.

TI Medical students' perspectives on euthanasia and physician-assisted
   suicide and their views on legalising these practices in South Africa
SO SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID ATTITUDES; DOCTORS; ETHICS
AB Background. Euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide have been a controversial and sometimes taboo topic for a long time, not only in South Africa (SA) but also internationally. A recent (SA) judicial case has seen the topic debated again. Consensus on accepting or abolishing these practices in SA has yet to be reached. All relevant role players need to be adequately engaged before policy can be informed.
   Objectives. To determine the views of future doctors (medical students) regarding euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) and to ascertain their stance on its legalisation in South Africa (SA).
   Methods. A paper-based, semi-quantitative descriptive study design consisting of 16 questions, using convenience sampling of third-to fifth-year medical students at Stellenbosch University, was used.
   Results. The overall response rate was 69.3% (N=277). In total, 52.7% of participants (n=146) felt that the practices of euthanasia/PAS should be legalised in SA. Responses varied depending on patient morbidities. If a patient had terminal disease with intractable suffering, 41.9% of participants would terminate the patient's life upon request. A further 36.1% of participants stated that they would have no part in ending a patient's life, while 35.0% said that they would be comfortable with providing the patient with the correct means to end their life (PAS). The majority (80.1%) of participants indicated that they would prefer a dedicated ethics committee to decide who receives euthanasia/PAS. Many factors influenced participants' responses, but differences in opinion between and within the various religious groups were particularly evident in the responses received.
   Conclusions. More than half the respondents in this study were open to legalising euthanasia/PAS, substantially more than in previous studies. However, only 41.9% of respondents would consider actually performing euthanasia/PAS, for certain patients. Views of other healthcare workers as well as the public are required before policy can be informed.

AB Objective: To investigate the 2-week prevalence of suicidal ideations and their associations to symptoms of posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety among South African university students. Participants: Data were collected from 1,337 students between May and August 2013. Methods: Hierarchical regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between suicidal ideation and symptoms of posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety. Results: Rates of suicidal ideation are higher among university students in South Africa than among the general population of the country and student populations in other parts of the world. Symptoms of depression and exposure to trauma predict suicidal ideation Conclusions: Findings bring into focus the high rates of suicidal ideation among a sample of university students in South African and the need for more research to investigate the psychosocial correlates of this phenomena within the cultural context of the country, especially given the correlation between suicidal ideation and other poor health outcomes.

AB This study documented the relationships among biomedical factors, psychosocial factors, health related quality of life (HRQOL) and suicidality in respect of HIV positive women in KwaZulu-Natal. One hundred and thirty three (133) women over the age of 18 years (mean age 32.96 yrs; SD = 7.28) participated in the study. Participants completed a Suicidality Measure (SM: Sheebhan, Janavs, Amorim, Janavs, Weiller, Hergueta, Baker & Dunbar, 1998), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MPSS: Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet & Farley, 1988) and the Health Related Quality of Life Survey SF-36 (Ware, Kosinski & Dewey, 2002). Information on social/contextual variables including income, marital status, employment status, number of children was obtained. Participants completed two biomedical measures, CD4 count and time since diagnosis information. The findings revealed a compromised level of HRQOL in the participants. After controlling for biomedical factors, psychosocial measures did not explain differences in quality of life. Perceived social support was inversely related to suicidality. Newly diagnosed patients were less likely to think of suicide as an option.

ID SOUTH-AFRICA; SUICIDE MORTALITY; DEPRESSION
AB Background. Suicide and suicide attempts are commonly encountered in primary healthcare. To manage them competently and in a nonjudgmental manner, health workers require an in-depth understanding of this problem.
   Objective. To determine the reasons for suicide attempts among patients admitted at Tshilidzini Hospital.
   Method. A descriptive qualitative study used an unstructured in-depth interview for data collection, with 10 purposively selected participants. The data were analysed thematically.
   Results. The participants gave the following reasons for their suicidal acts: poverty, unemployment and its associated financial difficulties; domestic violence; interpersonal conflicts; HIV/AIDS-related problems; maternal death; depression; hallucinations; and accusations of witchcraft. These factors interacted, producing feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness and lack of meaning in life, thereby driving the individual to resort to desperate measures. The choice of method for each suicide attempt was influenced by availability, knowledge, experience and the seriousness of intent to die.
   Conclusion. This study supports the idea that a suicidal act is a complex phenomenon arising in an distinctive way in each individual, based on the interplay of various factors.

AB Pregnant women in general are at an increased risk of experiencing symptoms of mental illness, and those living in a developing country are even more vulnerable. Research points towards a causal relationship between unplanned pregnancy and perinatal mental illness and suggests that pregnancy planning can aid in reducing the negative impact of mental illness on a woman, her unborn baby, and the rest of the family. In this quantitative, descriptive study, we investigated both socio-demographic factors and variables relating to mental illness itself that may place women at an increased risk of experiencing unplanned pregnancy. Data was gathered at two maternal mental health clinics in Cape Town by means of semi-structured interviews. Univariate analyses of the data revealed five independent key risk factors for unplanned pregnancy: lower levels of education, unmarried status, belonging to the Colored ethnic population, substance use, and having a history of two or more suicide attempts. Some of these factors overlap with findings of similar studies, but others are unique to the specific population (women with mental illness within a developing country). Screening of women based on these risk predictors may pave the way for early interventions and reduce the incidence of unplanned pregnancy and the negative consequences thereof in the South African population.

AB Background: The use of tissue collected at a forensic post-mortem for forensic genetics research purposes remains of ethical concern as the process involves obtaining informed consent from grieving family members. Two forensic genetics research studies using tissue collected from a forensic post-mortem were recently initiated at our institution and were the first of their kind to be conducted in Cape Town, South Africa.
   Main body: This article discusses some of the ethical challenges that were encountered in these research projects. Among these challenges was the adaptation of research workflows to fit in with an exceptionally busy service delivery that is operating with limited resources. Whilst seeking guidance from the literature regarding research on deceased populations, it was noted that next of kin of decedents are not formally recognised as a vulnerable group in the existing ethical and legal frameworks in South Africa. The authors recommend that research in the forensic mortuary setting is approached using guidance for vulnerable groups, and the benefit to risk standard needs to be strongly justified. Lastly, when planning forensic genetics research, consideration must be given to the potential of uncovering incidental findings, funding to validate these findings and the feedback of results to family members; the latter of which is recommended to occur through a genetic counsellor.
   Conclusion: It is hoped that these experiences will contribute towards a formal framework for conducting forensic genetic research in medico-legal mortuaries in South Africa.

AB Aim: The study investigates the epidemiology of fatal burns in the predominantly rural province of Mpumalanga, South Africa.
   Method: The study is cross-sectional and investigates region specific data extracted from a National Injury Mortality Surveillance System (NIMSS) and originally gathered at mortuaries. Fatal burns sustained during the 2 year period 2007 and 2008 are analysed (n = 304 cases). Mortality rates by age group, sex and district were compiled and attention was paid to manner of death, location, and temporal characteristics (time of day, weekday, season).
   Results: The overall fatal burn rate was 3.8 per 100,000 inhabitants (95% CI 3.4-4.3). The highest rates were among the oldest age group (8.2/100,000; 95% CI 6.1-10.7), males (5.3/100,000; 95% Cl 4.6-6.2) and in one of the three districts, Nkangala (4.8/100,000; 95% CI 3.9-5.6). Most burns were accidental (68.4%) and intentional ones (13.5%) occurred in particular among older people and in the home. Burns were sustained frequently at home (55.6%), between midnight and 5 a.m. and towards the end of the week. Seasonal variations were more pronounced in Nkangala.
   Conclusions: Fatal burns could be less common in rural than urban South Africa. As in urban South Africa, however, older people, young children, and males are more at risk. Not surprisingly, the occurrence of fatal burns is strongly related to living conditions and lifestyle, which vary even within rural areas of South Africa. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

AB The number of suicides in Japan has increased from approximately 22 000 per year from 1988 to 1997 to >30 000 per year since 1998. Likewise, the number of suicides has been increasing in Mie Prefecture. The purpose of the present study was to examine the incidence of and circumstances surrounding all suicide cases during 1996-2002 in Mie Prefecture and to compare the data with those from 1989 to 1995. In Mie Prefecture, the age-specific suicide rate during the second 7-year period included marked increases among men aged 50-59 and 60-69 years. Among women, the age-specific suicide rate increased with age during both 7-year periods. During the second period, psychiatric disorders as causative factors increased in all generations. They were especially important for women of the younger generation, whereas economic problems were the most common causative factor among men aged 40-64. Physical illness as a causative factor in suicide was high among the elderly, but among the other age groups this factor trailed behind economic difficulties for men and psychiatric. disorders for women. To prevent suicide, social cooperation as well as a plenitude of visiting nurses and psychiatric care is required, and early detection and treatment are also important.

AB Pregnant women living with HIV (WLHIV) in South Africa (SA) report higher rates of suicidal ideation than those who are HIV uninfected, and antenatal suicidal ideation has been previously associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Few studies have attempted to identify correlates and psychosocial predictors of suicidal ideation in this population. In this study, we sought to estimate the prevalence of and identify risk factors for suicidal ideation among pregnant WLHIV in rural SA (N = 673). Thirty-nine percent of women endorsed suicidal ideation (95% CI: 35.2% to 42.3%) and in multivariable logistic regression analysis, suicidal ideation was associated with intimate partner violence and stigma, which interacted to multiplicatively increase the odds of suicidal thoughts. Given the high rates of reported suicidal ideation identified in this sample, and the potential harm to mothers and neonates, suicide risk assessment and management protocols for pregnant WLHIV should be considered for inclusion in the standard of care in rural SA.

ID QUESTIONNAIRE; VALIDATION; SYMPTOMS
AB Objective: Exposure to traumatic events may precipitate suicidal ideation. Once an individual is diagnosed with PTSD, a suicide risk assessment often follows. This study explores how PTSD symptom criteria correlate with suicidal ideation in a sample of police officers. While the psychometric measures of PTSD often mirror the DSM-IV-TR criteria, focusing on exposure, symptom, and duration criteria, suicidal ideation measures often focus on concepts quite different from that. In this report the focus was on investigating how PTSD symptom criteria correlate with the suicidal ideation. Method: A group of South African police officers (N = 217) were assessed by means of the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale and a short version of the Adult Suicide Ideation Questionnaire. Linear and hierarchical regressions were used to determine which PTSD symptom criteria best predict suicidal ideation. Results: Hyperarousal was the primary predictor of suicidal ideation (R-2 [adjusted] = 0.249). Intrusive thoughts added only marginally to the model, contributing a further 2.5% to the declared variance. The contributions of the other two symptom types were negligible. Conclusion: In this study hyperarousal correlated significantly with suicidal ideation. It is suggested that practitioners be alert to these symptoms as possible indicators of suicidal ideation. Implications for suicide risk assessment and prevention measures are discussed.

AB This paper reports on the stigma and discrimination experienced by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students at a rural university in South Africa. Twenty lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students recruited through snowball sampling participated in this study. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used as a framework for data analysis. Findings indicate that religion-related stigma and discrimination are common at a rural-based university in South Africa. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students are typically ascribed a range of labels, including 'sinners', 'devils' and 'demon possessed'. They are also exposed to a number of discriminatory acts, such as the denial of financial and healthcare services and threats of and/or actual rape. Study participants reported attempts to convert lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students' sexual orientation which involved the use of intervention in the form of prayers. Derogatory labelling and associated discriminatory acts, for example the threat of rape, led many students to conceal their sexual identity, not attend specific classes, terminate their studies and even attempt suicide. Universities should develop policies to promote greater social inclusion and the acceptance of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students. Policies should also specify the steps or approaches to be taken in addressing discriminatory practices.

AB The use of political assassinations against key leaders of liberation movements has had a major impact on the course of history in Africa and the Middle East. Not only have some of the greatest of Third World leaders been killed but so, too, has the hope for political change they embodied. This survey of assassinations carried out by western states and their agents from the 1960s onwards reveals a bloody legacy of killings of leaders from Algeria, Cameroon, Congo, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Morocco, Mozambique, Palestine, South Africa, Togo and Zimbabwe - all of which were linked to the interests of western imperialism. Today's daily diet of suicide bombings and the targeting of civilians by both western militaries and jihadis is one consequence, it is suggested, of the brutalisation effected by the policy of political assassination.

Participants were 941 undergraduate students at a South African university. They responded to a number of surveys about music genre preferences and personality traits. Data were analysed for trends and patterns in personality attributions based on music genre preferences. The results indicated that participants hold distinct stereotypes about the personality traits, so that those with who preferred Classical, Blues and Jazz music were seer; to display higher openness to experience than comparison groups with other music genre preferences. Those with Rap, Reggae and Folk music genre preferences were stereotyped as artistic and unconventional. Young South African adults appear to use musical preference to define personality.

TI The profile analysis of attempted-suicide patients referred to Pelonomi
   Hospital for psychological evaluation and treatment from 1 May 2005 to
   30 April 2006
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
AB Background. Suicide is an increasing phenomenon worldwide. A suicide occurs every 40 seconds, and there is I attempt every I to 3 seconds. By 2020, these figures may hove doubled. No accurate statistics regarding the occurrence of attempted suicide for non-fatal suicidal behoviour in South Africa exist, because there has been no systematic data collection.
   Aim. The aim of the study was to determine the profile of patients who had attempted suicide and were referred to Pelonomi Hospital, Bloemfontein, for psychological evaluation and treatment during the period 1 May 2005 to 30 April 2006.
   Method. A descriptive, retrospective study was conducted. The study population comprised 258 attempted-suicide patients referred to Pelonomi Hospital for psychological evaluation and treatment. A data form was compiled to transfer the relevant information from patients' clinical files.
   Results. The majority of patients were female 168.9%). The median age was 22 years. The most common method used in suicide attempts was drug overdose (66%) - mostly antidepressants (19.7%)) and analgesics (8.2%). More females than males overdosed on drugs (p=0.0103). The main precipitating factors included problematic relationships (55.4%), financial problems (22.9%), psychiatric problems (22.1%), arguments (19.8%), abuse (emotional, sexual, physical - 18.2%), low self-esteem/worthlessness/hopelessness/humiliation (16.7%), and recent life changes (13.2%).
   Conclusion. The aim of the study was to determine the profile of patients who had attempted suicide. Possible factors associated with suicide attempts in our sample were identified and summarised in the form of a screening checklist. The value of the checklist is that it can be used as a screening method to identify possible suicide risk in patients.

AB Background. The objectives were to assess thoughts about suicide, plans to commit suicide and suicide attempts in the community, to investigate the use of health services following a suicide attempt, and to describe basic socio-cultural indices of the community.
   Method. The community survey was one component of the larger WHO multisite intervention study on suicidal behaviours (SUPRE-MISS). In each site, it aimed at randomly selecting and interviewing at least 500 subjects of the general population living in the catchment area of the emergency department where the intervention component of the study was conducted. Communities of eight SUPRE-MISS sites (in Brazil, China, Estonia, India, Iran, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam) participated plus two additional sites from Australia and Sweden conducting similar surveys.
   Results. Suicide attempts (0(.)4-4(.)2%), plans (1(.)1-15(.)6%), and ideation (2(.)6-25(.)4%) varied by a factor of 10-14 across sites, but remained mostly within the ranges of previously published data. Depending on the site, the ratios between attempts, plans, and thoughts Of Suicide differed substantially. Medical attention following a suicide attempt varied between 22% and 88% of the attempts.
   Conclusions. The idea of the suicidal process as a continuous and smooth evolution from thoughts to plans and attempts of suicide needs to be further investigated as it seems to be dependent on the cultural setting. There are indications, that the burden of undetected attempted suicide is high in different cultures; an improved response from the health sector on how to identify and support these individuals is needed.

AB This study aimed to disentangle the influence of depression and self-esteem on suicidal behaviour in adolescence. Grades 8 and 11 students in Cape Town, South Africa (n = 939) completed questionnaires assessing suicidal ideation and behaviour, depression, and self-esteem with respect to family, peers, school, sports/athletics, body image and global self-worth. Data were analysed using a series of multinomial logistic regression models adjusted for gender, grade, race and the sampling strategy. Results indicated that depression and low self-esteem in the family context were independently associated with suicide ideation and attempts. Moreover, low family self-esteem significantly differentiated suicide attempters from ideators. Screening for depression and low self-esteem in the family context is discussed as a possible strategy for helping to identify adolescents at risk for suicide attempts.

AB Background. Worldwide, suicide affects the most vulnerable populations, including adolescents and young adults. It is estimated that suicide will contribute more than 2% to the global burden of disease by 2020. Information about the prevalence of suicidal behaviour and the sociodemographic characteristics and risk factors associated with suicide in the South African (SA) rural context is important for local and national policy and contributes to global understanding of the phenomenon. Objective. To investigate key demographic factors and behaviours associated with planning and attempting suicide among high-school learners.
   Methods. In a cross-sectional study, we used stratified random sampling to select 16 schools in uMgungundlovu District, KwaZulu-Natal Province, SA. All grade 10 learners (N=1 759) at these schools completed a self-administered questionnaire (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System). Data analysis was carried out with Stata 13 statistical software using generalised estimating equations.
   Results. In total, 222 learners (12.6% of the 1 759) had made plans to attempt suicide during the previous 12 months, 261 (14.8%) had actually attempted suicide, and 218 attempts had resulted in the learner being treated by a doctor or nurse (12.4%). The risk of planning suicide increased with age. For male learners, being threatened with a weapon on school property (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9 - 7.1; p< 0.01) or bullied through Facebook or WhatsApp (AOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5 - 7.1; p< 0.01) significantly increased the likelihood of making a suicide attempt that resulted in treatment by a doctor or nurse. For female learners, engaging in risk behaviours increased this likelihood, risk factors including being physically hurt by someone they were dating (1 - 3 times AOR 3.3, 95% CI 1.9 - 5.7; p< 0.01, >= 4 times AOR 10.0, 95% CI 2.5 - 40.2 (p< 0.01) and number of drinks consumed in the past month (AOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4 -3.0; p< 0.01).
   Conclusions. The prevalence of suicide attempts among these SA learners was high and was influenced by multiple factors. Routine surveillance systems are urgently required to develop context-based interventions for male and female learners at uMgungundlovu District rural high schools.

AB Suicide is a prevalent problem among young people in Southern Africa, but prevention programs are largely absent. This survey aimed to identify the behavioral and psychosocial correlates of suicidal ideation among adolescents in Limpopo. A two-stage cluster sample design was used to establish a representative sample of 591 adolescents. Bivariate correlations and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. Findings show that suicidal ideation is prevalent among adolescents. The psychosocial factors perceived social support and negative feelings about the family and the behavioral factors forced sexual intercourse and physical violence by the partner were found to increase the risk of suicidal ideation. Depression mediated the relationship between these psychosocial and behavioral risk factors and suicidal ideation. This study increased our understanding of the psychosocial and behavioral predictors of adolescent suicidal ideation. The findings provide target points for future intervention programs and call for supportive structures to assist adolescents with suicidal ideation.

AB Our aim was to investigate suicide-related behaviours among secondary school adolescents in the Free State province, South Africa. Participants in this study were 142 secondary school adolescents selected from urban and rural schools around Welkom and Bethlehem, in the Free State. A stratified random sampling method was used to select the schools. Eighty-six (60.6%) participants were female, and 56 (39.4%) were male. They were aged between 12 and 19 years, with a mean age of 16.18 years (SD = 1.72). A questionnaire was used to obtain participants' demographic data, suicidal behaviours (suicidal ideation, thoughts, plans, and attempts), the severity of the suicidal attempt (where applicable) and how often suicidal attempts took place. Results show that the prevalence of extreme (pervasive) cases of suicidal ideation (i.e. almost every day in the past two weeks) is 12.0% (10.7% for males and 12.8% for females). There is no significant difference between suicidal ideation among males and among females. The prevalence of suicidal plans in the past two weeks and 'ever' (lifetime) were 7.7% and 18.3%, respectively. The prevalence of suicidal attempts in the past two weeks and 'ever' (lifetime) were 4.2% and 14.8%, respectively. There is no significant difference between the prevalence among males and females, early adolescents and late adolescents, adolescents from the Southern Sotho background and those from non-Southern Sotho speaking groups. Mental health workers and educators should use the above findings as baseline information when planning preventive and therapeutic strategies for the minimization of suicidal behaviours among adolescents in the province. The findings should also be considered when making policies on the health priority areas for funding.

AB BackgroundIn South Africa, injuries are the third leading cause of death and disability. Children are especially susceptible to unintentional injuries, especially pedestrian injuries, burns and drowning. Injury risk is informed by children's exposure to adverse environmental circumstances, and individual capacities dependent on developmental maturity. Boys are at greater risk than girls. This study investigates the incidence of fatal childhood injuries as well as sex differences across psychosocial development stages.
   MethodsData on fatal injuries in Gauteng, South Africa's most populous province, were obtained from the National Injury Mortality Surveillance System. The analysis drew on Erikson's psychosocial theory of development which was used to create meaningful age groups. Age-specific population data from the 2011 Census were used to calculate rates, and significant differences were determined through the generation of risk ratios and confidence intervals.
   ResultsThere were 5404 fatal injuries among children in Gauteng from 2008 to 2011. The average age of victims was 8.9 years, and the majority male (65.6%). In infancy, the mortality rates for all injuries and non-traffic unintentional injuries were significantly higher than for the other age groups. Burns were the most common cause of death in infancy and early childhood. Pedestrian injuries accounted for a third of mortality in preschool and school age, and homicide rates were significantly higher in adolescence than in the other developmental stages. For injuries in general, boys had significantly higher mortality rates than girls in all age groups except preschool. The only instance where the mortality rate for girls was significantly higher than for boys was for adolescent ingestion poisoning suicides.
   ConclusionsThe exposure to environmental and social risks is differentially moderated with maturing age and levels of autonomy. The sex of the child also informs risk. The nature of these risks is important when considering child injury prevention strategies.

TI Aggression, anger and violence in South Africa
SO HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article traces the roots of aggression, anger and violence in South Africa and the rest of the world. The paper is divided into four parts: Aggression, Anger, Catharsis and Violence. As a result of violence against other human beings, especially women and children, a profound respect for human dignity has been lost. People have become extremely aggressive. The last few decades have created a culture of violence because of the suppression or oppression of feelings. The article argues that frustration yields anger that leads to violent acts. The root cause of violence is frustration, which finally ( if not attended to) produces anger, anxiety, conflict and the eruption of violence. Suicide bombers in Palestine and other parts of the world demonstrate this type of aggression, anger and violence. Anger, on the one hand, is a good defense mechanism. It helps people cope with frustration. Violence, on the other hand, is used as a means of dominance, especially against women and children. In a political situation it is used as a means of changing social structures.

AB Background Criminology research has traditionally investigated sociodemographic predictors of crime, such as sex, race, age, and socioeconomic status. However, evidence suggests that short-term fluctuations in crime often vary more than long-term trends, which sociodemographic factors cannot explain. This has redirected researchers to explore how environmental factors, such as meteorological variables, influence criminal behavior. In this study we investigate the association between daily ambient temperature and homicide incidence in South Africa, a country with one of the highest homicide rates in the world. Methods Mortality data was from South Africa's civil registration system and includes all recorded deaths in the country from 1997 to 2013 (17 years). Daily temperature was from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Association of the United States and South Africa's Agricultural Research Council. Data were analyzed using a time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic regression. We delineated cases as either "definite" (ICD-10 codes X85-Y09, n = 68,356) or "probable" homicides (ICD-10 codes W25-W26, W32-W34, W50, Y22-Y24, Y28-Y29, n = 177,873). Case periods were defined as the day on which a death occurred. Control periods were selected using a day-of-week match within the same month and district. Analyses investigated same-day and lagged effects of maximum, mean and minimum temperature. Results A one-degree Celsius increase in same-day maximum temperature - our a priori metric of choice - was associated with a 1.5% (1.3-1.8%) increase in definite homicides and a 1.2% (1.1-1.3%) increase in total (definite + probable) homicides. Significant (p < 0.05) positive associations were also observed when applying other temperature metrics (mean, minimum) and lags (1, 0-1). The shape of the association did not display any clear non-linearities. There was no evidence of confounding by public holidays or air pollution. Conclusions This study suggests a positive association between daily ambient temperature and homicide in South Africa. This temperature-health relationship may be of particular concern in the context of climate change. The ability to include meteorological variables as a predictor of criminal activity and violent behavior could prove valuable in resource allocation for crime prevention efforts.

AB Few qualitative studies have explored the relationship between substance use and self-harm. We employed a multiple-case study research design to analyze data from 80 patients who were admitted to a hospital in South Africa following self-harm. Our analysis revealed, from the perspective of patients, a number of distinct ways in which substance use is implicated in self-harm. Some patients reported that substance intoxication resulted in poor decision making and impulsivity, which led to self-harm. Others said substance use facilitated their self-harm. Some participants detailed how in the past their chronic substance use had served an adaptive function helping them to cope with distress, but more recently, this coping mechanism had failed which precipitated their self-harm. Some participants reported that substance use by someone else triggered their self-harm. Findings suggest that there are multiple pathways and a host of variables which mediate the relationship between substance use and self-harm.

AB The objective of this study is to empirically investigate a two-way statistical relationship between the social health indicators and economic growth in the context of four major regions of the world i.e., East Asia and Pacific, Middle East and North Africa (MENA), South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. To recognize the relationship between the two variables, a time series, co-integration and Granger causality tests have been employed. Aggregate secondary data pertaining to these four regions from 1975 to 2011 on economic growth and social health indicators i.e., infant mortality, child abuse, child poverty, unemployment, weekly wages, health insurance coverage, teenage suicide, teenage drug abuse, high school dropouts, poverty, out-of-pocket health costs, homicides, alcohol related traffic fatalities, food insecurity, income inequality, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, basic health units and rural health centers has been used for analysis. This study evaluates four alternative but equally plausible hypotheses, each with different policy implications. These are: (1) social health indicators Granger cause economic growth, (2) economic growth Granger cause social health indicators (the conventional view), (3) There is a bi-directional causality between the two variables and (4) Both variables are causality independent (although highly correlated). The empirical results only moderately support the conventional view that economic growth has significant long run casual effect on social health indicators in East Asia and Pacific, MENA, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. The present study find evident of unidirectional causality running towards economic growth to social health indicators, although, there are some bidirectional causality also exists between the variables. The percentage of unidirectional causality between economic growth and social health indicators is larger than bidirectional or neutrality hypothesis.

AB Pregnant women are at increased risk for suicidal ideation and behaviours (SIB) compared to the general population. To date, studies have focused on the psychiatric correlates of SIB with lesser attention given to the associated contextual risk factors, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. We investigated the prevalence and associated psychiatric and socio-economic contextual factors for SIB among pregnant women living in low resource communities in South Africa. Three hundred seventy-six pregnant women were evaluated using a range of tools to collect data on socio-economic and demographic factors, social support, life events, interpersonal violence and mental health diagnoses. We examined the significant risk factors for SIB using univariate, bivariate and logistic regression analyses (p <= 0.05). The 1-month prevalence of SIB was 18%. SIB was associated with psychiatric illness, notably major depressive episode (MDE) and any anxiety disorder. However, 67% of pregnant women with SIB had no MDE diagnosis, and 65% had no anxiety disorder, while 54% had neither MDE nor anxiety disorder diagnoses. Factors associated with SIB included lower socio-economic status, food insecurity, interpersonal violence, multiparousity, and lifetime suicide attempt. These findings focus attention on the importance of socio-economic and contextual factors in the aetiology of SIB and lend support to the idea that suicide risk should be assessed independently of depression and anxiety among pregnant women.

TI Legalising physician-assisted suicide in South Africa: Should it even be
   considered?
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOETHICS AND LAW
LA English
DT Article
ID EUTHANASIA; ETHICS
AB For many years, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) have been topics that no one dared to mention. However, over the past few decades, the subject has emerged as a very pertinent issue around the world, for a number of reasons - so much so that these life-ending practices have already been legalised or decriminalised in some developed countries, such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, and within certain states of the USA. In the states and countries where the practices have been legalised, or at least decriminalised, the effects of the legalisation have been relatively well documented. On the other hand, in countries like South Africa (SA), where they are illegal, whether or not they should be legalised (taking into consideration all the associated benefits and consequences) should be discussed, and a consensus reached, sooner rather than later. A consensus regarding the feasibility of legalising euthanasia and/or PAS in SA is needed because these practices (or mere requests for them) are becoming increasingly common, especially among people with terminal illnesses. Furthermore, the relative ease with which patients who desperately seek to end their life through either of the aforementioned methods, and are able to access them - by applying for them in countries where the pertinent laws and regulations are adjudged to be more liberal - is alarming. This highlights the importance and need for each country to set clear laws or parameters (and regulations, where applicable) that relate to these life-ending practices.

DT Article
DE HIV-infection; Attempted suicide risk; Management; Prevention
ID BEHAVIOR; IDEATION; MEN
AB Objective: The aim of this study was to examine variables associated with recently diagnosed HP/-infection as a self-reported attempted suicide risk factor. Method: The study cohort consisted of 112 general hospital in-patients who attempted suicide because of HIV-infection. All the patients were subject to a comprehensive mental state examination and administration of a semi-structured questionnaire to obtain biographical, sociodemographic and other relevant information. Pearson uncorrected Chi-square (X-2) or Fisher's Exact Probability Test were used to analyze data utilising Epicalc 2000, version 1.02. Results: Most patients expressed a heterosexual preference. The average age was 34.9 years. Females predominated and in both genders depression and substance abuse (mainly alcohol-related) accounted for the most common psychiatric diagnoses. Less than half of the patients were married. Partner relational problems was a statistically significant variable. The most prevalent co-morbid stressors were poor social support, fear of disclosure/stigmatization and socio-economic pressures. Cognitive deficits included problems with cognitive flexibility concentration and memory Based on estimated national suicidal behaviour prevalence rates, a descriptive HIV-related attempted suicide rate of 67.2 per 100 000 and an increased risk for attempted suicide of 13.33% to 18.87% were calculated. Conclusion: HIV-infection can be an underestimated suicide risk factor. Effective management and prevention programmes should include as imperatives early diagnosis of HIV-related suicidal behaviour, recognition of underlying psychopathology neurocognitive deficits, associated stressors, the dynamics of partner relationship problems, as well as cultural awareness and sensitivity Potential neurocognitive complications that can act as additional risk factors require further research.

AB Drawing on data collected from 3 focus groups with 24 traditional healers, the aim of this qualitative study was to use the constructs of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to gain an understanding of traditional healer referral practices of their patients with a mental illness. Results indicated that traditional healers possess a concept of mental illness, mainly referring to a patient behaving abnormally. They often report regularly treating patients with these behaviours. Traditional healer referral to Western care is considered a temporary measure or a last resort. A majority of healers feel that allopathic physicians do not treat them with the respect that they feel their contribution to the health of the community warrants. Recommendations include the need for traditional healers to be trained to identify potential cases of mental illness in their communities and for dialogue between traditional and allopathic physicians in regard to mental health care.

ID COUNTY
AB Custody-related deaths have,become a major human rights issue in South Africa since the 1994 democratic elections and led to the formation of the Independent Complaints Directorate who, in April 2000, had recorded 2174 custody-related deaths since their inception. A 3-year retrospective descriptive study on all custody-related death cases at a Durban Medico-legal mortuary from January 1998 to December 2000 was undertaken. The study included deaths that occurred during arrest and deaths within the South African Police Services holding cells. Deaths of prisoners within the Correctional Services and psychiatric institutions were excluded. A total of 117 cases were reviewed, of which 88 (75.21%) were due to police shootings, 11 (9.40%) were due to assault by the police during arrest, and 3 (2.57%) were due to assault by police dogs. There were 102 (87.18%) "police action" related deaths and 16 (13.68%) police custody deaths, of which 7 (5.99%) were due to suicide by hanging and 2 (1.71%) due to natural causes. The results from this study differ significantly from published reports from other countries, with respect to the high numbers of deaths caused by police action. Prevention of custody-related deaths should be recognized as an area of concern and should be given greater priority by the government and the South African Police Services.

AB High rates of tuberculosis (TB) and TB/HIV co-infection is often linked with mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, which is further associated with poor health outcomes. In a country such as South Africa where rates of these infectious diseases are high, it is concerning that there is limited/no data on prevalence rates of mental disorders such as PTSD and its associated factors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of PTSD symptoms and associated factors in TB, TB retreatment and/or TB-HIV co-infected primary public health-care patients in three districts in South Africa. Brief screening self-report tools were used to measure: PTSD symptoms, psychological distress (anxiety and depression) and alcohol misuse. Other relevant measures, such as adherence to medication, stressful life events and sexual risk-taking behaviours, were obtained through structured questions. A total of 4900 public primary care adult patients from clinics in high TB burden districts from three provinces in South Africa participated. All the patients screened positive for TB (either new or retreatment cases). The prevalence of PTSD symptoms was 29.6%. Patients who screened positive for PTSD symptoms and psychological distress were more likely to be on antidepressant medication. Factors that predicted PTSD symptoms were poverty, residing in an urban area, psychological distress, suicide attempt, alcohol and/or drug use before sex, unprotected sex, TB-HIV co-infected and the number of other chronic conditions. Health-care systems should be strengthened to improve delivery of mental health care, by focusing on existing programmes and activities, such as those which address the prevention and treatment of TB and HIV.

AB Objective
   To estimate injury mortality rates in a rural population in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa and to identify socio-demographic risk factors associated with adult injury-related deaths.
   Methods
   The study used population-based mortality data collected by a demographic surveillance system on all resident and non-resident members of 11 000 households. Deaths and person-years of observation (pyo) were aggregated for individuals between 01 January 2000 and 31 December 2007. Cause of death was determined by verbal autopsy, coded using ICD-10 and further categorised using global burden of disease categories. Socio-demographic risk factors associated with injuries were examined using regression analyses.
   Results
   We analysed data on 133 483 individuals with 717 584.6 person-years of observation (pyo) and 11 467 deaths. Of deaths, 8.9% were because of injury-related causes; 11% occurred in children < 15 years old. Homicide, road traffic injuries and suicide were the major causes. The estimated crude injury mortality rate was 142.4 (134.0, 151.4)/100 000 pyo; 116.9 (108.1, 126.5)/100 000 pyo among residents and 216.8 (196.5, 239.2)/100 000 pyo among non-residents. In multivariable analyses, the differences between residents and non-residents remained but were no longer significant for women. In men and women, full-time employment was significantly associated with lower mortality [adjusted rate ratios 0.6 (0.4, 0.9); 0.4 (0.2, 0.9)]; in men, higher asset ownership was independently associated with increased mortality [adjusted rate ratio 1.5 (1.1, 1.9)].
   Conclusions
   Reducing the high levels of injury-related mortality in South Africa requires intersectoral primary prevention efforts that redress the root causes of violent and accidental deaths: social inequality, poverty and alcohol abuse.

AB Background: Several suicide and suicidal behaviour risk factors are highly prevalent in asylum seekers, but there is little insight into the suicide death rate and the suicidal behaviour incidence in this population. The main objective of this study is to assess the burden of suicide and hospital-treated non-fatal suicidal behaviour in asylum seekers in the Netherlands and to identify factors that could guide prevention.
   Methods: We obtained data on cases of suicide and suicidal behaviour from all asylum seeker reception centres in the Netherlands (period 2002-2007, age 15+). The suicide death rates in this population and in subgroups by sex, age and region of origin were compared with the rate in the Dutch population; the rates of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour were compared with that in the population of The Hague using indirect age group standardization.
   Results: The study included 35 suicide deaths and 290 cases of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour. The suicide death rate and the incidence of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour differed between subgroups by sex and region of origin. For male asylum seekers, the suicide death rate was higher than that of the Dutch population (N = 32; RR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.37-2.83). No difference was found between suicide mortality in female asylum seekers and in the female general population of the Netherlands (N = 3; RR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.15-2.07). The incidence of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour was high in comparison with the population of The Hague for males and females from Europe and the Middle East/South West Asia, and low for males and females from Africa. Health professionals knew about mental health problems prior to the suicidal behaviour for 80% of the hospital-treated suicidal behaviour cases in asylum seekers.
   Conclusions: In this study the suicide death rate was higher in male asylum seekers than in males in the reference population. The incidence of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour was higher in several subgroups of asylum seekers than that in the reference population. We conclude that measures to prevent suicide and suicidal behaviour among asylum seekers in the Netherlands are indicated.

AB This study investigates the determinants of terrorism in countries that are in the top category of the Fragile States Index (FSI), and are also prone to terrorism. Panel data for 38 countries mainly from Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and South Asia for the years 2005-2014 are used. Findings from the negative binomial and fixed effects estimation show that fragile state, number of refugees and youth unemployment have positive and significant impacts on terrorism. Military spending is positive but less robust across models. Conversely, FDI and remittances have a negative impact on terrorism with the former less robust. Governance and foreign aid are negative and insignificantly related to terrorism. Policy implications follow from the findings.

AB Background: Although the public health impacts of food insecurity and depression on both maternal and child health are extensive, no studies have investigated the associations between food insecurity and postnatal depression or suicidality.
   Methods: We interviewed 249 women three months after they had given birth and assessed food insecurity, postnatal depression symptom severity, suicide risk, and hazardous drinking. Multivariable Poisson regression models with robust standard errors were used to estimate the impact of food insecurity On psychosocial outcomes.
   Results: Food insecurity, probable depression, and hazardous drinking were highly prevalent and co-occurring. More than half of the women (149 [59.8%]) were severely food insecure, 79 (31.7%) women met screening criteria for probable depression, and 39 (15.7%) women met screening criteria for hazardous drinking. Nineteen (7.6%) women had significant suicidality, of whom 7(2,8%) were classified as high risk. Each additional point on the food insecurity scale was associated with increased risks of probable depression (adjusted risk ratio [ARR], 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.07), hazardous drinking (ARK, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.09), and suicidality (ARK, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.02-123). Evaluated at the means of the covariates, these estimated associations were large in magnitude.
   Limitations: The study is limited by lack of data on formal DCM-IV diagnoses of major depressive disorder, potential sample selection bias, and inability to assess the causal impact of food insecurity.
   Conclusion: Food insecurity is strongly associated with postnatal depression, hazardous drinking, and suicidality. Programmes promoting food security for new may enhance overall psychological well-being in addition to improving nutritional status. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study assessed the acceptability of, as well as the facilitators of and barriers to the HIV self-testing kit in the Gauteng province, South Africa. An exploratory qualitative cross-sectional study was conducted using focus group discussions (FGDs) among a sample of 118 respondents selected from the Braamfontein and Soweto areas of Johannesburg. Sixteen FGDs were conducted in order to assess the acceptability of the HIV self-testing kit. Respondent groups were segmented according to area (Soweto or Braamfontein), gender (male or female), age (20-34 and 35-49 years of age) and HIV testing status (have previously tested for HIV or have never tested for HIV) in order to achieve maximum variability. The main advantage identified was that the self-testing kit allows for privacy and confidentiality with regard to HIV status, and does not require a visit to a health facility - two of the main barriers to current HIV counselling and testing uptake. However, respondents, predominantly males, were concerned about the lack of counselling involved, which they thought could lead to suicide ideation among testers. The HIV self-testing kit was found to be acceptable among the majority of respondents. However, there is still a need for follow-up services for self-testers. The idea of a hotline for telephonic counselling within the self-testing model seemed to be favourable among many respondents and is an alternative to traditional face-to-face counselling, although some respondents felt that this was not sufficient.

ID TRAUMATIC DEATHS
AB Background: Firearms tends to be seen today as instrumental in injuries and deaths, including suicide. South Africa's gun law allows firearms to be licensed and legal, so in general they are not illegal weapons, even though many used in violence are illegal. This is a prime area in which multisectorial collaboration is needed in a country like South Africa.
   Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of firearm-related deaths and to understand the underlying causative factors.
   Method: This is a record review of 10,860 medicolegal autopsies conducted between 1993 and 2004 at Umtata General Hospital.
   Results: Between 1993 and 2004, there were 10,860 autopsies performed of those who died as a result of trauma and others in Umtata General Hospital. The average gunshot-related deaths during this period are 48.4 per 100,000 of the population per year. The rate has increased from 27 per 100,000 in 1993 to 42 per 100,000 in 2004. It was climbed to its peak to 67.8 per 100,000 in 2001. Firearm-related deaths account for 29% of all traumatic deaths. Males (82%) outnumber females 4.6:1 in fatalities due to firearms. There is an increasing trend in females. About 50% were in the 21- to 40-year age group. Interpersonal violence, poverty, and use of drugs and alcohol are common underlying factors.
   Conclusion.: There is a high incidence of firearm-related deaths in Transkei, which is in support of stricter gun control.

AB Background: Emergency department (ED)-based screening for substance use, suicide, and safety is commonly conducted in the United States. We sought to adopt this ED-based strategy in South Africa to determine the potential unmet needs of this population. Materials and Methods: This prospective, observational study was conducted at two sites in the Eastern Cape from June to September 2017. Adult patients presenting to the ED with noncritical conditions were approached to collect demographic data, respond to screening questions, and receive point-of-care human immunodeficiency virus testing. Screening questions assessed primary care access, substance use, suicidal thoughts, and home safety. The data analysis was performed using STATA v. 15 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). Descriptive statistics and cross-tabulations were performed to assess the proportion of patients with access to primary care, substance use, suicidal thoughts, and home safety. Relative risks were calculated using a generalized linear model for the appropriate exposures and outcomes. Results: Among the 2,074 patients approached, 1,880 consented to data collection. Half of the participants were male, and the median age was 34 years (interquartile range: 25-54 years). Screening questions revealed that 384 (20%) used alcohol in excess, 372 (20%) used tobacco, 174 (9%) lacked access to primary care, 69 (4%) had suicidal thoughts, and 55 (3%) felt unsafe at home. Most of those reporting substance use were male and between 25 and 34 years. Conclusions: One in five patients reported substance use, of which one in five did not have routine interaction with the health-care system. Routine ED-based screening could reach this missed population for timely intervention. The following core competencies are addressed in this article: Patient care, Practice-based learning and improvement, and Systems-based practice.

ID TRAUMATIC DEATHS
AB Background. Firearms are a causative factor in much violence-related morbidity and mortality, including suicide. Interventions focus on stricter gun control. In South Africa multisectoral collaboration is needed in this regard.
   Objective. To determine the incidence of firearm-related deaths in the Transkei region and to understand the underlying causative factors.
   Method. A record review was undertaken of 10 860 medicolegal autopsies performed between 1993 and 2004 at Umtata General Hospital.
   Results. Between 1993 and 2004 10 860 autopsies were performed on patients who died as a result of trauma and other causes at Umtata General Hospital. The average number of gunshot related-deaths during this period was 48.4 per 100 000 of the population per year. The rate increased from 27/100 000 in 1993 to 42/100 000 in 2004. Firearm-related deaths accounted for 29% of all traumatic deaths, and males (82%) outnumbered females 4.6:1, although there is an increasing incidence among females. About 50% of these deaths were in the 21 - 40-year age group. Interpersonal violence, poverty, and use of drugs and alcohol were common underlying factors.
   Conclusion. There is a high incidence of firearm-related deaths in Transkei. Stricter gun control is required.

AB In developing countries, up to 20% of maternal deaths during pregnancy are due to suicide, and being HIV-infected confers additional risk. This manuscript sought to identify perinatal correlates of suicidal ideation among women living with HIV (WLHIV) in rural South Africa. Pregnant WLHIV (N=681) were recruited and re-assessed at 12-months postpartum. Mean age was 28.3 (SD=5.7) years and 68% were below the poverty line. Prenatal suicidal ideation was 39%; suicidal ideation continued for 7% at 12months, 13% experienced incident suicidal ideation, and for 19% suicidal ideation had stopped postnatally. Intimate partner violence (AOR=1.17) and depression (AOR=1.14) predicted sustained suicidal ideation. Increased income (AOR=2.25) and greater stigma (AOR=1.33) predicted incident suicidal ideation. Younger age (AOR=0.94), disclosure of HIV status to partner (AOR=0.60), and greater stigma (AOR=1.24) predicted postnatal cessation of suicidal ideation. Perinatal care may provide windows of opportunity for identification and treatment of suicidal ideation.

   PERSPECTIVE; MECHANISMS; WORKERS; AREA
AB Background Surveillance is a critical public health tool for the control of pesticide poisoning. However, surveillance activities in developing countries are bedevilled by multiple problems, and inferences made from review of flawed data may lead to mistaken policy decisions.
   Methods Results of intensified surveillance from an intervention project in the Western Cape Province of South Africa were compared to the pattern of poisonings reported in routine notifications to the health authorities for a control farming district and in the study district over a 5-year period preceding the study. Intensified surveillance data results were also contrasted with policy approaches based on routine notifications and on Regional Poison Centre reports.
   Results Poisoning rates reported in the study area increased almost 10-fold during the intervention period. Compared to intensified surveillance, hospital and health authority sources greatly underestimate the proportion of cases due to occupational poisoning, and overestimate suicide as a proportional cause. In addition, the risks for women appear underestimated from routine notifications. Assumptions that a lack of awareness is responsible for most poisonings are not borne out by the empirical data when reporting is intensified.
   Conclusions Current policy assumptions are faulty, may result in inappropriate blame being attributed to victims and, by relying on information as the main element of education, may shift responsibility onto the individual. Improvements in the surveillance system should aim to restructure the types of data collected, and facilitate intra-governmental and inter-sector collaboration. The culture of monitoring based on report writing must change to one of surveillance that leads to intervention.

AB Background: Female homicide is very complex and difficult to research. Xhosa women are poor, illiterate and live in a rural area where they are exposed to a number of risks to their lives. The previous apartheid regimen broke the fabric of the family value system in this region and this came on top of a traditional patriarchal view of women as little more than property. Women are most vulnerable in this traumatised society.
   Objective: To study the incidence of female homicide in the Transkei sub-region of South Africa.
   Method: A record review was undertaken of all medico-legal autopsies performed from 1993 to 2015 at Mthatha Forensic Pathology Laboratory.
   Results: In total, 26 972 autopsies were performed on victims of unnatural death between 1993 and 2015. Of these, 6091 (22.58%) were cases of unnatural death among females. Homicide accounted for 1865 (30.61%) of these deaths. The average rate of female homicide during the study period was 12.5 per 100 000. The rate of homicide decreased from 14.25/100 000 (1993) to 9.19/100 000 (2015). The average rate of death was 4.93/100 000 as a result of the use of firearms, 3.75/100 000 for stab injuries and 3.70/100 000 for blunt trauma. The rate of murder was highest (6.55/100 000) in the young age group between 11 and 40 years.
   Conclusion: Despite a one and half time decrease in the rate of female homicide in the last 23 years (1993-2015) in the Transkei sub-region of South Africa, it is still three times higher than the worldwide rate.

ID SELF-DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR; STUDENTS
AB The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of suicidal behaviours among secondary school adolescents in the Limpopo Province. The participants in this study were 435 secondary school adolescents from Polokwane and surrounds. Two hundred and forty-three (56%) participants were female, and 192 (44%) were male. They were aged between 15 and 19 years, with a mean age of 17.25 years (SD = 1.34). A questionnaire was used to record participants' demographic data and suicidal behaviours, including suicidal thoughts and threats, plans, and attempts to commit suicide). Thirty-seven percent of the secondary school adolescents surveyed indicated having thought of taking their own lives; 17% had made threats or informed others about their suicidal intentions; 16% had made plans to take their own lives but did not carry them through; 21% reported having attempted to take their own lives. These results indicate that a higher percentage of males than females had attempted suicide. The most frequent method used for attempting suicide was self-poisoning (44% of the attempters), followed by drug overdoses (25.3%), hanging (22%), self-stabbing (2.2%), and other methods, such as, jumping from heights, starvation, and drug abuse (6.6%).

ID SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES; BEHAVIOR; RISK
AB Background: The overwhelming use of Internet and social media among the youth in South Africa causes both negative and positive effects on the users. Cyberbullying is one manifestation of such negative effects. Rural high school students are not immune to this modern age social problem. To protect them against the possible hazards, it is important to study this phenomenon among this group of young poeple.
   Objectives: This study explored the extent of the use of Internet and social media, the forms and frequency of cyberbullying and their effects on the emotional well-being and academic performance of grades 8-10 students in a rural high school in Limpopo, South Africa.
   Method: This study used a mixed research approach. Eighty participants consisting of 50 females and 30 males from grades 8 to 10 in a rural high school participated in this survey and 6 purposefully selected victims of cyberbullying completed an interview schedule.
   Results: The majority of participants had access to cyber technology and used Facebook frequently. More than half of the participants experienced a wide variety of cyberbullying, sexual offence being the highest. They were negatively affected both emotionally and academically to the extent that some thought of suicide.
   Conclusion: Even though students in this rural high school have access to the latest cyber technology, they are not equipped to prevent or cope with its negative effects; hence, they suffer in solitude. The study recommends an anti-cyberbullying policy being established, as well as counselling at school, and advises stakeholders who intend to expand e-learning at schools to include cyber safety and supportive mechanisms in their programmes for successful implementation.

AB Introduction: Positive psychological phenomena such as increased feelings of belonging linked to hosting the FIFA World Cup were observed in France 1998 and South Africa 2010. Approximately nine months after South Africa hosted the 2010 World Cup the sex ratio at birth increased significantly. Given the similarity of positive psychological phenomena between the two countries, this study sought to determine if the sex ratio at birth increased in France circa nine months after the 1998 World Cup.
   Methods: Anonymized publicly available live birth data from 1994 to 2004 inclusive was obtained from the Insee (Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes/Economiques - National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies). For statistical analysis, chi-squared tests were used.
   Results: The sex ratio at birth for March and April 1999 did not differ significantly from that of the rest of same period from 1996 to 2000 (p = 0.558), there was also no significant difference for February and March 1999.
   Conclusion: The sex ratio at birth did not increase in France after it hosted the 1998 World Cup. Possible reasons why the sex ratio at birth did not increase as it did in South Africa include a higher French prevalence of modern contraceptive use and a different kind/level of excitement for the World Cup in France since it has previously hosted large international sports tournaments. The influence of the World Cup on the sex ratio at birth depends on the context of a specific country. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study analyzed Turkish female adolescent-family relations, which is believed to be one of the significant factors in female adolescents' suicide attempts, from a multidimensional perspective. The Parent-Adolescent Relationship Inventory, a multidimensional evaluation tool based on the behavioral family-system approach was used as a research tool. The inventory consists of the concepts and techniques of behavioral theory, family system theory, and cognitive theory in parent-adolescent' problems and conflicts. Based on these theories, the parent-adolescent relations inventory (PARQ), involves three main dimensions: problem solving and communication skills, cognitive/internalized beliefs, and functions and structures in family systems. There are two forms of the inventory, the adolescent form and the parent form. Only the adolescent form of PARQ, including 284 items, was used in this research. The inventory also consists of 16 subscales. It was adapted into Turkish by Eryuksel (1996). The subjects of the study were 52 female adolescents who had attempted suicide and were taken to the Emergency Department of The Faculty of Medicine in Cukurova University, and 52 normal female adolescents from two different secondary schools at the southern province in Turkey. The age range of the clinical and normal groups were 14-18 ((x) over bar = 16). The results of the study revealed that the general stress level of female adolescents who attempted suicide is higher than those of normal groups. The examination of family structures of these female adolescents made it clear that mothers were the mediator between fathers and adolescents. It was also observed that both mothers and fathers shared many somatic concerns.

ID VERBAL AUTOPSIES; MORTALITY
AB The study compares the cause of death profile in a rural area of South Africa (Agincourt), with that in a rural area of West Africa (Niakhar), and in a developed country with the same life expectancy (France, 1951) in order to determine causes with high and low mortality and priorities for future health interventions. In the two African sites, causes of death were assessed by verbal autopsies, whereas they were derived from regular cause of death registration in France. Age-standardized death rates were used to compare cause-specific mortality in the three studies, Life expectancy in Agincourt was estimated at 66 years, similar to that of France in 1951, and much higher than that of Niakhar. Causes of death with outstandingly high mortality in Agincourt were violent deaths (homicide and suicide), accidents (road traffic accidents and household accidents), certain infectious diseases (HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, diarrhea and dysentery), certain chronic diseases (cancer of genital organs, liver cirrhosis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, maternal mortality, epilepsy, acute rheumatic fever, and pneumoconiosis) and malnutrition of young children (kwashiorkor). Causes of death with lower mortality than expected were primarily respiratory diseases (pneumonia, bronchitis, influenza, lung cancer), other cancers, vaccine preventable diseases (measles, whooping cough, tetanus), and marasmus. Verbal autopsies could be used in a rural area of a developing country without formal cause of death registration to identify the most salient health problems of the population, and could he compared with a formal cause of death registration system of a developed country.

AB Efavirenz is part of the first-line treatment for HIV patients including those in South Africa with approximately 50% experiencing neuropsychiatric side effects. A systematic review of papers reporting neuropsychiatric side effects with efavirenz published between January 2001 and December 2014 was performed, to provide guidance. 13 articles were reviewed. Patient ages ranged between 37 to 41years, with a high percentage males. Scales used to measure incidence and severity of side effects were varied; with disease severity or stage not reported. Patients with psychoses were excluded. Most commonly reported side effects were a reduction in sleep quality, depression, dizziness and anxiety. These were generally mild and not warranting discontinuation of efavirenz. It is difficult to directly compare the studies. Standardised methods need to be introduced and all patient groups represented including the elderly, children, patients with active symptomatic illness and more women especially among the African population.

AB There is a paucity of data on the prevalence of suicidality in HIV/AIDS, and associated psychological factors in sub-Saharan Africa, shown to be high in Uganda. Yet, the region accounts for over 70% of the world HIV burden. Our study used a cross-sectional survey of 226 HIV-positive (HIV+) adults and adolescents (aged 15-17 years) in Mbarara, Uganda. The relationship between suicidality and depressed mood, anxiety symptoms, state anger, self-esteem, trait anger and hopelessness was examined; anger was the predominant factor in suicidality, suggesting that anger management could potentially lower the prevalence of suicidality.

AB Background: Suicidality in HIV/AIDS is not only a predictor of future attempted suicide and completed suicide, it is also associated with poor quality of life and poor adherence with antiretroviral therapy. This paper examines the prevalence and correlates of suicidality in HIV/AIDS in the African nation of Uganda.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was undertaken among 618 respondents attending two HIV clinics in semi-urban Uganda. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on demographic, social, psychological and clinical factors. Correlates of suicidality were assessed using mulitvariable logistic regression.
   Results: Prevalence of 'moderate to high risk for suicidality' (MHS) was 7.8 % and that of life-time attempted suicide was 3.9 %. Factors associated with MHS at univariate analysis were: female gender, food insecurity, increasing negative life events, high stress score, negative coping style, past psychiatric history, psychosocial impairment, diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. Factors independently associated with MHS in multivariate models were female gender, increasing negative life events, a previous psychiatric history, and major depressive disorder.
   Conclusions: These results are in agreement with the stress-vulnerability model where social and psychological stressors acting on an underlying diathesis (including previous and current psychiatric morbidities) leads to suicidality. These results identify potential targets to mitigate risk through treatment of psychiatric disorders and promoting greater adaptation to living with HIV/AIDS.

AB Objectives. Little is known about socio-demographic patterns of non-fatal suicidality in early life in South Africa. We investigated the prevalence of self-reported early suicidality (suicidal ideation, planning and attempts) in a nationally representative sample of South Africans.
   Design. As part of a larger mental health survey, 3158 individuals aged over 25 years were asked to recall whether they engaged in non-fatal suicidal behaviour in early life (measured from childhood to 25 years). Race-based discrimination institutionalised under Apartheid profoundly influenced delivery and outcomes in health and other social services. Racial categories entrenched during Apartheid were therefore used to analyse data collected from individuals born before 1946, 1947-1956, 1957-1966 and 1967-1976.
   Results. 3.4% (95% CI = 2.6-4.1) of participants recalled early suicidal behaviour. The youngest group (born 1967-1976) recalled higher rates of early suicidality than older groups in all races. In unadjusted analysis, White people were 2.84 (95% CI = 1.62-4.97) and Coloured people 1.84 (95% CI = 1.15-2.93) times more likely than Black people to recall early suicidality. Individuals growing up in urban and higher socio-economic settings were approximately twice (OR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.14-4.28 and OR = 1.92; 95% CI = 1.27-2.90) as likely to recall early suicidality as those growing up in rural and lower socio-economic settings. Those with post-primary education were 2.79 (CI = 1.71-4.53) times as likely to recall early suicidality as those with no or only primary education. Racial differences ceased to be significant after adjustment for rural/urban location and other socioeconomic measures estimated for early life.
   Conclusion. The study provides novel evidence of increasing levels of early non-fatal suicidality recalled by younger South Africans. Levels appeared significantly higher in Whites than in Blacks. Socio-economic contexts in early life were interpreted as mediators rather than confounders of the association between race and recalled early suicidality. The findings for decreased levels of suicidality among participants growing up in lower socio-economic strata and rural settings in South Africa require further investigation. The need for widespread suicide prevention programmes targeting young people at a population level is emphasised.

AB With an increasing number of studies showing a rise in adolescent suicidal behaviour and a wealth of literature concerning adolescent coping strategies, this study examined both these issues within a South African context. The interplay between social, political, and economic factors in South Africa, with its history of apartheid, must impact upon the lives of adolescents living in this country and play a role in stress, depression, and feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and possible suicidal ideation. The objectives of the study were to determine the coping strategies exhibited by a South African sample of adolescents, the relationship between these coping strategies and suicidal ideation, and to investigate whether gender had any influence on this relationship. This study therefore aimed to get a better understanding of the relationship between the variables: suicidal ideation, coping strategy, and gender. Such research is important in learning to understand how adolescents cope, in order for caregivers and professionals in the field to be able to identify potential suicide ideators through their behaviours and coping strategies. A sample of 161 adolescents in grade eleven completed a demographic questionnaire, the Positive and Negative Suicidal Ideation Scale (PANSI), and The Coping Across Situations Questionnaire (CASQ). The findings indicated the majority of the sample (51%) had a positive outlook on life, feeling optimistic about the future most or a good part of the time. Further results showed that males and females followed the same pattern of coping by scoring highest on the functional coping strategies and lowest on the dysfunctional one. There was a significant difference between males and females on each coping strategy, with females scoring higher than males in each case. Correlation studies indicated a positive significant relationship between active coping (functional coping strategy) and positive suicidal ideation scores (positive outlook on life) and between withdrawal (dysfunctional coping strategy) and negative suicidal ideation scores (negative outlook on life). Results for each gender differed, with the female sub-sample revealing significant correlations between functional coping strategies and positive suicidal ideation scores, while the only significant correlation found within the male sub-sample was between the dysfunctional coping strategy and negative suicidal ideation scores.

AB Background: Acute poisoning incidents are one of the leading causes of morbidity and hospitalization in several countries. The purpose of this analysis was to compare the patterns of acute poisoning in three countries namely, Botswana, South Africa and Uganda; and examine the similarities and disparities in the patterns of occurrence of acute poisoning based on the sociodemographic factors of the victims, the toxic agents involved, the circumstances surrounding the incidents and their outcomes.
   Materials and methods: This paper is based on the re-analysis of data that were collected from January to June 2005 by some Master of Public Health students using a similar data collection tool. A single dataset made of the original individual datasheets was constituted and analysed.
   Results: Overall, it was found that the mean age of victims of acute poisoning was 20.9 +/- 14.5 years; the youngest victim was a 3 months old boy from South Africa; and the oldest was a 75 years old man from Uganda. In descending order, the most common toxic agents involved in poisoning incidents were household products (46.1%), agrochemicals (18.8%), pharmaceuticals (14.0%), animal and insect bites (13.0%), food poisoning (4.5%), as well as plants and traditional medicines (3.6%). Across the three countries, acute poisoning occurred mainly by accident, but the contextual factors of each country led to a pattern of acute poisoning that showed some similarities with regard to the distribution of deliberate self-poisoning among females, teenagers, and young adult victims. There were disparities related to the differential access to toxic agents, based on the age and gender of the victims. Of the 17 deaths reported, 2 (11.7%) were due to traditional medicines; household products were implicated in fatal outcomes in all three countries, though the extent of their involvement varied from country to country.
   Conclusion: Although plant and traditional medicines caused fewer cases of acute poisoning incidents, they contributed considerably to fatal outcomes.

ID PROPOSAL; SUICIDE; POLICY; DISABILITY; INUIT
AB While the multidimensionality of poverty is well-recognised, one dimension of poverty which has been often overlooked is weak social connectedness. This paper draws on conceptual, participatory and measurement literatures to show that social connectedness appears to be an important missing ingredient of multidimensional poverty analyses, with social isolation being a feature which exacerbates the condition of poor persons. To provide contextual detail as to its impact on persons in marginalized communities, we present qualitative primary data from South Africa and Mozambique and review pertinent studies of the First Nations of Canada and among persons with disability. A policy challenge for social isolation is that it is often seen as stemming from an individuals' capacity rather than resulting from the broader social context. The closing section outlines areas for policy.

TI The problem of father absenteeism in South Africa:A possible solution
   according to Biblical guidelines
SO TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE
LA Afrikaans
DT Article
DE Biblical guidelines; families; father absence; father involvement;
   father presence; role; South Africa
AB In this paper a solution-orientated approach is proposed as a suggested contribution to help fight the social problem of father absenteeism in South Africa, since the issue of absent fathers is becoming a serious local problem. Increasingly, children are growing up without a father figure and as a result become vulnerable in society. Broken families and absent fathers are major causes and effects resulting in children's vulnerability - the state of exposure to the possibility of being harmed, self-harmed and contemplating suicidal thoughts. Examples of vulnerable children are those who do not receive the love and care of one or both parents, who may, therefore, struggle with basic skills such as how to handle emotions, trust and interpersonal relationships. Moreover, they may lack self-knowledge and engage in risky behaviour.
   The absence of a parent within a family system causes a vacuum in the parenthood role and has a negative influence on the ability of the family to function efficiently. The number of children living without their fathers has increased unabatedly during the almost two decades of democracy in South Africa. The absence of a father has been constructed as socially detrimental and a dilemma for most children in South Africa, as the lack of a father figure means the child has no positive male role model. Father absence not only has a severe impact on family life, but constitutes a social trend of widespread concern, akin to major diseases such as HIV/Aids.
   Research has shown that a dysfunctional family life is a major societal problem, with father absence and fatherlessness at the centre thereof. The following statistics reflect disturbing factors related to father absence in South Africa: 63% of suicides originate from fatherless homes; 70% of juveniles in state-operated institutions come from fatherless homes; 80% of rapists motivated by displaced anger grew up in fatherless homes; 40% of all children in the country do not live with their biological fathers; 85% of children with behavioural problems come from homes where the father is absent; 90% of homeless children originate from fatherless homes; and 71% of children who do not finish school have absent fathers.
   Father absence is a tendency and world-wide phenomenon in many communities. Statistically, there is a tendency akin to a "fatherhood disease" globally and a rapid increase in single-parenting. Fathers' absence is the ultimate cause for the rising incidence of single mothers, vulnerable children and child-headed households in South Africa. Single-parent households have become the norm in South Africa where the "typical" child is raised by the mother only.
   The abovementioned problems are devastating to families, who may blame God for ills and misfortunes in their lives. Parents are a gift from God to children, but numerous children have been raised in families where fathers have been neglecting their responsibilities. The society in South Africa at present seemingly is unable to acknowledge the importance of fatherhood. However, father absence holds many negative consequences for families and communities, and many families experience a difficult family life because of it.
   Themes such as Biblical parenting, mentors and mentoring, Christian values, missional fatherhood, fatherhood from a Biblical perspective, the views of mothers and adolescents on the important role of the father within a family context were examined with regard to the problem of father absence.
   The findings arrived at in the context of these themes contributed towards a practical component, namely the Fatherhood Training and Equipping Programme "Dad become fully you", which was developed in 2011 to be utilised in the field of community engagement. The programme was compiled from my research and studies in collaboration with FAMSA (Families South Africa). The programme constituted one of the strengths and core responsibilities of the research because the main aim thereof was to train and equip fathers and to restore the indispensable role of the father within the family context. In 2015, the same programme with a different theme, "A life beyond iron bars", was started at the Potchefstroom Remand Detention Facility (Potchefstroom Correctional Services). The aim of the programme was to train and equip, motivate, inspire and empower fathers in prison, according to the following guideline in the White Paper on Corrections in South Africa, Chapter 3 (3.3.7): "... creation of an environment in which offenders are encouraged to discard negative and destructive values and replace them with positive and constructive values."
   The programme consists of seven themes: the concept of fathering; self-image; character; labelling; disappointments; the father as developer; and becoming fully you. From 2015 to 2018, approximately 150 inmates (fathers) were trained and equipped by means of the programme.
   In my opinion, the Fatherhood Training and Equipping Programme should strongly be considered for future research as a proposed solution to the problem of father absence in South Africa. Father absence constitutes a huge challenge in the South African context, and in order to address this challenge, Biblical guidelines are suggested for families who are confronted with this growing problem. The Biblical guidelines will serve as a supplement for and a new point of view compared to previous studies with regard to the problem of father absence. The implementation of Biblical guidelines towards the role of the father is essential for the family, and Biblical presentation of fatherhood should be the basis in dealing with issues such as father absence and what the role of the man in the home should be.

AB Depression affects nearly 350 million people worldwide. Local data indicates that approximately 17% of all South Africans will experience at least one episode of depression in their lifetime. Depressive disorders contribute significantly towards overall morbidity and increased risk for suicide. Antidepressant therapy remains one of the cornerstones in the management of depressive disorders. Although the efficacy of antidepressive drugs is continuously subjected to criticism, thousands of controlled clinical trials have shown, and will continue to show, their benefit in the effective treatment of depressive disorders. Since the introduction of antidepressants in the early 1950s, researchers have been searching for an ideal antidepressant able to adequately reduce, preserve and prevent features of depression with the absence of side effects. This article summarizes the currently available antidepressant drugs in South Africa. Discontinued products have been omitted and newly registered agents have been added. This review does not contain reference to any experimental drug, or substances not yet available for local use.

AB Background: In South Africa, violence-related injury and mortality contributes highly to the nation's burden of injury. Drug abuse, which is also reported to be rife across the county, has been associated with violence, resulting injury, and death. While post-mortem toxicological investigations are comprehensive and routine in violent fatalities internationally; this is not currently the case in South Africa.
   Objectives: To conduct a post-mortem toxicological investigation on a cohort of violent fatalities in the West-Metropole of Cape Town, Western Cape.
   Methods: The study included a prospective toxicological analysis and a retrospective review of the corresponding blood alcohol results on a small cohort of victims of violent death (whether homicidal, non-overdose suicidal, or accidental) admitted to the Salt River State Mortuary in Cape Town. Biological specimens were collected from the victims following informed consent from the next-of-kin, and a targeted screening approach using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry was used for the qualitative toxicology analysis. At the Forensic Chemistry National Laboratory, blood alcohol testing was conducted using a headspace gas chromatography with flame ionisation detector according to national standards. Data was analysed with regards to demographics, circumstances of death, and toxicological results.
   Results: Consent was obtained for 104 violent death cases, autopsied between August-October 2015, most were male victims of homicide (n = 92, 88%). Volatiles analysis for ethanol was performed on 98% of cases, with 41% testing positive (> 0.01 g/100 mL). Other drugs of abuse were detected in 63 (61%) cases and more than one substance were present in 51 (49%) cases. The most commonly detected substances were combinations of methamphetamine, diphenhydramine, and methaqualone.
   Conclusions: A high prevalence of drugs of abuse was identified in a cohort of victims of violent death. Objective drug trends observed were consistent with national self-reported rehabilitation centre data and research on self-reported drug user. This study was limited by the sampling strategy, including challenges associated with obtaining consent and the rapid turnover of violent fatalities. Despite this - and to the authors' knowledge - this study provided the first prospective post-mortem toxicological investigation into violent death in South Africa. Contextually, it highlights the need for routine and comprehensive toxicology in these cases to strengthen research and service provision, so as to better understand the role of drugs in violent death.

ID RISK BEHAVIORS; ADOLESCENTS; SUBURBAN; VIOLENCE
AB Objectives. To document and compare prevalence rates of adolescent injury-related risk behaviours at six sites in South Africa.
   Design. The identical self-administered instrument was used at all sites. Prevalence rates (with 95% confidence intervals) were calculated taking the multistage cluster sampling strategy into account.
   Setting and subjects. In Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth and Mankweng participants were drawn from either grades 8 or 9, and grade 11, while in Queenstown and Umtata they were drawn from grade 11 only. We selected 39 schools in Cape Town and Durban, 33 in Port Elizabeth and 20 in each of the rural areas.
   Outcome measures. Road-related risk behaviour, violence, and suicide attempts.
   Results. Across the sites there were high rates of risk behaviour in all domains. For example, in the 12 months preceding the survey an estimated 52.8% of grade 11 males in Cape Town had travelled in the front seat of a motor vehicle without a seatbelt, 33.0% of grade 8 males in Mankweng had bullied others, while 44.5% of the same group had been bullied, and 18.6% of females in Port Elizabeth had attempted suicide. Rates were lower in rural areas for behaviour involving motor vehicles, but there were no consistent urban-rural findings for violence-related behaviour. Females were at higher risk of suicidal behaviour and males were at higher risk of other injury-related behaviour.
   Conclusions. There is a need for effective interventions to reduce the extent of injury-related risk behaviour in adolescents in urban and rural settings.

AB Objective. We assessed the effectiveness of South Africa's Firearm Control Act (FCA), passed in 2000, on firearmhomicide rates compared with rates of nonfirearm homicide across 5 South African cities from 2001 to 2005.
   Methods. We conducted a retrospective population-based study of 37 067 firearm and nonfirearm homicide cases. Generalized linear models helped estimate and compare time trends of firearm and nonfirearm homicides, adjusting for age, sex, race, day of week, city, year of death, and population size.
   Results. There was a statistically significant decreasing trend regarding firearm homicides from 2001, with an adjusted year-on-year homicide rate ratio of 0.864 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.848, 0.880), representing a decrease of 13.6% per annum. The year-on-year decrease in nonfirearm homicide rates was also significant, but considerably lower at 0.976 (95% CI = 0.954, 0.997). Results suggest that 4585 (95% CI = 4427, 4723) lives were saved across 5 cities from 2001 to 2005 because of the FCA.
   Conclusions. Strength, timing and consistent decline suggest stricter gun control mediated by the FCA accounted for a significant decrease in homicide overall, and firearm homicide in particular, during the study period.

AB Forensic anthropology is a rapidly growing field in South Africa and skeletal biologists are often called upon by the police to assist in personal identification front skeletal remains, which are recovered in Suspected cases of homicide and suicide and in mass disaster. Measurements of the calcaneus have been shown to be sexually dimorphic in South African whites. Since the validity of discriminant function equations in sex determination is population specific, the aim of the present study was to derive similar equations for the calcanei of the South African blacks. The bones that were used in this Study were obtained from the Raymond A. Dart Collection of Human Skeletons, School of Anatomical Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. One hundred and sixteen (116) intact and non-pathological calcanei, consisting of 58 males and 58 females and belonging to individuals whose age at death ranged between 22 and 75 years, were selected by the simple random sampling technique. The measured variables included the maximum length. the load arm length, the dorsal articular facet length, the body height, the maximum height, the cuboidal facet height. the middle breadth, the dorsal articular facet breadth and the maxim,urn breadth. Discriminant function analyses were done using the Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) program. All measured parameters of the calcaneus showed significant sexual differences. Length measurements were found to be the most sexually dimorphic. Combinations of variables provided better estimate of sex (79%-86%) than individual variable (64%-79%).

AB The association between suicidality and HIV/AIDS has been demonstrated for three decades, but little is know about risk factors that can help understand this association and help identify who is most at risk. Few research studies have been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, a region that accounts for more than 70% of the HIV global burden. This paper describes clinical risk factors for suicidality among individuals with HIV infection and AIDS disease in Mbarara, Uganda. In this study, suicidality includes both suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 543 HIV-positive individuals aged 15 years and above, recruited from 2 HIV specialised clinics in Mbarara. Using logistic regression analysis, factors significantly associated with suicidality at 95% confidence interval were identified. The rate of suicidality was 10% (n = 54; 95% CI: 5.00-15.00). Risk factors for suicidality were: perception of poor physical health (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.23-3.99, p = 0.007), physical pain (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.01-3.30, p = 0.049), reducing work due to illness (OR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.23-3.99, p = 0.004) and recent HIV diagnosis (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03, p = 0.001). These findings suggest that HIV/AIDS in south-western Uganda is associated with a considerable burden of suicidality. HIV is associated with several clinical factors that increase vulnerability to suicidality. There is need for more appropriate interventions targeting these clinical risk factors, systematic suicide risk assessment and management of suicidal ideation and behaviours in HIV care.

AB Community-based organizations (CBOs) have the potential to provide high quality services for orphaned and vulnerable children in resource-limited settings. However, evidence is lacking as to whether CBOs are reaching those who are most vulnerable, whether attending these organizations is associated with greater psychosocial wellbeing, and how they might work. This study addressed these three questions using cross-sectional data from 1848 South African children aged 9-13. Data were obtained from the Young Carers and Child Community Care studies, which both investigated child wellbeing in South Africa using standardized self-report measures. Children from the Child Community Care study were all CBO attenders, whereas children from Young Carers were not receiving any CBO services, thereby serving as a comparison group. Multivariable regression analyses were used to test whether children attending CBOs were more deprived on socio-demographic variables (e.g., housing), and whether CBO attendance was in turn associated with better psychosocial outcomes (e.g., child depression). Mediation analysis was conducted to test whether more positive home environments mediated the association between CBO attendance and significantly higher psychological wellbeing. Overall, children attending CBOs did show greater vulnerability on most socio-demographic variables. For example, compared to children not attending any CBO, CBO-attending children tended to live in more crowded households (OR 1.22) and have been exposed to more community violence (OR 2.06). Despite their heightened vulnerability, however, children attending CBOs tended to perform better on psychosocial measures: for instance, showing fewer depressive symptoms (B = -0.33) and lower odds of experiencing physical (OR 0.07) or emotional abuse (OR 022). Indirect effects of 030 attendance on significantly better child psychological wellbeing (lower depressive symptoms) was observed via lower rates of child abuse (B = 0.07) and domestic conflict/violence (B = -0.03) and higher rates of parental praise (B = -0.03). Null associations were observed between CBO attendance and severe psychopathology (e.g., suicidality). These cross-sectional results provide promising evidence regarding the potential success of CBO reach and impact but also highlight areas for improvement. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB The study aimed to investigate the extent to which social support-focused coping and resilience can predict lower risk for self-harm by at-risk adolescents. Participants were 962 high school learners from nine high schools in the Free State Province, South Africa (female = 57.9 %; black = 70.7 %; mean age = 16.34 years). They completed the Revised Coping Schemas Inventory and the Resiliency Scale for Children and Adolescents. Logistic regression analysis was computed to predict risk for self-harm from social support-focused coping and resilience. The results indicate that higher levels of social support predict lower risk for adolescent self-harm. Social support-oriented coping and resilience predicted tension-reduction and emotional reactivity. Social support-focused coping seems to have an influence in lowering the risk of self-harm amongst adolescents.

AB Background: Adolescents living with HIV represent a high-risk population for suicidal ideation and attempts, especially in low-income settings. Yet little is known about risk and protective factors for suicide in this population.
   Methods: A moderated mediation model was employed to test for potential (a) effects of stigma on suicidal ideation and attempts, both direct and mediated through depression and (b) direct and stress-buffering effects of social support resources on depression and suicidal ideation and attempts, among 1053 HIV-positive 10-19-year-old adolescents from a resource-scarce health district in South Africa. The survey data was collected using full community sampling of 53 clinics and tracing to over 180 communities. Effects of two support resources were tested: perceived support availability from the adolescents' social network and structured clinic support groups. Stigma was measured using the ALHIV-SS scale, depression through the CDI short form and social support through items from the MOS-SS.
   Results: Stigma was a risk factor for depression (B = 0.295; p < 001) and for suicidal thoughts and behaviour (B = 0.185; p < .001). Only perceived support availability was directly associated with less depression (B = -0.182, p < .001). However, both perceived support availability and support group participation contributed to the overall stress-buffering effects moderating the direct and indirect relationships between stigma and suicidal thoughts and behaviour.
   Limitations: The data used in this study was self-reported and cross-sectional.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that strengthening multiple social support resources for HIV-positive adolescents, through early clinic and community-based interventions, may protect them from experiencing poor mental health and suicidal tendencies.

AB Introduction
   Low and middle income countries bear the majority burden of self-harm, yet there is a paucity of evidence detailing risk-factors for self-harm in these populations. This study aims to identify environmental, socio-economic and demographic household-level risk factors for self-harm in five impoverished urban communities in Johannesburg, South Africa.
   Methods
   Annual serial cross-sectional surveys were undertaken in five impoverished urban communities in Johannesburg for the Health, Environment and Development (HEAD) study. Logistic regression analysis using the HEAD study data (2006-2011) was conducted to identify household-level risk factors associated with self-harm (defined as a self-reported case of a fatal or non-fatal suicide attempt) within the household during the preceding year. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to identify factors associated with self-harm.
   Results
   A total of 2 795 household interviews were conducted from 2006 to 2011. There was no significant trend in self-harm over time. Results from the final model showed that self-harm was significantly associated with households exposed to a violent crime during the past year (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 5.72; 95% CI 1.64-19.97); that have a member suffering from a chronic medical condition (AOR 8.95; 95% 2.39-33.56) and households exposed to indoor smoking (AOR 4.39; CI 95% 1.14-16.47).
   Conclusion
   This study provides evidence on household risk factors of self-harm in settings of urban poverty and has highlighted the potential for a more cost-effective approach to identifying those at risk of self-harm based on household level factors.

Methods We used a qualitative descriptive design and conducted unstructured interviews with 18 (n = 18) purposive selected participants. Data saturation determined the sample size. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the data. Results The majority of the sample were Black males; on average, 50.8 years (SD +/- 13.6) old. Two themes and eight subthemes arose from the data. The themes were living with the consequences of the illness and treatment, and coping with a changed life. The lives the participants knew before becoming sick changed and became a living hell; pain was a major problem as was eating and for some, communicating. The participants were stigmatised, ridiculed and rejected which added to their suffering. Receiving support from family and friends and their faith in God assisted them to cope with their changed lives. Conclusion Our study poses various challenges to clinical practice. Pain management is of the utmost importance; the nutritional status of these patients should be monitored and best practices in terms of management applied. Raising awareness of cancer and its complications could improve knowledge and decrease blame, stigmatisation and rejection and improve patient outcomes.

ID POLITICS
AB This article discusses the ANC's relationship with the youth-led township rebellion of the mid 1980s which has not received adequate attention in the existing literature on South African resistance politics. The argument made is that while the ANC lacked a physical presence in the townships and was thus unable to organise the uprisings, the appeal of its confrontational policies - and above all its armed struggle - meant it was accorded the mantle of symbolic leadership by the youths spearheading the fighting. The intangibility of mass consciousness and the difficulty of gauging it though conventional archival sources means the article relies heavily on the testimony of contemporary witnesses, and particularly journalists. The origins and dynamics of the uprising are investigated in the article and the gestation of the insurrection within the townships for almost a year before its eventual eruption is discussed, as is the manner in which the rebellion's lack of formal leadership proved to be its greatest strength by making it difficult to quell. The timeframe covered spans the first year of the uprising because it witnessed in microcosm the basic themes which dominated mass politics in South Africa for most of the following decade.

AB Background: Little is known about the pattern or risk factors for deaths from external causes in sub-Saharan Africa: there is a lack of reliable data, and public health priorities have been focussed on other causes. This study assessed the prevalence and risk factor for deaths from external causes in rural Malawi.
   Methods: We analysed data from 2002-2012 from the Karonga demographic surveillance site which covers similar to 35,000 people in rural northern Malawi. Verbal autopsies with clinician coding are used to assign cause of death. Repeated annual surveys capture data on socio-economic factors. Using Poisson regression models we calculated age, sex and cause-specific rates and rate ratios of external deaths. We used a nested case-control study, matched on age, sex and time period, to investigate risk factors for these deaths, using conditional logistic regression.
   Results: In 315,580 person years at risk (pyar) there were 2673 deaths, including 143 from external causes. The mortality rate from external causes was 47.1/100,000 pyar (95 % CI 32.5-68.2) among under-fives; 20.1/100,000 pyar (95 % CI 13.1-32.2) among 5-14 year olds; 46.3/100,000 pyar (95 % CI 35.8-59.9) among 15-44 year olds; and 98.7/100,000 pyar (95 % CI 71.8-135.7) among those aged >= 45 years. Drowning (including four deaths in people with epilepsy), road injury and suicide were the leading external causes. Adult males had the highest rates (100.7/100,000 pyar), compared to 21.8/100,000pyar in adult females, and the rate continued to increase with increasing age in men. Alcohol contributed to 21 deaths, all in adult males. Children had high rates of drowning (9.2/100,000 pyar, 95 % CI 5.5-15.6) but low rates of road injury (2.6/100,000 pyar, 95 % CI 1.0-7.0). Among 5-14 year olds, attending school was associated with fewer deaths from external causes than among those who had never attended school (adjusted OR 0.15, 95 % CI 0.08-0.81). Fishermen had increased risks of death from drowning and suicide compared to farmers.
   Discussion: In this population the rate of deaths from external causes was lowest at age 5-14 years. Adult males had the highest rate of death from external causes, 5 times the rate in adult females. Drowning, road injury and suicide were the leading causes of death; alcohol consumption contributed to more than one quarter of the deaths in men
   Conclusions: The high proportion of alcohol-related deaths in men, the predominance of drowning, deaths linked to uncontrolled epilepsy, and the possible protective effect of school attendance suggest areas for intervention.

AB Background: Menarche is the first menstrual cycle. Menstrual problems, such as dysmenorrheal menorrhagia, oligomenorrhea, and irregular cycle are common in female adolescents. This research aims to examine the associations between age at menarche and menstrual problems and suicidal behavior among Chinese female adolescents.
   Methods: An epidemiological survey of 5831 female adolescents from eight high schools of three counties of Shandong province, China, was conducted. A self-administered paper-and-pencil questionnaire was used to collect information. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between menstruation and suicidality.
   Results: The mean age of the sample was 15.02 (SD=1.44) years. Of the sample, 5,231 (90.0%) had experienced their first menstrual cycle, and 23.2%, 10.4%, and 4.5% of the sample reported having had suicidal ideation, plan and attempt, respectively. In multivariate models, menarche at <= 11 years was associated with increased risk of suicidal ideation (OR=1.41, 95%CI: 1.10-1.81) and menarche at 12 years was associated with suicide plan (OR=1.23, 95%CI: 1.00-1.51). Irregular menstrual cycle was significantly associated with increased risk of suicidal ideation (OR=1.40, 95%CI: 1.05-1.86) and menstrual period less than or equal to 4 days was significantly associated with increased risk of suicide plan (OR=1.32, 95%CI: 1.06-1.66).
   Limitations: This cross-sectional study cannot establish the causal directions between menstrual problems and suicidality in adolescents.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that earlier menarche, irregular menstrual cycle and short menstrual period are associated with suicidal behavior in female adolescents. Further research is warranted to examine the causal relationship between menstrual problems and suicidal behavior in adolescents.

AB Objective: Mortality in the psychiatric population, both from natural and unnatural causes, is higher than in the general population and this is despite an improvement in the delivery of care and treatment of mental illness in recent years The study was conducted to determine a profile of mortality and standardized mortality rates within our psychiatric hospital Method: A retrospective clinical case audit was conducted of deaths that occurred at Weskoppies Hospital between 1st January 2001 and 31st December 2005. Direct standardised mortality rates were calculated (gender specific adjusted for age according to the South African population) Results: A total of 164 deaths were observed during this period The gender-specific all cause mortality rates, standardised to the South African population, were 0 0177 (95% CI 0 0141, 0 0213) and 0 0163 (95% CI 0 0121, 0 0206) for males and females respectively The all cause mortality rates for the South African male and female population were 0 0188 and 0 0170 respectively (not significantly different as it falls within the 95% confidence interval of the standardised rates) The predominant natural cause of mortality was infection Ten of the deaths were due to unnatural causes, of these 7 were suicides The mortality ratio for unnatural causes was 0 47 Conclusion: Mortality studies are important tools for determining quality of health care provisions to patients Studies of this nature assist in making recommendations for optimal clinical practice and aid in developing preventative measures

AB BackgroundThe aim of the study was to identify trajectories of perinatal depressive symptoms and their predictors among women living in a low-resource setting in South Africa, and who present with a risk of depression during pregnancy.MethodsThis is a secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial among 384 women living in Khayelitsha, a low income setting in South Africa, recruited at their first antenatal visit if they scored 13 or above on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, were at least 18years of age, less than 29weeks pregnant and spoke isiXhosa. Participants were followed up at 8months gestation, 3 and 12months postpartum. Latent trajectories of depressive symptoms were identified using growth mixture modelling, based on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). There were no differences in HDRS scores between the control and intervention arms, so all participants were assessed together. Health, social and economic predictors of trajectories were investigated to identify high-risk groups with greater or more chronic depressive symptoms, using univariate logistic regression.ResultsTwo trajectories were identified: antenatal only (91.4%), with moderate to severe symptoms at baseline which later subside; and antenatal and postnatal (8.6%), with severe depressive symptoms during pregnancy and later in the postpartum period, which subside temporarily to moderate levels at 3months postpartum. Predictors for the antenatal and postnatal trajectory include severe food insecurity, intimate partner violence, lower social support, greater functional impairment, problematic drinking and suicide risk.ConclusionsA small proportion of women who are at risk for depression antenatally remain at risk throughout the perinatal period, and can be differentiated from those who show a natural remission. Identification and referral strategies should be developed with these findings in mind, especially given the limited mental health resources in low-income settings.

TI Trends in alcohol prevalence, age of initiation and association with
   alcohol-related harm among South African youth: Implications for policy
SO SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Objectives. To understand alcohol use trends and alcohol-related harm among youth in South Africa (SA) between 1998 and 2008, and discuss implications for the current alcohol policy process.
   Methods. A review was conducted of 4 national prevalence and 2 sentinel surveillance studies. Data were extracted to Epi Info (version 7) and chi-square analyses undertaken.
   Results. Lifetime alcohol use remained stable but high at 20 - 25% and 49.1 - 49.6% according to South African Demographic and Health Survey (SADHS) and Youth Risk Behaviour Survey (YRBS) data, respectively. Age of initiation remained stable; 12% of adolescents initiated alcohol use prior to age 13 years. Significant gender differences existed with more males having ever consumed alcohol, engaged in binge drinking, and driven or walked under the influence of alcohol (DUI and WUI, respectively). Binge drinking among females increased significantly from 27% to 36% (SADHS) and 1896 to 27% (YRBS). DUI and WUI increased. Homicide/violence, suicide and unintentional deaths were significantly associated with blood alcohol concentration (BAG).
   Conclusions. Although SA has made significant strides in alcohol control and prevention of alcohol-related harm over the past decade, early alcohol initiation remains a concern and binge drinking is increasing, especially among females. Significant associations exist between BAG and alcohol-related fatalities. Findings imply that regulatory policies are inadequate; additional efforts are required to ensure that control strategies translate into a reduction in harmful alcohol use by SA youth.

AB Criminal death incidence of women varies between developed and developing countries, and it has become a common public problem in almost every country. We do not have any data about femicide cases published in Turkey until today. In our study, we tried to call attention to femicide cases. In our study, we evaluated 141 cases of female homicides with an interval of 10 years between January 1996 and May 2005, retrospectively. Data retrieved were statistically evaluated using chi-square test. Most of the cases were between 21 and 35 years of age. Spouse murders are usually witnessed during the process of divorce. Establishment of institutions which will ensure the security of women during this period is of paramount importance. If we protect women during divorce and separation proceedings, we can prevent femicide cases. We also think that laws may be strengthened for protecting women who are vulnerable at such times.

AB Child sexual abuse is a worldwide concern. It is an insidious, persistent, and serious problem that, depending on the population studied and definition used, affects 2-62% of women and 3-16% of men as victims. Pain and tissue injury from child sexual abuse can completely heal in time, but psychological and medical consequences can persist through adulthood. Associated sexually transmitted diseases (such as HIV) and suicide attempts can be fatal. All physicians who treat children should be aware of the manifestations and consequences of child sexual abuse, and should be familiar with normal and abnormal genital and anal anatomy of children. This aim is best accomplished through training and routine examination of the anus and genitalia of children. Because as many as 96% of children assessed for suspected sexual abuse will have normal genital and anal examinations, a forensic interview by a trained professional must be relied on to document suspicion of abuse.

AB Background: Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) often present with epileptic seizures which carry standard mortality rate two to three folds higher than in the general population, yet preventative eradication of these lesions remains controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the demographic and angioarchitectural features associated with clinical presentation of seizures in patients with brain AVMs.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all consecutive patients who presented to three interventional neuroradiology hospitals, with brain AVMs in Kwazulu- Natal, South Africa, over a period of 10 years. The demographic and clinical presentations were derived from patient's electronic medical records. Radiological features were determined using axial Computerized Topography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scan. Angioarchitectural features were determined from Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA). Simple and multiple logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with the risk of seizure as initial presentation in brain AVMs.
   Results: The analysis identified race/ethnicity, nidus size and location as the predictors of seizure presentation. By multiple logistic regression analysis, African- black race (OR = 4.7; 95% CI: 1.15-19.60), brain AVM nidus > 3 cm in diameter, (OR=4.4; 95% CI: 1.7-11.42) and cortical lobar location (OR = 13.6; 95% CI: 2.80 - 65.14) were found to be significant predictors of brain AVM-associated seizures.
   Conclusion: Improved knowledge of specific morphological factors associated with brain AVM epilepsy could aid in the formulation of appropriate therapeutic strategies for control and/or cure of these brain AVM-associated seizures.

AB Background: Over the past two decades research on sexual and gender minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender; LGBT) health has highlighted substantial health disparities based on sexual orientation and gender identity in many parts of the world. We systematically reviewed the literature on sexual minority women's (SMW) health in Southern Africa, with the objective of identifying existing evidence and pointing out knowledge gaps around the health of this vulnerable group in this region.
   Methods: A systematic review of publications in English, French, Portuguese or German, indexed in PubMed or MEDLINE between the years 2000 and 2015, following PRISMA guidelines. Additional studies were identified by searching bibliographies of identified studies. Search terms included (Lesbian OR bisexual OR "women who have sex with women"), (HIV OR depression OR "substance use" OR "substance abuse" OR "mental health" OR suicide OR anxiety OR cancer), and geographical specification. All empirical studies that used quantitative or qualitative methods, which contributed to evidence for SMW's health in one, a few or all of the countries, were included. Theoretical and review articles were excluded. Data were extracted independently by 2 researchers using predefined data fields, which included a risk of bias/quality assessment.
   Results: Of 315 hits, 9 articles were selected for review and a further 6 were identified through bibliography searches. Most studies were conducted with small sample sizes in South Africa and focused on sexual health. SMW included in the studies were racially and socio-economically heterogeneous. Studies focused predominately on young populations, and highlighted substance use and violence as key health issues for SMW in Southern Africa.
   Conclusions: Although there are large gaps in the literature, the review highlighted substantial sexual-orientationrelated health disparities among women in Southern Africa. The findings have important implications for public health policy and research, highlighting the lack of population-level evidence on the one hand, and the impact of criminalizing laws around homosexuality on the other hand.

AB OBJECTIVE To investigate the prevalence and correlates of missed opportunities for addressing reproductive and mental health needs during patients' visits to primary healthcare facilities.
   METHODS We selected a random sample of participants from 14 of the 49 clinics in Cape Town's public health sector using stratified, cluster random sampling (n = 2618). Participants were screened to identify those at risk for unsafe sexual behaviour and a mental disorder (specifically substance use, depression, anxiety, and suicide). Information pertaining to whether or not respondents were asked about these issues during clinic visits during the previous year was elicited. The rates and correlates of missed opportunities for providing reproductive and mental health interventions were calculated.
   RESULTS The criteria of a strict definition of a missed opportunity for reproductive or mental health care information were fulfilled by 25% of the sample, while 46% met criteria for a looser definition. After adjusting for the effects of other variables in the model, men and Coloured respondents were more likely to have satisfied the definition of a missed opportunity for an intervention, while having completed high school and having children increased the likelihood of receiving an intervention.
   CONCLUSION Consultations with primary healthcare providers in which these issues are not discussed may represent missed opportunities. Persons presenting for routine care can be counselled, screened and, if required, treated. Interventions are needed at the patient, provider, and community levels to increase the opportunities to provide reproductive and mental health care to patients during routine visits.

TI Unnatural Deaths in South African Platinum Miners, 1992-2008

DT Article
ID ACCIDENTS; FATALITIES; INJURIES
AB Background: The mortality rate from unnatural deaths for South Africa is nearly double the world average. Reliable data are limited by inaccurate and incomplete ascertainment of specific causes of unnatural death. This study describes trends in causes of unnatural death between 1992 and 2008 in a cohort of South African miners.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The study used routinely-collected retrospective data with cause of death determined from multiple sources including the mine's human resources database, medical records, death registration, and autopsy. Cause-specific mortality rates and Poisson regression coefficients were calculated by calendar year and age group. The cohort included 40,043 men. One quarter of all 2937 deaths were from unnatural causes (n = 805). Causes of unnatural deaths were road traffic accidents 38% (109/100,000 py), homicides 30% (88/100,000 py), occupational injuries 17% (50/100,000 py), suicides 8% (24/100,000 py), and other accidents 6% (19/100,000 py). Rates of unnatural deaths declined by 2% (95% CI -4%,-1%) per year over the study period, driven by declining rates of road traffic and other accidents. The rate of occupational injury mortality did not change significantly over time (-2% per year, 95% CI -5%,+ 2%). Unnatural deaths were less frequent in this cohort of workers than in the South African population (IRR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.95), particularly homicides (IRR 0.48, 95% CI 0.42-0.55).
   Conclusions/Significance: Unnatural deaths were a common cause of preventable and premature death in this cohort of miners. While unnatural death rates declined between 1992 and 2008, occupational fatalities remained at a high level. Evidence-based prevention strategies to address these avoidable deaths are urgently needed.

AB Aims Suicidal behaviour is an under-reported and hidden cause of death in most low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) due to lack of national systematic reporting for cause-specific mortality, high levels of stigma and religious or cultural sanctions. The lack of information on non-fatal suicidal behaviour (ideation, plans and attempts) in LMIC is a major barrier to design and implementation of prevention strategies. This study aims to determine the prevalence of non-fatal suicidal behaviour within community- and health facility-based populations in LMIC.
   Methods Twelve-month prevalence of suicidal ideation, plans and attempts were established through community samples (n = 6689) and primary care attendees (n = 6470) from districts in Ethiopia, Uganda, South Africa, India and Nepal using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview suicidality module. Participants were also screened for depression and alcohol use disorder.
   Results We found that one out of ten persons (10.3%) presenting at primary care facilities reported suicidal ideation within the past year, and 1 out of 45 (2.2%) reported attempting suicide in the same period. The range of suicidal ideation was 3.5-11.1% in community samples and 5.0-14.8% in health facility samples. A higher proportion of facility attendees reported suicidal ideation than community residents (10.3 and 8.1%, respectively). Adults in the South African facilities were most likely to endorse suicidal ideation (14.8%), planning (9.5%) and attempts (7.4%). Risk profiles associated with suicidal behaviour (i.e. being female, younger age, current mental disorders and lower educational and economic status) were highly consistent across countries.
   Conclusion The high prevalence of suicidal ideation in primary care points towards important opportunities to implement suicide risk reduction initiatives. Evidence-supported strategies including screening and treatment of depression in primary care can be implemented through the World Health Organization's mental health Global Action Programme suicide prevention and depression treatment guidelines. Suicidal ideation and behaviours in the community sample will require detection strategies to identify at risks persons not presenting to health facilities.

AB Purpose: Globally, adolescents are at risk of depression, traumatic stress, and suicide, especially those living in vulnerable environments. This article examines the mental health of 15- to 19-year-old youth in five cities and identifies the social support correlates of mental health.
   Methods: A total of 2,393 adolescents aged 15-19 years in economically distressed neighborhoods in Baltimore, MD; New Delhi, India; Ibadan, Nigeria; Johannesburg, South Africa; and Shanghai, China were recruited in 2013 via respondent-driven sampling to participate in a survey using an audio computer-assisted self-interview. Weighted logistic regression and general linear models were used to explore the associations between mental health and social supports.
   Results: The highest levels of depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms were displayed in Johannesburg among females (44.6% and 67.0%, respectively), whereas the lowest were among New Delhi females andmales (13.0% and 16.3%, respectively). The prevalence of suicidal ideation ranged from 7.9% (New Delhi female adolescents) to 39.6% (Johannesburg female adolescents); the 12-month prevalence of suicide attempts ranged from 1.8% (New Delhi females) to 18.3% (Ibadan males). Elevated perceptions of having a caring female adult in the home and feeling connected to their neighborhoods were positively associated with adolescents' levels of hope across the sites while negatively associated with depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms with some variation across sites and gender.
   Conclusions: Adolescents living in the very economically distressed areas studied register high levels of depression and posttraumatic stress. Improving social supports in families and neighborhoods may alleviate distress and foster hope. In particular, strengthening supports from female caretakers to their adolescents at home may improve the outlooks of their daughters. (C) 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

TI Reviewing clinical psychology training in the post-apartheid period:
   Have we made any progress?
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SOUTH-AFRICA; HEALTH; SUICIDE
AB The recruitment and training of clinical psychologists remain important challenges for South African psychology in the post-apartheid period. Specifically, the challenges are to address issues of equity and redress, develop relevant policy, curricula and practices, and to produce graduates who are able and willing to work in the context of diversity and disadvantage. In this article we selectively review the progress made in responding to these challenges. Our conclusion is one of concern, since clinical psychology's track record in terms of training leaves much to be desired. While there. is a greater degree of engagement with issues of equity and access, training still remains racially skewed and redress is largely confined to simply providing institutional access. Furthermore, the 'silences' and paucity of attempts at transforming recruitment and selection processes, policy, curricula and training practices are of even greater concern. We argue that while there are constraints to transforming training in terms of the tensions and contradictions between mainstream professional training requirements, social conditions and 'relevant' discourses and practices, afar more substantive engagement with, and commitment to the fundamental issues are required. This review concludes with the assertion that clinical psychology is rapidly running out of time to remedy its deficiencies and maintain its respectability as a helping profession for the entire nation. Some tentative suggestions are offered for the way forward.

DE Burn fatalities; Pathology; Post mortem; Forensic; Autopsy; Demographics
ID MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; SOUTH-AFRICA; SHACK FIRES; PART I; BURNS;
   EPIDEMIOLOGY; MORTALITY; DEATH
AB In South Africa, research on burn mortality has emanated primarily from specialised burn centres and has focused on specific age groups and hospital-based fatalities. This study describes the demographic profile and the pathology of trauma related to burn fatalities as seen at the Pretoria Medico-Legal Laboratory (PTA MLL), a large urban medico-legal mortuary over a 5-year period from January 2011 to December 2015. Mortuary admission records and autopsy reports were used to gather information on demographics, circumstances of injury, apparent manner and cause of death, pathology of burns, toxicology and histology reports and identification of the decedents.
   Results: Of the 9558 unnatural deaths admitted to the PTA MLL during this time period, 291 (3.0%) of the fatalities met the inclusion criteria. The male:female ratio was 2.9:1. Most fatalities occurred between the ages of 0-4 years. One hundred and forty-two (142) decedents were charred beyond recognition. Identification was confirmed in 134 (94.4%) of the charred remains. In 208 (69.8%) of the cases the manner of death was deemed to be accidental, 23 (7.9%) were homicidal and 11 (3.8%) were suicides. Two hundred and fifty-five (87.4%) of the fatalities were as a result of open flames/fires. Shack fires were responsible for 105 (36%) of all fatalities. In 32 (11.0%) cases of open flame/fire fatalities where death occurred at the scene of injury, more than one fatality was reported per incident. In 122 (79.2%) of scene fatalities, soot deposition was noted in the upper and lower airways. Forty-five (32.8%) of hospital fatalities occurred within 24 h of admission. The most common complications in hospital fatalities were from the respiratory system. The mean blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) was 0.09 g/100 ml. The mean carboxyhaemoglobin concentrations (COHb) was 19.9%. All available cyanide results were negative.
   Conclusion: The study is the first of its kind in South Africa to generate bimodal descriptive statistics for burn fatalities. Approximately 3% of unnatural deaths at the PTA-MLL were due to burns, occurring at a rate of +/- 1 death per week. The data provides a platform for funding, collaborative research, planning and development of public health programs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

ID KWAZULU-NATAL PROVINCE; SUICIDE
AB Background: Self-harm behaviour is a major public health problem that is commonly underreported. This study reviews the spectrum of these self inflicted injuries managed by a major trauma centre in South Africa.
   Methods: A retrospective review of the regional trauma registry was undertaken over a five-year period from December 2012 to December 2017 at the Pietermaritzburg Metropolitan Trauma Service (PMTS) in South Africa. All patients who were admitted after they had sustained an injury as a result of self-harm were included.
   Results: During the five-year study period, a total of 179 patients were included. The mean age was 29 years (SD12) and there were 139 (77%) males and 40 (23%) females. Of these, 16 had a previously established psychiatric diagnosis and two had a prior history of having sustained self-harm. The previously diagnosed psychiatric illnesses included mood dysphoria disorders (5), schizophrenia (3), substance abuse and dependency (1), anti-social personality disorder (1) and unspecified (6). The mechanism was penetrating trauma in 47 (26%). The penetrating mechanisms included stab wounds (SW) in 33, gunshot wounds (GSW) in 10, broken glass in 2 and a single impalement. Blunt mechanisms accounted for the remaining 131 (73%) injuries. The most common mechanism of blunt self-harm was hanging in 101 patients. This was followed by vehicular related trauma (8), jumping in front of a train (1) and jumping from a height (1). In 17 patients the exact mechanism of the blunt trauma was unclear. There was no statistical difference in the mechanism of injury between male and female patients. There were 38 (28%) men and 9 (23%) women who sustained a penetrating injury and there were 100 (72%) male and 31 (78%) female patients who had a blunt mechanism of injury. A total of 53 CT scans were obtained, 40 chest X-rays, 9 abdominal X-rays and 2 ultrasounds. There were 113 neck injuries, 68 head injuries, 24 abdominal injuries, 15 upper limb and 15 lower limb injuries and four facial injuries. A total of 32 operations were performed. These included laparotomy (14), neck exploration (5), tracheostomy (4). A total of 22 patients developed a complication.
   Conclusion: Self-inflicted injury is not uncommon and frequently requires investigation and or surgical treatment. Patients who sustain such an injury constitute a distinct vulnerable group who are under researched. Future research on this vulnerable patient group is needed.

TI Paraquat poisoning: Acute lung injury - a missed diagnosis
SO SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Paraquat is a herbicide of great toxicological importance because it is associated with high mortality rates, mainly due to respiratory failure. We report the case of a 28-year-old man admitted to the casualty department at Ngwelezana Hospital, Empangeni, KwaZuluNatal, South Africa, with a history of vomiting and abdominal pain after ingestion of similar to 100 mL of an unknown substance, later identified as paraquat, together with an unknown amount of alcohol, in a suicide attempt. He developed respiratory distress associated with lung parenchymal infiltrates that required ventilatory support and later a spontaneous pneumothorax, and died in the intensive care unit. We discuss the importance of a high index of suspicion of paraquat poisoning in rural areas, where paraquat is readily available as a herbicide on farms, in patients with a similar presentation. We further stress the importance of identifying the classic radiological progression after paraquat poisoning, to help avoid a delay in diagnosis if the culprit substance is not known (as happened in our case). Lastly, we look at the importance of avoiding oxygen supplementation, and early administration of immunosuppressive therapy, to improve outcome.

AB Data reliability and validity are methodological concerns in cross-national analyses of crime, but there is little agreement on which source of data provides the most reliable estimates. Moreover, few studies have examined the potential threat to validity posed by unclassified deaths. The current study aims to (1) assess the reliability of cross-national homicide data from the United Nations (UN) and the World Health Organization (WHO); and (2) investigate the impact of unclassified deaths on the validity of WHO data. Findings indicate that UN and WHO homicide rates (n=56) differ in magnitude, but produce similar outcomes. The UN data produce more robust results and statistical models with less error. The WHO data are more stable and reliable over time, and better suited for longitudinal analyses. Analyses drawing on WHO data should not disregard unclassified deaths because their inclusion provides a more accurate estimate of the true number of homicides.

AB Can we die from shame? In what way is shame a feminist issue? How have contemporary artists explored the theme? Prompted by a news item that reported the death of a leading Korean actress, which was attributed to the shame of a role she had played in a recent movie, The Scarlet Letter, this article explores shame initially through a re-reading of Sigmund Freud's challenging theory of exuality (1905) in which he plots out the ways in which shame and disgrace come into being and specifically inflect the social management of women's adult sexuality. It then offers three case studies of ways in which contemporary artists from South Africa, Zanzibar/UK and Israel/France have explored aspects of historically created shame (apartheid and truth/reconciliation, enslavement, genocide and the Holocaust) through a variety of forms of art practice, not to submit their subjects to re-shaming, but to challenge the world to be ashamed of what has been done to diminish the humanity of those who are othered for gender, ethnicity, religion.

AB Background: Chronic substance use (CSU) is associated with health problems, including self-harm, placing a significant burden on health care resources and emergency departments (EDs). This is problematic in low-and middle-income countries like South Africa (SA), where primary care facilitates and emergency departments (EDs) are often poorly resourced.
   Aim: To investigate the epidemiology of CSU and self-harm and to consider the implications for primary health care service delivery and suicide prevention in SA.
   Methods: Data were collected from 238 consecutive self-harm patients treated at the emergency department (ED) of an urban hospital in SA. The data were analysed using bivariate and multivariate analyses.
   Results: Approximately 37% of self-harm patients reported CSU. The patients in the CSU subgroup, compared to other self-harm patients, were more likely to be men (odds ratio [OR] = 8.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.19-20.9, p < 0.001), to have self-harmed by inflicting damage to their body tissue OR = 4.45, 95% CI = 1.77-11.2, p < 0.01) and to have a history of self-harm (OR = 3.71, 95% CI = 1.44-9.54, p = 0.007). A significantly smaller proportion of CSU patients, compared to other self-harm patients, were referred for psychiatric assessment (OR = 8.05, 95% CI = 4.16-15.7, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: The findings of this study confirm that CSU is associated with greater service utilisation and repetition of self-harm among patients in primary health care settings. Treating self-harm as the presenting problem within primary care settings does not necessarily ensure that patients receive the care that they need. It might be helpful to include psychiatric assessments and screening for CSU as an integral component of care for self-harm patients who present in primary health care settings.

AB Background: As part of a situational analysis for a research programme on the integration of mental health care into primary care (Programme for Improving Mental Health Care-PRIME), we conducted a baseline study aimed at determining the broad indicators of the population level of psychosocial distress in a predominantly rural community in Ethiopia.
   Methods: The study was a population-based cross-sectional survey of 1497 adults selected through a multi-stage random sampling process. Population level psychosocial distress was evaluated by estimating the magnitude of common mental disorder symptoms (CMD; depressive, anxiety and somatic symptoms reaching the level of probable clinical significance), harmful use of alcohol, suicidality and psychosocial stressors experienced by the population.
   Results: The one-month prevalence of CMD at the mild, moderate and severe threshold levels was 13.8%, 9.0% and 5.1% respectively. The respective one-month prevalence of any suicidal ideation, persistent suicidal ideation and suicide attempt was 13.5%, 3.8% and 1.8%. Hazardous use of alcohol was identified in 22.4%, significantly higher among men (33.4%) compared to women (11.3%). Stressful life events were widespread, with 41.4% reporting at least one threatening life event in the preceding six months. A similar proportion reported poor social support (40.8%). Stressful life events, increasing age, marital loss and hazardous use of alcohol were associated with CMD while stressful life events, marital loss and lower educational status, and CMD were associated with suicidality. CMD was the strongest factor associated with suicidality [e.g., OR (95% CI) for severe CMD = 60.91 (28.01, 132.48)] and the strength of association increased with increase in the severity of the CMD.
   Conclusion: Indicators of psychosocial distress are prevalent in this rural community. Contrary to former assumptions in the literature, social support systems seem relatively weak and stressful life events common. Interventions geared towards modifying general risk factors and broader strategies to promote mental wellbeing are required.

TI Violence against Women and Mental Health
SO VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND MENTAL HEALTH
SE Key Issues in Mental Health
LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
AB This chapter provides a brief overview of the book contents and highlights the policy and programmatic implications. The book provides substantial evidence of the pervasiveness of violence against women across the world. The first section includes a global overview of the prevalence and consequences of violence against women and various regional perspectives from Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, and South Africa. All of the chapters highlight how social, cultural and economic factors, particularly gender inequality and women's low status in society, are root causes of this violence and affect women's mental health directly as well. The chapters in the second section of the book document the burden of mental ill health among women who have experienced different forms of violence sexual abuse in childhood, intimate partner violence (IPV), sexual violence; similarly with violence in different settings such as in conflict and among migrants and refugees. Other chapters address violence against women with severe psychiatric illness, sexual abuse perpetrated on patients by health professionals and suicide and intimate partner violence. In spite of this evidence, most mental health policies and programmes do not systematically include consideration of violence issues. Furthermore, mental health services are sorely lacking in low and middle income countries. This is a call for more awareness, for changes in the system and integration of violence issues into mental health policies and into the training curricula for mental health care providers. Increased attention to the primary prevention of all forms of violence is also urgently needed. Copyright (C) 2013 WHO*

AB Intimate partner violence (IPV) is an important cause of women's health and socio-familial severe problems, the most extreme being the victims' homicide. This is the first nationwide Portuguese autopsy-based and judicial-proven study about female intimate partner homicide.
   At least 62 women over 15 years old were killed by current or former men-intimate partners, corresponding to an IPV-related female mortality rate of 0.44/100.000 women; intimate partner violence was the reason of homicide in 60.8% of all autopsied women.
   The typical Portuguese victim showed to be a young adult woman, employed, killed by a current husband in a long-term relationship, usually with children in common and with a history of previous IPV. The typical Portuguese perpetrator showed to be older than the victim, employed, owning a firearm and without criminal records. At the time of the fatal event 59.7% of the relationships were current. In 57.9% of the former relationships women were killed during the 1st year after its terminus. Near half of the perpetrators attempted or committed suicide afterward. Most women were killed by gunshot wounds (45.2%), especially in the thorax (48.4%), with multiple fatal injuries; 56.5% also presented non-fatal injuries.
   The detection of prior IPV and the risk evaluation seems to be fundamental to decrease these fatal outcomes, but also, the prevention of perpetrators' alcohol abuse and carrying weapons. This work emphasizes the need to deepen the research on this issue, aiming to contribute to prevent both fatal and non-fatal IPV-related cases.

TI Gendered risk factors associated with self-harm mortality among youth in
   South Africa, 2006-2014
SO SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID ILLICIT DRUG-USE; SUICIDE MORTALITY; HEALTH; EPIDEMIOLOGY; CHILDREN
AB Background. Despite efforts to reduce self-harm mortality, death rates remain high, with almost 12% of all youth deaths in South Africa (SA) attributed to this cause. There are gendered differences in causes of death among youth, but little is known about the sex-specific risk factors.
   Objective. To identify the levels and sex-specific determinants of self-harm mortality among youth in SA.
   Methods. This was a cross-sectional study of SA death notification forms from 2006 to 2014. Descriptive and analytical statistical techniques were used, including cause-specific mortality rates, proportional mortality ratios and logistic regression models.
   Results. A total of 1 122 youth (15 - 24 years of age) deaths due to self-harm causes were reported over the study period, during which rates of self-harm mortality increased. More deaths of males (n=818) than females (n=304) were reported. Almost 60% of deaths (p<0.05) were of 20 -24-year-olds, and 46.4% (p<0.05) of those who died had a secondary education. Almost 10% of females (p<0.05) were pregnant at the time of death. Hanging was the most common type of self-harm mortality among males (79.2%) and females (49.3%). While 11.0% (n=90) of self-harm deaths of males were due to poisoning, more females used this method (39.8%, n=121). The probability of self-harm mortality for males increased according to certain provinces of residence. For females the odds were higher for those who were pregnant (odds ratio (OR) 1.3; p<0.05) and non-South African (OR 1.7; p<0.05) and had secondary education (OR 1.4; p<0.05).
   Conclusions. The study showed gender differentials in the determinants of self-harm mortality among youth in SA. For this reason, uniform approaches to awareness campaigns need to be altered to address the specific needs of youth. While males have higher rates than females, the prevalence of self-harm mortality in pregnant females is of concern and needs to be addressed specifically, as it relates not only to suicidal ideation and behaviour but also to youth sexual and reproductive health programmes in the country.

ID AIDS; SEROPREVALENCE; INFECTION
AB The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of suicidal ideation in patients who were tested for HIV-infection and whether along with their HIV status, age and gender influenced their risk for suicidal ideation. The sample consisted of 189 patients who attended a voluntary HIV counseling and testing clinic (VCT) at a general state hospital in Durban, South Africa. Their mean age at baseline was 34.2 years, with an age range of between 16-79 years. Seropositivity, age and gender were significantly associated with suicidal ideation. The majority of these patients were in the younger age group, and young males had a 1.8 times higher risk for suicidal ideation than females. Although risk factors for seropositive-related suicidal ideation can be complex and multi-factorial, this study identified a young age and male gender as important high risk factors in the sample studied. It is recommended that all, but especially young male HIV-infected patients seen at a VCT clinic be screened for suicidal ideation and that early intervention to prevent subsequent suicides or suicidal attempts be included in pre- and post-test HIV counseling.

AB More than 85% of the world's population lives in 153 low-income and middle-income countries (LAMICs). Although country-level information on mental health systems has recently become available, it still has substantial gaps and inconsistencies. Most of these countries allocate very scarce financial resources and have grossly inadequate manpower and infrastructure for mental health. Many LAMICs also lack mental health policy and legislation to direct their mental health programmes and services, which is of particular concern in Africa and South East Asia. Different components of mental health systems seem to vary greatly, even in the same-income categories, with some countries having developed their mental health system despite their low-income levels. These examples need careful scrutiny to derive useful lessons. Furthermore, mental health resources in countries seem to be related as much to measures of general health as to economic and developmental indicators, arguing for improved prioritisation for mental health even in low-resource settings. Increased emphasis on mental health, improved resources, and enhanced monitoring of the situation in countries is called for to advance global mental health.

AB Background: Not much is known about the risk factors of major depressive disorder (MDD) in HIV/AIDS in the African socio-cultural context. Therefore a study was undertaken to examine the prevalence and risk factors of MDD in HIV/AIDS in semi-urban Uganda.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was undertaken among 618 respondents attending two HIV clinics in Uganda.
   Results: Prevalence of MDD was 8.1%. Factors associated with MDD at univariate analysis only were female gender, family history of mental illness, negative coping style, alcohol dependency disorder, food insecurity and stress; not associated with MDD were social support, neurocognitive impairment, CD4 counts and BMI. Factors independently associated with MDD were psychosocial impairment, adverse life events, post traumatic stress disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and life-time attempted suicide.
   Conclusion: Psychological and social factors were the main risk factors of MDD among ambulatory HIV positive persons with no evidence for the role of the neurotoxic effects of HIV. Treatment approaches for MDD in this patient group should be modeled on those used among non-HIV groups.

AB This study analyses the incidences and patterns of paraquat poisoning from calls received at the Malaysia National Poison Centre (NPC) since 2004 following the ban of the herbicide (2004-2006) and subsequent restriction up to year 2015. Related reported cases to the centre over twelve years (2004-2015) were retrieved and studied in respect to socio-demographic characteristics, mode and type of poisonings, exposure routes and location of incident. Ages of poisoned victims range from 10 months old to 98 years with males being intoxicated more frequently than females (ratio male to female = 2.7). The age group mainly involved in the poisoning was 20-39 years. The most common mode was intentional (62.8%) followed by unintentional (36.9%). Among the 1232 reported cases, suicidal poisoning was the highest (57.2%); accidental poisoning (30.8%) and occupational poisoning (3.3%). The findings showed an upward trend of suicidal poisoning over the years, clearly emphasizing the need for more stringent and effective enforcement to ensure the safe use of paraquat.

AB INTRODUCTION The Pietermaritzburg Metropolitan Trauma Service (PMTS) has run a systematic quality improvement programme since 2006. A key component included the development and implementation of an effective surveillance system in the form of an electronic surgical registry (ESR). This study used data from the ESR to review the incidence, spectrum and outcome of paediatric trauma in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.
   METHODS The ESR was reviewed, and all cases of paediatric trauma managed between 1 January 2012 and 30 July 2014 were retrieved for analysis.
   RESULTS During the study period, 1,041 paediatric trauma patients (724 male, 69.5%) were managed by the PMTS, averaging a monthly admission of 36. The mean age was 10.9 years (standard deviation: 5.4 years). The mechanism of injury (MOI) was blunt trauma in 753 patients (72.3%) and penetrating trauma in 170 (16.3%). Pedestrian vehicle collisions accounted for 21% of cases and motor vehicle collisions for a further 11%. Intentional trauma accounted for 282 patients (27.1%) and selfinflicted trauma for 14 cases (1.3%). Ninety patients admitted to the intensive care unit and fifty-one required high dependency unit admission. There were 17 deaths, equating to an in-hospital mortality rate of 1.7%. A total of 172 children died on the scene of an incident. There were 35 road traffic related deaths, 26 suicides by hanging, 27 deaths from blunt assault and 23 deaths from penetrating assault. The overall mortality rate for paediatric trauma was 18.2%.
   CONCLUSIONS The ESR has proved to be an effective surveillance system and has enabled the accurate quantification of the burden of paediatric trauma in Pietermaritzburg. This has improved our understanding of the mechanisms and patterns of injury, and has identified a high incidence of intentional and penetrating trauma as well as road traffic collisions. These data can be used to guide strategies to reduce the burden of paediatric trauma in our environment.

ID PARENTAL ACCEPTANCE; SENSITIVITY; ATTACHMENT; ABUSE
AB South African society is perceived as violent, with an average murder rate significantly higher than in the rest of the world. The family is a core system within the broader community and is traditionally seen as a safe environment. The reality, however, is that a high percentage of all murders is committed by someone known to the family or a member of a family or household. The aim of the article is to understand the child who commits family murder by determining the contributing individual and systemic factors that lead to family murder. A qualitative research design was followed and qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the data.
   The case presented in this article to illustrate the typical characteristics of children who committed family murder formed part of a PhD study in educational psychology. Although each case of family murder has unique features, similar characteristics are often present in all these cases, and it is hoped that this case study will increase insight into the general characteristics of this phenomenon.
   Simone (pseudonym), whose case is described in this article, was subjected to severe family dysfunction and physical abuse by her father and grandmother. She had an ambivalent relationship with her grandmother, who was sometimes caring but sometimes abused her verbally. Simone also had to perform adult duties from an early age, having to collect money for her grandmother at nightclubs her grandmother owned. Her mother did not intervene when the grandmother took over the care of Simone. When Simone was 10 years old, her father committed suicide. Two days before the suicide the father discussed his feelings and suicide plans with Simone. Simone's grandmother blamed Simone for her father's suicide. At the age of twelve, Simone slipped sleeping tablets into her grandmother's tea. She approached two unknown men on the street and persuaded them to kill her grandmother, who, she told them, had murdered her parents. In return she promised the men household goods and sexual intercourse. The men agreed to commit the murder and followed Simone to the grandmother's home where she was asleep due to the medication she had been given. Simone was in the next room when the men strangled her grandmother. Not being convinced that her grandmother was dead, she gave the men a kitchen knife and insisted they slit her grandmother's throat as well. The men subsequently each received 25-year prison sentences. For her role in the murder of her grandmother Simone received 36 months' correctional supervision, suspended for 7 years. She became South Africa's youngest female murder accomplice.
   The general characteristics of children who commit family murder (including this case study) relate to weak or no attachment to the primary caregiver. This, as well as the accumulated individual and environmental stressors, lead to feelings and perceptions of rejection. A safe and supportive family environment is often absent; the child's emotional needs are not acknowledged. These children are often not supported when they experience loss. Family dysfunction, which includes abuse and extreme parenting styles, is evident. The accumulated stressors often lead to feelings of anxiety and aggression. The individual and systemic stressors accumulate over several years and result in murder at a seemingly "unimportant" moment.

AB Depression, crime, eating disorders, substance abuse, stress, violence, suicide, promiscuity, self-harm, and learning difficulties are an all too familiar sign of our times amongst children. We cannot deny the fact that the lifestyles of nations throughout the world are being transformed by technological and cultural advancements at such a fast pace that we are seeing a negative impact on our younger generations ability to think, learn and behave. Without positive intervention that embraces the positive side of technological advancement, young children run the risk of growing up too quickly and becoming desensitized emotionally and socially.
   As a modern day society, we need to acknowledge that communal life involves certain laws and principals that an individual cannot get around and that we all need a community in order to survive both mentally and physically. (Adler: 1927) In light of this, we cannot discount the fact that excessive exposure to unfiltered modern technology channels many of which are abused, are eroding childhood and forcing our younger generation to absorb on a subconscious level the messages of social degeneration. Zig Ziglar (1985: 32) was instrumental in identifying some of our negative environmental factors that have the ability to change the way our children think, learn and behave. His concern however, was identifying who is responsible for creating a learning opportunity for the characteristics necessary to be successful in life.
   South Africa boasts a nation of almost 50 million people with a diversity of cultures, 11 official languages, and a vast disparity in demographics. Through innovation, progressive tools and hands on skills training, a preventative training programme in South Africa has found an answer to assisting children from all demographics to living up to their inherent potential in a demanding society. With targeted objectives that embrace individuality and leadership potential, this paper intends to share the experiences of working within a nation that exhibits a large amount of resilience despite negative circumstantial influences equivalent to its first world counterparts.
   The investigation was conducted over a one year period between January to December 2011 in the Free State Province. As a sampling procedure, children with one or more identified barriers to learning were targeted. The age range of these learners was in the pre-teen and early teen developmental phase between age 12 and 14. The data was obtained from an independently run and privately owned life skills training facilitiy in the chosen demographic area. The training facilities use the same methods of assessment, namely being an online measurement tool for completion by parents during a 20 minute session within the home or office environment. The online assessment, consisting of 10 specific lifestyle areas was completed pre and post intervention to determine the levels of lifestyle balance and stress management in the child's life.
   This paper will highlight the trends in the pressures imposed on our children in South Africa through the analysis of pre and post course South African data allowing us to analyse how stress relating to life impacts on behaviour, confidence and social skills.

AB Death resulting from burns is an important social problem and a frequent accident. However, because approximately 10% of cases are estimated to result from a fire that was deliberately started, all fire-related deaths should be treated as suspicious, and the cause of a fire should be investigated. For the bodies recovered from the scene of a fire, the manner of death could also be suicide or homicide. The objective of this study was to contribute to the clarification of controversial data present in the literature on the manner of death determination of fire-related deaths, through evaluation of autopsy findings of bodies recovered from fires. We reviewed 20,135 autopsies performed in a 5-year period, in Istanbul, as the whole autopsy data of the city and found 133 fire-related deaths. The death scene investigation reports and other judicial documents, autopsy fmdings, and toxicological analysis results were evaluated to determine the parameters of age, sex, level of the burn, vital signs [red flare; soot in the lower respiratory tract, esophagus, and/or stomach; and screening of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels in the blood], toxicological substances, presence of accelerants, cause of death, and manner of death. The manner of death was determined to be an accident in 98 (73.7%) and homicide in 12 (9%) cases, whereas there was no suicide. In addition, it could not be determined in 23 (17.2%) cases. In accidental deaths, the most frequent cause of death was COHb poisoning with statistically significant blood COHb levels greater than 10%. Further, the presence of soot in the lower respiratory tract, esophagus, and/or stomach and the existence of at least 1 or 2 vital signs together were found to be valid deterministic criteria with statistical significance in terms of identifying the manner of death.

AB Background: A common method engaged in suicide is deliberate self-poisoning (DSP). Substances implicated in DSP include prescription and over-the-counter medicines, drugs, household chemicals, agrochemicals and herbal mixtures. Few studies have been conducted on DSP in South Africa, despite its occurrence and high management cost. This study aimed to determine the profile of patients treated for DSP at the emergency department of Pelonomi Regional Hospital, Bloemfontein, between January 2010 and July 2011. A profile of DSP cases will allow practitioners in this region to be aware of the magnitude, causes and common substances used, which will enable them to plan and execute an adequate management protocol to reduce mortality. Methods: This was a retrospective, descriptive study. All DSP patients treated during the 18-month study period were identified from the emergency department register. The clinical files of these patients were reviewed and relevant information captured. Results: In total, 260 DSP patients presented at the emergency department. Files for 212 (81.5%) patients had sufficient information and were included in the study. Two-thirds (66.0%, n = 140) of the patients were female and the highest percentage was in the age group 20-29 years (44.8%, n = 94). Most patients were black (81.1%, n = 150). Most resided in areas associated with low socioeconomic status, including informal settlements, farms and townships. The highest percentage of patients took paracetamol (21.7%, n = 46), while 19.3% (n = 41) ingested household chemicals and 9.9% (n = 21) antiretroviral medication. Only 81 of the 212 patient files had the reason for the DSP captured. Of these, half (49.4%) reported troubled relationships. Conclusion: This study showed that DSP mostly occurred among females in the age group 20-29 years. Most of the patients resided in areas with poor socioeconomic status, and faced relationship, marital, employment and other psycho-socioeconomic problems.

AB A 57-year-old man attempted a suicide self-inflicting multiple scissors stab wounds in the chest. At the scene, Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) showed an important left pleural effusion and pericardial fluid. Computed Tomography Angiography confirmed the pericardial effusion. The patient underwent immediate surgery. Three epicardial wounds of the anterior surface of the right ventricle were identified, one of which was actively bleeding. The lesion was sutured, the patient recovered uneventfully, and on the sixth postoperative day was transferred to a psychiatric unit. At 6-month follow-up, he is doing well and has returned to work. We discuss the importance of FAST for an early diagnosis of chest penetrating trauma leading to a rapid life-saving cardiac procedure and propose a clinical-based protocol for the management of patients with suspected penetrating cardiac injury which we have applied in our service for last six years. Midline sternotomy should be considered the incision of choice in patients with penetrating trauma in the cardiac box with evidence of injury to the heart and great vessels. Emergency Department Thoracotomy can be a possible option for those patients with impending cardiac arrest despite adequate resuscitation.

AB Seedless grapes are generally preferred by consumers for fresh consumption. The development of new seedless selections utilizing stenospermy, has been recognized as a key factor in Vitis vinifera breeding programs throughout the world. The Department of Fruit Tree Breeding and Genetic at the Volcani Center is actively involved in breeding of early and late seedless grapes. Special emphasis is given to the time of ripening, firmness, high sugar content, special aromas, loose and uniform bunches, natural big berries, good shelf life and reduced labor costs. We utilized advanced techniques for embryo rescue and hardening in order to improved the efficiency of our cross hybridization program.
   Several years ago we have developed, registered and released for commercial growth several new selections. Some of these cultivars were found to be rather promising: Results obtained from the testing of "Prime", "Mystery", Spring Blush and "Black-finger" under different climatic conditions in Chile, South Africa and Israel are presented. The role of the seeded East-European cultivar "Yantar" in the inheritance of early ripening will be discussed.
   In parallel to the conventional breeding studies, we have established a biotechnological approach for the improvement of table grapes.
   Using seed-coat and embryo specific promoters we have overexpressed the egg avidin in transformed grapes. Ablation of seeds indicated that avidin can be utilized successfully as a suicide gene.

AB Why do the Swazi people call the condom lijazi lemkhwenyana-the son-in-law's coat? Why is a man prohibited from entering the precincts of his in-laws if he is not wearing a coat or jacket or at least some long-sleeved item of clothing? Why is a man whose mental faculties have been enfeebled by a love spell said to be wearing a metallic coat? Why does David Masondo give a prospective one-night stand his jacket to ensure that she cannot slip through his fingers as she has done before? What empowers Can Themba's character Philemon in The Suit (To Kill a Man's Pride and Other Short Stories from South Africa. Johannesburg: Ravan, 1984) to drive his wife to suicide by torturing her through her secret lover's suit? In this article, I explore the sartorial valence of what is essentially a single item of men's dress: the coat/suit jacket/jacket. The black masculinities in question here are predominantly Swazi, although other southern African groups are touched upon. I argue that this thick upper-body covering of the male body, initially introduced by colonial modernity, has become so entrenched in the dress ethics of Swazi (and other) masculinities that, as a wardrobe item, it has come to embody the force of the masculine subject.

AB Background: An estimated 350 million people live with depression worldwide. In Mozambique, there are no national data quantifying the burden of mental illnesses. With the sixth highest suicide rate in the world, there is strong evidence of an unmet mental health need. We conducted a survey to measure the prevalence of depression among female heads of household and assess individual, social, and cultural risk factors associated with a positive depression screening.
   Methods: This survey was conducted across 14 rural districts in central Mozambique in 2014. We gathered information from 3543 female heads of household (100% response rate) on > 500 variables, including a depression screening tool (PHQ-8). Weighted percentages of survey responses are reported.
   Results: Among female heads of household, 14% screened positive for depression (PHQ-8 score >= 10). Our adjusted models show increased odds of depression per additional year of age (aOR: 1.02 [1.01, 1.04]; p = 0.002), additional year of education (aOR: 1.06 [1.02, 1.11]; p = 0.006), and additional kilometer from the nearest clinic (aOR: 1.05 [1.02, 1.07]; p = < 0.001). Experiencing food insecurity (aOR: 1.05 [1.02, 1.08]; p = 0.003) was associated with increased odds of depression. Being single (aOR: 0.42 [0.29, 0.60]) or divorced/widowed/separated (aOR: 0.57 [0.34, 0.98]; p < 0.001) vs. married was protective against depression, as was a perceived "sufficient" household income (aOR: 0.37 [0.19, 0.69]; p = 0.008).
   Limitations: Social desirability bias may have led women to underreport feelings of depression.
   Conclusions: The association of more education and marriage with increased odds of depression may reflect a frustration with limited opportunity for success experienced by some women in rural Mozambique.

AB Introduction: Intentional self-poisoning is a significant part of the toxicological burden experienced by emergency centres. The aim of this study was to describe all adults presenting with intentional self-poisoning over a six-month period to the resuscitation unit of Khayelitsha Hospital, Cape Town.
   Methods: Adult patients with a diagnosis of intentional self-poisoning between 1 November 2014 and 30 April 2015 were retrospectively analysed after eligible patients were obtained from the Khayelitsha Hospital Emergency Centre database. Missing data and variables not initially captured in the database were retrospectively collected by means of a chart review. Summary statistics were used to describe all variables.
   Results: A total of 192 patients were included in the analysis. The mean age was 27.3 years with the majority being female (n=132, 68.8%). HIV-infection was a comorbidity in 39 (20.3%) patients, while 13 (6.8%) previously attempted suicide. Presentations per day of the week were almost equally distributed while most patients presented after conventional office hours (n=152, 79.2%), were transported from home (n=124, 64.6%) and arrived by ambulance (n=126, 65.6%). Patients spend a median time of 3h37m in the resuscitation unit (interquartile range 1 h 45m-7 h 00 m; maximum 65 h 49 m). Patient acuity on admission was mostly low according to both the Triage Early Warning Score (non-urgent n=100, 52.1%) and the Poison Severity Score (minor severity n=107, 55.7%). Pharmaceuticals were the most common type of toxin ingested (261/ 343, 76.1%), with paracetamol the most frequently ingested toxin (n=48, 25.0%). Eleven patients (5.7%) were intubated, 27 (14.1%) received N-acetylcysteine, and 18 (9.4%) received benzodiazepines. Fourteen (7.3%) patients were transferred to a higher level of care and four deaths (2%) were reported.
   Discussion: Intentional self-poisoning patients place a significant burden on emergency centres. The high percentage of low-grade acuity patients managed in a high-acuity area is of concern and should be investigated further.

AB Objective: Not much is known about the role of different traumatic events in predicting suicidal outcomes. We investigated the association of specific traumatic events with different suicidal outcomes.
   Method: Data are from the Nigerian Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being, a multistage probability household survey of persons aged 18 years and over. Information on traumatic events and suicidal behaviours (ideation, plan and attempts) was collected in face-to-face interviews using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI.3) from a subsample of the respondents (N = 2143).
   Results: At least one traumatic event was reported by 63% of the sample. Traumatic events were more likely to have been experienced by individuals with different suicidal outcomes, with a dose-response relationship between the number of traumatic events and suicide ideation. The risks of suicidal ideation were elevated among persons with a history of combat experience (OR 6.3 95% CI 1.8-21.8) and those with exposure to war (OR 4.2; 95% CI 1.610.6), while that of suicidal attempt was increased among persons with experience of interpersonal violence (OR 4.3; 95% CI 1.4-13.0).
   Conclusion: Traumatic events are common in the general population. This report highlights the role of traumatic events (especially those related to violence) in predicting suicidal behaviour.

AB Background and aimsAlcohol use is a major contributor to injuries, mortality and the burden of disease. This review updates knowledge on risk relations between dimensions of alcohol use and health outcomes to be used in global and national Comparative Risk Assessments (CRAs).
   MethodsSystematic review of reviews and meta-analyses on alcohol consumption and health outcomes attributable to alcohol use. For dimensions of exposure: volume of alcohol use, blood alcohol concentration and patterns of drinking, in particular heavy drinking occasions were studied. For liver cirrhosis, quality of alcohol was additionally considered. For all outcomes (mortality and/or morbidity): cause of death and disease/injury categories based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes used in global CRAs; harm to others.
   ResultsIn total, 255 reviews and meta-analyses were identified. Alcohol use was found to be linked causally to many disease and injury categories, with more than 40 ICD-10 three-digit categories being fully attributable to alcohol. Most partially attributable disease categories showed monotonic relationships with volume of alcohol use: the more alcohol consumed, the higher the risk of disease or death. Exceptions were ischaemic diseases and diabetes, with curvilinear relationships, and with beneficial effects of light to moderate drinking in people without heavy irregular drinking occasions. Biological pathways suggest an impact of heavy drinking occasions on additional diseases; however, the lack of medical epidemiological studies measuring this dimension of alcohol use precluded an in-depth analysis. For injuries, except suicide, blood alcohol concentration was the most important dimension of alcohol use. Alcohol use caused marked harm to others, which has not yet been researched sufficiently.
   ConclusionsResearch since 2010 confirms the importance of alcohol use as a risk factor for disease and injuries; for some health outcomes, more than one dimension of use needs to be considered. Epidemiological studies should include measurement of heavy drinking occasions in line with biological knowledge.

AB Background: Injuries rank high among the leading causes of death and disability annually, injuring over 50 million and killing over 5 million people globally. Approximately 90% of these deaths occur in developing countries.
   Objectives: To estimate and identify the risk factors for injury mortality in the Rufiji Health and Demographic Surveillance System (RHDSS) in Tanzania.
   Methods: Secondary data from the RHDSS covering the period 2002 and 2007 was examined. Verbal autopsy data was used to determine the causes of death based on the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Trend and Poisson regression tests were used to investigate the associations between risk factors and injury mortality.
   Results: The overall crude injury death rate was 33.4/100 000 population. Injuries accounted for 4% of total deaths. Men were three times more likely to die from injuries compared with women (adjusted IRR (incidence risk ratios)=3.04, p=0.001, 95% CI (2.22 to 4.17)). The elderly (defined as 65+) were 2.8 times more likely to die from injuries compared with children under 15 years of age (adjusted IRR=2.83, p=0.048, 95% CI (1.01 to 7.93)). The highest frequency of deaths resulted from road traffic crashes.
   Conclusions: Injury is becoming an important cause of mortality in the Rufiji district. Injury mortality varied by age and gender in this area. Most injuries are preventable, policy makers need to institute measures to address the issue.

AB There is a lack of data on the prevalence of emotional abuse in youth. The aim of this study was thus to estimate the prevalence of emotional abuse in intimate partnerships among young women in rural South Africa and to measure the association between lifetime experience of emotional abuse (with and without the combined experience of physical and/or sexual abuse) and adverse health outcomes. Between 2002 and 2003, young women from 70 villages were recruited to participate in the cluster randomized controlled trial of an HIV behavioral intervention, Stepping Stones. Data was obtained through the administration of a questionnaire at baseline. Of the 1,293 women who had ever been partnered, 189 (14.6%) had experienced only emotional abuse in their lifetimes. Three hundred sixty-six women (28.3%) experienced emotional abuse with physical and/or sexual abuse in their lifetimes, and one hundred forty-four women (11.1%) experienced physical and/or sexual abuse without emotional abuse. Hazardous drinking was associated with the experience of physical and/or sexual abuse, with (OR 6.0, 95% CI [1.0, 36.6]) and without emotional abuse (OR 5.8, 95% CI [1.1, 29.4]). Illicit drug use (OR 5.6, 95% CI [2.4, 12.6]), having depressive symptoms (OR 2.9, 95% CI [1.2, 4.2]), having psychological distress (OR 1.9, 95% CI [1.4, 2.6]), and suicidality (OR 79.0, 95% CI [17.3, 359.6]) was associated with the experience of emotional abuse with physical and/or sexual abuse. Suicidality was also strongly associated with having experienced emotional abuse alone (OR 79.5, 95% CI [16.7, 377.4]). This study showed that emotionally abused young women had a greater risk of suicidality than those experiencing no abuse and that the combined experience of emotional with physical and/or sexual abuse was strongly associated with poor mental health outcomes.

AB Questions concerning the drama at Schoonder Sigt: A closer look at the suicide of Robert Jacob Gordon in 1795
   Colonel Robert Jacob Gordon (1743-1795) is a famous explorer of Southern Africa, its geography, people, flora and fauna. His reputation as Military Commander of the Cape of Good Hope is, however, not so good. His resistance against the British attack in 1795 was defensive, mostly evading direct combat, and after three months he surrendered. Subsequently, some five weeks later, on the 25th of October 1795, Gordon committed suicide. South African historiography, based on prevailing rumour at the time, was convinced: his suicide was due to feelings of shame and remorse, reaction to social isolation and contempt. People accused Gordon of cowardice and his treacherous defence of the Cape, claiming that as an Orangist and Anglophile, Gordon had handed the Cape over to the British to prevent a Jacobin revolution, whereby he could be assured that the British custody would take care of the Cape until the restoration of the House of Orange.
   That Gordon was neither a coward nor a traitor, is the thesis of this article; and his suicide therefore had to have had another origin. Indeed, Gordon was an opponent of the 1789 French Revolution, and his Scottish stock might have him helped to cooperate with the British. But he did not neglect his duties and he was not betrayed by the British. Backed up by Commissioner Sluysken and the unanimous Political Council, he followed a defensive line of action, seeing the English opponent being the majority - in guns, men and professional experience - while he was not sure of the reliability of his own men, mercenaries and unruly burgher militia's - the countryside was in open conflict with the Company regime. For three months, Gordon kept the enemy at bay and retained his honour as a soldier, then he surrendered: as a professional soldier, he knew that prolonged warfare was useless, and would result in more victims and much damage. Fighting to the end, sacrificing oneself for one's honour or freedom of the nation - such feelings were foreign to 18th century officers.
   There is no knowledge of any sign of treason or sneaky cooperation by Gordon with the British army; nor is there any indication of disappointment by Gordon about the policy of the British occupier Some forty British officers honoured Gordon by being present at his funeral. There was indeed a small number of burghers and soldiers, inspired by Jacobin revolutionary nationalism, who deplored the surrender of the Cape to the British. They wrote to the Government in the Netherlands (by now the Batavian Republic) and accused the Colonial Government of treason. In their writings they called Gordon a coward and his behaviour treasonous and declared his suicide as being the result of remorse (the British forgot their promises to maintain the rights of the Dutch on the Cape Colony), social rejection and isolation.
   The accusers of the policies of Governor Sluysken and Commander Gordon are well-known: a junior clerk/schoolmaster (H. D. Campagne, as Jacobin agitator expelled by the British and for years kept imprisoned in England), an artillerist (PW.Marnitz), an assistant (assistent - C. L. Neethling, expelled, went to Holland), and the assistant ship's doctor (onderchirurgijn - J.P. Woyer, Graaff-Reinet, active in the so-called Swellendam Republic movement). Not the type of people with the knowledge to judge the situation! Their accusations were met with no response by the Batavian Government, which approved the official report by Governor Sluysken. This was an indirect disapproval of Neethling's book which was an attack of Sluysken's report, and he and his comrades were not rewarded for their revolutionary fervour: Neethling got nothing at all, Woyer was sent to the East (where he never arrived), only Campagne got some financial help, while as prisoner in England.
   It is evident that the South African historiography has given much too much credit to the revolutionary propaganda and gossip of Campagne, Marnitz, Neethling, Woyer and the anonymous pamphlet written in French Apologie de Robert de Gordon (1796). Encapsulated in the anti-imperialistic paradigm, dear to colonial historians (George McCall Theal) and the Afrikaner nationalists (C. Beyers), both the British and the VOC Regime are blamed The VOC leadership yielded to the reality, and Gordon had nothing to feel embarrassed about: the British were too strong, war is never the ultimate goal. There was not even a British plan to get hold of the Cape for ever; only to secure the Cape from the French hegemony (and the Batavian Republic was a vassal of Paris!). Not only the defence of the Cape, but also the interpretation of the mentality at the Cape, of the so-called Cape Town Jacobins and the "Republican movement" in the outermost districts Swellendam and Graaff-Reinet, have been described according to that paradigm. Their character and impact evidently are misunderstood, and both have been attributed an anachronistic ideology.
   In the context of this ideological historiography, everybody has explained the suicide of Gordon as idiosyncratic. However; there are many indications for another explanation of Gordon's suicide. Gordon wasn't the kind of man to suffer from gossip or the idiot accusations of stupid common soldiers. People said that his wife had rejected him, driving him to commit suicide - an all too common story. But there were other, serious problems. Since his last journey through the interior parts of the Cape, Gordon was ill. An illness that made him visibly meagre, and sometimes his behaviour was odd. His endeavours to strengthen the walls of the forts by hides and woolsacks were an evident example, and his riding around the Cape during the war remarkable. Some of his children, many years later, ended in a lunatic asylum. In a letter; written only two days before his death, Gordon confessed: I am almost distracted; his writing showed how emotions seemed to have overcome him. Gordon was ill. He felt that his tough body and strong mind were deteriorating - the idea to become a shadow of the man he used to be, seemed intolerable to him, and afraid of further physical and psychical decline, he took his pistol and shot himself

AB Background: Violence against women and adult femicides are critical medico-legal issues worldwide. Intimate partner violence is one of the leading contributory risk factors. This study aimed to describe the characteristics of femicides in Taiwan.
   Methods: A retrospective analysis of forensic autopsy records of adult femicide victims in Taiwan during a 10-year period was carried out. The age, victim-offender relationship, injury patterns and causes of death were analyzed.
   Results: Among the 220 adult femicide victims recruited, 114 were killed by intimate partners and 106 were killed by non-intimate partner offenders. The average age of victims killed by intimate partners (40.0 y/o) were younger than those killed by non-intimate partner perpetrators (48.6 y/o). The most common site of injuries in the intimate partner group and the non-intimate partner group was the neck and the upper limbs, respectively. The rates of bruise and intracranial injury of non-intimate partner group were significantly higher than that of the intimate partner group. The most common causes of death in both groups were strangulation and sharp force injury. The heart injury was significantly more frequent in victims offended by intimate partners than by other assailants.
   Conclusions: The characteristics of adult femicides, and the patterns of injury in victims killed by intimate partners and non-intimate partner offenders were different. This data is helpful for corpus inspection in forensic casework and for strategic planning of femicides prevention. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Scottish literature; Irvine Welsh; Marabou Stork Nightmares;

AB This paper focuses on the theme of colonisation interlocked with a specifically-male desire for power in Irvine Welsh's Marabou Stork Nightmares (1995). The novel elaborates in fictional and historical terms on the then Prime Minister John Major's policy on violent crimes in general and juvenile delinquency in particular, encapsulated in his statement used as the book's motto: "We should condemn more and understand less." The novel's narrator/protagonist, Roy Strang, is reduced to an apparent vegetative state after a failed suicide attempt committed as a result of guilt over his active involvement in a brutal gang rape of a young woman. Imprisoned in his unfeeling body, his mind seeks to assume control by conjuring up heroic fantasies of his hunting down and killing a specimen of marabou stork, a symbolic embodiment of evil. Intruding in his fantasy are memories of his time spent as a teenager in South Africa, where he first experienced the sensation of power as a member of the white colonisers, who were by default considered superior to the local black population. In the broader picture of national histories, Roy witnesses the exploited natives revolting and taking revenge on their oppressors, including the killing of Roy's uncle. On the small scale of individual lives, Roy sees the woman whom he raped taking an equally-violent revenge on her tormentors, including Roy himself. While the novel does not profess to offer an alternative solution, it illustrates that revolution does not equal revenge, which merely replaces one form of violence with another.

AB BackgroundUnilateral do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders (against patient/family wishes) have been ethically justified in cases of medical futility. We investigated whether electrophysiology practitioners believe medical futility justifies unilateral implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) deactivation.
   Methods and ResultsEmail invitations to take an online survey were sent to 1,894 electrophysiology practitioners. A total of 384 responses were collected (response rate 20.6%). Though the sample included respondents from Europe, Asia, Australia, South America, and Africa, the majority were from North America (78%), were academically affiliated (64%), and practiced in an urban setting (67.8%). Deactivation of ICD shock function in agreement with patient wishes and a preexisting DNR were not considered physician-assisted suicide (93.2%, 358/384). However, a majority of the sample responded that it was not ethical/moral for doctors to deactivate ICDs against patients' wishes (77.1%, 296/384) or against family/surrogates' wishes (72.4%, 278/384), even in the context of medical futility. A majority indicated that deactivating ICD shock function is not ethically/morally different than withholding cardiopulmonary resuscitation or external defibrillation in a code (72.7%, 277/381), but was different than deactivating pacing in a pacemaker-dependent patient (82.8%, 318/384). In the classification of interventions, a plurality (43.0%, 165/383) regarded ICDs to be unlike any other intervention. Concerning pacemakers, 50% (191/382) considered them to be like dialysis (a therapy that keeps patients alive).
   ConclusionsThis international sample of electrophysiology practitioners considered ICD and pacemaker deactivation to be ethically distinct. While ICD deactivation was considered appropriate in the setting of patient/family agreement, unilateral deactivation was not.

AB In the last decades, the notion that cities are in a state of equilibrium with a centralised organisation has given place to the viewpoint of cities in disequilibrium and organised from bottom to up. In this perspective, cities are evolving systems that exhibit emergent phenomena built from local decisions. While urban evolution promotes the emergence of positive social phenomena such as the formation of innovation hubs and the increase in cultural diversity, it also yields negative phenomena such as increases in criminal activity. Yet, we are still far from understanding the driving mechanisms of these phenomena. In particular, approaches to analyse urban phenomena are limited in scope by neglecting both temporal non-stationarity and spatial heterogeneity. In the case of criminal activity, we know for more than one century that crime peaks during specific times of the year, but the literature still fails to characterise the mobility of crime. Here we develop an approach to describe the spatial, temporal, and periodic variations in urban quantities. With crime data from 12 cities, we characterise how the periodicity of crime varies spatially across the city over time. We confirm one-year criminal cycles and show that this periodicity occurs unevenly across the city. These 'waves of crime' keep travelling across the city: while cities have a stable number of regions with a circannual period, the regions exhibit non-stationary series. Our findings support the concept of cities in a constant change, influencing urban phenomena-in agreement with the notion of cities not in equilibrium.

TI 'Global mental health': systematic review of the term and its implicit

AB Background
   The term 'global mental health' came to the fore in 2007, when the Lancet published a series by that name.
   Aims
   To review all peer-reviewed articles using the term 'global mental health' and determine the implicit priorities of scientific literature that self-identifies with this term.
   Method
   We conducted a systematic review to quantify all peer-reviewed articles using the English term `global mental health' in their text published between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2016, including by geographic regions and by mental health conditions.
   Results
   A total of 467 articles met criteria. Use of the term `global mental health' increased from 12 articles in 2007 to 114 articles in 2016. For the 111 empirical studies (23.8% of articles), the majority (78.4%) took place in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with the most in Sub-Saharan Africa (28.4%) and South Asia (25.5%) and none from Central Asia. The most commonly studied mental health conditions were depression (29.7%), psychoses (12.6%) and conditions specifically related to stress (12.6%), with fewer studies on epilepsy (2.7%), self-harm and suicide (1.8%) and dementia (0.9%). The majority of studies lacked contextual information, including specific region(s) within countries where studies took place (20.7% missing), specific language(s) in which studies were conducted (36.9% missing), and details on ethnic identities such as ethnicity, caste and/or tribe (79.6% missing) and on socioeconomic status (85.4% missing).
   Conclusions
   Research identifying itself as `global mental health' has focused predominantly on depression in LMICs and lacked contextual and sociodemographic data that limit interpretation and application of findings.

AB Objectives Comorbidity is a common feature of mental disorders. However, needs assessment surveys focus largely on individual disorders rather than on comorbidity even though the latter is more important for predicting suicidal thoughts and behaviors. In the current report, we take a step beyond this conventional approach by presenting data on the prevalence and correlates (sociodemographic factors, college-related factors, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors) of the main multivariate profiles of common comorbid Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV disorders among students participating in the first phase of the World Health Organization World Mental Health International College Student initiative. Method A web-based mental health survey was administered to first year students in 19 colleges across eight countries (Australia, Belgium, Germany, Mexico, Northern Ireland, South Africa, Spain, United States; 45.5% pooled response rate) to screen for seven common DSM-IV mental disorders: major depression, mania/hypomania, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, alcohol use disorder, and drug use disorder. We focus on the 14,348 respondents who provided complete data; 38.4% screened positive for at least one 12-month disorder. Results Multivariate disorder profiles were detected using latent class analysis (LCA). The least common class (C1; 1.9% of students) was made up of students with high comorbidity (four or more disorders, the majority including mania/hypomania). The remaining 12-month cases had profiles of internalizing-externalizing comorbidity (C2; 5.8%), internalizing comorbidity (C3; 14.6%), and pure disorders (C4; 16.1%). The 1.9% of students in C1 had much higher prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors than other students. Specifically, 15.4% of students in C1 made a suicide attempt in the 12 months before the survey compared with 1.3-2.6% of students with disorders in C2-4, 0.2% of students with lifetime disorders but no 12-month disorders (C5), and 0.1% of students with no lifetime disorders (C6). Conclusions In line with prior research, comorbid mental disorders were common; however, sociodemographic correlates of LCA profiles were modest. The high level of comorbidity underscores the need to develop and test transdiagnostic approaches for treatment in college students.

TI Coverage of work related fatalities in Australia by compensation and
   occupational health and safety agencies
SO OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID SOUTH-AFRICA; INJURIES
AB Aims: To determine the levels of coverage of work related traumatic deaths by official occupational health and safety (OHS) and compensation agencies in Australia, to allow better understanding and interpretation of officially available statistics.
   Methods: The analysis was part of a much larger study of all work related fatalities that occurred in Australia during the four year period 1989 to 1992 inclusive and which was based on information from coroners' files. For the current study, State, Territory, and Commonwealth OHS and compensation agencies were asked to supply unit record information for all deaths identified by the jurisdictions as being due to non-suicide traumatic causes and which were identified by them as being work related, using whatever definitions the agencies were using at the relevant time. This information was matched to cases identified during the main study.
   Results: The percentage of working deaths not covered by any agency was 34%. Only 35% of working deaths were covered by an OHS agency, while 57% were covered by a compensation agency. The OHS agencies had minimal coverage of work related deaths that occurred on the road (to workers (8%) or commuters (3%)), whereas the compensation system covered these deaths better than those of workers in incidents that occurred in a workplace (65% versus 53%). There was virtually no coverage of bystanders (less than 8%) by either type of agency. There was marked variation in the level of coverage depending on the industry, occupation, and employment status of the workers, and the type of injury event involved in the incident.
   Conclusions: When using data from official sources, the significant limitations in coverage identified in this paper need to be taken into account. Future surveillance, arising from a computerised National Coroners Information System, should result in improved coverage of work related traumatic deaths in Australia.

TI Forensic mental health services: Current service provision and planning
   for a prison mental health service in the Eastern Cape
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; TELEPSYCHIATRY; SUICIDE
AB Objectives: No research data exists on forensic psychiatric service provision in the Eastern Cape, Republic of South Africa. The objective of this research was to assess current forensic psychiatric service provision and utilisation rates at Fort England Hospital. This is important in improving and strengthening the service. A related objective was to develop a model for a provincial prison mental health service.
   Methodology: This study is a situational analysis of an existing forensic psychiatric service in the Eastern Cape. The design of the study was cross sectional. An audit questionnaire was utilised to collate quantitative data, which was submitted to Fort England Hospital, Grahamstown. A proposed prison mental health service was developed utilising prevalence rates of mental illness among prisoners to calculate bed and staff requirements for an ambulatory and in-patient service.
   Results: During the study period a total of 403 remand detainees were admitted to the forensic psychiatry division of Fort England Hospital. The average length of stay was 494 days and the bed utilisation rate was determined at 203.54%. We estimate that to provide a provincial prison mental health service to treat psychotic illnesses and major depression the province requires a 52 bedded facility and a total staff complement of approximately 31.
   Conclusions: Forensic psychiatric services include the assessment, management and treatment of mentally disordered persons in conflict with the law and prisoners requiring psychiatric assessments. The Eastern Cape Province does not have plans or policies to assess and manage mentally ill offenders, resulting in an increased load on available services. We recommend that an inter-departmental task team, which includes Health, Justice and Constitutional Development and Correctional Services, should be established in the province, to develop a strategy to assist in the development of an effective and efficient forensic psychiatric service. This should be driven by the provincial Department of Health.

AB Objective: College entrance may be a strategically well-placed "point of capture" for detecting late adolescents with suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). However, a clear epidemiological picture of STB among incoming college students is lacking. We present the first cross-national data on prevalence as well as socio-demographic and college-related correlates for STB among first-year college students.
   Method: Web-based self-report surveys were obtained from 13,984 first-year students (response rate 45.5%) across 19 colleges in 8 countries (Australia, Belgium, Germany, Mexico, Northern Ireland, South Africa, Spain, and the United States).
   Results: Lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts was 32.7%, 17.5%, and 4.3%, respectively. The 12-month prevalence was 17.2%, 8.8%, and 1.0%, respectively. About three-fourths of STB cases had onset before the age of 16 years (Q3 = 15.8), with persistence figures in the range of 41% to 53%. About one-half (53.4%) of lifetime ideators transitioned to a suicide plan; 22.1% of lifetime planners transitioned to an attempt. Attempts among lifetime ideators without plan were less frequent (3.1%). Significant correlates of lifetime STB were cross-nationally consistent and generally modest in effect size (median adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.7). Nonheterosexual orientation (aOR range 3.3-7.9) and heterosexual orientation with some same-sex attraction (aOR range 1.9-2.3) were the strongest correlates of STB, and of transitioning from ideation to plans and/or attempts (aOR range 1.6-6.1).
   Conclusion: The distribution of STB in first-year students is widespread, and relatively independent of socio-demographic risk profile. Multivariate risk algorithms based on a high number of risk factors are indicated to efficiently link high-risk status with effective preventive interventions.

AB Background: This study investigated associations among adolescents' self-esteem in 6 domains (peers, school, family, sports/athletics, body image and global self-worth) and risk behaviours related to substance use, bullying, suicidality and sexuality. Method: A multistage stratified sampling strategy was used to select a representative sample of 939 English-, Afrikaans- and Xhosa-speaking students in Grades 8 and 11 at public high schools in Cape Town, South Africa. Participants completed the multidimensional Self-Esteem Questionnaire (SEQ; DuBois, Felner, Brand, Phillips, &, Lease, 1996) and a self-report questionnaire containing items about demographic characteristics and participation in a range of risk behaviours. It included questions about their use of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, solvents and other substances, bullying, suicidal ideation and attempts, and risky sexual behaviour. Data was analysed using a series of logistic regression models, with the estimation of model parameters being done through generalised estimation equations. Results: Scores on each self-esteem scale were significantly associated with at least one risk behaviour in male and female adolescents after controlling for the sampling strategy, grade and race. However, specific self-esteem domains were differentially related to particular risk behaviours. After taking the correlations between the self-esteem scales into account, low self-esteem in the family and school contexts and high self-esteem in the peer domain were significantly independently associated with multiple risk behaviours in adolescents of both sexes. Low body-image self-esteem and global self-worth were also uniquely associated with risk behaviours in girls, but not in boys. Conclusions: Overall, the findings suggest that interventions that aim to protect adolescents from engaging in risk behaviours by increasing their self-esteem are likely to be most effective and cost-efficient if they are aimed at the family and school domains.

AB Background: Community-based studies of the rates and profile of depression among Africans are still sparse.
   Methods: As part of the World Mental Health Surveys initiative, a clustered multi-stage sampling of households in 21 of Nigeria's 36 states (representing 57% of the national population) was implemented to select adults aged 18 years and over (N=6752) for face-to-face interviews using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0). Diagnosis of major depressive episode (MDE) was based on the Criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition.
   Results: Lifetime and 12-month estimates of MDE were 3.1% (standard error 0.3) and 1.1% (s.e. 0.1). receptively. Increasing age was associated with higher estimates of positive responses to stem (screen) questions for depression and of life time disorders among stem-positive respondents. The mean age of onset was about 29.2 years. The median (inter quantile range, IQR) duration of an episode among lifetime cases was 1.0 (2.0-2.4) year and the median (IQR) number of lifetime episodes was 1.5 (2.0-2.8). MDE was highly comorbid with anxiety disorders, musculoskeletal conditions, chronic pain and ulcer. The odds ratio of life time suicide attempt among persons with lifetime MDE was 11.6 (95% confidence interval, 3.9-34.9). Over 25% of 12-month cases were rated as severely disabled in the performance of usual roles. Only 16.9% (s.e. 5.0) of 12-month cases had received any treatment.
   Limitations: All data were based on self-reports.
   Conclusion: MDE, defined according to DSM-IV, is a risk factor for mental and physical comorbidity as well as disability in Nigerians. Age-related telescoping or denial may partly explain the low rates in this young population. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: Accidental drowning can cause out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We investigated the effect of drowning location on outcomes of individuals who experienced drowning-OHCA.
   Methods: All cases of emergency medical service-treated drowning-OHCA in South Korea from January 2006 to December 2013 were analyzed. Cases were excluded if there was a preceding injury, no information on event location, or suicide. Cases were divided into 4 groups: recreational water with mandatory safety regulations (group 1, public swimming pool; group 2, beach) and nonrecreational water without mandatory safety regulations (group 3, natural freshwater; group 4, seawater). The main outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted using natural freshwater as the reference location.
   Results: We analyzed 1691 drowning-OHCAs (public swimming pools, 3.4%; public beaches, 5.2%; unsupervised seawater, 33.8%; and unsupervised open freshwater, 57.6%). The rate of survival to discharge was 4.6% for all cases, 17.5% for cases in public swimming pools, 9.1% for cases in public beaches, 4.9% for cases in unsupervised seawater, and 3.3% for cases in unsupervised open freshwater (p < 0.01). The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for survival relative to natural freshwater were 3.97 (95% CI, 1.77-8.89) for public swimming pools, 2.81 (95% CI, 1.22-6.45) for public beaches, and 1.54 (95% CI, 0.88-2.70) for unsupervised seawater.
   Conclusion: Individuals who experience drowning-OHCA in public locations with safety regulations had a better rate of survival. There should be improved public awareness of the significantly greater risk of drowning-OHCA in locations that have no safety regulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BackgroundGlobally, 350 million people are affected by depression and 800,000 people die due to suicide every year due to depression. People living with HIV/AIDS face different challenges, including HIV-related perceived stigma, lack of social support and also depression. This study aimed to assess prevalence and factors associated with depressive symptom among people living with HIV/AIDS attending Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Hawassa, Ethiopia.MethodsHospital-based cross-sectional study was implemented in 2016. A total of 401 HIV-positive patients who had regular visit at Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Hawassa, Ethiopia were included in the study. Systematic random sampling technique was used to recruit study participants. Patient Health Questionnaire item nine (PHQ-9) was used to assess depressive symptoms. In addition to this, Oslo social support scale and HIV perceived stigma scale were used to assess social support and HIV-related perceived stigma, respectively.ResultsA total of 401 study participants were included in the study, giving a response rate of 96.2%. The mean age of the respondents was 38years (SD10.23). This study revealed that 48.6% of HIV-positive patients had depression. Patients who had poor social support [AOR=2.53, (95% CI 1.70, 9.13)], HIV-related perceived stigma [AOR=2.83, (95% CI 1.78, 4.48)] and CD4 cell count<200 [AOR=3.89, (95% CI 1.02, 14.83)] were more likely to have depression as compared to individuals who had good social support, no perceived HIV stigma and CD4 cell count>200, respectively.ConclusionHaving poor social support, HIV-related perceived stigma and low CD4 cell count (<200) had statistically significant association with depressive symptom. Training of health workers in ART clinics and availing manuals on assessing mental health issues is useful to screen and treat depression among HIV patients.

AB Background: Depression is a major cause of disability among children and adolescents and is associated with elevated risks for substance abuse, HIV transmission risk behavior, and suicide. Among adolescents living with HIV (ALWH), depression undermines adherence to antiretroviral treatment, leading to poorer health outcomes. However, there are few instruments available for depression screening among ALWH in sub-Saharan Africa.
   Methods: Using mixed methods we developed and validated a 20-item depression screening scale to be used among ALWH in rural Uganda. First, we conducted focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with adolescents and adult caregivers (n = 80) to elicit participant perspectives about mental health challenges facing HIV-affected children and adolescents. We generated an initial pool of 40 items, pilot tested it with ALWH and adolescents of unknown serostatus (n = 40), and then administered the items to a validation sample of ALWH (n = 224). Exploratory factor analysis was used to examine the factor structure of the scale. We evaluated the scale for its reliability, and validity.
   Results: The mean age of the participants in the validation sample was 14.9 years (standard deviation [SD] 1.4), 131 (58%) were girls and 48 (21%) were orphans. Exploratory factor analysis revealed two factors related to affective and cognitive symptoms of depression. The 20-item depression scale was internally consistent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.91) with moderate test-retest and inter-rater reliability. Construct validity was excellent, as demonstrated through correlation with related constructs like stigma (P< 0.001) and bullying (P< 0.001). At the optimized cutoff score, 64 (29%) participants screened positive for probable depression. Using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents, we found that 37 participants (17%) were diagnosed with major depressive disorder. In reference to the criterion standard, the depression scale showed excellent discrimination (c-statistic = 0.84).
   Conclusion: This new 20-item depression scale was reliable and valid for detecting major depressive disorder among ALWH in rural Uganda.

AB Background: Psychosocial characteristics, including self-esteem, perceived social support, coping skills, stigma, discrimination, and poverty, are strongly correlated with depression symptoms. However, data on the extent of these correlations among persons living with HIV and the associations between psychosocial characteristics and HIV treatment outcomes are limited in sub-Saharan Africa.
   Objective: This paper aims to describe the recruitment process and baseline characteristics associated with depression in a sample of HIV-positive people in a cluster randomized trial of group support psychotherapy (GSP) for depression delivered by trained lay health workers (LHWs).
   Methods: Thirty eligible primary care health centers across three districts in Uganda were randomly allocated to have their LHWs trained to deliver GSP (intervention arm) or group HIV education and treatment as usual (control arm) to persons living with HIV comorbid with depression. Baseline demographic, socioeconomic, and psychosocial characteristics were collected via interviewer-administered questionnaires. Among eligible participants, differences between those enrolled versus those who refused enrollment were assessed using chi square for categorical variables and t tests for continuous variables. Spearman rank order correlation analyses were conducted to determine associations between baseline depression symptoms and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), viral load suppression, and other psychosocial variables.
   Results: The study screened 1473 people and 1140 were found to be eligible and enrolled over 14 weeks. Participants recruited comprised 95% of the target sample size of 1200. The sample's mean age was 38.5 (SD 10.9) years and both genders were well represented (males: 46.32%, 528/1140). Most participants met the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (96.92%, 1105/1140), had significant posttraumatic stress symptoms (72.46%, 826/1140), reported moderate suicide risk (52.54%, 599/1140), had primary or no formal education (86.22%, 983/1140), and reported no income-generating activity (72.63%, 828/1140) and no food insecurity (81.67%, 931/1140). Among eligible participants, 48 of 1140 (4.21%) refused to participate in the interventions; these participants were more likely to be males (Chi(2)(1)= 4.0, P=.045) and have significantly lower depression symptoms scores (t(2)= 2.36, P=.01) than those who participated in the interventions. There was a significant positive correlation between viral load and number of traumatic experiences (rho=.12, P=.05). Adherence to ART was positively correlated with perceived social support (rho=.15, P<.001), but negatively correlated with depression symptoms (rho=-.11, P=.05) and stigma (rho=-.14, P<.001).
   Conclusions: Men and women with HIV and depression experience multiple social and economic vulnerabilities and disadvantages. Culturally tailored psychological interventions aimed at these individuals should address these socioeconomic disadvantages in addition to addressing their mental health care needs.

AB Objectives: To collate data from multiple obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) treatment centers across seven countries and five continents, and to report findings in relation to OCD comorbidity, age of onset of OCD and comorbid disorders, and suicidality, in a large clinical and ethnically diverse sample, with the aim of investigating cultural variation and the utility of the psychiatric diagnostic classification of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.
   Methods: Researchers in the field of OCD were invited to contribute summary statistics on current and lifetime psychiatric comorbidity, age of onset of OCD and comorbid disorders and suicidality in their patients with OCD.
   Results: Data from 3711 adult patients with primary OCD came from Brazil (n = 955), India (n = 802), Italy (n = 750), South Africa (n = 565), Japan (n = 322), Australia (n = 219), and Spain (n = 98). The most common current comorbid disorders were major depressive disorder (28.4%; n = 1055), obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (24.5%, n = 478), generalized anxiety disorder (19.3%, n = 716), specific phobia (19.2%, n = 714) and social phobia (18.5%, n = 686). Major depression was also the most commonly co-occurring lifetime diagnosis, with a rate of 50.5% (n = 1874). OCD generally had an age of onset in late adolescence (mean = 17.9 years, SD = 1.9). Social phobia, specific phobia and body dysmorphic disorder also had an early age of onset. Co-occurring major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and psychotic disorders tended to have a later age of onset than OCD. Suicidal ideation within the last month was reported by 6.4% (n = 200) of patients with OCD and 9.0% (n = 314) reported a lifetime history of suicide attempt.
   Conclusions: In this large cross-continental study, comorbidity in OCD was common. The high rates of comorbid major depression and anxiety disorders emphasize the need for clinicians to assess and monitor for these disorders. Earlier ages of onset of OCD, specific phobia and social phobia may indicate some relatedness between these disorders, but this requires further study. Although there do not appear to be significant cultural variations in rates or patterns of comorbidity and suicidality, further research using similar recruitment strategies and controlling for demographic and clinical variables may help to determine whether any sociocultural factors protect against suicidal ideation or psychiatric comorbidity in patients with OCD.

AB Background: In addition to services within the health system, interventions at the population and community levels are also important for the promotion of mental health, primary prevention of mental, neurological and substance use (MNS) disorders, identification and case detection of MNS disorders; and to a lesser degree treatment, care and rehabilitation. This study aims to identify "best practice" and "good practice" interventions that can feasibly be delivered at these population- and community-levels in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), to aid the identification of resource efficiencies and allocation in LMICs.
   Methods: A narrative review was conducted given the wide range of relevant interventions. Expert consensus was used to identify "best practice" at the population-level on the basis of existing quasi-experimental natural experiments and cost effectiveness, with small scale emerging and promising evidence comprising "good practice". At the community-level, using expert consensus, the ACE (Assessing Cost-Effectiveness in Prevention Project) grading system was used to differentiate "best practice" interventions with sufficient evidence from "good practice" interventions with limited but promising evidence.
   Results: At the population-level, laws and regulations to control alcohol demand and restrict access to lethal means of suicide were considered "best practice". Child protection laws, improved control of neurocysticercosis and mass awareness campaigns were identified as "good practice". At the community level, socio-emotional learning programmes in schools and parenting programmes during infancy were identified as "best practice". The following were all identified as "good practice": Integrating mental health promotion strategies into workplace occupational health and safety policies; mental health information and awareness programmes as well as detection of MNS disorders in schools; early child enrichment/preschool educational programs and parenting programs for children aged 2-14 years; gender equity and/or economic empowerment programs for vulnerable groups; training of gatekeepers to identify people with MNS disorders in the community; and training non-specialist community members at a neighbourhood level to assist with community-based support and rehabilitation of people with mental disorders.
   Conclusion: Interventions provided at the population- and community-levels have an important role to play in promoting mental health, preventing the onset, and protecting those with MNS disorders. The importance of inter-sectoral engagement and the need for further research on interventions at these levels in LMICs is highlighted.

AB There are a significant number of people who live under the breadline in South Africa. Especially women and children are vulnerable when they end up on the streets, owing to a number of reasons such as economic hardship and unemployment. Women are also often caregivers of their young children and to seek fulltime employment is not always feasible. Several of these vulnerable women resort to alcohol or drug abuse as a means to at least temporarily cope with their problems. It is usually social workers who render services to vulnerable groups and in this instance to vulnerable women. The aim of this study was to explore the challenges experienced by vulnerable women who abuse alcohol or drugs, in order to improve service rendering by social workers.
   There is an increase worldwide in the abuse of harmful substances. Although statistics indicate that more men than women succumb to substance abuse, affected women often do not seek help, owing to several factors such as the stigma attached thereto, and the lack of sufficient services to assist them. Research indicates that economic hardship could contribute to substance abuse. Little research has been done on the unique challenges facing vulnerable women who are prone to substance abuse. These women often end up on the street, heightening the risks of their falling prey to violence and sexual assault.
   The ecological perspective was chosen as a theoretical framework for this study as the different systems could shed light on the research question: "What are the challenges of vulnerable women who resort to substance abuse?" Stressful situations could contribute to a life of substance abuse. Especially women who leave their families for a life on the streets are suffering emotional stress. The three levels of the ecological perspective that were utilised were the micro, meso and macro levels.
   A qualitative approach of an exploratory nature was chosen to meet the goal of the study, namely to explore the challenges facing vulnerable women succumbing to alcohol and drugs as a last resort. An NGO was approached to collect a sample of 15 participants. Criteria for inclusion were that the participants had to be women; over 21 years old; had to have used alcohol and/or drugs during the course of the study or six months prior to the study; had to be sober during the interviews; and had to be clients of the NGO that delivered the sample.
   Data were collected by means of a semi-structured interview guide. The interviews were recorded with the permission of the participants and transcribed by the researcher. Ethical clearance was obtained for the study.
   The data were analysed and categorised into relevant themes. Data verification was also done by member checking and the use of an independent coder. The study was limited in that only a small sample was used and that it was done only in the Western Cape.
   Theme 1 concerned a traumatic childhood. All participants had lived through a traumatic childhood and still struggled in adulthood to work through different issues. Significantly, a number of the participants' own family members were directly or indirectly responsible for the childhood trauma. Theme 2 pertained to difficulties in adulthood varying from subjecting to violence, being cheated on, having been victims of rape, serving jail terms, living on the streets, and attempting suicide. Closely related to theme 2, are challenges in the environment (theme 3). Notable stumbling blocks pertained to participants living with sickness, relationship challenges, gang violence, hunger and conflict with the police. The abuse of alcohol or drugs, as well as the misuse of pain killers as a coping mechanism was identified as theme 4. One of the participants also struggled with a dual diagnosis of bipolar disorder and substance use disorder. Hope was identified as the 5th theme. Despite the listed challenges, some participants still retained a flicker of hope and resilience, wishing to improve their lives and reclaim custody of their children.
   It can be concluded that vulnerable women who abuse alcohol or drugs face several challenges and that specialised intervention is needed to help them to come to terms with childhood trauma, adversities in adult life, challenges in the environment and, in addition to all of the above, with substance dependency. More research is recommended, specifically focused on vulnerable women who succumb to substance abuse.
