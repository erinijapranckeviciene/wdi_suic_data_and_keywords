TI RURAL AND URBAN SUICIDE IN SOUTH KOREA
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Suicide rates in 2005 in South Korea were higher in rural areas than in urban areas. Those in rural areas more often used pesticides and chemicals as a method for suicide, and there was a greater proportion of men and the elderly, both groups at higher risk for suicide in South Korea. These three factors may account for the high rural suicide rate in South Korea.

AB AimThe aim of this study is to investigate mixed risk factors associated with suicide rates in South Korea.MethodsData on suicide in South Korea from 1995 to 2015 were investigated to understand risk factors for suicide using time series analysis.ResultsWe found that increasing GDP per capita growth rates and fertility rates were associated with decreasing suicide rates. Using the moving average method (monthly data), we found a negative correlation between suicide rates and the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI). Moreover, a seasonal pattern of suicide rates was found in South Korea. The suicide rate was highest in May and lowest in January. The months of outliers occurred against the seasonal pattern observed in 1998, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2008. These might be associated with the economic crisis or other miscellaneous risk factors.ConclusionThese results provide evidence that there is a significant relationship between suicide rates and the socioeconomic factors mentioned above in South Korea. The results obtained in this study may help to create public policies for lowering suicide rates in South Korea.

AB South Korea is a country with one of the highest suicide rates in the world, and the suicide rate is still on the rise. The purpose of this study was to determine the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of suicide attempts and risk factors related to suicide attempts among depressed patients in South Korea. Among the 1183 participants, 21.4% had a history of a suicide attempt. When the severity of depression was controlled, the risk factors for patients who attempted suicide included younger age, experienced significant life events before 12 years of age, psychotic symptoms, and previous depressive episodes. The characteristics of attempted suicide in depressed patients in South Korea can be summarized as a high suicide attempt rate with no difference in the number of suicide attempts and lethality between males and females. This unique tendency is probably related to the sociodemographic and cultural characteristics of South Korea.

AB Objective Lethality of the chosen method during a suicide attempt is a strong risk factor for completion of suicide. We examined whether annual changes in the pattern of suicide methods is related to annual changes in suicide rates among older adults in South Korea and Japan.
   Methods We analyzed annual the World Health Organization data on rates and methods of suicide from 2000 to 2011 in South Korea and Japan.
   Results For Korean older adults, there was a significant positive correlation between suicide rate and the rate of hanging or the rate of jumping, and a significant negative correlation between suicide rate and the rate of poisoning. Among older adults in Japan, annual changes in the suicide rate and the pattern of suicide methods were less conspicuous, and no correlation was found between them.
   Conclusion The results of the present study suggest that the increasing use of lethal suicide methods has contributed to the rise in suicide rates among older adults in South Korea. Targeted efforts to reduce the social acceptability and accessibility of lethal suicide methods might lead to lower suicide rate among older adults in South Korea.

AB The annual suicide rate in South Korea is the highest among the developed countries. Paraquat is a highly lethal herbicide, commonly used in South Korea as a means for suicide. We have studied the effect of the 2011 paraquat prohibition on the national suicide rate and method of suicide in South Korea. We obtained the monthly suicide rate from 2005 to 2013 in South Korea. In our analyses, we adjusted for the effects of celebrity suicides, and economic, meteorological, and seasonal factors on suicide rate. We employed change point analysis to determine the effect of paraquat prohibition on suicide rate over time, and the results were verified by structural change analysis, an alternative statistical method. After the paraquat prohibition period in South Korea, there was a significant reduction in the total suicide rate and suicide rate by poisoning with herbicides or fungicides in all age groups and in both genders. The estimated suicide rates during this period decreased by 10.0% and 46.1% for total suicides and suicides by poisoning of herbicides or fungicides, respectively. In addition, method substitution effect of paraquat prohibition was found in suicide by poisoning by carbon monoxide, which did not exceed the reduction in the suicide rate of poisoning with herbicides or fungicides. In South Korea, paraquat prohibition led to a lower rate of suicide by paraquat poisoning, as well as a reduction in the overall suicide rate. Paraquat prohibition should be considered as a national suicide prevention strategy in developing and developed countries alongside careful observation for method substitution effects.

AB South Korea has ranked first in suicide mortality among the 35 OECD nations since 2003. Unfortunately, mental health research and evidence-based interventions to curb the rate of suicide have been limited. Suicide is the leading cause of death among South Korean adolescents. Academic stress is a primary risk factor, which is highly correlated with depression. Social stigma against mental illnesses and negative relationships with peers and parents are additional risk factors, while positive relationships may be protective. We propose a multi-dimensional solution, involving the participation of schools, peers and parents to decrease the rate of adolescent suicide in South Korea.

AB The number of suicides in South Korea totaled 4840 in 1995 and 8569 in 1998; in Japan, suicides totaled 21,420 in 1995 and 31,755 in 1998. Suicide prevention is an important issue for both South Korea and Japan. In South Korea, factors related to the increase in suicides must be clarified, and specific suicide prevention measures must be promptly discussed in order to decrease the number of suicides. Therefore, this report examined suicide and unemployment rates and increased rates of mining and industrial production and of money supply in South Korea from 1990 to 2002. This report also discusses the relationships between suicide and unemployment rates and increased rates of mining and industrial production and increased rates of money supply during the same period.
   During the period studied, annual suicide rates ranged from 7.1 to 18.3 per 100,000 populations. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the suicide rate was clearly related to the unemployment rate, but the suicide rate was not related to increased rates of mining and industrial production and increased rates of money supply. Thus, when unemployment rates increase, relevant organizations and the community should pay close attention to the increase in suicide rates. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Unlike other East Asian countries, South Korea has until recently experienced relatively few charcoal burning suicides. We investigated trends in charcoal burning suicide immediately following the suicide by charcoal burning of the South Korean celebrityAhn Jae-Hwanin September 2008. In the study, we compared the weekly number charcoal burning suicides 1 year before and after the celebrity's death. Before Ahn Jae-Hwan's suicide, charcoal burning accounted for <1% of suicides; his death was followed by an immediate and sustained increase in the use of this methodit accounted for nearly 5% of suicides (n=772 suicides) in the subsequent 12 months. The demographic patterning (young male predominance) and location (inside cars) of the charcoal burning suicides further supported a copy-cat effect. Ahn Jae-Hwan's death appears to have triggered a rapid and sustained adoption of charcoal burning as a method of suicide in South Korea.

AB By focusing on the elderly suicide rates, this study lays out the different suicide regulation and prevention policies of three developed countries - Japan, the Netherlands, and South Korea. The main goal is to compare and analyze how these policies, with disparate ways of handling suicide, influence elderly suicide rates in relation with their countries' respective differing suicide determinants. By applying the 'Method for Synthesizing about Public Policies' created by Morestin, Gauvin, Hogue, and Benoit to check the status of efficiency and of any issues of public policies, it concludes that South Korea shows promise, while Japan's suicide rates have certainly been scaling down. Conversely, in terms of the use of euthanasia, suicide rates in the Netherlands have been continuously rising.

AB Objective The suicide rate in South Korea was the second highest among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries in 2017. The purpose of this study is to understand the characteristics of people who died by suicide in Korea from 2013-2017 and to better prevent suicide.
   Methods This study was performed by the Korea Psychological Autopsy Center (KPAC), an affiliate of the Korea Ministry of Health and Welfare. According to the Korea National Statistical Office, the number of suicide victims nationwide was estimated to reach about 70,000 from 2013 to 2017. Comprehensive suicide records from all 254 police stations in South Korea were evaluated by 32 investigators who completed a 14-day didactic training program. Then, we evaluated the characteristics of suicide victims in association with disease data from the National Health Insurance Database (NHID), which is anonymously linked to personal information of suicide victims.
   Results Thirty-one of 254 police stations in the Seoul metropolitan area were analyzed by August 10, 2018. Findings showed that the characteristics of suicide victims differed according to the nature of the region.
   Conclusion Our results suggest that different strategies and methods are needed to prevent suicide by regional groups.

AB This article examines the cultural sources of underreported suicide deaths in South Korea. It analyzes two sets of suicide data compiled by two different government agencies. Noting the considerable undercounting of suicide deaths compiled by the National Statistical Office, it explores how the underreporting is linked to the Confucian norm of familism. Despite an effort to improve the quality of official suicide data, a reform in the death system is needed in order to gather accurate data for a better understanding of the increased suicides as well as for the development of more effective suicide prevention and intervention strategies.

The results show that the male suicide rate outweighs that of females, the likelihood of committing suicide increases with age, and that, in regard to marital status, nonmarried people are the most at risk. In addition, several methods of reducing suicide rates are identified: the wider use of social networks to reduce social burden, the development of a social atmosphere where aging is accepted as a natural process, and the development of protection factors within families.

DE Attitudes; Suicide; Suicide prevention; South Korea; United States
AB Background: South Korea (hereafter, Korea) has witnessed a rapid increase in its suicide rate over the past few decades and currently reports the highest rate among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Conversely, the United States has maintained its suicide rate near the OECD average. The present study examines and compares attitudes toward suicide among college students in either country to explain the higher prevalence of suicide in Korea.
   Findings: Non-Korean students in the United States, Korean students in the United States, and Korean students in Korea completed a web-based questionnaire on Attitudes Toward Suicide (ATTS). A series of two-way 3 x 2 between subjects Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests of the participants' group and gender, as well as post-hoc comparisons, were conducted to examine differences across various attitude domains. As expected, the results revealed group differences in the majority of attitude areas. Most notably, students in Korea reported more permissive attitudes toward suicide and were less likely to believe in the right to prevent others' suicide. Gender did not have an effect on any attitudes except on the right to prevent suicide and there were no interactions between group and gender.
   Conclusions: The results suggest the importance of addressing public attitudes toward suicide in future suicide prevention efforts in Korea.

ID PERIOD-COHORT ANALYSIS; INTRINSIC ESTIMATOR; AGE
AB Background: In the past two decades, rates of suicide mortality have declined among most OECD member states. Two notable exceptions are Japan and South Korea, where suicide mortality has increased by 20 % and 280 %, respectively.
   Methods: Population and suicide mortality data were collected through national statistics organizations in Japan and South Korea for the period 1985 to 2010. Age, period of observation, and birth cohort membership were divided into five-year increments. We fitted a series of intrinsic estimator age-period-cohort models to estimate the effects of age-related processes, secular changes, and birth cohort dynamics on the rising rates of suicide mortality in the two neighboring countries.
   Results: In Japan, elevated suicide rates are primarily driven by period effects, initiated during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. In South Korea, multiple factors appear to be responsible for the stark increase in suicide mortality, including recent secular changes, elevated suicide risks at older ages in the context of an aging society, and strong cohort effects for those born between the Great Depression and the aftermath of the Korean War.
   Conclusion: In spite of cultural, demographic and geographic similarities in Japan and South Korea, the underlying causes of increased suicide mortality differ across these societies-suggesting that public health responses should be tailored to fit each country's unique situation.

TI The Impact of Improving Suicide Death Classification in South Korea: A
   Comparison with Japan and Hong Kong
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID UNDETERMINED DEATHS; ECONOMIC-CRISIS; RATES; AGE; STATISTICS; MORTALITY
AB Introduction
   The suicide rate of South Korea has increased dramatically during the past decades, as opposed to steadily decreasing trends in Japan and Hong Kong. Although the recent increase of suicide in South Korea may be related to changing socioeconomic conditions and other contextual factors, it may also reflect, in part, a reduction of misidentified suicide cases due to improving classification of manner of death.
   Method
   We compared the annual proportional change of suicide, undetermined death, and accidental death from South Korea with those of Japan and Hong Kong from 1992 to 2011; a greater proportional change of the manner-of-death categories during the period is indicative of a relatively less stable registration and hence a greater potential for misclassification bias on reported suicide trends. Subgroup analyses stratifying the deaths by methods were also conducted. To estimate the impact, the age-standardized rates of these three death categories in each site were calculated.
   Results
   We found that, during the 20-year observation period, the proportional change of suicide, undetermined death, and accidental death in South Korea was significantly greater than Japan and Hong Kong. Similar observations were made in subgroup analyses. While death rates of the three manners in Japan and Hong Kong generally moved in a parallel fashion, the increase of suicide in South Korea occurred concomitantly with a significant reduction of its accidental death rate. 43% of the increase in suicides could be attributed to the decrease in accidental deaths, while 57% of the increase could be due to fundamental causes.
   Conclusion
   Our data suggest that, during the mid-1990s and after, the increasing burden of suicide in South Korea initially was masked, in part, by misclassification. Thus, the later apparently rapid increase of suicides reflected steadily improving classification of manner of death, as well as a more fundamental increase in the suicide rate.

TI Impact of Macro-Level Socio-Economic Factors on Rising Suicide Rates in
   South Korea: Panel-Data Analysis in East Asia
SO JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH POLICY AND ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID TIME-SERIES; JAPAN; UNEMPLOYMENT; HEALTH; TRENDS; INEQUALITIES;
   INTEGRATION; MORTALITY; DURKHEIM; CYCLES
AB Background: The rapid increase in suicide rates in South Korea, particularly in the aftermath of the Asian economic crisis in the late 1990s, compares with the declining suicide rates observed in most other OECD countries over the same period.
   Aims of the Study: This study aimed to examine an array of macro-level societal factors that might have contributed to the rising suicide trend in South Korea.
   Methods: We first investigated whether this trend was unique to South Korea, or ubiquitous across five Asian countries/areas that are geographically and culturally similar (South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan), using WHO mortality data and national statistics (1980-2009). Age-standardised suicide rates (per 100,000 population) were calculated for each gender and age group (15-24, 25-44, 45-64, and 65+) for each country. Both panel data and country-specific time-series analyses were employed to investigate the impact of economic change and social integration/regulation on suicide.
   Results: Despite similarities in geography and culture, the rising trend of suicide rates was unique to South Korea. This atypical trend was most apparent for people aged 65 and over, which was in sharp contrast to the decreasing suicide trends observed in the other four Asian countries. The results of the panel data analyses generally pointed to a negative relationship between economic growth and suicide rates, particularly for working-aged people. The results of the time-series analyses further suggested that low levels of social integration, as indicated by rising divorce rates, may also have a role in rising suicide rates in South Korea, particularly for older people. Furthermore, the association between suicide rates and economic adversity (unemployment and economic downturn) was most salient among middle-aged men in South Korea.
   Discussion and Limitations: Compared to four other East Asian countries/areas (Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan), South Korea has uniquely experienced a rising trend of suicide rates over the past three decades, particularly among older people. The findings highlight the differential associations between social changes and suicide rates at various stages over a person's life course. Low levels of social integration and economic adversity may in part explain the atypical suicide trend in South Korea, especially for older people and middle-aged men, respectively. Data constraints, however, limit the scope for explanation in light of the complex and multifactorial causes of suicide.
   Implications for Health and Social Care Policies: Different age groups within the population require different policy interventions to curb the unprecedented rise in suicide rates in South Korea. Particularly for older people, there is a great need to strengthen methods of assisting family support as well as formulating models of social care that are financially-sustainable and culturally sensitive. More investment is also needed to strengthen labour market protection and/or expand social safety net for the unemployed.
   Implications for Further Research: The link between social integration and suicide rates deserves further empirical investigation, so that mediating factors that are amenable to policy actions can be better identified.

ID REPLICATION; IDEATION; PROGRAM
AB Suicide has dramatically increased in recent years, and South Korea is the highest rate among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member countries. Noteably, suicide is the leading cause of death in South Korea in youths aged 15-24. Approximately 70-90% of youth suicides are related to a preexisting psychiatric disorder such as depressive disorder, conduct disorder, or substance abuse. Recently, some studies have proposed nationwide suicide prevention programs, but there have been no systematic studies about suicide and suicide prevention programs particularly for adolescents. In South Korea, to establish an evaluation system of mental health screening services and to develop a case management program, a mental health promotion model for adolescents and a few programs for depression and suicide prevention for adolescents are currently being developed. Developmental considerations and a multidisciplinary approach in the treatment and prevention of suicidal adolescents are very important. In addition it is necessary to conduct a systematized nationwide survey of depression and suicide in adolescents.

AB Objective Throughout the past several years, there have been a number of entertainment celebrity suicides in South Korea. The aim of this study was to investigate the clustering of suicides following celebrities' suicides in South Korea from 2005 to 2008, particularly according to certain characteristics.
   Methods Seven celebrity suicides were examined and defined using the Korean Integrated Newspaper Database System (KINDS) and from these, we considered four affected periods occurring 28 days after each celebrity's suicide. A Poisson time-series autoregression model was used to estimate the relative risk of the total suicide number for each affected period from 2005 to 2008. Logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate whether there were specific increases in the numbers of suicides in subgroups matching each celebrity.
   Results There were significant increases in the risk of suicide during the affected periods. Remarkable increases were found in the subgroups matching each celebrity, especially in the group in which all factors (sex, age, and method) were similar.
   Conclusion This study provides confirmation that a significant copycat effect was induced by these celebrities' suicides, especially among people who identified more with the celebrities. This implies that countermeasures for upright media coverage of celebrity suicides should be discussed and practiced properly in South Korea.

DE Coal briquette; Copycat; Epidemic; Intentional poisoning; Mortality
ID CHARCOAL-BURNING SUICIDE; TAIWAN; RATES
AB Backgrounds: Suicide from carbon monoxide poisoning by burning coal briquette or barbecue charcoal increased rapidly in some East Asian countries in the recent decade. The purpose of this study was to examine trends in suicides from carbon monoxide poisoning in South Korea and their epidemiologic characteristics.
   Methods: We presented age-standardized mortality rates of carbon monoxide suicide and compared them with those of suicide by other methods using registered death data from Statistics Korea (South Korea) from 2006 to 2012. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to estimate odds ratios of carbon monoxide suicide by socio-demographic characteristics before and after the marked increase in carbon monoxide suicide in September 2008.
   Results: The number of carbon monoxide suicides in South Korea was only 34 in 2006 but rapidly increased to 267 in 2008 and was 1125 in 2012, with the age-standardized rates of 0.06 (2006), 0.48 (2008), and 1.97 (2012) per 100,000 population respectively (a striking 3,183% increase in 2006-2012). Suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning showed greater odds ratios among men, younger age groups, single or the divorced, and those with high education and non-manual jobs compared with suicides by other methods.
   Limitations: This study only used data for fatal self-poisoning by carbon monoxide (non-fatal cases not included) and had no information on the sources of carbon monoxide.
   Conclusions: Carbon monoxide suicides substantially increased in South Korea over the relatively short study period and showed some distinct sodo-demographic characteristics compared with suicides by other methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sex differences in suicide rates and suicide methods was compared among adolescents in South Korea, Japan, Finland, and the United States. This study analyzed suicide rates and suicide methods of adolescents aged 15-19 years in four countries, using the World Health Organization mortality database. Among both male and female adolescents, the most common method of suicide was jumping from heights in South Korea and hanging in Japan. In Finland, jumping in front of moving objects and firearms were frequently used by males, but not by females. In the United States, males were more likely to use firearms, and females were more likely to use poison. The male to female ratio of suicide rates was higher in the United States (3.8) and Finland (3.6) than in Korea (1.3) and Japan (1.9). Sex differences in suicide methods may contribute to differences in the suicide rates among males and female adolescents in different countries.

To better understand this phenomenon, the author analyzed all suicides in South Korea from 1997 to 2015 and charted the trend in suicide methods by gender. Over time, both genders rapidly chose hanging for suicide at the expense of drug/pesticide poisoning. Gassing was hardly used in the beginning, but its recent gain in use is noteworthy. Including undetermined deaths did not change the main results. The author regressed hanging on demographics and found that hanging was particularly chosen by ever-married men of prime working age with a respectable level of education.

AB Objective: Previous studies have indicated that suicide rates have significant seasonal variations. There is seasonal discordance between temperature and solar radiation due to the monsoon season in South Korea. We investigated the seasonality of suicide and assessed its association with climate variables in South Korea.
   Method: Suicide rates were obtained from the National Statistical Office of South Korea, and climatic data were obtained from the Korea Meteorological Administration for the period of 1992-2010. We conducted analyses using a generalized additive model (GAM). First, we explored the seasonality of suicide and climate variables such as mean temperature, daily temperature range, solar radiation, and relative humidity. Next, we identified confounding climate variables associated with suicide rate. To estimate the adjusted effect of solar radiation on the suicide rate, we investigated the confounding variables using a multivariable GAM.
   Results: Suicide rate showed seasonality with a pattern similar to that of solar radiation. We found that the suicide rate increased 1.008 times when solar radiation increased by 1 MJ/m(2) after adjusting for other confounding climate factors (P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Solar radiation has a significant linear relationship with suicide after adjusting for region, other climate variables, and time trends.

TI High Altitude Remains Associated with Elevated Suicide Rates after
   Adjusting for Socioeconomic Status: A Study from South Korea
SO PSYCHIATRY INVESTIGATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Suicide rate; Altitude; Socioeconomic status; South Korea
AB There have been several studies supporting a possible relationship between high suicide rate and high altitude. However socioeconomic status may confound this association because low socioeconomic status, which is known to be related to a high suicide rate, is also associated with living at high altitude. This study aims to explore whether the relationship between high altitude and high suicide rate remains after adjusting for socioeconomic status in South Korea. We collected demographic data of completed suicides, the mean altitude of the district where each suicide took place, and the mean income of each district. We analyzed the data using regression analysis before and after adjustment for mean income. We found that there is a positive correlation between altitude and suicide rate, even after adjustment for mean income. Thus, altitude appears to be an independent risk factor for suicide.

AB Suicide is a major public health concern in South Korea, and self-poisoning by pesticides is one of the common methods of suicide. Pesticide ban policies have been successful for suicide prevention; however, no studies have shown their effect according to occupational groups. The present study analyzed suicide and suicide by pesticide rates among South Korean workers aged 15-64 in 2003-2017, their associations with occupational groups, and the impact of three major economic indices on these factors. Workers in the agriculture, forestry, and fishery industries had relative risks of 5.62 (95% CI: 5.54-5.69) for suicide overall and 25.49 (95% CI: 24.46-26.57) for suicide by pesticide. The real gross domestic product had a positive association with suicide overall only in the last five-year period investigated in this study, and the unemployment rate consistently had a positive association. The economic status and policy for suicide prevention affected suicide and suicide by pesticide rates differently among occupational groups and different time periods. Policy addressing suicidal risk for different occupational groups should be of concern in South Korea.

AB Purpose The places of death for people who died of suicide were compared across eight countries and socio-demographic factors associated with home suicide deaths identified.
   Methods Death certificate data were analyzed; using multivariable binary logistic regression to determine associations.
   Results National suicide death rates ranged from 1.4 % (Mexico) to 6.4 % (South Korea). The proportion of suicide deaths occurring at home was high, ranging from 29.9 % (South Korea) to 65.8 % (Belgium). Being older, female, widowed/separated, highly educated and living in an urban area were risk factors for home suicide.
   Conclusions Home suicide deaths need specific attention in prevention programs.

AB Objectives Studies have highlighted the association between the degree of urbanicity and spatial disparities in suicide, but few have evaluated its changes across time. We explored the geospatial trends of suicide in South Korea from 1992 to 2012, and their relationship to the nation's evolving urbanicity.
   Setting South Korea.
   Primary outcome measures Age-sex-specific suicide rate.
   Results Suicide rates increased in all regions of South Korea during the study period. Controlling the effects of age and sex, there was an overall inverse relationship between the degree of urbanicity and regional suicide rates. These associations were, however, attenuated across the periods, as there were smaller increases in suicide rates in mid-sized urban regions as compared to larger cities and to rural areas. Increases over time in the suicide rates among youth and working-age adults were greater in large urban centres and in rural regions. For elders, the increase was far greater in rural regions.
   Conclusions The association of urbanicity and the geospatial pattern of suicide in South Korea was a dynamic process and varied by age groups across the course of two decades. Internal migration and related social processes most likely contributed to these changes.

AB Objective According to previous social survey, a high number of North Korean refugees (NKRs) in South Korea had suicidal ideation. The purpose of this study is to examine the related factors for suicidal ideation among NKRs by gender in South Korea.
   Methods We examined the sample of NKRs, 701 subjects (men=160, women=-541) residing in South Korea, the participants were enrolled from October 2008 to May 2014. The related factors with suicidal ideation in NKRs were analyzed via a logistic regression analysis.
   Results Refugee women were more likely to have suicidal ideation than men were. Although thoughts of suicide do not necessarily mean that they will follow through, however, there is an association that the higher rate of suicide also results in a higher rate of attempted suicide. In both genders, they tended to think more frequently about suicide who had stayed in South Korea for more than 5 years. In addition, higher frequencies of suicidal ideation also associated with higher level of perceived stress in both genders.
   Conclusion The gender difference should be addressed when designing suicide prevention interventions among the North Korean population in South Korea.

TI Impact of paraquat regulation on suicide in South Korea

DT Article
DE Death; intentional poisoning; intervention; legislation; pesticides
ID PESTICIDE REGULATION; TIME TREND; INSECTICIDES; POISONINGS; PATTERNS;
   DEATHS; CHOICE; RATES
AB Background: Ingestion of pesticides (mainly paraquat) accounted for one-fifth of suicides in South Korea in 2006-10. We investigated the effect on suicide mortality of regulatory action, culminating in a ban on paraquat in South Korea in 2011-12.
   Methods: We calculated age-standardized method-specific suicide mortality rates among people aged a parts per thousand yen15 in South Korea (1983-2013) using registered death data. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate changes in the rate and number of pesticide suicides in 2013, compared with those expected based on previous trends (2003-11).
   Results: Pesticide suicide mortality halved from 5.26 to 2.67 per 100 000 population between 2011 and 2013. Compared with the number expected based on previous trends, the regulations were followed by an estimated 847 [95% confidence interval (CI) -1180 to -533] fewer pesticide suicides, a 37% reduction in rates (rate ratio = 0.63, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.73) in 2013. The decline in pesticide suicides after the regulations was seen in all age/sex/geographical groups. The absolute reduction in the number of suicides was greatest among men, the elderly and in rural areas. The reduction in pesticide suicides contributed to 56% of the decline in overall suicides that occurred between 2011 and 2013. There was no impact of the regulations on crop yield.
   Conclusions: The regulation of paraquat in South Korea in 2011-12 was associated with a reduction in pesticide suicide. Further legislative interventions to prevent the easy availability of highly lethal suicide methods are recommended for reducing the number of suicides worldwide.

AB The attitudes of the general public and lawmakers toward suicide can influence the degree to which suicide prevention is prioritized in public policymaking. In this study, we compared the attitudes of urban residents, lawmakers, and community mental health workers toward suicide. Urban residents (N = 501) were surveyed through a telephone interview, while self-reported questionnaire was administered by lawmakers (N = 156) and community mental health workers (N = 121) through office visit and post, respectively. We used the Suicide Opinion Questionnaire to measure attitudes toward suicide in all three samples. Both the general public and legislators had insufficient knowledge and more permissive and uncaring attitudes toward suicide, whereas community mental health workers were more inclined to have sufficient knowledge of suicide and more intolerant and caring attitudes towards suicide. Therefore, lawmakers and the general public require education on suicide and suicide prevention, which may help lower South Korea's high suicide rate ranking among the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development member states.

AB South Korea has among the highest rates of suicide in the world, and previous research suggests that suicide frequency increases with anomalously high temperatures, possibly as a result of increased sunshine. However, it is unclear whether this temperature-suicide association exists throughout the entire year. Using distributed lag nonlinear modeling, which effectively controls for nonlinear and delayed effects, we examine temperature-suicide associations for both a warm season (April-September) and a cool season (October-March) for three cities across South Korea: Seoul, Daegu, and Busan. We find consistent, statistically significant, mostly linear relationships between relative risk of suicide and daily temperature in the cool season but few associations in the warm season. This seasonal signal of statistically significant temperature-suicide associations only in the cool season exists among all age segments, but especially for those 35 and older, along with both males and females. We further use distributed lag nonlinear modeling to examine cloud cover-suicide associations and find few significant relationships. This result suggests that that high daily temperatures in the cool season, and not exposure to sun, are responsible for the strong temperature-suicide associations found in South Korea.

AB Background: Suicide is one of the leading causes of mortality in both South Korea and Japan. Aims: The study aims to compare the descriptive epidemiology of suicide over the last two decades (1985-2006) and to explore the conditions associated with the different distribution of suicides in both countries. Methods: Age-standardized suicide rates were obtained from the OECD Health Data 2009. Age-specific suicide rates for the age groups were calculated from the WHO Mortality Database. Suicide methods were identified based on ICD-10. Results: Through 1980-2000, Japan showed consistently higher suicide rates compared to Korea. However, from the mid-1990s, Korea showed an acute increase of suicides and finally surpassed Japan; the age-standardized suicide rate of Korea increased from 10.2 (per 100,000) in 1985 to 21.5 in 2006, while it slightly increased from 18.4 to 19.1 in Japan. The highest age-specific suicide rate was observed among Japanese men aged 45-64 years and Korean men aged over 64 years. The increase of elderly suicides among Korean women was notable. The gender ratio increased in Japan and decreased in Korea, respectively. The preferred suicide methods were hanging and pesticide poisoning in Korea and hanging in Japan. Because of the limited number of observations, hypothesis testing of specific risk factors was not possible. Conclusions: Age and gender distribution of suicide rates differed considerably between the two countries. Welfare protection throughout the life course in both countries, and pesticide regulation in Korea would be helpful in reducing the burden of suicide mortality in both countries, even if the social values could not be changed in a short time.

ID US; INEQUALITY; POLICY
AB This research estimates the contextual effects of population-level alcohol consumption on the average suicide mortality rate (SMR) in South Korea from 2013 to 2015. The effect was estimated not only in relation to the risk factors of suicide, such as divorce and being elderly, but also protective factors, such as church attendance and educational attainment. Using a multivariable spatial regression model, results show that only excessive population-level alcohol consumption pattern had a positive effect on SMR by increasing 0.24 standardized units in the SMR; the moderate pattern, however, had no significant impact. These results imply that the excessive population-level alcohol consumption pattern is a risk factor with respect to SMR. This research suggests the implementation of policies to control population-level alcohol consumption, based on a concern for public health, to reduce the suicide risk in South Korea.

AB This article reviews risk factors for youth suicide in South Korea (hereafter referred to as Korea), based on the ecological systems theory. Although youth suicide is a major concern for Korean society, understanding of this phenomenon has been limited since most of the empirical studies address personal characteristics without much consideration to larger environmental contexts for Korean adolescents. This review integrates many empirical findings on Korean adolescents' suicidal ideation or behaviours within the context of micro-, meso-, exo-, macro-, and chrono-systems that surround an individual. Finally, it draws implications on assessment and intervention strategies for youth suicide that school psychologists and other mental health professionals in Korean schools can utilize.

AB This study investigated the cross-cultural relevance and validity of the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS) utilizing young adult samples from South Korea (n=554) and the United States (U.S.; n=390). To examine the ITS, all participants completed self-report questionnaires measuring Thwarted Belongingness, Perceived Burdensomeness, and Capability for Suicide. We examined whether each construct significantly predicted the severity of suicidal risk in both samples. We also determined whether the strength of the effects of Thwarted Belongingness and Perceived Burdensomeness on suicidal ideation differed between the two samples due to the greater degree of importance placed on interpersonal relationships in collectivistic cultures such as South Korea. Structural equation modeling was used to examine these hypotheses. Thwarted Belongingness, Perceived Burdensomeness, and Capability for Suicide significantly predicted elevated suicidal risk. However, there were no significant differences in the paths from Thwarted Belongingness or Perceived Burdensomeness to suicide risk between the South Korean and U.S. samples. These findings support the cross-cultural relevance and applicability of the ITS, whereby Thwarted Belongingness and Perceived Burdensomeness serve as indicators of suicide risk in both Western (U.S.) and East Asian (Korean) samples.

AB Japan and South Korea have among the highest suicide rates in the world. However, the age, gender, and time trends in each country differ substantially. Age-Period-Cohort (APC) analysis of suicide rates was conducted to better understand these differences. Using age- and gender-specific data on suicide between 1986 and 2015 in Japan and Korea, we implemented APC analysis to decompose the country-specific trends into age, calendar period, and birth cohort effects. APC analysis revealed three trends: (1) there was a sharp increase in suicide around retirement age in Korea but not in Japan (age effect); (2) there was a dramatic increase in suicide during the three decades of observation in Korea (period effect) whereas rates were more stable in Japan; and (3) the post-War generation in Japan (including baby boomer) had lower rates of suicide compared to generations born before 1916 or after 1961 (birth cohort effect), whereas suicide rate has increased linearly in each generation in Korea. Although Japan & Korea share high suicide rates, our APC analysis suggests divergent causes underlying these trends. Japanese suicide rates plateaued among the cohorts who experienced the post-War rapid economic growth (women born in 1951-1956 and men born in 1916-1961) (birth cohort effect) due to a strong social safety net for this cohort, while suicide rates in Korea continue to rise with each generation and is particularly elevated in post-retirement age. Japan and Korea need to pay more attention to suicide prevention in more recent birth cohorts.

AB Objectives The South Korean government has recently implemented policies to prevent suicide. However, there were few studies examining the recent changing trends in suicide rates. This study aims to examine the changing trends in suicide rates by time and age group.
   Design A descriptive study using nationwide mortality rates.
   Setting Data on the nationwide cause of death from 1993 to 2016 were obtained from Statistics Korea.
   Participants People living in South Korea.
   Interventions Implementation of national suicide prevention policies (first: year 2004, second: year 2009).
   Primary outcome measures Suicide was defined as X60-X84' code according to the ICD-10 code. Age-standardised suicide rates were estimated, and a Joinpoint regression model was applied to describe the trends in suicide rate.
   Results From 2010 to 2016, the suicide rates in South Korea have been decreasing by 5.5% (95% CI -10.3% to -0.5%) annually. In terms of sex, the suicide rate for men had increased by 5.0% (95% CI 3.6% to 6.4%) annually from 1993 to 2010. However, there has been no statistically significant change from 2010 to 2016. For women, the suicide rate had increased by 7.5% (95% CI 6.3% to 8.7%) annually from 1993 to 2009, but since 2009, the suicide rate has been significantly decreasing by 6.1% (95% CI -9.1% to -3.0%) annually until 2016. In terms of the age group, the suicide rates among women of almost all age groups have been decreasing since 2010; however, the suicide rates of men aged between 30 and 49 years showed continuously increasing trends.
   Conclusion Our results showed that there were differences in the changing trends in suicide rate by sex and age groups. Our finding suggests that there was a possible relationship between implementation of second national suicide prevention policies and a decline in suicide rate.

AB Suicide notes from two groups of protest suicides ill South Korea during the period 1975-2003 were compared: suicide notes from students (n = 16) and suicide notes from workers (n = 15). The students appeared to be acting upon abstract ideals, including the oppression of the masses by the government and the American forces in Korea, and they typically urged the reunification of Korea. The workers were acting upon more local concerns, such as the oppression of their union by the government and the companies and the policies of their specific companies.

TI Understanding the contribution of suicide to life expectancy in South
   Korea
SO DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID ECONOMIC-CRISIS; GENDER RATIO; JAPAN; RATES; MORTALITY; AGE
AB BACKGROUND
   South Korea has the highest rate and highest rate of increase in suicide among developed countries. The suicide epidemic in Korea is an anomaly, and suicide rates are high for both men and women, with no signs of decreasing. Yet we do not know the extent to which suicide has reduced life expectancy in Korea.
   OBJECTIVE
   We investigated whether and to what extent the rapid increase in suicide has contributed to changes in Korean life expectancy, a key indicator of population health.
   METHODS
   We used a recently developed decomposition method that separates the contribution of suicide's effect on change in life expectancy into two parts: that due to change in the overall suicide incidence rate and that due to change in the mean age of suicide victims.
   RESULTS
   From 1995 to 2010, life expectancy increased by 6.5 years in Korea, with change in most causes of death contributing to its growth. We nonetheless find, as expected, that the rise in suicides reduced the increase in life expectancy from 1995 to 2010, so life expectancy in Korea is about 0.21 years lower than it would have been without the increase in suicides. Moreover, had the age of suicide victims remained stable, we project that Korea's life expectancy would be fully 0.70 years lower than it is.
   CONCLUSION
   Although the growth in suicide was the largest single factor slowing the rise in Korean life expectancy, the effect would have been even larger had the age of suicide victims not increased.

AB Adolescent suicide behavior is a serious social concern in South Korea, and there is a current lack of knowledge regarding the overall strengths and weaknesses of school-based suicide prevention interventions (SPI) for this group. The aim of this study was to review the benefits of and barriers to effective implementation of existing SPI for adolescents in South Korea. A review of school-based SPI was performed using the PsycINFO, PubMed, ERIC, KoreaMed, RISS, KISS, and NDSL electronic databases. Among the identified publications, 18 were subsequently included in this review and were classified into three approach types: universal (seven studies), selective (four studies), and indicated (seven studies). Major health outcomes associated with adolescent suicide have been suggested, but different outcomes from SPI have been found. The health-related benefits of these interventions were decreases in suicide risk from depression, aggression, and suicide ideation, and increases in the protective factors of self-esteem, confidence, social relationships, and respect for the value of life. Barriers to successful implementation of SPI included less consideration of the effectiveness of SPI treatment duration, minimal or no follow-up monitoring, low participation due to parents' prejudices against mental health, and underdeveloped referral systems. The findings from this review suggest that there is a need to revise existing SPI programs in the future to take into account of cultural sensitivity. The resulting programs should be useful to researchers, therapists, school staff, parents, and legislators in South Korea. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID TRENDS; PREVENTION; DEATHS; STATES
AB Background: The lethality of the suicide method employed is a strong risk factor for the completion of suicide. We examined whether annual changes in the pattern of suicide methods is related to annual changes in suicide rates in South Korea, the United States (US), and Finland.
   Methods: We analyzed annual data from 2000-2011 for South Korea and Finland, and 2000-2010 for the US in order to examine trends in the rates and methods of suicide. Data on suicide methods were obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO) mortality database.
   Results: Along with an annual rapid increase in suicide rates, the incidence of hanging increased steadily while suicide by self-poisoning steadily decreased in South Korea. In the US, along with an annual increase in suicide rates, the proportion of suicides committed by hanging increased while those committed with the use of firearms steadily decreased. In Finland, annual changes in the suicide rate and suicide method were not statistically significant during the study period.
   Conclusions: Our present findings suggest that the increased use of specific lethal methods for suicide, namely hanging, is reflected in the increased suicide rates in the Korean and the US populations. The most effective approach for reducing overall suicide rates may be the implementation of population-based initiatives that reduce both the accessibility (e. g., access to firearms) and the social acceptability (e. g., effective and responsible regulations for reporting suicide) of lethal methods of suicide.

AB Background: Previous studies in Eastern as well as Western countries have shown a relationship between marital status and suicide mortality. However, to date, no Korean study has calculated national suicide rates by marital status for specific genders, ages, and education levels. This study investigated whether the relationship between marital status and suicide differs by age, gender, and educational attainment, and analyzed the effect of marital status on suicide risk after controlling for these socio-demographic variables.
   Methods: Using national mortality data from 2015, and aggregated census data from 2010 in South Korea, we created a virtually individualized dataset with multiple weighting algorithms, including individual socio-demographic characteristics and suicide rates across the entire population.
   Results: The findings show that the following groups faced the highest relative suicide risks: 1) divorced men of all ages and men aged more than 75 years, particularly divorced men aged more than 75; and 2) never-married men aged 55-64 years, and never-married women of lower education status.
   Limitations: We did not account for important variables such as mental health, substance abuse, employment insecurity, social integration, perceived loneness, and family income which we were unable to access.
   Conclusions: This current research extends prior theoretical and methodological work on suicide, aiding efforts to reduce suicide mortality in South Korea.

AB Seasonality of suicidal behavior has been widely reported in many epidemiological studies with a well replicated suicide peak in spring followed by a trough in winter season. Research from some regions over the past few decades has shown a diminishing seasonal pattern of suicides and this introduced a new perspective on the suicide study. Data on all suicide deaths from the period 1991 to 2015 was extracted from the South Korean National Death Registration data set which was made available by Statistics Korea. Our findings confirmed a strong seasonal effect of suicides in South Korea throughout the study period and a marked diminishing pattern was observed since the period of 2006-2010. The rhythm of suicides kept changing across the time intervals with a spring peak followed by a second peak in late summer/autumn. The seasonality varied across age groups and the seasonal effect among the Korean elderly suicides was still found to be significant though a diminishing pattern was observed recently.

AB Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death in South Korea, which is the highest rate among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member countries. The World Health Organization worldwide initiative for the prevention of suicide reported that there are at least 20 suicide attempts for every suicide committed. The lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, planning, and attempts in South Korea was 15.2%, 3.3%, and 3.2% (single 2.1% and multiple 1.1%), respectively. Suicide attempts showed a significant association with mental disorders, especially major depressive disorder in a Korea-based community study. Brain neuroimaging studies showed prefrontal localized hypofunction and impaired serotonergic responsivity in those attempting suicide, which are also typical findings in patients with depression. Postmortem studies have reported that approximately 60% of suicide victims suffered from major depressive disorder and other mood disorders. Family studies have suggested a genetic linkage between suicide and depression. In conclusion, suicide and suicidal behaviors are significantly associated with depression. Suicide is a medical condition which is treatable and preventable, and suicide rates can be reduced through early diagnosis and treatment for depression. Regular surveys for suicide and depression an essential tool for establishing a national policy for suicide prevention.

AB Purpose: Suicide has been considered a large public health concern in recent years because suicide mortality has been increasing rapidly. This study was done to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of a suicide attempt among adolescents in South Korea. Methods: The data of the 2006 Youth Health Risk Behavior web-based Survey collected by the Korean Center for Disease Control was analyzed using logistic regression for this study. Results: The prevalence of a suicide attempt was 5.2% in South Korea. The risk factors of a suicide attempt were suicidal ideation (odds 31.83), depression (odds 7.98), drug use (odds 4.67), currently smoking (odds 3.19), feeling unhappiness (odds 2.77), stress (odds 2.60), currently drinking alcohol (odds 2.39), sexual activity (odds 2.33), living with neither parent (odds 2.24), initial alcohol drinking by age 9(odds 1.80), health status (odds 2.15), skipped breakfast (odds 1.7), disease (odds 1.65), and school records (odds 1.22). Conclusion: Suicide screening and prevention programs should be developed, considering these risk factors. Suicide prevention programs should be applied to the at risk population prior to a suicide attempt.

AB Purpose: This study aims to examine how inequalities in suicide by education changed during and after macroeconomic restructuring following the economic crisis of 1997 in South Korea. Materials and Methods: Using Korea's 1995, 2000, and 2005 census data aggregately linked to mortality data (1993 - 2006), relative and absolute differentials in suicide mortality by education were calculated by gender and age among Korean population aged 35 and over. Results: Average annual suicide mortality rates have steadily increased from 1993 - 1997 to 2003 - 2006 in almost all sociodemographic groups stratified by gender, age, and education. Based on the relative index of inequality (RII) and slope index of inequality (SII), educational differentials in suicide mortality generally increased over time in men and women aged 45 years +. Although RII did not increase with year among men and women aged 35 - 44 years, SII showed a significantly increasing trend in this age group. Conclusion: These worsening absolute inequalities in suicide mortality indicate that the governmental suicide prevention policy should be directed toward socially disadvantaged groups of the Korean population.

AB Background/Purpose: Few studies have compared methods of suicide used by women in different countries. This study compared methods used by women in South Korea, Taiwan, Sweden and the United States.
   Methods: Age- and method-specific suicide rates for women in the four countries in 2002 were calculated and compared. Hanging, firearms and jumping from a height were classified as violent suicide methods. Poisoning suicides were further classified according to use of drugs, gases, pesticides and other agents.
   Results: Half of Taiwanese and American women used violent methods, while only one third of women in South Korea and Sweden used such methods. Poisoning was the most often used suicide method by women in all four countries. About 90% of American and Swedish women used drugs. In contrast, almost half of women from Korea and Taiwan used pesticides.
   Conclusion: Different countries contrast greatly in the agents used in suicide by poisoning but not in patterns of violent methods used. [J Formos Med Assoc 2009;108(6):452-459]

AB Background Pesticide ingestion is among the most commonly used suicide methods globally. Underestimation of deaths by pesticide self-poisoning is thought to be common but under-researched. We investigated potential misclassification and underestimation of suicide by pesticide poisoning and their impact on trends in pesticide suicide in South Korea.
   Methods We compared sociodemographic profiles between deaths certified as suicide, undetermined deaths and injuries by poisoning using pesticides, unspecified chemicals and medicines/alcohol in South Korea (1991-2012), and calculated similarity scores. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to examine time trends.
   Results The profiles of deaths classified as pesticide suicides showed generally similar patterns to those for undetermined deaths/injuries by poisoning using pesticides and suicides/undetermined deaths/injuries by poisoning using unspecified chemicals. Over the study period, the number of pesticide suicides (on average 2033 per year; range 623-3530) would increase by 15%, 23% and 31%, when assuming that 20%, 30% and 40% of deaths in alternative cause-of-death categories were misclassified pesticide suicides respectively. Age-standardised rates of pesticide suicide increased more than four times in 1991-2003 but fell by around 50% in 2003-2012. This trend did not change when the assumed proportion of misclassification was 20%, whereas the rapid increase in 2000-2003 would be lessened if misclassification occurred by 30% or more.
   Conclusions Pesticide suicides may be underestimated in South Korea as some are possibly misclassified as deaths due to other causes; however, such underestimation would not substantially affect estimated secular trends.

Jonghyun, and dozens more like him, is a type of Korean celebrity known as an "idol." In addition to being popular within Korea, idols are the public face of K-pop, which has become a worldwide phenomenon. This has made idols into incarnations of Korea and Korean culture, and brought the public's powerful disciplining gaze to bear on these young performers. In this paper, we explore how characteristics of life in contemporary Korea-including a high suicide rate, and intense pressures in education and employment-compound with idols' years of intense training in singing and dancing without adequate attention to physical, much less mental, health. Although this is the first incident of an A-list K-pop idol committing suicide, we propose that the nature of contemporary Korean celebrity, together with specific factors defining the lives of Korean youth, create an environment where suicide may become even more prevalent, escalating Korea's suicide rate, which is already among the world's highest. Finally, we discuss the potential impact of Jonghyun's suicide on K-pop fans.

AB Background: Suicide rates have recently been decreasing on average among OECD countries, but increasing trends have been detected in South Korea, particularly since the 1997 economic crisis. There have been no detailed analyses about the changes of the suicide rates over time periods in Korea. We examined trends in both absolute and proportional suicide rates over the time period of economic development, crisis, and recovery (1986-2005) as well as in birth cohorts from 1924 to 1978.
   Methods: We used data on total mortality and suicide rates from 1986 to 2005 published online by the Korean National Statistical Office (NSO) and extracted data for individuals under 80 years old. The analyses of the trends for 1) the sex-age-specific total mortality rate, 2) the sex-age-specific suicide rate, and 3) the sex-age-specific proportional suicide rate in 1986-2005 were conducted. To demonstrate the birth cohort effect on the proportional suicide rate, the synthetic birth cohort from 1924 to 1978 from the successive cross-sectional data was constructed.
   Results: Age standardized suicide rates in South Korea increased by 98% in men (from 15.3 to 30.3 per 100,000) and by 124% in women (from 5.8 to 13.0 per 100,000). In both genders, the proportional increase in suicide rates was more prominent among the younger group aged under 45, despite the absolute increase being attributed to the older group. There were distinct cohort effects underlying increasing suicide rates particularly among younger age groups.
   Conclusion: Increasing suicide rates in Korea was composed of a greater absolute increase in the older group and a greater proportional increase in the younger group.

AB Korea has the highest suicide rate amongst the OECD countries. Yet, its research on suicidal behaviors has been primitive. While the Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide has gained global attention, there has only been a few researches, which examined its applicability in Korea. In this article, we review the previous studies on suicide and examine the association between the Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide and traditional Korean culture, with an emphasis on Collectivism and Confucianism. We propose that pathways to suicide might vary depending on cultural influences. Clinical implications and suggestions for future research will be discussed.

AB Objective Suicide is the leading cause of death in 10-39-year-olds in South Korea, and the second highest rate among the OECD countries. However, few studies have investigated the particularity of completed suicide in South Korea.
   Methods Study subjects consisted of 2,838 suicide cases and 56,758 age and sex matched living controls from a national representative sample of 1,025,340 South Koreans. They were obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) with follow-up up to 12 years. We obtained information on primary diagnosis of any ICD-10 disorder along with suicide cases during their lifetime.
   Results Among ICD-10 disorders, depression was the most common disorder (19.10%, n=542), found in victims of completed suicides except for common medical disorders such as hypertensive crisis, respiratory tract infection or arthropathies. After adjusting for sex, age, economic status, disability, and disorders, schizophrenia showed the strongest association with suicide (AOR: 28.56, 95% CI: 19.58-41.66) among all ICD-10 disorders, followed by psoriasis, multiple body injury, epilepsy, sleep disorder, depression, and bipolar disorder. For age groups, <= 19 years was associated with anxiety disorder (AOR=80.65, 95% CI: 13.33-487.93), 20-34 years with epilepsy (AOR=134.92, 95% CI: 33.69-540.37), both 35-49 years (AOR=108.57, 95% CI: 37.17-317.09) and 50-65 years (AOR=189.41 95% CI: 26.59-1349.31), with schizophrenia, and >65 years (AOR=44.7, 95% CI: 8.93-223.63) with psoriasis.
   Conclusion Psychiatric and physical disorders carried greatly increased risks and numbers of suicides in South Korea. Schizophrenia was the strongest risk factor, especially 35-65 years, and depression was the most common in suicide victims among ICD-10 disorders in South Korea.

AB For more than 10 years, the suicide rate in South Korea has been the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Suicide-prevention strategies, such as restricting access to lethal suicide methods, have been implemented in Korea. In this paper, we discuss suicide-prevention strategies that restrict access to the five leading methods for committing suicide: pesticide ingestion, inhalation of charcoal fumes, jumping from heights, placing oneself in front of moving subway trains, and hanging oneself by the neck. Of the five suicide-prevention strategies outlined in our study, prohibition of the herbicide paraquat and installation of screen doors were proven to be effective, while others need further assessments. Yet, the overall decline in suicide rate from 31.7 per 100,000 people in 2011 to 27.3 per 100,000 people in 2014 suggests that these suicide-prevention strategies have successfully decreased the suicide rate in Korea.

AB A neighborhood-level analysis of mortality from suicide would be informative in developing targeted approaches to reducing suicide. This study aims to examine the association of community characteristics with suicide in the 424 neighborhoods of Seoul, South Korea.
   Neighborhood-level mortality and population data (2005-2011) were obtained to calculate age-standardized suicide rates. Eight community characteristics and their associated deprivation index were employed as determinants of suicide rates. The Bayesian hierarchical model with mixed effects for neighborhoods was used to fit age-standardized suicide rates and other covariates with consideration of spatial correlations.
   Suicide rates for 424 neighborhoods were between 7.32 and 71.09 per 100,000. Ninety-nine percent of 424 neighborhoods recorded greater suicide rates than the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member countries' average. A stepwise relationship between area deprivation and suicide was found. Neighborhood-level indicators for lack of social support (residents living alone and the divorced or separated) and socioeconomic disadvantages (low educational attainment) were positively associated with suicide mortality after controlling for other covariates.
   Finding from this study could be used to identify priority areas and to develop community-based programs for preventing suicide in Seoul, South Korea.

AB This study investigated suicidal behavior prevalence and its association with physical and sexual health, and behavior-related factors among female sex workers in South Korea. Using time location sampling, we recruited 1,083 sex workers for an interviewer-administered questionnaire regarding sexual behavior, sociodemographics, and self-rated health (SRH) status. Participants were also tested for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). We used binary logistic regression analysis to define suicide attempt factors. Around 28 % of sex workers in the sample reported that they had attempted suicide in the past year. Suicide attempts were independently associated with drinking alcohol almost every day, not using condom regularly, STD infection experience, and unfavorable SRH status. Higher suicide attempt likelihood was associated with poor sexual and physical health, but there was no significant association with the number of customers per week. We thus need to revive STD screening programs provided by the government and to support mental health programs.

AB Background: The aim of this study is to examine the validity and reliability of the Korean version of attitudes towards suicide (ATTS) on a group of university students, which would contribute to the evaluation of the ATTS as a useful tool of measuring attitudes toward suicide in South Korea with very high suicide rates.
   Methods: The subjects of the study were 195 undergraduates at Chung-Ang University, South Korea in 2013. The measure for assessing public attitudes towards suicide was ATTS made up of 34 items in English and the Korean version of it was produced by forward and backward translation procedure. To identify any factors unique to South Koreans' attitudes towards suicide, we applied exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to the data from 195 university students and was followed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to assess construct validity of the Korean version. The internal consistency of the scale was assessed using Cronbach's a and the assessment of the test-retest reliability was performed by intraclass correlation coefficients.
   Results: On the EFA analysis, were excluded, the tool had 11 factors (32 items), accounting for 62.99 % of the total variance in participants' responses. CFA failed to support 11-factor model of the scale. Six out of 11 factors were acceptable in terms of both internal consistency and test-retest reliability.
   Conclusions: Six factors of the Korean version of the ATTS had acceptable content validity and reliability. However, on the whole, it did not have good construct validity and thus further investigations are needed to develop a scale measuring true public attitudes toward suicide in South Korea.

ID MOVEMENT ORGANIZATIONS; DIFFUSION; DEMOCRACY; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS
AB Widely recognised as an indispensable element in South Korea's political democratisation, protest suicide has conjured up an image of insurmountable spirit and steely resolve by heroic fighters challenging the powerful authoritarian state. Based on a systematic examination of 125 cases of protest suicide from 1970 to 2015, this article exposes the deficiencies in previous accounts and contends that protest suicide is not a uniform practice but an evolving political form that reflects changes in the broader political environment. Calling into question the conventional account that attributes protest suicide to severe state oppression, the article shows how protest suicide became most prominent in the late 1980s in the context of expanding political space, not in the earlier periods when the political climate was most adverse. The article also traces the gradual change of protest suicide from an aggressive political weapon meant to spur mass protest towards a more defensive act by workers who use death to communicate frustration, weariness and despair as they protest injustice. These findings suggest the need to embrace a more nuanced understanding of protest suicide and reflect on the nature of political democracy in the age of neo-liberalism.

AB Background: The suicide rate of the youth in South Korea has been increasing, and suicide of the youth still has been the most common cause of death since 2007. We aimed to determine the trends and the regional risk factors of youth suicide in South Korea from 2001 to 2010.
   Subjects and Methods: We used the data from the National Statistical Office to calculate the standardized suicide rates and various regional data including population census, employment, and labor. To calculate the effect of individual risk factors, we used the data from the fourth Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBWS-VI). Conditional autoregressive model for regional standardized mortality ratio (SMR) using inter-regional spatial information was fitted.
   Results: Suicide rates of adolescents aged 12 to 18 was from 3.5 per 100,000 people in 2001 and 5.3 per 100,000 in 2010. There were no significant gender difference in suicide rates, however, the number of suicides among adolescents aged 15-18 accounted for four times than those of adolescents ages 12-14. High proportion of late adolescents, higher number of recipients of national basic livelihood, and higher number of adolescents who treated with depression were related to elevated suicide rate of adolescent. Total sleep time of adolescents and regional unemployment rate were negatively associated with the suicide risk of respective regions.
   Conclusions: Age distribution, economic status, total sleep time, and the number of adolescent patients with depression were different between those in low and in high adolescent suicidal regions in Korea. Our findings suggest that preferential appliance of adolescent suicide prevention program for regions by considering those factors may be important steps to reduce adolescent suicide in Korea.

AB Objective Although evidence suggests that there is an increase in suicide rates in the general population following celebrity suicide, the rates are heterogeneous across celebrities and countries. It is unclear which is the more vulnerable population according to the effect sizes of celebrity suicides to general population.
   Methods All suicide victims in the general population verified by the Korea National Statistical Office and suicides of celebrity in South Korea were included for 7 years from 2005 to 2011. Effect sizes were estimated by comparing rates of suicide in the population one month before and after each celebrity suicide. The associations between suicide victims and celebrities were examined.
   Results Among 94,845 suicide victims, 17,209 completed suicide within one month after 13 celebrity suicides. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that suicide victims who died after celebrity suicide were significantly likely to be of age 20-39, female, and to die by hanging. These qualities were more strongly associated among those who followed celebrity suicide with intermediate and high effect sizes than lower. Younger suicide victims were significantly associated with higher effect size, female gender, white collar employment, unmarried status, higher education, death by hanging, and night-time death. Characteristics of celebrities were significantly associated with those of general population in hanging method and gender.
   Conclusion Individuals who commit suicide after a celebrity suicide are likely to be younger, female, and prefer hanging as method of suicide, which are more strongly associated in higher effect sizes of celebrity suicide.

DE Suicide; Reporting guidelines; Newspapers; South Korea
ID CELEBRITY SUICIDE; MEDIA; PORTRAYAL; COVERAGE
AB Background: With the dishonor of being the highest suicide rated country in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, South Korea should take more initiatives in suicide prevention. Although the role of the media and its relation to actual suicide attempts has been tested and supported by many studies, the suicide reporting guidelines are not well followed. The purpose of this study is to examine how well Korean newspapers adhere to existing guidelines and to suggest limitation and improvements for the current guidelines.
   Methods: Five mainstream newspapers in South Korea, namely, Kyunghyang Shinmun, Hankyoreh, Chosun Ilbo, JoongAng Daily, and Dong-A Ilbo, were chosen for the analysis. Using the Naver news search engine, articles dated from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2017, were selected with the keyword "suicide" and advanced option "printed newspaper." However, articles, columns, opinions, and reviews that utilized the word "suicide" in a general context were excluded from the final analysis. Finally, the number of cases was narrowed down to 368. Each article was analyzed using the guideline framework consisting of 13 items: sensational coverage, overstatement direct wording, method used, details about site/location, photographs, suicide note, generalization, speculation, romanticization, interviews with the bereaved, help-seeking information, and public education.
   Results: More than 60% of the articles included direct wording (63.9%), mentioned the method used (68.2%), and provided details about the site or location (74.5%). Nearly half of the articles revealed the contents of the suicide note (44.6%). Less than 3% of the suicide reports had information about hotline logo or phone numbers (1.4%) and facts regarding suicide and suicide prevention (2.2%).
   Conclusions: Our study revealed that the guidelines were ineffective in their monitoring role and that most of the newspapers were incompliant with many significant guideline items in South Korea. Our findings not only explore the limitations of the current guidelines but also provide an important rationale as to why there should be stronger suicide monitoring regulation or an agency with sufficient authority to prevent suicide in a nation-wide scale.

AB Background: This study examines the extent to which the indiscriminate media coverage of the famous young actress Lee Eun-ju's suicide in 2005 affected suicides overall and in specific subgroups (by age, gender, and suicide method) in a suicide-prone society, South Korea.
   Methods: South Korea's 2003-2005 suicide data (n=34,237) were obtained from death certificate records of the National Statistical Office (NS0). Data was analyzed with Poisson time series autoregression models.
   Results: After adjusting for confounding factors (such as seasonal variation, calendar year temperature, humidity, and unemployment rate), there was a significant increase in suicide (RR-1.40, 95%, Cl =1.301.51, no of excess mortalities-331; 95% CI-267-391) during the 4 weeks after Lee's suicide. This increase was more prominent in subgroups with similar characteristics to the celebrity. In particular, the relative risk of suicide during this period was the largest (5.24; 95% Cl 3.31-8.29) in young women who used the same suicide method as the celebrity. Moreover, the incidence of these copycat suicides during the same time significantly increased in both genders and in all age subgroups among those who committed suicide using the same method as the celebrity (hanging).
   Limitations: It is difficult to prove conclusively that the real motivation of the suicides was Lee's death.
   Conclusions: The findings from this study imply that, if the media indiscreetly reports the suicide of a celebrity in a suicide prone society, the copycat effect can be far-reaching and very strong, particularly for vulnerable people. (C )2013 Elsevier EN. All rights reserved.

TI Geographical Inequalities in Suicide Rates and Area Deprivation in South
   Korea

   DISORDERS; MORTALITY; WALES; ASSOCIATION; DEPRESSION
AB Background: Recent years have witnessed growing interest in determinants of suicide in South Korea. While much of the research has paid attention to the role of individual factors in explaining suicide mortality, another potentially important dimension of health inequality is geography.
   Aims of the Study: To describe the geographical distribution of suicide rates in South Korea, and to examine to what extent the distribution is shaped by area deprivation.
   Methods: Using 2004-2006 mortality data and 2005 population census data, the study first described the spatial mapping of age-standardised suicide rates and level of area deprivation across 250 districts in South Korea. A spatial lag model was also employed to examine the association between the two, taking into account the spatial dependence and interactions between neighbouring districts, as indicated by Moran's I and Geary' C statistics. In addition to level of area deprivation, population density, welfare spending, and rates of divorce, marriage and fertility at district-level were added to the model.
   Results: The spatial mapping of suicide rates across 250 districts exhibited a different pattern between males and females. While the highest suicide rates tended to cluster in the north-east region of South Korea for males', no clear pattern was observed for females. On the other hand, the lowest suicide rates for both males and females were found in most districts of the capital city. The results of the spatial lag model revealed a significant association between suicide rates and area deprivation, particularly for male suicide. Compared to the least deprived area, there were about 12-13 more male suicide cases (per 100,000 males) in highly deprived areas. The association with area deprivation was less clear for females. Population density was negatively associated with suicide rates for both males and females. While suicide rates were in general positively associated with divorce rates and negatively associated with fertility rates, the coefficients of both were not significant in the model for females.
   Discussion and Limitations: The study highlighted substantial geographical variation in suicide rates across South Korea. Such variation can be largely explained by level of area deprivation, especially for males. The level of excess suicides (i.e. 12-13 per 100,000 males) in highly deprived areas was similar to the average suicide rates of OECD countries. Due to the paucity of individual-level data however, the study was unable to test whether or not these associations were independent of population composition.
   Implications for Health Policies: Prioritising development in relatively more deprived areas would potentially minimise resource barriers. Since such area-based approaches focus on a body with clear responsibility (i.e. local authority) and a greater relevance for local residents, programmes and services can be more effectively tailored to local needs and also more effectively delivered to local residents.
   Implications for Further Research: Alternative sources of data with individual-level data should be explored to strengthen the basis of the present findings, and also to examine the exact mechanism underlying the associations between suicide rates and area deprivation.

AB The purpose of this study was to identify the differences in suicide risk, meaning in life, and need for life respect among three age groups (young adults, the middle aged, and the elderly) of 540 public hospital outpatients in South Korea. This was a cross-sectional study. Among these 3 age groups, we observed significant differences in suicide risk, meaning in life, and need for life respect according to education level, marital status, living arrangements, type of disease, gender, and monthly income. These findings might contribute to the prevention of suicide in the future and the implementation of better community-based nursing care.

AB Background: The purpose of this study was to determine the characteristics of childhood suicidal deaths among elementary school students that occurred from 2011 to 2015 in Korea.
   Methods: The report form of each suicide case by the teacher in charge to the Education Ministry was reviewed retrospectively.
   Results: There were 19 suicidal deaths (12 boys, 7 girls) in elementary school students. The youngest case was a third grader (n = 1). Jumping from heights (n = 12) was the most frequently used method. Most suicides (n = 12) were committed in their homes.
   Conclusion: These results highlight the alarming trend of early suicidal deaths and the importance of early suicide prevention strategies, especially in schools.

We used interpretative phenomenological analysis for data collection and analysis and conducted in-depth interviews with 11 participants in Korea to evaluate the positive changes subsequent to the suicide. Participants revealed positive outcomes in response to losing an immediate family member to suicide after suffering the "most unimaginable pain" including (a) "Now I know what the most important thing in life is," (b) "Warm and intimate relationships matter," and (c) "Survivors of suicide's search for meaning." The implications of these findings and avenues for future research are discussed.

ID MEDIA CAMPAIGN; ANNOUNCEMENTS; DEPRESSION
AB Background: One of the critical measures in suicide prevention is promoting public awareness of crisis hotline numbers so that individuals can more readily seek help in a time of crisis. Although public service advertisements (PSA) may be effective in raising the rates of both awareness and use of a suicide hotline, few investigations have been performed regarding their effectiveness in South Korea, where the suicide rate is the highest among OECD countries. Aims: The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a television PSA campaign. Method: We analyzed a database of crisis phone calls compiled by the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare to track changes in call volume to a crisis hotline that was promoted in a TV campaign. We compared daily call counts for three periods of equal length: before, during, and after the campaign. Results: The number of crisis calls during the campaign was about 1.6 times greater than the number before or after the campaign. Relative to the number of suicide-related calls in the previous year, the number of calls during the campaign period surged, displaying a noticeable increase. Conclusion: The findings confirmed that this campaign had a positive impact on call volume to the suicide hotline.

AB We investigated the effects of a large range of clinical factors on the long-term risk of suicide in the general population of South Korea. We analyzed the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHISNSC) database in South Korea. A total of 300,232 individuals were followed for up to 12 years. We obtained information on demographic variables (age and sex), lifestyle variables (cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking and exercise), psychiatric and physical disorders, laboratory examination results and physical examination findings. We conducted a competing risk survival analysis to estimate the risk of completed suicide. 725 individuals (241/100,000) died by suicide in the follow-up period. After Bonferroni correction, we found a significant suicide risk associated with 6 variables: Parkinson's disease, depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (inverted association), elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase levels, male gender and age. Before Bonferroni correction, variables such as cigarette smoking, heavy alcohol drinking, psychotic disorder, other psychiatric disorder, benzodiazepine use and higher fasting glucose showed some significant association. In addition, body mass index and height were inversely related to completed suicide before Bonferroni correction. However, only the 6 variables listed above were robust predictors of suicide in the fully adjusted analyses with multiple test correction. Common medical conditions had no clear influence on suicide. Diverse clinical factors influenced the long-term risk of completed suicide in this general population sample. Comprehensive assessment of these risk factors will facilitate more focused suicide surveillance measures.

AB This study explores the prevalence of adolescent depression in South Korea and community-level factors related to it, to inform interventions to reduce it. Data were obtained from 36,889 high school students from 39 neighborhoods from the Eighth Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey conducted in 2012. Two-level multilevel logistic regression model analysis was used to examine the association of adolescent depression with neighborhood socioeconomic composition, education environment, and community wellbeing. The prevalence of adolescent depression differed by neighborhood. It was associated with differences in Family Affluence Scores, but not with the Government Financial Independence Ratio. Adolescents living in neighborhoods with higher suicide rates were more likely to have depression, but community education environment did not affect the risk of depression. To reduce adolescent depression, both individual- and community-level approaches should be implemented. Specifically, policy should focus on alleviating economic inequality within neighborhoods and preventing suicides. Adolescents living in neighborhoods with higher economic inequality and higher suicide rates should be given priority.

AB Background Multiple studies have shown that macroeconomic factors are associated with changes in suicide rates. We investigated how changes in economic conditions associated with the recent economic crisis in South Korea influenced suicide rates among working-age adults.
   Methods Time-series analyses were performed to examine the temporal associations of national unemployment rates and sex-employment-specific suicide rates in South Korea from 2003 to 2011, with particular attention to the increases of suicides that occurred during the recessionary period that began in 2008. We also compared the relative risk of suicide among different occupations.
   Results National unemployment rates were positively associated with suicide rates among employed and unemployed men and women, with a 2-month to 3month lagged period. Significant increases of suicide rates among working-age adults during the recession were detected in most of the subgroups stratified by age, sex and employment status. Forty-three per cent of the increase of suicides was derived from the employed population. Compared with workers in elementary occupations, the relative risk of suicide for mangers increased by threefold during the recessionary period. Among those who were employed, half of the increases in suicides occurred among clerks and workers involved in sales and services.
   Conclusions Changes in macroeconomic conditions are tied to population-level suicide risks for employed and unemployed persons. However, these associations vary depending on sex, employment status and occupational roles. In advance of future economic crises, it is important to develop prevention initiatives intended to reach the diverse populations potentially exposed to the adverse effects of sudden economic disruptions.

ID HEALTH
AB Suicide is the leading cause of death among South Korean adolescents. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between suicidal thoughts (ST) and suicidal attempts (SA) with the level of physical activity (PA) among South Korean adolescents. Based on data from the eighth Korea Youth Risk Behaviors Web-Based Survey, 74,186 South Korean adolescents were evaluated in terms of their relationship between meeting guidelines for vigorous PA (VPA), moderate PA (MPA), and low PA (LPA) and in respect of ST and SA status. The adjusted odds ratio in adolescents who thought about suicide increased significantly with PA levels (1.02 in males, 1.21 in females with VPA, 1.10 in males, 1.18 in females with MPA, and 1.16 in males, 1.20 in females with LPA) compared to participants who did not think about suicide. In addition, the AOR in adolescents who attempted suicide increased significantly with PA levels (1.16 in males, 1.36 in females with VPA, 1.13 in males, 1.15 in females with MPA, and 1.26 in males, 1.15 in females with LPA) compared to participants who did not attempt suicide. These results show that VPA, MPA, and LPA are positively associated with ST and SA prevention in South Korean adolescents. Therefore, to prevent suicide of South Korean adolescents, we support public health program including PA participation.

AB This study examines the potential of delayed monthly bill payments as a predictor of suicidal behavior in South Korea with the highest suicide rate among developed countries. Using the Korea Welfare Panel Study, multivariable logistic regressions examined the association between suicide ideation/attempts and the frequency of late payments on utility bills or National Health Insurance premium during last three years. Confounding factors such as past depression and suicide ideation/attempts history were adjusted for. Among 10,988 individuals, 2.7% reported suicide ideation and 0.11% attempted suicide in the past year, while 7.1% reported they paid late once or more during the last three years. Adults with two or more delayed payment had 2.32 times increased odds of suicidal ideation and 10.99 times increased odds of suicide attempts, compared to having no late payments. Adjusting for other socio-economic characteristics rarely changed the relationship between late payments and suicide ideation/attempts (for suicidal ideation, OR = 2.11; for suicide attempts: OR = 7.44), suggesting the independent effect of late payments on suicide behavior. With these findings, it can be suggested that late payment is an important factor, preemptively signaling suicide behavior with serious consequences in health and life.

AB Previous research has suggested that children and adolescents in residential care are at high risk of suicide. Empirical studies on this topic in South Korea, however, are scarce. Our objectives were to 1) examine the relative risk of suicide among children in residential care compared with those not in residential care, 2) evaluate how the relative risk of suicide is associated with age, and 3) explore the trend in relative risk of suicide over time. We used repeated cross-sectional survey data from nationally representative samples of 848,451 children aged 12 to 18 in South Korea between 2007 and 2018 to examine the association between residence type and risk of suicide. The results of the pooled logistic regression suggest that the suicide risk of children and adolescents in residential care is significantly higher than that of children and adolescents not in residential care. We also found that the association between the type of residence (residential care or not) and risk of suicide among children and adolescents varied depending on their age. We then performed a series of logistic regressions for each survey year to compare the odds ratios of suicide risk in children and adolescents in residential care versus those not in residential care. The findings suggest that the relative risk of suicide among children and adolescents in residential care has increased during the past 12 years. This increasing trend was more prominent in older adolescents.

AB Purpose
   This study examined trends in the suicide rates of persons with foreign background in Japan.
   Methods
   Using the nationwide death records in the Vital Statistics of Japan, we first reported the age-adjusted suicide rates of 8 foreign nationals (Brazil, China, Korea, Peru, the Philippines, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States) in Japan by sex from 1980 to the mid-2010s. We also computed rate ratios to compare the suicide rate of each group with those of the Japanese population. Second, we focused on Koreans, who had the highest suicide rate in Japan. We compared the suicide rates of Koreans in Japan with Koreans in South Korea to examine whether their suicide rates were more closely related to those of their country of origin or those of their host country.
   Results
   We found that the suicide rates of Koreans and Chinese in Japan were similar to or higher than those of Japanese, while other groups tended to show lower suicide rates. Most notably, Koreans displayed consistently high suicide rates from 1980 to the mid-2010s, which were nearly twice as high as those of the Japanese population. Korean males and females in Japan had higher suicide rates than those in South Korea.
   Conclusions
   Immigrants in Japan were not necessarily influenced by the suicide rates of the host country. The high suicide rates among Korean residents in Japan might be explained by various disadvantages and adversities that they face in Japan.

AB The issue of health inequalities has steadily gained attention in South Korea, as income inequality widened and social polarization increased following the country's economic crisis in the late 1990s. While official figures indicate a general trend of worsening mental health, with rapidly rising rates of suicide and depression in particular, the extent of socio-economic inequality with respect to mental health problems has not been well elucidated. This study aimed to measure income-related inequalities in depression, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in South Korea and to trace their changes over a 10-year period (1998-2007). The concentration index approach was employed to quantify the degree of income-related inequalities, using four waves of the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. The study found persistent pro-rich inequality in depression, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts over the past decade (i.e., individuals with higher incomes were less likely to have these conditions). The inequalities actually doubled over this period. These findings imply a need for expanded social protection policies for the less privileged in the population.

AB Because suicide is irreversible, prevention is paramount. For the optimal strategy to reduce lethal means, we sought to investigate age- and sex-associated variations in suicide methods. Data on annual causes of death from 1991 to 2015 in the Republic of Korea were used. Major sociodemographic correlates of the five suicide methods were analyzed by multiple multinominal logistic regression analysis. Among a total of 239,565 suicides from 1991 to 2015, hanging was most common. Gas poisoning sharply increased from 2007 to 2015. The gap between hanging and the second most common method of suicide has increased from 659 in 2004 to 4,433 in 2015. Charcoal burning was most commonly used by males younger than 45 years of age, whereas pesticide was commonly used by both sexes ages 55 years and older. Our results suggest that age- and sex-specific suicide prevention strategies are needed, particularly for gas and pesticide poisoning.

AB Aims. Korea has the highest suicide rate of developed countries, two times higher than the USA. Suicide trends among Koreans Americans living in the USA during the same period have not yet been described. We report suicide mortality rates and trends for four groups: (1) Korean Americans, (2) non-Hispanic White (NHW) Americans, (3) selected Asian American subgroups and (4) Koreans living in the Republic of Korea.
   Methods. We used US national (n = 18 113 585) and World Health Organization (WHO) (n = 232 919 253) mortality records for Korea from 2003 to 2012 to calculate suicide rates, all expressed per 100 000 persons. We assessed temporal trends and differences in age, gender and race/ethnicity using binomial regression.
   Results. Suicide rates are highest in Koreans living in the Republic of Korea (32.4 for men and 14.8 for women). Suicide rates in Korean Americans (13.9 for men and 6.5 for women) have nearly doubled from 2003 to 2012 and exceed rates for all other Asian American subgroups (5.4-10.7 for men and 1.6-4.2 for women). Suicide rates among NHWs (21.0 for men and 5.6 for women) remain high. Among elders, suicide in Korean Americans (32.9 for men and 15.4 for women) is the highest of all examined racial/ethnic groups in the USA.
   Conclusions. Suicide in Korean Americans is higher than for other Asian Americans and follows temporal patterns more similar to Korea than the USA. Interventions to prevent suicide in Korean American populations, particularly among the elderly, are needed.

AB A close examination of the information promotion strategies of advanced countries, including South Korea, indicates the value of data, its analysis and usage. Big data analytics, in particular, attracts great attention as a method to fulfill personal and social demands by discerning a pattern for common behaviors and predicting the future. Along with drastic socioeconomic changes in South Korea, the suicide rate has increased dramatically and become the leading cause of death for those in their teens and twenties. This study investigates the features and contents of youth suicide by comparing social network data (69,886 cases in total) and suicide counseling cases from CYS-Net (1,463,737 cases in total). The results show that the youth in South Korea use the internet most at the beginning of the week, around the summer vacation, and from after school until night time. The main reasons for youth suicide are solitude and loneliness, worries about academic achievement or school admission, and school violence. More females disclose their problems to others than their male counterparts. 16 to 18 year -olds look for help the most from counselors for their problems. When it comes to location, youths in big cities, such as Gyeonggi-do, Seoul, Incheon, Daejeon, and Busan city, post more about suicide online. As these results show, youth suicide is a serious matter; thus, it is urgent to establish a youth suicide prevention system. This should be organized by population, age, and location, as well as related policy based on findings from this big data analysis.

AB Exposure to suicide in social relationships may be associated with suicidal ideation among survivors. In South Korea, which is known for having the highest suicide rate among OECD countries, exposure to suicide in social relationships can have serious consequences as social relationships are greatly emphasized in the society. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between survivors' suicidal ideation and their exposure to suicide in close relationships. Data collected through a telephone survey of a total of 1,000 men and women selected from across the nation using a stratified sampling method were analyzed. The results show that individuals who lost a family member, friend, or acquaintance in their lifetime are 4.5 times, 3.7 times, 2.2 times, respectively, more likely to have suicidal ideation in the past year compared to those without such experience. These findings suggest that special intervention for suicide survivors should be considered for those who experience suicide in close relationships.

AB Media reports of a celebrity's suicide may be followed by copycat suicides, and the impact may vary in different age and sex subgroups. We proposed a quantitative framework to assess the vulnerability of age and sex subgroups to copycat suicide and used this method to investigate copycat suicides in relation to the suicides of 10 celebrities in South Korea from 1993 to 2013. By applying a detrending model to control for annual and seasonal fluctuations, we estimated the expected number of suicides within a copycat suicide period. The copycat effect was assessed in two ways: the magnitude of copycat suicide by dividing the observed by the expected number of suicides, and the mortality rate by subtracting the expected from the observed number of suicides. Females aged 20-29 years were the most vulnerable subgroup according to both the magnitude of the copycat effect (2.31-fold increase over baseline) and the mortality rate from copycat suicide (22.7-increase). Males aged 50-59 years were the second most vulnerable subgroup according to the copycat suicide mortality rate (20.5- increase). We hope that the proposed quantitative framework will be used to identify vulnerable subgroups to copycat effect, thereby helping devise strategies for prevention.

AB The suicide rate in Korea has been declining steadily after peaking in 2011. However, to date, time-series analyses of Korean suicide rate data have mainly addressed factors related to increases in suicide rates. This study analyzed one of the most important evidence-based public health strategies to decrease suicide, that is, preventive effects of restricting access to lethal means via a charcoal-selling procedure improvement campaign, using multivariate time series analysis. The results showed the campaign in Gyeonggi Province had a significant effect on decreasing the number of charcoal-burning suicides in this area. It is believed that the present study has important implications in terms of providing the first empirical evidence for the charcoal-selling procedure improvement campaign in Korea. Further repeated research is needed to evaluate the impact of the intervention when the more enough observational data become available.

AB It is considered that people from poor countries get depressed which ultimately leads to suicide. It is estimated that one million people commit suicide every year worldwide. It is considered from statistics that global annual suicide fatalities could rise to 1.5 million by 2020. Economically and culturally the most influential countries of East Asia are China, Japan and South Korea. To find the underlying causes for such a high suicide rate was the basic purpose of this article. We selected 100 suicide research articles as well as World Health Organisation's statistics related to suicide in East Asian countries. Stress and insecurity, whether related to employment or in relationship, are the basic causes which ultimately take an individual to the verge of suicide. Some people also find suicide a mean to get rid of life due to some lethal diseases. Aged persons consider themselves out of life so they adopt suicide. The government has already taken serious steps to minimise the death rate caused by suicide. Stress in education institutions has to be negotiated by taking some steps in education policy. Consistent efforts should be made to cope with this problem.

AB The connection between divorce and suicide risk in Asia is unclear. To understand the contribution of cultural transitions to suicide among the divorced, we compare age- and sex-specific suicide rates among divorced men and women from five Pacific Rim populations: Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and the state of Victoria in Australia. On a cultural spectrum, we consider Hong Kong and Taiwan to lie between the more individualistic Australian culture and the more collectivistic Japanese and Korean cultures. Coefficients of aggravation (COA) are also compared.
   Suicide rates were found to be higher among the divorced than among other marital status groups in all five populations, but this difference was small in Victoria. The effect of divorce was significantly greater for men than for women only in Japan and South Korea. In the other populations, divorced men and women were at equal risk. Age trends in suicide rates for the divorced groups differed across populations. The COAs for the divorced group aged 40 or younger in the East Asian populations were higher than the COAs for older divorced groups, though this was not the case in the Victorian population.
   Suicide patterns among the divorced in the East Asian populations can be understood in terms of the legacy of Confucian traditions. Gender differences in Japan and South Korea may reflect either gender inequality (male dominance in formal interactions and emotional dependence in domestic life within a deteriorating Confucian family support system) or unique socio-cultural factors among married women. Divorced East Asian groups aged 40 or younger may be at a higher risk of suicide due to individual-level cultural ambivalence combined with a desire for systemic-level emotional interdependence. Social welfare regimes in the four East Asian populations need to fill the vacancy left by retreating traditional family systems. Research implications are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB South Korea's elderly suicide rate is not merely the highest among the member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, it is the highest in the world. This study analyzed the effect of ego-resilience and social support on depression and suicidal ideation of the elderly, providing baseline data to aid in the development of preventive programs on elder suicide. We found that ego-resilience is a strong inhibitor of suicidal ideation. Direct and indirect effects of social support on suicidal ideation were especially helpful for elders with mild depression.

AB As a result of unprecedented increase in suicides over the last decade, Korea now ranks at the top of OECD countries in suicide statistics (26.1 deaths per 100,000 population in 2005). Our study sought to document socioeconomic inequalities in self-destructive behaviors including suicidal ideation, parasuicide, and completed suicide. For prevalence of suicidal ideation and parasuicide, we used four waves of data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1995, 1998, 2001, and 2005). For suicide mortality, we abstracted suicide cases from the National Death Registration records, and linked them with population denominators from the national census in 1995, 2000, and 2005. We examined variation in self-destructive behaviors according to level of educational attainment (at the individual level), as well as area-level characteristics including level of deprivation and degree of urbanicity. Age-standardized rates were calculated through direct standardization using the 2005 census population as the standard. Inequalities were measured by the relative index of inequality and the slope index of inequality. The age-standardized prevalence of suicidal ideation decreased across consecutive surveys in both genders (18.0-13.5% for men, 27.5-22.9% for women). Parasuicides similarly decreased over time. By contrast, completed suicides increased over time (20.9-42.8 per 100,000 for men and 8.9-20.9 for women). The most prominent increases in completed suicides were observed among the elderly in both genders. Lower education, rural residence, and area deprivation was each associated with higher suicide rates. Both absolute as well as relative inequalities in suicide by socioeconomic position widened over time. Our findings suggest that the current suicide epidemic in Korea has social origins. In addition to clinical approaches targeted to the prevention of suicides in high risk individuals, social policies are needed to protect disadvantaged populations at risk of self-destructive behaviors.

AB Although the effects of age, period, and cohort (APC) on suicide are important, previous work in this area may have been invalid because of an identification problem. We analyzed these effects under three different scenarios to identify vulnerable groups and thus overcame the identification problem. We extracted the annual numbers of suicides from the National Death Register of Korea (1992-2015) and estimated the APC effects. The annual average suicide rates in 1992-2015 were 31.5 and 14.7 per 100,000 males and females, respectively. The APC effects on suicide were similar in both sexes. The age effect was clearly higher in older subjects, in contrast to the minimal changes apparent during earlier adulthood. The birth cohort effect showed an inverted U shape; a higher cohort effect was evident in females born in the early 1980s when period drift was larger than 3.7%/year. Period effect increased sharply during the early 1990s and 2000s. We found that elderly and young females may be at a particularly high risk of suicide in Korea.

AB Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents in the United States. Imitation plays an important role in adolescent suicides. Identification theory suggests that media coverage of adolescent suicides can increase imitation suicides among adolescents. The present study examines this possibility using data collected from South Korea. It also explores the relationship between media coverage of celebrity suicides and suicide rates among adolescents. We found that adolescent suicides increase after media coverage of either an adolescent's suicide or a domestic celebrity's suicide.

AB Background: The suicide rate has been increasing in Korea, and the country now has the highest rank in the world. This study aimed to present the long-term trends in Korea's suicide rate using Joinpoint analysis and age-period-cohort (APC) modeling.
   Methods: The population and the number of suicides for each five-year age group were obtained from the National Statistical Office for the period 1984-2013 for Koreans aged 10 years and older. We determined the changes in the trends in age-standardized mortality rates using Joinpoint. APC modeling was performed to describe the trends in the suicide rate using the intrinsic estimator method.
   Results: The age-standardized suicide rate in men rapidly increased from 1989 to 2004, and slightly increased thereafter, whereas the suicide rate in women increased from 1989 to 2009 and then decreased thereafter. Within the same period, the suicide rate was higher among the older age groups than in the younger groups. Within the same birth cohort, the suicide rate of the older groups was also higher than that in the younger groups. Within the same age group, the suicide rate of the younger cohorts was higher than it was in the older cohorts. In the APC modeling, old age, recent period, and having been born before 1924 were associated with higher suicide rates.
   Limitations: The accuracy and completeness of the suicide rate data may lead to bias.
   Conclusions: This study showed an increasing trend in the suicide rates for men and women after 1989. These trends may be mainly attributed to cohort effects. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective To examine gender differences in the characteristics of suicidal behavior in South Korea.
   Methods Between August 2003 and December 2006, 344 suicide attempters (116 men, 228 women) participated in this Study. The attempters were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I), and the lethality of the attempt was measured using the Lethality Suicide Attempt Rating Scale-II (LSARS-II) and Risk-Rescue Rating Scale (RRRS).
   Results Significantly more women than men were admitted to emergency rooms due to attempted Suicide during the study period. The male attempters were older and had a higher rate of employment than the females. Depression was the most common psychiatric disorder in both genders. The lesion/toxicity scores of the RRRS indicated that the male Suicide attempters used higher doses or more toxic agents than the female attempters. The most common methods of suicide were ingestion and cutting in both sexes. Although there were significant gender differences in the RRRS risk score and RRRS total scores, there was no gender difference in the LSARS-II scores, which suggests that patients of both sexes share a similar ambivalence regarding suicide completion or death.
   Conclusion Our study should be understood within the context of the specific cultural background of South Korea. We found that males and females use similar methods when I attempting Suicide and share a similar ambivalence regarding the Outcome of the attempt: however, there was a difference in severity of the attempt between the two groups. Our findings may aid in the identification of more effective methods of intervention to prevent suicide.

AB We examined the factors that affect suicide attempts adolescents multicultural families in South Korea. The participants were 727 adolescents whose mothers and/or fathers were born outside of South Korea (376 males and 351 females). Among them, 41 (weighted prevalence 6.2%) had attempted suicide during the last 12 months. Female gender, residence in large cities (compared with in rural areas), living with relatives/alone/with friends/in a dormitory or living in a facility (compared with living with family), high and low socio-economic status (compared with a middle level), high and low academic performance (compared with a middle level), severe perceived stress (compared with non-severe stress), conflicts with a teacher (compared with conflicts with parent), and foreign-father/-parent families (compared with foreign-mother family) were associated with increased odds of suicide attempt. The results indicate that greater awareness of the possibility of suicidal behavior is prudent for adolescents in multicultural families with certain risk factors, such as being from a foreign-parents family, living separately from the family, and having conflicts with a teacher.

AB This is the first national survey study in South Korea investigating the relationship between suicide lethality and the clinical information of suicide attempters. An interview questionnaire was used to assess their sociodemographic factors, medical and psychiatric information, and two suicide scales, the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale and the Suicide Intent Scale. Suicide methods were categorized as low and high lethality; low lethality covered drug overdose or self-cutting behavior, and high lethality covered all other methods. High and low lethality suicide method groups were significantly different in demographic, medical, and psychiatric factors. The two scale score distributions differed significantly across two groups, and the difference was also valid for the subcategory analyses of the Suicide Intent Scale. Multiple factors such as older age, male sex, no previous psychiatric history, and previous suicide attempt, as well as high suicide intent by means of suicide scale, affect selection of suicide method of high lethality.

SO EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRIC SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE Celebrity suicide; copycat suicide; media effect; epidemiology
ID CELEBRITY SUICIDE; RATES; RISK
AB Background. There is ample evidence media reporting of celebrity suicides increases copycat suicides. This study had three aims: (a) to quantitatively examine copycat suicides with exponential modelling that predicts the copycat suicide effect of South Korean celebrity suicides; (b) to investigate the association between media effect and subsequent suicides following celebrity deaths; and (c) to investigate the extent in which media influences the increase and rate of decline of copycat suicides following a celebrity suicide.
   Methods. All suicides during 1991-2010 in South Korea were included in this study utilising a nationwide database. Fifteen celebrities were selected based on the frequency of media reports following 1 week after their suicide. The media effect was obtained through the Korean Integrated Newspaper Database System. Exponential curve fits and correlation analyses investigated the quantitative effect of copycat suicides.
   Results. After controlling for baseline number of average suicides, there was a marked increase in the number of suicides following each celebrity suicides, which followed an exponential model. There was a significant correlation between the total number of copycat suicides and number of media following the celebrity suicide (r = 0.74, p < 0.01). There were weak-to-moderate correlations between the amplitude of increase in suicides (r = 0.45, p = 0.09) and rate of decline (r = 0.38, p = 0.16) with the total number of media coverage.
   Conclusions. Copycat suicides following celebrity suicides follow exponential modelling. Additionally, there is a strong media effect between the number of media reports following the days after celebrity suicides and subsequent copycat suicides. This may also be associated with the amplitude and rate of decline of copycat suicides. This suggests that improving media reporting and implementing preventative interventions for vulnerable populations may be important.

AB Objectives: This study analyzed the spatiotemporal pattern and spatial diffusion of elderly suicide by age cohort, in Korea. Study design: The research investigated the elderly suicide rates of the 232 municipal units in South Korea between 2001 and 2011.
   Methods: The Gi* score, which is a spatially weighted indicator of area attributes, was used to identify hot spots and the spatiotemporal pattern of elderly suicide in the nation during the last 10 years. The spatial Markov matrix and spatial dynamic panel data model were employed to identify and estimate the diffusion effect.
   Results: The suicide rate among elderly individuals 75 years and older was substantially higher than the rate for those between 65 and 74 years of age; however, the spatial patterns of the suicide clusters were similar between the two groups. From 2001 to 2011, the spatial distribution of elderly suicide hot spots differed each year. For both age cohorts, elderly suicide hot spots developed around the north area of South Korea in 2001 and moved to the mid-east area and the mid-western coastal area over 10 years. The spatial Markov matrix indicates that the change in the suicide rate of one area was affected by the suicide rates of neighbouring areas from the previous year, which suggests that suicide increase in one area inflates a neighbouring area's suicide rate over time. Using a spatial dynamic panel data model, elderly suicide diffusion effects were found to be statistically significant for both age cohorts even after economic and demographic indicators and a time variable are included. For individuals 75 years and older, the diffusion effect appeared to be larger.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that elderly suicide can spread spatially over time in both age cohorts. Thus, it is necessary to design a place-based and age-differentiated intervention policy that precisely considers the spatial diffusion of elderly suicide.

AB Background: South Korean society faces a serious challenge in the increasing rates of youth suicidal behavior. There is a need both to gain a better understanding of the causes of this behavior and to develop strategies for responding to this critical public health issue. Aims: This article analyzes how psychological, sociopsychological, and subcultural factors influence suicidal proneness among Korean youth as well as makes suggestions for developing social policies that could reduce Korean youth suicidal behaviors. Method: Correlation and multivariate regression analyses on suicide proneness and depression were employed using a sample of 172 South Korean youths (aged 18-24) selected from the 2009 General Social Survey collected through face-to-face interviews. Results: Young people's suicidal proneness is associated with depression, a tolerant attitude toward suicide, strained family relations, living in rural areas, being female, and being closely related to survivors of suicide or potential suicides. Conclusion: The findings from this study reveal the significance of social and cultural factors as influences on recent youth suicidal behavior in Korea. The analysis suggests that the underlying risk factors of suicidal behavior are embedded in the changing social and cultural context of Korean society. Thus, suicide prevention efforts should involve more than merely treating any underlying psychiatric disorders.

AB In 1997-1998 a widespread economic crisis hit the economies of many East/Southeast Asian countries; its impact on suicide rates across the region has not been systematically documented. We investigated the impact of the Asian economic crisis (1997-1998) on suicide in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand. Suicide and population data for the period 1985-2006 were extracted from the World Health Organisation's mortality database and Taiwanese mortality statistics. Sex-specific age-standardised suicide rates for people aged 15 years or above were analysed using joinpoint regression. Trends in divorce, marriage, unemployment, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and alcohol consumption were compared with trends in suicide rates graphically and using time-series analysis. Suicide mortality decreased in the late 1980s and early 1990s but subsequently increased markedly in all countries except Singapore, which had steadily declining suicide rates throughout the study period. Compared to 1997, male rates in 1998 rose by 39% in Japan, 44% in Hong Kong and 45% in Korea; rises in female rates were less marked. Male rates also rose in Thailand, but accurate data were incomplete. The economic crisis was associated with 10,400 more suicides in 1998 compared to 1997 in Japan, Hong Kong and Korea. Similar increases in suicide rates were not seen in Taiwan and Singapore, the two countries where the economic crisis had a smaller impact on GDP and unemployment. Time-series analyses indicated that some of the crisis's impact on male suicides was attributable to increases in unemployment. These findings suggest an association of the Asian economic crisis with a sharp increase in suicide mortality in some, but not all, East/Southeast Asian countries, and that these increases were most closely associated with rises in unemployment.

AB Using data from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey, this study seeks to investigate associations of suicide attempts with family, individual, and behavioral factors on the basis of gender. Among male adolescents, those who did not live with their parents, who had poor subjective academic achievement, depression, experiences of smoking and sexual coitus, drug abuse, suicidal ideation and plans were more likely to attempt suicide. Among the female adolescents, those who did not live with their parents, had depression, low self-rated health, experiences of drug abuse and sexual coitus, and expressed unhappiness, suicidal ideation and suicide plans were more likely to attempt suicide. Thus, the development of a suicide prevention program for Korean adolescents requires different approaches for males and females.

ID DEPRESSION
AB Purpose: To investigate online search activity of suicide-related words in South Korean adolescents through data mining of social media Web sites as the suicide rate in South Korea is one of the highest in the world.
   Methods: Out of more than 2.35 billion posts for 2 years from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2012 on 163 social mediaWeb sites in South Korea, 99,693 suicide-related documents were retrieved by Crawler and analyzed using text mining and opinion mining. These data were further combined with monthly employment rate, monthly rental prices index, monthly youth suicide rate, and monthly number of reported bully victims to fit multilevel models as well as structural equation models.
   Results: The link from grade pressure to suicide risk showed the largest standardized path coefficient (beta = .357, p < .001) in structural models and a significant random effect (p < .01) in multilevel models. Depression was a partial mediator between suicide risk and grade pressure, low body image, victims of bullying, and concerns about disease. The largest total effect was observed in the grade pressure to depression to suicide risk. The multilevel models indicate about 27% of the variance in the daily suicide-related word search activity is explained by month-to-month variations. A lower employment rate, a higher rental prices index, and more bullying were associated with an increased suicide-related word search activity.
   Conclusions: Academic pressure appears to be the biggest contributor to Korean adolescents' suicide risk. Real-time suicide-related word search activity monitoring and response system needs to be developed. (C) 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

DT Article

AB A number of ecological studies have found a pattern of increasing suicide rates after suicides of several Asian entertainment celebrities. However, the finding may be subject to positive outcome bias where cases with no perceived impact may be routinely excluded. In this study, we deploy interrupted time-series analysis using ARIMA transfer function models to investigate systematically the impact of thirteen celebrity suicides on subsequent suicide rates in South Korea. We find that three out of eleven cases were found to be followed by a significant increase in suicide rate, while controlling for seasonality, secular trends, and unemployment rates. Such significant increases could last for nine weeks. Non-significance cases may be attributable to the small amount of media coverage, the "displacement'' effect of preceding case, and the negative connotation of celebrity deaths. We therefore conclude that whether or not the impacts were detected may be largely conditioned by various contextual factors. Current evidence based on ecological studies is insufficient to draw a firm conclusion. Further studies using multiple approaches should be developed.

AB Despite the alarming suicide rate among South Korean emerging adults, relatively little is known about their unfettered perspectives on death and suicide. Therefore, an innovative data collection technique was developed to apprehend the meanings that emerging adults attribute to death and suicide in their explorations of the phenomena through a selection of short stories. A convenience sample (N = 114) responded to a survey in which participants transferred their feelings toward death and suicide to characters or events in the short stories. A qualitative content analysis revealed relatively permissive perspectives toward death and suicide. Negative perspectives on death are associated with societal victimization and positive perspectives with naturalistic fatalism. Positive perspectives on suicide are overwhelmingly rooted in existential, individual choices while negative perspectives focus on societal pressures. These perspectives contribute to illuminating tensions between traditionalist collectivism and contemporary individualism in Korean society that could inform suicide prevention initiatives for emerging adults.

AB The suicide rate for ages 15-24 increased recently in South Korea. The purpose of this study was to understand the suicidal ideation using the qualitative content analysis in South Korean college students. The data were collected with non-structured open questions in 134 college students and were analyzed with qualitative content analysis. The collected materials were classified 2 categories, 6 themes, and 21 theme clusters. Two categories are emerged: (1) facilitators of suicidal ideation, and (2) inhibitors of suicidal ideation. This study identified that the facilitators of suicidal ideation are physical, psychological and societal concerns, and suggested that the inhibitors of suicidal ideation are influenced by religious and cultural context. These results presented that Buddhism and Confucianism had influence on reasons to not attempting suicide behavior as the inhibitor of suicidal ideation. In conclusion, cultural context should be considered to develop strategies for the suicide prevention in South Korean college student. (C) 2010 Royal College of Nursing, Australia.

AB Study Objectives: Suicide is a serious public health problem, and suicide rates are particularly high in South Korea. Insomnia has been identified as a risk factor for suicidal ideation; however, little is known about the mechanisms accounting for this relationship in this population. Based on the premise that insomnia can be lonely (e.g., being awake when everyone else is asleep), the purpose of this study was to examine whether greater insomnia severity would be associated with higher levels of thwarted belongingness and suicidal ideation, and whether thwarted belongingness would mediate the relationship between insomnia and suicidal ideation.
   Methods: Predictions were tested in a sample of 552 South Korean young adults who completed self-report measures of insomnia severity, suicidal ideation, and thwarted belongingness.
   Results: Greater insomnia symptom severity was significantly and positively associated with thwarted belongingness and suicidal ideation. Mediation analyses revealed that thwarted belongingness significantly accounted for the relationship between insomnia severity and suicidal ideation.
   Conclusions: These findings highlight the potential importance of monitoring and therapeutically impacting insomnia and thwarted belongingness to help reduce suicide risk.

TI Working (wo)man's suicide: transnational relocations of capital -
   repercussions for labour in South Korea and the Philippines
SO JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL ANTHROPOLOGICAL INSTITUTE
LA English
DT Article
ID ANTHROPOLOGY; RISK
AB In South Korea, 2011 was marked by the rise of a social movement against precarity, the emergence of which was dependent upon effective and affective mobilizing strategies amongst workers. The impetus was provided by a struggle at a shipyard in Pusan, where an activist held a crane occupied for 309 days. The role of affect in constituting neoliberal workplaces has recently received much attention in anthropology. The question of how emotions figure into the mobilizing efforts of labour, rather than those of management, however, has been overlooked. Hope and despair are two emotive themes amongst activists involved in the Hanjin dispute that are closely linked to the practice of suicide amongst unionized workers in the country. Since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, suicide has also become an all-too-ordinary response to pressures imposed upon an increasingly precarious Korean workforce. I look into the affective mobilizing cultures that have allowed the Hope Bus' movement to excel in Korea, and explore the less successful efforts that were made by Korean and Filipino activists to link up their struggles.

AB Objective: The suicide rate in South Korea was the highest among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in 2011. Although the suicide rate in adolescents is lower than that of adults and is reported to be decreasing in young males in some countries, it has consistently increased in recent years in South Korea. We aimed to determine the prevalence, pattern, and predictors of suicidal ideation and attempt in the past 12 months.
   Methods: A total sample of 72,623 adolescents aged 12-18 years who responded to a web-based anonymous self-reported survey between September and October 2010 was used for the analysis.
   Results: The suicidal ideation and suicide attempt rates were 19.1% and 4.9%, respectively. Being female, having a poor perceived socioeconomic status and a poor perceived academic performance, subjective feelings of depression, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, perceived general medical health, and experiences of any involvement with sexual intercourse were the contributing factors that predicted elevated risks for suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. In contrast to previous reports in other countries, the suicide attempt rate in Korean female adolescents peaked at age 13 years, and there were no differences in suicidal ideation in females by age. There were no differences in both suicidal ideation and attempt rates in males by age.
   Conclusion: A multidisciplinary approach that takes into consideration the characteristics of Korean adolescents with suicidal ideation or suicide attempt is warranted for developing prevention and treatment programs.

AB Background: In light of the increased suicide rate in Korea, it has become important for researchers to examine the various factors associated with it. The purpose of this study is to compare and analyze the difference between suicide attempters and completers in terms of the suicide methods used and the lethality of these methods. In addition, we investigated certain demographic factors that are associated with the choice of suicide method by evaluating their lethality.
   Finding: The most frequently used methods of suicide were different in the two groups of attempters and completers. Drug poisoning was the most frequent method in suicide attempters, whereas hanging was the most common method among suicide completers. Drug poisoning, stabbing, and other chemical poisoning were evaluated as relatively non-lethal compared to other suicide methods. While about 70.0% of the suicide attempters used relatively non-lethal methods, almost all suicide completers used lethal methods, based on our classification of the lethality of the method. In terms of gender, males used more lethal methods of suicide.
   Conclusions: Suicide completers' choice of suicide methods are different from those of suicide attempters and tend to be more lethal. Interventions to restrict access to more lethal suicidal methods could be a useful strategy to reduce the suicide rates in South Korea.

AB We examined predictors of suicide attempts in clinically depressed adolescents in Korea and gender differences in suicidal behavior. In total, 106 adolescents diagnosed with depressive disorder were recruited in South Korea. We assessed various variables that might affect suicide attempts, and used a structured interview for the diagnosis of depression and comorbidities and to evaluate suicidality. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects were compared between suicide attempt and non suicide attempt groups and we examined significant predictors of suicide attempts. Gender differences in suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior were also analyzed. Among 106 depressed participants, 50 (47.2%) adolescents were classified in the suicide attempt group. Generally, the suicide attempt and non-suicide attempt group shared similar clinical characteristics. The suicide attempt group had more females, more major depressive disorder diagnoses, more depressive episodes, and higher suicidal ideation than the non-suicide attempt group. Suicidal ideation was the only significant predictor of suicidal attempt, regardless of gender. Higher suicidal ideation frequency scores and more non-suicidal self injurious behaviors were shown in the female suicide attempt group than the male suicide attempt group. It is recommended that suicidal ideation be assessed regularly and managed rigorously to decrease suicide risks in depressive adolescents.

AB PurposeThe high disease burden associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is linked to the elevated suicide risk in this population. Informed by the interpersonal theory of suicide, this study examined how and under which conditions depression is related to suicide risk in people living with HIV/AIDS.MethodsA total of 202 outpatients with HIV/AIDS participated in a cross-sectional and multi-center survey involving four university hospitals in South Korea. This self-reported survey included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, and Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview suicidality module.ResultsParticipants' mean age was 48.6 (SD=13.4) and the majority was male (89.1%). The proportions of those at high, medium, and low suicide risk were 18.5%, 20%, and 15.4%, respectively. Depression was associated with suicide risk directly and indirectly by increasing perceived burdensomeness (PB) and the indirect effect of depression on suicide risk mediated by PB was contingent on the level of thwarted belongingness (TB). PB was associated with suicide risk even after controlling for depression, suggesting its independent effect on suicide risk.ConclusionsPB and TB are potential mechanisms through which depression is associated with suicide risk, supporting the applicability of the interpersonal theory of suicide to understanding a complex interplay of risk factors in people with HIV/AIDS. Moreover, given the independent association of PB with suicide risk, as well as a protective effect of TB in suicide risk, monitoring and management of these factors should be included in the care of people with HIV/AIDS.

AB This study investigated the nature of media coverage of a national entertainer's suicide and its impact on subsequent suicides. After the celebrity suicide, the number of suicide-related articles reported surged around 80 times in the week after the suicide compared with the week prior. Many articles (37.1%) violated several critical items on the World Health Organization suicide reporting guidelines, like containing a detailed suicide method. Most gender and age subgroups were at significantly higher risk of suicide during the 4 weeks after the celebrity suicide. Results imply that massive and noncompliant media coverage of a celebrity suicide can cause a large-scale copycat effect.

AB Suggestive associations of suicide with air pollutant concentrations have been reported. Recognizing regional and temporal variability of pollutant concentrations and of suicide, we undertook a detailed meta-analysis of completed suicides in relation to 5 major pollutants over 6 years in the 16 administrative regions of the Republic of Korea, while also controlling for other established influences on suicide rates. Of the 5 major pollutants examined, ozone concentrations had a powerful association with suicide rate, extending back to 4 weeks. Over the range of 2 standard deviations (SD) around the annual mean ozone concentration, the adjusted suicide rate increased by an estimated 7.8% of the annual mean rate. Particulate matter pollution also had a significant effect, strongest with a 4-week lag, equivalent to 3.6% of the annual mean rate over the same 2 SD range that approximated the half of annual observed range. These results strongly suggest deleterious effects of ozone and particulate matter pollution on the major public health problem of suicide.

TI Impact of Social Service Expenditures on the Suicide Rate: The Cases of

SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SERVICE RESEARCH

DE Suicide rate; Asia countries; social expenditure
AB An empirical study reported that the economic crisis in European countries affected their suicide rates and described that an increase in social services expenditures of US$10 per person in labor market programs impacted the decrease in unemployment suicides by 0.038%. However, there has no study that the economic crisis in Asia countries affected their suicide rates. Since 2008, South Korea has been ranked first for suicide rate in the OECD countries. Many studies have blamed the economic crisis that followed from the US financial crisis in 2007 as the critical cause. However, in the case of Japan, the suicide rate decreased in the same time period (2008-2011) even though they faced the same financial crisis. The purpose of this study was to examine why the different situations in Korea and Japan occurred with the economic crisis through testing whether the government's social service expenditure affects the people's suicide rate in Asia countries. These efforts will contribute to understanding the critical role of social service.

AB Pesticide poisoning has been recognized as an important public health issue around the world. The objectives of this study were to report nationally representative figures on mortality from and the incidence of pesticide poisoning in South Korea and to describe their epidemiologic characteristics. We calculated the age-standardized rates of mortality from and the incidence of pesticide poisoning in South Korea by gender and region from 2006 through 2010 using registered death data obtained from Statistics Korea and national healthcare utilization data obtained from the National Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service of South Korea. During the study period of 2006 through 2010, a total of 16,161 deaths and 45,291 patients related to pesticide poisoning were identified, marking respective mortality and incidence rates of 5.35 and 15.37 per 100,000 population. Intentional self-poisoning was identified as the major cause of death due to pesticides (85.9%) and accounted for 20.8% of all recorded suicides. The rates of mortality due to and incidence of pesticide poisoning were higher in rural than in urban areas, and this rural-urban discrepancy was more pronounced for mortality than for incidence. Both the rate of mortality due to pesticide poisoning and its incidence rate increased with age and were higher among men than women. This study provides the magnitude and epidemiologic characteristics for mortality from and the incidence of pesticide poisoning at the national level, and strongly suggests the need for further efforts to prevent pesticide self-poisonings, especially in rural areas in South Korea.

ID ADOLESCENTS; DEPRESSION; MODEL
AB In South Korea, suicide is the fourth leading cause of death, which is the highest rank among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. Suicidal behaviors have shown a significant association with addiction, including internet abuse and dependence in South Korea. Internet addiction is characterized by excessive or poorly controlled preoccupations, urges, or behaviors regarding computer use and internet access. Therefore, we overviewed the relationship of internet addiction and suicidal behaviors in this article. The relationship between internet addiction and suicide was confirmed. The first is the biological approach related to reward systems, cognitive function, brain neurotransmitters, and gene expression. The second is the psychopathological approach associated with depression, anxiety, impulse control, and substance-related disorders including diseases such comorbidities. Finally, the third is the socio-environmental approach related to the contextual stimuli and social isolation and alienation caused by the lack of support and low self-esteem. In conclusion, internet addiction is significantly associated with suicidal behaviors. Internet addiction is a medical condition which is treatable and preventable, and suicide behaviors caused by internet addiction can be controlled through early diagnosis and treatment. Based on a growing body of research on the cause and effect relationship of internet addiction and suicide, various interventions of protection and prevention have been studied.

AB Using the 2009 Korean General Social Survey (N = 1,422), we examine (1) if religious variables affect suicide acceptability-attitudes and norms regarding the acceptability of suicide; and (2) whether religious variables dampen the otherwise strong effects of stress on suicide acceptability. We find that Protestantism, religious attendance, and religious salience are associated with lower levels of suicide acceptability. Yet, the negative impact of Protestantism is entirely mediated by religious attendance and salience. Moreover, the effects of stress on suicide acceptability are attenuated for those who have higher levels of religious attendance and salience. These results have important implications for understanding suicide acceptability and suicide, especially the Protestant-Catholic differences first recognized by Emile Durkheim.

AB Suicidal trends and related characteristics such as sociodemographic factors, psychological factors, and health behaviors can differ between countries. This study investigated the predictors of suicidal ideation and attempted suicide including health behaviors among American and Korean youth from two national representative data sets. In both countries, depression was the most predominant predictor to suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. Unique predictors of suicidal youth in each country were also found. In America, attempted suicide was predicted by poor body image, whereas in Korea attempted suicide was predicted by medical diagnosis such as asthma, concern about weight, and alcohol consumption. The value of our approach lies in the comparative analysis of analogous and unique characteristics of suicidal youths in these two huge data sets from different countries. These results should be helpful for school and mental health care providers to plan interventions for youth at risk of suicide to prevent suicidal completion in these nations.

AB Background: Subway suicide can significantly impact the general public. Platform Screen Doors (PSDs) are considered to be an effective strategy to prevent suicides at subway stations, but the evidence on their effectiveness is limited.
   Methods: We assessed the effectiveness of installing half- and full-height platform screen doors in reducing subway suicides using Poisson regression analysis. Ten-year monthly panel data for 121 subway stations between 2003 and 2012 in the Seoul metropolitan area were used for the analysis.
   Results: We found that installing PSDs decreases fatal suicide cases by 89% (95% CI: 57-97%). We also found that the installation of full-height PSDs resulted in the elimination of subway suicides by completely blocking access to the track area; however, half-height PSDs, which do not extend to the ceiling of the platform, were not as effective as full-height ones.
   Limitation: Our findings were based on the data from a single subway operator for a limited period of time. Accordingly, we did not consider the possibility that some passengers choose to die at a station run by other operators. Our study did not examine the potential substitution effects of other suicide methods.
   Conclusion: Installing physical barriers at subway stations can be an effective strategy to reduce the number of subway suicides; however, half-height PSDs are not as effective as full-height ones, even when they are as high as the height of an adult. Thus, these barriers should be made high enough so that nobody can climb over them. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our conservative estimates show that for 5 out of 11 celebrity suicides observed, 1 celebrity suicide on average yielded to more than 10 excessive suicides per day over a time frame of at least 2 weeks. The results indicate that a significant number of people are very much mentally unstable to end their life by emotional shocks that should be irrelevant to their economic status.

AB Background: Suicide is a major public health concern. The elderly have the highest rate of suicide and they make more lethal suicide attempts and have fewer psychiatric interventions than young people. Furthermore, they have old-age specific psychosocial difficulties. The present study investigated psychosocial risk factors and characteristics of an index suicide attempt of the elderly suicide attempters.
   Methods: Subjects included 388 patients who were admitted to the emergency room following self-poisoning. Two age groups were defined: younger patients (aged less than 65 years) and older patients (aged over 65 years). Data including demographic factors, suicidal risk factors and information about the current suicide attempt were obtained from a retrospective chart review.
   Results: The number of suicide attempters over the age of 65 years old was 57, and their mean age was 73.5 +/- 7.5 years. The elderly patients had more underlying medical illnesses than the under-65 group (p<0.001). Depression was the most common psychiatric diagnosis. Psychotropics were the most commonly ingested drugs in both groups, but the use of pesticides was more notable in the elderly. The elderly suicide attempters had higher risk-rating scores (p<0.001) and lower rescue-rating scores (p=0.014) than the under-65 group. Male-to-female ratio of the elderly group was nearly 1: 1 unlike the under-65 group (p=0.004).
   Conclusion: Elderly suicide attempters had different psychosocial stressors such as physical illness and more lethal suicide attempts. Our study suggests the need for development of specific preventive strategies and management guidelines for the elderly suicide attempters.

ID RISK; IDEATION; PREDICTION; DISORDER; BEHAVIOR; YOUTH
AB Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents and a major public health concern. Here we developed a risk stratification model for adolescent suicide attempts using sociodemographic characteristics, risk behaviours and psychological variables. Participants were 247,222 subjects in the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBS). We developed a suicide index based on the suicide risk estimated in the generalized linear model and proposed the risk stratification model using the R language to measure the probability of suicide attempt among adolescents. Among the study population, the annual rate of suicide attempt was approximately 4%. The model provided good prediction for suicide attempt (AUC = 0.85). The important univariate risk factors for the outcome were dimensional measures of age, sex, breakfast consumption, experience of violence, sleep duration, perceived stress, feeling of sadness, current cigarette smoking, current alcohol drinking, perceived general health, perceived academic record, household economic status and living with biological or adoptive parents. Our suicide index model allowed the identification of adolescents who are at a high risk for suicide. This tool may promote the prevention of adolescent suicide and can be particularly useful in everyday settings where it is difficult to contact mental health professionals immediately.

AB Objective This study aims to provide the information of the stigmas of mental illness such as psychosis, alcoholism, attempt suicide, and depression among North Korean defectors.
   Methods We examined stigma for the mental illnesses of 639 North Korean defectors aged 19 to 65 years who live in the Settlement, Support Center for North Korean Refugees. The stigmas of mental illnesses were assessed using the Perceived Devaluation-Discrimination Scale We directly compared the stigma level between North Korean defectors and the general population of South Korea.
   Results North Korean defectors had higher perceived stigmas of psychosis and alcoholism and lower perceived stigmas of depression than South Koreans. Perceived stigma associated with attempted suicide was similar for North Korean defectors and South Koreans. Only marital status in sociodemographic variables had associations with higher perceived stigma of psychosis, alcoholism, and depression in the North Korean defectors. North Korean defectors, who spent more than one year in transit country, had associations with lower perceived stigma of psychosis and alcoholism. North Korean defectors, who had the experience of compulsory repatriation to North Korea or North Korean family in South Korea, had an association with higher perceived stigma of depression.
   Conclusion North Korean defectors had higher perceived stigmas of psychosis and alcoholism and lower perceived stigmas of depression than South Koreans. Further studies are needed to document serial changes in stigmas for mental illnesses associated with the receipt of education at the Settlement Support Center for North Korean defectors.

AB Gay men and lesbians in South Korea are alienated and stigmatized due to the country's low tolerance of social differences, resulting in distress and suicidal impulses. This study investigated the predictors of suicidal ideation in a gay and lesbian group in South Korea based on the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide. Differences between the gay and lesbian group and the heterosexual group were found in the direct path between perceived burdensomeness and suicidal ideation. The relationship was significant for both groups, but the path coefficient was greater for lesbians and gay men than for heterosexuals. These findings imply that perceived burdensomeness may be a more critical factor in suicidal ideation of lesbians and gay men.

ID POPULATION; DEPRESSION; PREVALENCE; RISK; DISORDERS
AB Background: Suicide rates in Korea have increased dramatically. Stroke is considered one of the most debilitating neurological disorders, resulting in physical impairment, disability, and death.
   Aim: The present study attempted to examine factors related to suicidal ideation in community-dwelling stroke patients.
   Methods: The Korea Welfare Panel Study was used to investigate the relationship between demographic and psychological variables and suicidal ideation among these individuals. Depression was assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale 11 (CES-D-11). Self-esteem was assessed using Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale.
   Results: The prevalence of suicidal thought among stroke patients was estimated at 13.99%. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that both older age and depression were significant independent risk factors for suicidal ideation.
   Conclusion: High-priority health care plans can prevent suicide in stroke patients suffering from depression. Assessing risk for suicide and monitoring the high-risk group is integral to health care. Stroke patients with depression, particularly older patients, would be prime targets for suicide intervention programs.

AB PURPOSE: To examine the changes in all cause mortality and cause-specific mortality after the economic crisis in South Korea.
   METHODS: Monthly mortality data for an entire country was used and intervention analysis applied to compare mortality after the crisis with mortality which would have occurred if the trends before the crisis had continued.
   RESULTS: All cause mortality began to increase about 1 year after the crisis, while cardiovascular increased immediately. Transport accidents decreased significantly during the year following the crisis and then regressed towards the pre-economic crisis level. Suicides increased rapidly and maintained an upward trend but subsequently reduced towards the pre-economic crisis level.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown an evidence of a relationship between economic crisis and mortality. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide (i.e., IPTS) proposes that suicidal desire occurs when an individual simultaneously experiences thwarted belongingness (TB) and perceived burdensomeness (PB) (i.e., interpersonal needs). However, interpersonal needs have been inconsistent in predicting suicide ideation in Koreans. Therefore, we examined depressogenic personality dimensions-sociotropy and autonomy as individual differences that may alter the effects of TB and PB on suicide ideation. We hypothesized that sociotropy will amplify the influence of TB on suicide ideation and that autonomy will regulate the degree to which PB leads to suicide ideation. This study was conducted with undergraduate students from a university located in Seoul, Korea. 313 students of whom 113 were males (36.1%) and 200 were females (63.9%) were included in the final analyses. Among the 313 participants, 42 (20.3%) endorsed suicide ideation. Significant correlations were identified between sociotropy and depression, and autonomy and depression. PB and sociotropy were valid predictors of suicide ideation even after controlling for depression. In addition, significant interactions were found between sociotropy and TB, and autonomy and PB.

AB Background: In South Korea, it has not been easy to negotiate studies that target drug users who are being punished by law, and accordingly, no study on suicidal ideation among substance users has been accomplished yet. In this study, the factors that affect substance users' suicidal ideation were confirmed.
   Methods: It was based on the data collected from 'The 2009 Study on Substance-Dependent Individuals in Korea', which was conducted by The Catholic University of Korea in 2010 as a project sponsored by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Korea. This study targeted 523 former hospital inpatients, prison inmates, and persons under protective supervision who had used substances such as psychotropic drugs, marijuana, and narcotic agents, and were in the recovery stage at various treatment/rehabilitation centers. Student's t and chi-square tests were used, and multivariate analysis was performed to examine the strength of the relationships between suicide ideation and various factors.
   Results: According to this study, 41% of these substance users planned suicide with suicidal ideation. Suicidal ideation was confirmed as associated with an unsatisfactory domestic environment, insufficient and unsatisfactory spare time experiences with others, emotional abuse, severe depression, and trouble with controlling violent behavior. Of the substance users who had planned to commit suicide, 56% attempted suicide. Their suicide attempts were shown to have been associated with insufficient protective supervision and the experiences of physical abuse, trouble with controlling violent behavior, and doctors' prescriptions due to psychological or emotional problems.
   Conclusion: Based on this analysis of the factors that affect suicidal behavior, preventive measures and strategies for substance user were suggested in this study.

AB The Asian economic crises of 1997 and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) had far-reaching impacts on Asian and other global economies. Turmoil in the banking and finance sectors led to downturns in stock markets, resulting in bankruptcies, house repossessions and high unemployment. These crises have been shown to be correlated with a deterioration in mental health and an increase in suicides, and it is important to understand the implication of these impacts and how such recessions affect the health of affected populations. With the benefit of hindsight, did lessons learned from the negative effects of the 1997 Asian economic recession impact the aftermath of the 2008 GFC in Asian countries? Utilising a framework based on a simple strata-bootstrap algorithm using daily data - where available - we investigate the trend in suicide rates over time in three different populations (Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea), and examine whether there were any changes in the pattern of suicide rates in each country subsequent to both the 1997 Asian and 2008. We find that each country responded differently to each of the crises and the suicide rates for certain age-gender specific groups in each country were more affected.

AB Recent research indicates a heightened risk of suicide in this population, a concern given that suicide may be more accepted for those with physical disabilities than for those without such disabilities. The relationship between physical disability and suicide has begun to be examined within empirically supported frameworks of suicide and indicates that interpersonal factors (e.g. perceived burdensomeness) and pain are mechanisms contributing to this heightened risk of suicide. The suicide rate after acquiring a physical disability, such as a spinal cord injury, and the greater odds of suicide after reporting having a disability further support the association between physical disability and suicide. The multifaceted nature of physical disability is reflected in its relationship with suicidal ideation and behaviors.

AB Introduction: Over the past 20 years the WHO has considerably improved world mortality data. There are still shortcomings but more countries now report data and world-wide estimates are regularly made. Methods: Data about mortality have been retrieved from the WHO world database. Worldwide injury mortality estimates for 2008 as well as trends of the suicide rate from 1950 to 2009 were analysed. Results: Suicides in the world amount to 782 thousand in 2008 according to the WHO estimate, which is 1.4% of total mortality and 15% of injury mortality. The suicide rate for the world as a whole is estimated at 11.6 per 100,000 inhabitants. The male-female rate ratio of suicide is estimated to be highest in the European Region (4.0) and the lowest in the Eastern Mediterranean region (1.1). Among males the highest suicide rate in the 15-29 age group is in the SE Asian region, in the 45-59 age group in European males and for ages above 60 in the Western Pacific region. Females from SE Asia have a remarkably high suicide rate among 15-29-year-olds and from age 45 in the Western Pacific region. The leading country is currently Lithuania, with a suicide rate of 34.1 per 100,000 inhabitants. Also among males the suicide rate is the highest in Lithuania at 61.2. Among females South Korea with 22.1 is at the top of world suicide rates. Conclusions: During the past six decades, according to the WHO Japan, Hungary, and Lithuania have topped the list of world countries by suicide rate, but if the current trends continue South Korea will overtake all others in a few years. The heart of the problem of suicide mortality has shifted from Western Europe to Eastern Europe and now seems to be shifting to Asia. China and India are the biggest contributors to the absolute number of suicides in the world.

This study used data from 5000 adolescents aged 14-18 years. Strain due to individual stress was found to have a direct effect on suicide, but strain due to social stress did not have a direct effect on suicide. The interactive effect of strain and social capital significantly predicted depressive symptoms and suicide. In the relationship between strain and suicide, the interactive effect of strain and social capital was mediated by depressive symptoms.

AB Objective: To compare suicide rates and characteristics in East Asian and Western countries.
   Method: Data from five East Asian jurisdictions and five English-speaking Western countries were obtained from national offices responsible for collection of statistics. Data were graphed to demonstrate differences between East Asian and Western age patterns of suicide. Relevant literature was reviewed, including observations concerning suicide rates in various non-English-speaking European countries.
   Results: Age patterns and rates of suicide differ between East and West and across time, but with Japan's and the United States patterns progressively becoming more similar.
   Conclusions: Sociocultural factors affect suicide patterns and rates; choice of method and cohort effects affect rates. Strategies for prevention of suicide should give attention to culture-related precipitants of suicide.

AB Background: Suicide is a serious public health concern worldwide, and the fourth leading cause of death in Korea. Few studies have focused on risk factors for suicide attempt among people with suicidal ideation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the risk factors and develop prediction models for suicide attempt among people with suicidal ideation in the Korean population.
   Method: This study included 1567 men and 3726 women aged 20 years and older who had suicidal ideation from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2007 to 2012. Among them, 106 men and 188 women attempted suicide. Multivariate logistic regression analysis with backward stepwise elimination was performed to find risk factors for suicide attempt. Sub-group analysis, dividing participants into under 50 and at least 50 years old was also performed.
   Results: Among people with suicidal ideation, age, education, cancer, and depressive disorder were selected as risk factors for suicide attempt in men. Age, education, national basic livelihood security, daily activity limitation, depressive disorder, stress, smoking, and regular exercise were selected in women. Area under curves of our prediction models in men and women were 0.728 and 0.716, respectively.
   Conclusions: It is important to pay attention to populations with suicidal ideation and the risk factors mentioned above. Prediction models using the determined risk factors could be useful to detect high-risk groups early for suicide attempt among people with suicidal ideation. It is necessary to develop specific action plans for these high-risk groups to prevent suicide.

AB Objectives We aimed to identify the impact of poverty on suicide risk in older adults. Method The data used in this study was obtained from the National Health Insurance Service-Senior claims database from 2002 to 2013. A total of 558 147 individuals were followed for up to 12 years. Poverty was assessed from insurance premium levels, and causes of death were analysed by linking individuals' deaths to the data for causes of death from the National Statistics Office in South Korea. Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyse the associations between poverty and suicide deaths after adjustments for possible confounders. Results Among 558 147 older adults (aged 60-119 years), the poverty group had an increased risk of suicide compared with the high-income group (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-1.47), and poverty-group males had a significantly higher risk of suicide than males in the high-income group (AHR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.33-1.68). Adults aged 60 to 74 years in the poverty group had a higher risk of suicide than those with a high income in the same age group (AHR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.27-1.57). However, no statistically significant income gradient was found for females or adults aged 75 years or older. Conclusions Our findings revealed that poverty is a risk factor for death by suicide in older adults. Suicide prevention strategies for older adults should be specifically tailored by income level.

AB Objectives: To investigate the trends and correlations of gross domestic product (GDP) adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita on suicide rates in 10 WHO regions during the past 30 years.
   Design: Analyses of databases of PPP-adjusted GDP per capita and suicide rates. Countries were grouped according to the Global Burden of Disease regional classification system.
   Data sources: World Bank's official website and WHO's mortality database.
   Statistical analyses: After graphically displaying PPP-adjusted GDP per capita and suicide rates, mixed effect models were used for representing and analysing clustered data.
   Results: Three different groups of countries, based on the correlation between the PPP-adjusted GDP per capita and suicide rates, are reported: (1) positive correlation: developing (lower middle and upper middle income) Latin-American and Caribbean countries, developing countries in the South East Asian Region including India, some countries in the Western Pacific Region (such as China and South Korea) and high-income Asian countries, including Japan; (2) negative correlation: high-income and developing European countries, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and (3) no correlation was found in an African country.
   Conclusions: PPP-adjusted GDP per capita may offer a simple measure for designing the type of preventive interventions aimed at lowering suicide rates that can be used across countries. Public health interventions might be more suitable for developing countries. In high-income countries, however, preventive measures based on the medical model might prove more useful.

AB Aims and objectives To investigate the effects of a suicide prevention programme on the levels of depression, self-esteem, suicidal ideation and spirituality in patients with mental illness. Background Instances of suicide have significant correlations with depression, low self-esteem, suicidal ideation and a low level of spirituality in the victims. Therefore, addressing depression, low self-esteem and suicidal ideation as suicide risk factors and increasing levels of spirituality can constitute an effective programme to prevent suicide among patients with mental illness. Design The study was a quasi-experimental study with a nonequivalent control group, nonsynchronised design. Participants The study sample consisted of 45 patients with mental illness who had been admitted to the psychiatric unit in a university hospital in South Korea. The patients were assigned to control and experimental groups of 23 and 22 members, respectively. Methods The suicide prevention programme was conducted with the experimental group over fourweeks and included eight sessions (two per week). The control group received only routine treatments in the hospital. Results The experimental group that participated in the programme had significantly decreased mean scores for depression and suicidal ideation compared with the control group. However, there were no significant differences in the mean scores for self-esteem and spirituality between the groups. Conclusion The suicide prevention programme might be usefully applied as a nursing intervention for patients hospitalised in psychiatric wards or clinics where the goals are to decrease depression and suicidal ideation. Relevance to clinical practice Typical treatments for hospitalised patients with mental illness are not enough to prevent suicide. Intervention for suicide prevention needs to apply an integrated approach. The suicide prevention programme using an integrated approach is more effective in reducing depression and suicidal ideation in patients with mental illness than applying routine treatments in the hospital.

AB BackgroundWe investigated the characteristics of adolescents who committed suicide in South Korea, and how these characteristics differed by gender.MethodData from middle and high school students who committed suicide between 2014 and 2016 were analyzed. We evaluated differences in suicide method and place, personal characteristics, and school life characteristics by gender using the Chi square test and t test.ResultsJumping from a high place was the most common suicide method for both male and female students. A significantly greater proportion of female adolescents had experienced depressive symptoms, previous self-injury, previous suicide attempts, and had problems with school attendance and peers. Additionally, they were more likely to be classified as high risk according to a school-based mental health screening test and to utilize professional mental health treatment services.ConclusionOur results demonstrate that adolescents who committed suicide exhibited gender differences in personal characteristics and school life. These characteristics might aid in the development of adolescent suicide policies and intervention programs.

AB Objectives: Pesticide poisoning stands as a major public health issue worldwide. The objective of this study was to examine the epidemiologic characteristics of pesticide-related hospitalizations in South Korea. Methods: Data from the Korea National Hospital Discharge Survey were analyzed to describe the epidemiologic characteristics of pesticide poisoning among hospitalized patients from 2004 through 2006. Pesticide-related hospitalizations were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes. National estimates of pesticide-related hospitalizations were calculated using sampling weights for number of hospitalizations. Results: A total of 25,982 pesticide-related hospitalizations were estimated during the years 20042006, yielding an average annual pesticide-related hospitalization rate of 17.8 per 100,000 population in South Korea. Age-specific rates for pesticide-related hospitalization increased with age, with the highest rate noted among those aged 70 or above. The majority of pesticide-related hospitalization was cases of intentional poisoning in rural areas. Seasonal variation in the rate was observed, with summer being the highest among both men and women. Conclusions: Pesticide-related hospitalization is prevalent and demonstrates demographic and seasonal and regional variations. More effective strategies to reduce pesticide-related hospitalizations are required in South Korea.

AB The study aims to examine the negative effects of sexual violence on North Korean (NK) female refugees in South Korea. Although the prevalence of sexual violence victimization is extremely high and mental health problems are serious among these refugees, little to no research has been done on the relationship between sexual violence and mental health among these women. The mental health conditions of two groups of women (sexual violence victims and those who have not experienced sexual violence) were compared using ANCOVA analyses. The results show that suicidal ideation and alcohol use are significantly more prevalent in the sexual violence group than in the non-sexual violence group. The women who had experienced sexual violence in particular should be provided with more professional and sustained treatment and management services. The government must improve the effectiveness of existing policies related to suicide and the drinking culture in South Korea.

AB Objective We aimed to examine the rates, correlates, methods, and precipitating factors of suicide attempts among adolescent patients admitted for psychiatric inpatient care from 1999 to 2010 in a university hospital in Korea.
   Methods The subjects consisted of 728 patients who were admitted for psychiatric inpatient care in a university hospital over a 12-year period and who were aged 10-19 years at the time of admission. We retrospectively investigated the information on suicidal behaviors and other clinical information by reviewing the subjects' electronic medical records. Whether these patients had completed their suicide on 31 December 2010 was determined by a link to the database of the National Statistical Office.
   Results Among 728 subjects, 21.7% had suicidal ideation at admission, and 10.7% admitted for suicidal attempts. Female gender, divorced/widowed parents, and the presence of mood disorders were associated with a significantly increased likelihood of suicide attempts. Most common method of suicide attempts was cutting, and most common reason for suicide attempts was relationship problems within the primary support group. A diagnosis of schizophrenia was associated with increased risk of death by suicide after discharge.
   Conclusion These results highlight the role of specific psychosocial factor (e.g., relational problems) and psychiatric disorders (e.g., mood disorders) in the suicide attempts of Korean adolescents, and the need for effective prevention strategies for adolescents at risk for suicide.

AB Recent research indicates that suicide rates are elevated in those living at higher altitudes in both the United States and South Korea. A possible mechanism that was proposed is metabolic stress associated with hypoxia. This commentary discusses these results, and also the association between elevated suicide rates and other conditions associated with hypoxia (smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma). Tryptophan hydroxylase may not normally be saturated with oxygen, so mild hypoxia would decrease serotonin synthesis. Low brain serotonin is known to be associated with suicide. Thus, the commentary proposes and discusses the hypothesis that decreased brain serotonin synthesis associated with hypoxia is a mechanism that may contribute to suicide in conditions causing hypoxia. Finally the commentary proposes various studies that could test aspects of this hypothesis.

AB Objective This study had two main goals: to examine the structure of co-occurring peer bullying experiences among adolescents in South Korea from the perspective of victims and to determine the effects of bullying on suicidal behavior, including suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, among adolescents.
   Method This study used data gathered from 4,410 treatment-seeking adolescents at their initial visits to 31 local mental health centers in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. The structure of peer bullying was examined using latent class analysis (LCA) to classify participants' relevant experiences. Then, a binomial logistic regression adjusted by propensity scores was conducted to identify relationships between experiences of being bullied and suicidal behaviors.
   Results The LCA of experiences with bullying revealed two distinct classes of bullying: physical and non-physical. Adolescents who experienced physical bullying were 3.05 times more likely to attempt suicide than those who were not bullied. Victims of (non-physical) cyber bullying were 2.94 times more likely to attempt suicide than were those who were not bullied.
   Conclusions Both physical and non-physical bullying were associated with suicide attempts, with similar effect sizes. Schools and mental health professionals should be more attentive than they currently are to non-physical bullying.

ID LONG WORKING HOURS; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; COMPENSATION; EMPLOYEES
AB Objectives: Recently, overwork-related disorders have become a major public health concern in Korea. This study investigated the current trends of working hours, causes of death in the working population, and compensation rates.
   Methods: We reviewed the current trends of working hours, cause of death statistics in the working population, industrial accident compensation insurance (IACI) statistics, issues of compensation and prevention of work-related cerebro-cardio vascular diseases (CCVDs), mental disorders, and suicide.
   Results: Although weekly working hours and the proportion of long working days have decreased, workers in small companies with fewer than five employees and those in the service sector continue to work long hours. The age standardized mortality due to CCVD and suicide was highest among those with managerial roles. In total, 589 CCVD cases and 104 mental disorder or suicide cases were compensated as occupational diseases in 2017. Between 2016 and 2017, 61% of 59 compensated suicides were related to overwork, specifically: long working hours, increased responsibility, or increased workload. The Korean government has introduced various policies to reduce working hours and to increase compensation approval rate for overwork-related CCVDs. Stakeholders have called for the introduction of independent laws to prevent overwork-related disorders, change organizational culture, and address the blind spots of the IACI Act and Labor Standard Act.
   Conclusions: Prevention and compensation policies have improved working conditions in Korea, but there remains much to be done. This review significantly contributes to the understanding of the overall policies and research to prevent overwork-related disorders in Korea.

AB School bullying is a serious social problem that results in potentially severe and long lasting consequences for youth, parents, teachers, and school officials. Commensurate with the serious nature and outcomes of bullying, there has been a number of bullying prevention and intervention programs and measures in schools. The current review provides a synthesis and evaluation of the existing research on bullying prevention and intervention strategies in South Korean schools, set within Bronfenbrenner's social-ecological contexts, including the micro- (i.e., family, peer, school), meso- (i.e., family-school), and macro- (i.e., religion, policies) systems. We also discuss the strengths and limitations of the research reviewed and provide directions for future research focusing on major empirical gaps in the literature on bullying prevention and intervention strategies in South Korea.

AB Background: The occupation of farming has been reported to be associated with a high suicide rate, and suicidal ideation is an important risk factor for suicide. The objective of this study was to explore the association between occupational pesticide exposure or poisoning history and suicidal ideation among male farmers in South Korea.
   Methods: Through a nationwide sampling survey, a total of 1958 male farmers were interviewed in 2011 in South Korea. Detailed occupational pesticide exposure and pesticide poisoning information were obtained from face-to-face interviews. Suicidal ideation was defined as whether they had thought of harming themselves or trying to take their own lives over the preceding year. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the effect of pesticide poisoning on suicidal ideation.
   Results: Among all farmers, 4.7% (n=92) reported suicidal ideation in 2010. After controlling for potential confounders, lifetime hospitalization due to pesticide poisoning showed a 2.48-fold increase in risk (95% CI: 126, 4.91). Those with multiple poisonings showed more significant associations with suicidal ideation (OR=2.33 for once, OR=3.02 for more than once). Moderate- or severe-symptom severity of acute pesticide poisoning cases (OR=2.23; 95% CI: 1.21-4.11) also showed increased risks of suicidal ideation than the milder classes did. However, no significant association was identified with cumulative lifetime pesticide application and suicidal ideation.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that risk of suicidal ideation is related to occupational pesticide poisoning among male farmers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide and suicide attempts are dramatic events for both the individuals concerned and for their social environments. Efforts have been made to identify reliable biological predictors of suicide and suicide attempts. In the present study, we focused on one potential marker, cholecystokinin (CCK), among first time suicide at tempters. A total of 25 suicide attempters (mean age: 30 years; 80% females) and 23 healthy controls were enrolled in the present cross-sectional study. Experts rated participants' symptoms of depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; HDRS). Blood levels of CCK levels were assessed. Suicide attempters had CCK levels 22.67 times higher and HDRS scores 14.33 higher than healthy controls. CCK levels were only weakly associated with HDRS scores. CCK appears to be a fairly reliable biomarker for suicide attempts. However, CCK levels were not associated with depression scores, making it difficult to match biological markers to depressive behaviour.

AB Objective Precarious employment is associated with worse mental health, but it is unclear whether changes in employment status are related to suicidal behaviors. This study examined the association between change in employment status and suicidal ideation among workers in South Korea.
   Methods To maximize power of the analysis, we combined data from the ongoing Korean Welfare Panel Study. We analyzed 3793 participants who were permanent workers at baseline (2011-2014) and who either: (i) maintained permanent employment; (ii) became a full-time precarious worker; (iii) became a part-time precarious worker; or (iv) became unemployed in the following year (2012-2015). Suicidal ideation was assessed annually by asking participants, "Have you ever seriously thought about dying by suicide in the past year?" Logistic regression was applied to examine associations between change in employment status and suicidal ideation, adjusting for potential confounders such as lifetime suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms at baseline.
   Results Participants who became part-time precarious workers were more likely to have suicidal ideation [odd ratio (OR) 2.37, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.07-5.25, P=0.033] compared to those who remained permanent workers. In analysis restricted to workers who never previously thought about dying by suicide, suicidal ideation was more common among those who became either full-time (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.09-4.99, P=0.029) or part-time (OR 3.94, 95% CI 1.46-10.64, P=0.007) precarious workers.
   Conclusions Our findings suggest that change in employment status from permanent to precarious employment may increase suicidal ideation among workers in South Korea.

AB Pesticide poisoning is a major cause of death in the world. The objective of this study was to examine the trends of pesticide poisoning deaths and their epidemiologic characteristics in South Korea.
   We evaluated the age-standardized mortality rates from pesticide-related deaths (intentional self-poisoning, accidental poisoning, assault, undetermined intent poisoning) in South Korea from 1996 through 2005, using registered death data obtained from the Korea National Statistical Office. The regional rurality index was calculated and correlation analyses were used to estimate the association with pesticide poisoning mortality.
   The number of pesticide poisoning deaths from 1996 through 2005 was 25,360, which accounted for 58.3% of the total poisoning fatalities. The age-standardized mortality rates by pesticide poisoning significantly increased from 4.42 to 6.42 per 100,000 population, whereas the total death rate was decreased in the same period. Intentional self-poisoning was the majority cause of death from pesticides (84.8% of total pesticide poisoning deaths). The majority of the pesticide poisoning deaths were men, over 50 years old, with education less than middle school, and residing in rural areas. The rate of pesticide poisoning deaths was the highest in the farming period and was significantly correlated with the rurality index of each region.
   Pesticide poisoning deaths substantially increased during the 10-year study period, and showed demographic, seasonal and regional variations. More intensive intervention efforts to reduce pesticide mortality should become a public health priority in South Korea.

ID UNITED-STATES; HEROIN USERS; RISK; ASSOCIATION; PATTERNS
AB Drug abuse has been widely linked to suicide risk. We examined the factors that affect adolescent drug users' suicide attempts in South Korea. This study analyzed the data of 311 adolescents who had used drugs such as inhalants, psychotropic drugs, and marijuana (195 males and 116 females). Among 311 subjects, 109 (35.0%) had attempted suicide during the last 12 months. After adjusting for other variables, depressive mood (OR=19.79) and poly-drug use (OR=2.79), and low/middle levels of academic achievement compared with a high level (OR=3.72 and 4.38) were independently associated with increased odds of a suicide attempt, while better perceived health (OR=0.32) was independently associated with reduced odds of a suicide attempt. For adolescent drug users, preventive work should be directed toward the active treatment of drug use, depression, and physical health and reinforcing proper coping strategies for academic and other stress.

AB South Korea has the highest suicide rate among countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), with a rising trend that contrasts with the trend in most other OECD countries. This study assessed differential associations of socio-demographic factors with suicidal ideation in South Korea. We used five waves of data from the 2010 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Study subjects included 5803 men and women aged >25 years. We analysed weighted percentages with consideration of the complex survey sample design and unequal weights. Surveylogistic regressions were applied. Protective effects against suicidal ideation were found for higher household income, higher educational attainment, and being married. Functional limitations and depressive symptoms were risk factors for suicidal ideation. However, these significant factors may exert different effects on vulnerability for suicidal ideation among different genders and age groups. Thus, household income was mainly protective for women and subjects aged 25-44 years, and educational attainment was protective for individuals aged > 65 years. Our findings suggest the need for extended social protection policies for the less privileged population and special strategies for different groups. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

DE Suicidal ideation; work conditions; insecure employment; shift work;
   middle-aged adults

   TIME; RISK
AB Background: Korea has the highest rate of suicide in the world and has held this rank for the last decade. Suicide has risen especially sharply among 45- to 54-year-old Koreans; there were about 32.1 suicides per 100,000 individuals in 2015, and this contributed significantly to the rising suicide rate in Korea. Recently, adverse work conditions, including insecure employment and shift work, have been suggested as a suicide risk factor. However, little is known about the influence of insecure employment on suicidal ideation among middle-aged adults. Furthermore, prior research has examined the association between shift work and suicidal ideation only among individuals engaged in specific jobs, such as police work or firefighting, and those investigations have not focused on middle-aged adults. Aim: This study investigated the influence of employment status and shift work on suicidal ideation among middle-aged adults. Methods: The sample comprised waged, middle-aged adult employees (n = 2,364) aged 45-64 years who had participated in the cross-sectional Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2015. Using multivariate logistic regression analyses, this study evaluated the associations of employment status and shift work with suicidal ideation among middle-aged adults. Results: The major finding was that insecure employment status was independently associated with suicidal ideation in middle-aged adults (odds ratio (OR) = 2.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [1.27, 4.94]) and that shift work was significantly associated with suicidal ideation among middle-aged adults (OR = 2.30, 95% CI = [1.14, 4.66]). Conclusions: The findings of this study highlight the need for multidimensional interventions regarding suicide, especially for middle-aged adults engaged in insecure jobs and shift work. Multidimensional interventions, including early screening for suicidal thoughts during routine medical check-ups, readily available work-based counselling programmes and regular monitoring, are likely to be useful.

AB Many studies have investigated risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicide attempt; however, most have failed to show differences in risk factors between suicidal ideation and suicide attempt among the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected population. This study was designed to identify differences in risk factors between suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among HIV-infected adults in Seoul. A face-to-face survey of 457 HIV-infected adults was conducted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government in 2013. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Among 422 participants, 44% had suicidal ideation, and 11% had suicide attempts. The independent risk factors for suicidal ideation were young and middle age, living with someone, history of AIDS-defining opportunistic disease, history of treatment for depression, lower social support, and psychological status. Beneficiaries of National Medical Aid, economic barriers to treatment, history of treatment for depression, and lower psychological status were independently associated with suicide attempts. Patients with HIV in Korea were treated without cost in some centers. Thus, experiencing an economic barrier to treatment might be due in part to ignorance of HIV care policies. Our findings indicate that suicide attempts are associated with socioeconomic factors and information inequality regarding medical care. In conclusion, suicidal ideation closely associated with the psychosocial factors, whereas suicide attempt demonstrates a stronger association with socioeconomic factors. Suicide prevention measures should be implemented to provide information to help HIV-infected patients.

AB Suicide is second to only accidental death as the leading cause of mortality in young men across the world. Although suicide rates for young men have fallen in some high-income and middle-income countries since the 1990s, wider mortality measures indicate that rates remain high in specific regions, ethnic groups, and socioeconomic groups within those nations where rates have fallen, and that young men account for a substantial proportion of the economic cost of suicide. High-lethality methods of suicide are preferred by young men: hanging and firearms in high-income countries, pesticide poisoning in the Indian subcontinent, and charcoal-burning in east Asia. Risk factors for young men include psychiatric illness, substance misuse, lower socioeconomic status, rural residence, and single marital status. Population-level factors include unemployment, social deprivation, and media reporting of suicide. Few interventions to reduce suicides in young men have been assessed. Efforts to change help-seeking behaviour and to restrict access to frequently used methods hold the most promise.

AB We examined whether annual changes in the prevalence of suicide risk factors are related to annual changes in suicide rates among male and female adolescents in South Korea. Data from the Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (2005-2015) were used to obtain the annual prevalence of psychological and health-related risk factors among Korean adolescents. Mortality data from the Korean National Statistical Office (NSO) were used to obtain annual suicide rates among Korean adolescents aged 15-19 years. For male adolescents, there were significant positive correlations between suicide rate and the rate of depressive mood, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, drinking, and smoking and negative correlations between suicide rate and the rate of self perceived healthiness, obesity, and being physically active. For female adolescents, suicide rates were positively correlated with rate of being sexually active and negatively correlated with rate of obesity. Overall, our study showed that annual rates of suicide are associated with annual prevalence of suicide risk factors in Korean adolescents, particularly in male adolescents.

AB In many Western countries, the criminalization and stigmatization of suicide has given way to a biomedical approach aimed at destigmatizing suicide and treating underlying mental illness. By contrast, in many East Asian countries, suicide has never historically been criminalized or stigmatized. High rates of suicide in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have recently led policy makers in those countries to pursue innovative suicide-prevention strategies. The intentional denormalization of harmful behaviors has been discussed in the public health and ethics literatures, particularly with regard to smoking cessation, and could represent a novel mechanism for preventing suicides in East Asia. Using examples from the sociocultural, historical, and legal discourses surrounding suicide in Western and East Asian contexts, we suggest that denormalization can be a justified, culturally relevant suicide-prevention strategy, but that care must be taken to avoid shaming or stigmatizing suicidal individuals. Specifically, we propose the term weak denormalization to refer to an ethically permissible strategy at the mildest end of a spectrum of denormalizing approaches-milder than the reintegrative shaming described in the criminal justice literature, and diametrically opposed to outright stigmatization, which is generally considered ethically impermissible. Given the severe stigma of mental illness in East Asia, adopting the dominant Western view of suicide as solely a psychiatric concern would not be justified. Weak denormalization strategies in East Asia should be culturally tailored and rigorously tested on a small scale. They should include social supports, praise for the bravery of those of who seek help, and strategies to reduce shame regarding perceived social failure.

AB This study calculated the sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevalence rates among female sex workers (FSWs) in South Korea and elucidated the social and behavioral risk factors that affect FSW's infection with STIs. FSWs were recruited using a multistage cluster probability sampling method (N = 1,073). STI prevalence rates were 9.8 % for Treponema pallidum, 2.6 % for gonorrhea, and 12.5 % for Chlamydia. The risk probability of STI infection was higher for participants with fewer social relationships (OR = 0.99), more suicide attempt experiences (OR = 1.36), lower frequency of condom use (OR = 0.81), lower self-efficacy (OR = 0.78), and more irregular STI examination experiences (OR = 0.69). The STI prevalence rates of FSWs in South Korea were lower than those of FSWs in other Southeast Asian nations. While the direct factors for STI prevalence among this population were related to safe sex, indirect factors such as social support were also significant. Because this affects the self-efficacy of isolated individuals among sex workers, preventive interventions in STIs among FSWs must be expanded to the promotion of social support and mental health programs.

AB Objectives: As South Korea has the highest incidence of completed suicides, the present study aimed to investigate the predictive power of the variables that have been associated with suicide attempts in Korean patients diagnosed with depression.Methods: Hundred participants were divided into two groups: suicide attempters (31%) and suicide non-attempters (69%). Participants with a history of more than one suicidal attempt were assigned to the suicide attempter group. A hierarchical logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the predictive strengths of the variables that were likely to be associated with suicide attempts.Results: After controlling for the effects of such variables as the severity of depressive symptoms, life stress events and impulsivity, the severity of past suicidal ideation was the most important predictive factor for discriminating suicide attempters from suicide non-attempters. The odds ratio for attempting suicide relative to not attempting suicide increased by a factor of 4.408 for each unit of increase in suicidal ideation.Conclusions: The present study suggests that the most severe suicidal ideation throughout one's entire life should not be overlooked and may be a major predictor of the risk of suicide.

AB Objective: To understand the life experiences of elderly people who are living in long-term care hospitals and are afflicted with suicide ideation.
   Methods: A phenomenological qualitative methodology based on Colaizzi's method was used for the study. Participants included 9 elderly people who are 65 years old or older with suicidal ideas and were admitted in any of the 3 long-term care hospitals in D City, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea. Data were collected from July to December 2014.
   Results: Seven categories, 15 theme categories, 30 themes, and 88 significant items were identified as parts of their life experiences. The 7 categories were identified as "being a slave to one's disease", "sadness as a result of being far away from one's family", "vain care and consolation for me", "continued life in a hospital, which feels like living abroad", "plunging life", "moving toward the end of life", and "sad relief from death".
   Conclusion: The findings from this study provide a deep understanding of the lives of elderly people who were staying in long-term care hospitals, and these will help improve their quality of life. Additionally, they can be used as references in implementing high-quality nursing practices for such elderly people.

AB Background: A suicidal person can go through different stages that include suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts. For a few individuals, these can end up with suicide. However, there have been no studies investigating any differences in attitudes toward suicides among individuals with no suicidal thoughts, those with suicidal thoughts, and those with suicide attempts. Aims: This study was carried out to compare attitudes toward suicide among three different groups: individuals with a history of no suicidal thoughts, those with a history of suicidal thoughts, and those with a history of suicide attempts. Method: To examine Koreans' attitudes toward suicide, we analyzed the data from the 2013 National Suicide Survey involving 1,500 participants aged between 19 and 75 years. Results: Different attitudes toward suicide were found among the three groups. Persons reporting that they had made a suicide attempt in their life showed the most permissive attitudes toward suicide. Limitations: Since this research is based on cross-sectional data, it is difficult to eliminate the possibility of changes in attitude toward suicide completely after having a suicidal thought and suicide attempt. Conclusion: These results can be a useful source for constructing effective messages for suicide prevention campaigns and can ultimately contribute to an improvement in the public's perceptions of suicide in the future.

AB While a growing body of evidence suggest that social capital including interpersonal trust and reciprocity might be associated with mental health outcomes, few studies have explored the relationship with suicidal behaviors. This research examined the prospective association between interpersonal trust and reciprocity and suicidal behaviors using the Korea Welfare Panel Study, a nationally representative longitudinal cohort dataset in South Korea. Interpersonal trust and reciprocity were assessed at the 7th wave of the survey (2012), and each measure was classified into two categories (low vs. high). Experience of suicidal ideation, planning, and attempt was assessed between the 8th (2013) and 10th wave (2015) of the surveys. After adjusting for confounders including lifetime experience of suicidal behaviors at the 7th wave of the survey (2012) as well as socio-demographic information, the low interpersonal trust group was more likely to experience suicidal ideation (OR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.11-1.53) compared to the high interpersonal trust group whereas no statistically significant association was observed in the reciprocity analysis.

AB Objective The present study aimed to validate a Korean version of the self-report Depressive Symptom Inventory-Suicidality Subscale (DSI-SS).
   Methods 553 South Korean undergraduate students (aged 18-34 years, 74.8% females) completed questionnaires. Participants completed Korean versions of the self-report Depressive Symptom Inventory-Suicidality Subscale (DSI-SS), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS), and a measure of suicide-related symptom history
   Results Results indicated that the DSI-SS demonstrated excellent internal consistency (alpha=0.93) and strong convergent validity with the BDI (r=0.57, p<0.01), ISI (r=0.27, p<0.01), and BSS (r=0.70, p<0.01). DSI-SS scores also significantly differentiated between those reporting a history of suicide attempts compared to non-suicide attempters [t (38.80)=-3.28, p<0.05].
   Conclusion Given the brevity of this measure, and evidence for its validity, the Korean version of the DSI-SS may be particularly promising for clinical and empirical use as a screening tool among South Korean undergraduates.

AB Suicide attempts at the Han river are rapidly increasing, which are 4.11 times from 2005 to 2015, whereas the rate of completed suicide in South Korea increased 1.07 times during the same period. However, few studies have been conducted on the issue because many suicide attempters were seriously injured after a fall in the Han river. We present a case of a patient with major depressive disorder (MDD) who attempted suicide and minimally injured after jumping from the bridge at the Han river. We could assess his psychological and neurocognitive functions before and immediately after his attempt. From this case, we can identify that higher cognitive aspect of executive dysfunction, especially in the frontal domain of selective attention and inhibition, may be associated with his suicide attempt. In conclusion, we suggest psychiatric treatments for cognitive impulsiveness and safety barriers at the bridge to prevent suicide attempts of patients with MDD.

AB Background: The aims of this study were to describe temporal patterns of injury-related mortality by sex, age group, and mechanism, and to identify changes in the leading causes of injury-related deaths in South Korea from 1996 through 2006.
   Methods: This retrospective, descriptive study analyzed national data on all injury-related deaths reported in official death certificates from 1996-2006. Incidence rates of fatal injuries are presented as crude and age-standardized rates per 100 000 population, and percentage changes in injury-related mortalities over the 11-year period were calculated with respect to intention, sex, and age. The 4 most common mechanisms (fall, poisoning, suffocation, and drowning) were then classified as unintentional injuries or suicides.
   Results: Overall injury-related mortality decreased 31.7% during the study period (1996-2006). Despite this overall decreasing trend, injury-related mortality increased among adults aged 65 years or older. In particular, injury-related mortality among women older than 80 years doubled since 1996. Suicide replaced transport as the leading cause of injury-related deaths between 2003 and 2006. With regard to intention, sex, and age, the most noticeable changes during the study period were increases in unintentional fall among elderly adults and suicidal fall among adolescents.
   Conclusions: The incidence rate for all injuries generally decreased from 1996-2006. However, the incidence rate of fall injuries increased among elderly adults, and suicide increased among adolescents. These findings suggest that further investigation of the characteristics and trends of injuries is necessary to develop and implement effective interventions.

ID SOUTH-KOREA; ASIA; SINGAPORE; GENDER; EAST
AB Suicide data relating to 1979-2014 were obtained from three East Asian jurisdictions (Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan) and two 'Western' countries (Australia, New Zealand). Rates and age patterns of suicide have changed markedly since 1979. Graphs of these patterns largely remained either upward-sloping, bimodal or flat (uniform) over the 36 years, male commonly differing from female, and East Asian patterns more like each other than those of the Western countries. Japan's male middle-aged suicide rate reached a peak in 1999-2003, which, like increased rates among working age males in Hong Kong and Taiwan, has been attributed largely to consequences of Asian financial crises. Male to female ratios of suicide rates have remained higher in the Western countries, but late life suicide rates have decreased to varying extents in all five jurisdictions. Identifying reasons for differences between jurisdictions in their suicide rates and patterns at particular times, and over time, is likely to point to factors (period, cohort, psychosocial or cultural) that protect against or foster suicidal ideation. This avenue of research may assist in identifying ways of preventing suicide.

DE Suicide; Age; Seasonal patterns; Durkheim; Urbanization; South Korea
ID UNITED-STATES; CYCLES
AB The monthly pattern of suicides has remained a puzzle ever since it was discovered in the second half of the 19th century. In this paper we intend to "explain" not the pattern itself but rather its changes across countries and in the course of time.
   First, we show that the fairly common idea according to which this pattern is decaying in "modern" societies is not altogether true. For instance, around 2000, in well urbanized countries like South Korea or Spain this pattern was still as strong as it was in France (and other European countries) in the late 19th century.
   The method that we use in order to make some progress in our understanding is the time-honored Cartesian approach of breaking up the problem under consideration "into as many parts as might be necessary to solve it". More specifically, we try two separations of monthly suicides into simpler components: (i) according to suicide methods and (ii) according to age-groups. These separations rely on the introduction of what we call "elementary monthly profiles".
   The first separation points out the key-role of hanging and drowning. The second shows the crucial role of the 15-20 and 65+ age-groups.
   Then, we present a number of cases in which age-group decomposition provides adequate predictions. It turns out that the cases in which the predictions do not work are newly urbanized countries. The discrepancies may be due to a memory effect which induces a time-lag extending over one or two generations.
   Finally, in the light of the new results presented in the present paper, we re-examine the theory proposed by Emile Durkheim. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Adolescents; Suicide ideation
AB One of the causes for adolescents' mortality in Korea for the last 20 years was suicide. What is the most effective way to prevent adolescent suicide? What are the significant and urgent topics that must be studied to prevent adolescent suicide? By looking closely at adolescents' perceptions and experiences of suicide ideation, I expect that I could find better ways to save the students from committing suicide. I used the revision of the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (Reynolds, 1985). 60 respondents participated in this survey spontaneously. Through this research, the biggest thing I realized was that depression and suicide ideation are strongly related. Students felt suicide ideation for the situation itself (37%), but there were more students who wanted to commit suicide from suffering of depression (56%). 26% of students stated that the duration of feeling depression was long before they felt the urge to commit suicide. Thus, we can prevent adolescent suicide if family members, friends and teachers see their depression earlier. It means that we can help the students from the depression stage before they enter suicide ideation stage. Secondly, the reasons of suicide ideation were 'home problems' (30%), 'peer relationship problems' (26%), and 'academic problems' (22%). It reveals that our suicide ideation comes from social relationship. Third, most students relied on their close friends (50%), not teachers to solve the problems. What they needed was conversation with friends and consolation from friends (48%). Seeing these results, students thought that friends would understand their pain and worries since friends might have similar problems and understand better. Fourth, 63% of the students did not request help. They said that they did not confess since they were worried about peoples' reaction (47%). 24% of students said they were shy or scared to tell anyone. Finally, 59% of respondents said they need special activities or programs to solve suicide ideation problems. I suggest that the following are things that are needed for students feeling suicide ideation: 1) consultation from an expert, 2) a place to comfortably let out their worries, 3) a community where they can share their worries and overcome them together.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore significant variables predicting adolescent suicidal attempts. Socio-environmental variables such as gender, school record, school grade, school adaptation, and family intimacy together with intra-individual variables including depression, anxiety, delinquency, stress, and self-esteem were considered as candidates. Data from 1481 adolescents were collected from Korea National Youth Policy Institute. For statistical analyses, hierarchical logistic regression analysis was performed. Results of hierarchical logistic regression analysis showed that gender, school grade, depression, delinquent, stress, and family intimacy were significant predictors of suicidal attempts of adolescents. Among those, the most powerful predictor was depression, and the second was delinquency. Classification accuracy by the model of our study was 87.6%. Implications and limitations of present study and suggestions for future study were discussed.

AB After the launch of governmental financial support for the development of a regional suicide prevention programme, 'Emergency Fund to Enhance Community-Based Suicide Countermeasure' in 2009, suicide mortality rates in Japan have decreased from 25.7 (in 2009) to 16.5 (in 2018) per 100,000 population. Therefore, to explore the effects of governmental financial support on suicide mortality rates in Japan, the present study determined the relationship between the trends of empirical Bayes standardised Mobile Ratio of suicide mortality ratio in all 47 Japanese prefectures (EBSMR-RR) and the execution amounts of 10 sub-divisions of 'Emergency Fund to Enhance Community-Based Suicide Countermeasure' using stepwise multiple regression analysis. The female EBSMR-RR was only significantly/inversely related to the municipal 'development of listeners and leaders', whereas male EBSMR-RR was significantly/inversely related to prefectural 'enlightenment', and 'intervention models', but significantly/directly related to prefectural 'personal consultation support'. The present findings suggest the inverse relationship between financial support and the suicide mortality rates in Japan. Furthermore, the independent factors in the reduction of suicide mortality rates between males and females provide important information for planning a scientifically evidence-based and more cost-effective regional suicide prevention programmes.

AB Suicide is not only an individual phenomenon, but it is also influenced by social and environmental factors. With the high suicide rate and the abundance of social media data in South Korea, we have studied the potential of this new medium for predicting completed suicide at the population level. We tested two social media variables (suicide-related and dysphoria-related weblog entries) along with classical social, economic and meteorological variables as predictors of suicide over 3 years (2008 through 2010). Both social media variables were powerfully associated with suicide frequency. The suicide variable displayed high variability and was reactive to celebrity suicide events, while the dysphoria variable showed longer secular trends, with lower variability. We interpret these as reflections of social affect and social mood, respectively. In the final multivariate model, the two social media variables, especially the dysphoria variable, displaced two classical economic predictors - consumer price index and unemployment rate. The prediction model developed with the 2-year training data set (2008 through 2009) was validated in the data for 2010 and was robust in a sensitivity analysis controlling for celebrity suicide effects. These results indicate that social media data may be of value in national suicide forecasting and prevention.

AB Background We compared mortality inequalities by occupational class in Japan and South Korea with those in European countries, in order to determine whether patterns are similar. Methods National register-based data from Japan, South Korea and eight European countries (Finland, Denmark, England/Wales, France, Switzerland, Italy (Turin), Estonia, Lithuania) covering the period between 1990 and 2015 were collected and harmonised. We calculated age-standardised all-cause and cause-specific mortality among men aged 35-64 by occupational class and measured the magnitude of inequality with rate differences, rate ratios and the average inter-group difference. Results Clear gradients in mortality were found in all European countries throughout the study period: manual workers had 1.6-2.5 times higher mortality than upper non-manual workers. However, in the most recent time-period, upper non-manual workers had higher mortality than manual workers in Japan and South Korea. This pattern emerged as a result of a rise in mortality among the upper non-manual group in Japan during the late 1990s, and in South Korea during the late 2000s, due to rising mortality from cancer and external causes (including suicide), in addition to strong mortality declines among lower non-manual and manual workers. Conclusion Patterns of mortality by occupational class are remarkably different between European countries and Japan and South Korea. The recently observed patterns in the latter two countries may be related to a larger impact on the higher occupational classes of the economic crisis of the late 1990s and the late 2000s, respectively, and show that a high socioeconomic position does not guarantee better health.

AB This longitudinal study examines to what extent the risk of mortality-all-cause, natural death, suicide, and unintentional injury mortality-differs by types and severity of disabilities as well as disability status.
   Data were the National Sample Cohort of 1,025,340 individuals in South Korea followed from 2002 to 2013. Cox regression with time-variant variables was used to estimate the hazard ratio of mortality by disability.
   Individuals with disabilities had a higher risk of mortality compared to those without (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.80-1.88 for natural death; HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.64-2.03 for suicide; HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.38-1.71 for unintentional injury). All types of disability were associated with an increased risk of natural death. Individuals with mental disability were the highest risk group for suicide (HR 7.14, 95% CI 5.31-9.60). People defined as having severe disability had an elevated risk for all categories of mortality.
   Disabilities are important markers of high risk of mortality. Findings call for actions to reduce mortality risk of people with disabilities, including preventing suicidal behaviors of those with mental disability.

AB This was the first Korean national study to evaluate prevalence and correlates of suicidal behavior, and to compare multiple and single attempts. A total of 6510 adults completed face-to-face interviews (response rate, 81.7%) through randomly chosen one-person-per-households. Lifetime prevalence and correlates were evaluated with the Korean version of Composite International Diagnostic Interview (K-CIDI), and a questionnaire to inquire about suicidal behaviors. The lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt in South Korea was 15.2%, 3.3%, and 3.2% (single 2.1% and multiple 1.1%), respectively. Younger age was associated with attempts and more strongly associated with multiple attempts. Attempts were the most strongly associated with mood disorders, especially bipolar disorder, which was more strongly associated with multiple attempts. In conclusion, suicidal behaviors are highly prevalent in Korea, especially in young adults. Bipolar disorder was the most strongly associated disorder with suicide attempts, more with multiple attempts.

AB Objective Suicide is a significant public health concern worldwide. Social media data have a potential role in identifying high suicide risk individuals and also in predicting suicide rate at the population level. In this study, we report an advanced daily suicide prediction model using social media data combined with economic/meteorological variables along with observed suicide data lagged by 1 week.
   Methods The social media data were drawn from weblog posts. We examined a total of 10,035 social media keywords for suicide prediction. We made predictions of national suicide numbers 7 days in advance daily for 2 years, based on a daily moving 5-year prediction modeling period.
   Results Our model predicted the likely range of daily national suicide numbers with 82.9% accuracy. Among the social media variables, words denoting economic issues and mood status showed high predictive strength. Observed number of suicides one week previously, recent celebrity suicide, and day of week followed by stock index, consumer price index, and sunlight duration 7 days before the target date were notable predictors along with the social media variables.
   Conclusion These results strengthen the case for social media data to supplement classical social/economic/climatic data in forecasting national suicide events.

AB Aims: This study aimed to determine the role of acute alcohol use among suicide decedents based on their blood alcohol concentrations (BAC), and identify sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with the differences in BAC.
   Methods: Data were collected from nationwide autopsies conducted between May 2015 and November 2015 in South Korea. A total of 683 suicide decedents were classified into three groups according to the BAC at the time of autopsy: no alcohol (NA) group (BAC < 0.01%), no intoxication (NI) group (0.01 <= BAC < 0.08%), and intoxication (I) group (BAC >= 0.08%). Sociodemographic data and clinical factors related to suicide among the three groups were analyzed using a multinomial logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Among the suicide decedents (N = 683), the NA group was 55.6% (N = 380), NI group was 15.7% (N = 107), and I group was 28.7% (N = 196). History of suicide attempts (odds ratio [OR]: 1.798, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.073-3.012) and absence of medical illness (OR: 1.633, CI: 1.038-2.571) were higher in the I group compared to the NA group. Psychiatric and medical illness triggers of suicide were significantly lower in the I group than the NA group (OR: 0.325, CI: 0.118-0.892). Being male (OR: 2.494, CI: 1.363-4.565) and financial problems as triggers of suicide (OR: 3.234, CI: 1.636-6.393) were higher in the NI group than in the NA group. Being male and having financial problems were associated with no intoxication (0.01 <= BAC < 0.08%), whereas the history of suicide attempts and absence of medical and/or psychiatric illness were associated with acute alcohol intoxication (BAC >= 0.08%) in the suicide decedents.
   Conclusions: Suicide decedents had different characteristics based on different BACs identified in the autopsy. The differences in acute alcohol intoxication and no intoxication in suicide decedents may have implications for the targeted prevention of suicides related to alcohol.

AB Objectives. We examined the associations of overall and age-specific suicide rates with business cycles from 1928 to 2007 in the United States.
   Methods. We conducted a graphical analysis of changes in suicide rates during business cycles, used nonparametric analyses to test associations between business cycles and suicide rates, and calculated correlations between the national unemployment rate and suicide rates.
   Results. Graphical analyses showed that the overall suicide rate generally rose during recessions and fell during expansions. Age-specific suicide rates responded differently to recessions and expansions. Nonparametric tests indicated that the overall suicide rate and the suicide rates of the groups aged 25 to 34 years, 35 to 44 years, 45 to 54 years, and 55 to 64 years rose during contractions and fell during expansions. Suicide rates of the groups aged 15 to 24 years, 65 to 74 years, and 75 years and older did not exhibit this behavior. Correlation results were concordant with all nonparametric results except for the group aged 65 to 74 years.
   Conclusions. Business cycles may affect suicide rates, although different age groups responded differently. Our findings suggest that public health responses are a necessary component of suicide prevention during recessions. (Am J Public Health. 2011;101:1139-1146. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2010.300010)

AB Suicide is a major public health concern in Japan. This study aimed to characterize the trends in suicide mortality in Japan by method since 1979. Using data from the Japan vital registration system, we calculated age-standardized rates of suicide mortality separately by sex and method. We conducted a log-linear regression of suicide mortality rates separately by sex, and linear regression analysis of the proportion of deaths due to hanging, including a test for change in level and trend in 1998. While crude suicide rates were static over the time period, age-adjusted rates declined. The significant increase in suicide mortality in 1998 was primarily driven by large changes in the rate of hanging, with suicide deaths after 1998 having 36.7% higher odds of being due to hanging for men (95% CI: 16.3-60.8%), and 21.9% higher odds of being due to hanging for women (95% CI: 9.2-35.9%). Hanging has become an increasingly important method for committing suicide over the past 40 years, and although suicide rates have been declining continuously over this time, more effort is needed to prevent hanging and address the potential cultural drivers of suicide if the rate is to continue to decline in the future.

AB With the population of the elderly increasing, suicides among elderly people present a serious problem for global societies. However, there are few studies on suicide among elderly subjects, especially in Asia. The study aimed to determine the relationship between physical health, mental health, social environmental condition, and the suicide behavior among elderly subjects in the city of Suwon, located southeast of Seoul. We analyzed 1548 Korean aged over 60 years from baseline data of a larger prospective study called the Suwon Project. The study protocol included sociodemographic variables, mental health factors, and physical health factors. In the interview, the subjects were asked about suicide ideation and history of suicide attempt. Of the total subjects, 7.42% reported suicide ideation and 1.42% reported a history of suicide attempt. A logistic regression analysis showed that physical illness, five stroke warning signs, anxiety and depression associated with suicide ideation, and depression strongly corresponded to the suicide ideation. Anxiety, depression, and stroke warning signs were associated with history of suicide attempt among the elderly. Additionally, stroke warning signs and depression are independently associated with history of suicide attempt. This study revealed that stroke warning signs have a high correlation with history of suicide attempt in the elderly, independent from the depression factors. This study suggests that there is an independent relationship between physical health status and suicide behavior in the case of elders.

AB To analyze the impact of the Tunisian Revolution on suicide and homicide patterns in Tunisia.
   It is a retrospective, cross-sectional study, including all the cases of homicides and suicides that occurred during an 8-year period (2007-2014) in Northern Tunisia. We compared data before and after the revolution.
   After the revolution, the number of suicides rose 1.7 times, with a prevalence rising from 1.8 to 3.12 suicides per 100,000 persons per year. Homicides rose 1.3 times after the revolution. For both manner of death, victims were mostly males, aged between 20 and 39 years, living in urban areas. Hanging and self-immolation rose, respectively, 1.8 and 3 times after 2011. We observed suicide cases most frequently occurred in public places and in front of public administration after 2011. Homicide victims' profile and circumstances showed a single variation which is an increase in number of cases happening in rural areas.
   Our results proved a short-term impact of the transition period on homicides and suicides. Urgent preventive measures are needed especially to decrease the suicide rates.

TI Zolpidem Use and Suicide Death in South Korea: A Population-Based
   Case-Control Study
SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective To investigate whether zolpidem use is associated with suicide death in adults.
   Method We conducted a case-control study using the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) database. Cases were adults with a suicide record (ICD-10 codes; X-60-X84, Y87.0) between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2013. 10 Controls were matched to each case by age, sex, index year, region, income level, and health insurance type. Zolpidem use during 2 years before suicide was quantified. Adjusted odd ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression.
   Results The percentage of zolpidem users was significantly higher in cases (451 of 1,928 [23.4%]) than in controls (832 of 18,404 [4.5%]). After controlling for potential confounders, zolpidem use was significantly associated with suicide (aORs, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.74-2.52). Dose-response relationships were observed (for trend, p < .0001). Consistent findings were observed when analyses were restricted to suicide death (aORs, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.73-2.51) and nonmedication poisoning suicide death cases (aORs, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.74-2.53).
   Conclusions We found a significant and positive association between zolpidem use and suicide. Zolpidem should be prescribed cautiously and with due caution of increased suicide risk.

AB Objectives: Suicide is a major mental health concern in South Korea, where a rapid increase in suicide rates among older adults is evident. This study aims to understand the association of childhood adversity with suicidal ideation in later life, and whether gender differences in the effects of childhood adversity exist. Method: The sample consisted of older adults aged 60 years and more in six waves of the Korea Welfare Panel Study from 2012 to 2017 (N = 4,105). A mixed effect logistic regression with random intercept was used to test the effects of childhood adversity on the risk of 12-month suicidal ideation. Results: After controlling for socioeconomic status, psychosocial resources, and health conditions, the mixed effect models using longitudinal data indicated that parental death predicted an increased risk of suicidal ideation and that a greater number of childhood adversities predicted a higher likelihood of suicidal ideation. No gender differences were found in the effects of childhood adversity on suicidal thoughts. Conclusion: These findings support a life course perspective, highlighting the importance of assessing early life disadvantages to understand suicidal ideation among older adults. The findings suggest that interventions targeting older adults who experienced parental death in childhood or multiple adversities may be effective in preventing suicidal ideation.

AB Objective A considerable proportion of suicide attempts are the result of sudden desires. Understanding such impulsive suicide attempts is necessary for effective interventions. We evaluated the impulsivity of suicide attempters treated in emergency rooms. The aim of the study was to identify the characteristics of impulsive suicide attempts by comparing these individuals to those who attempted to commit suicide in a non-impulsive manner.
   Methods This study analyzed suicide attempters who visited the emergency departments of seven selected university hospitals. A total of 269 medical records in which impulsivity of suicide attempt were confirmed were subject to be analyzed. The impulsivity of the suicide attempt was examined using a summative score of items 6 and 15 on the Suicide Intent Scale.
   Results A total of 48.0% of the participants were impelled by sudden inclinations to attempt suicide. Impulsive attempters were younger, unmarried and less physical illness than non-impulsive attempters, whereas no significant differences were found on psychiatric history and previous suicide history. Impulsive suicide attempters had suicide ideations that were not as severe (chi(2)=55.33, p<0.001) or intense (t=-8.38, p<0.001) as their counterparts'. Furthermore, medical results of impulsive suicide attempts were better than non-impulsive suicide attempts (t=-3.77, p<0.001).
   Conclusion The results suggested that a considerable proportion of suicide attempts were the result of sudden inclinations. Impulsive attempts were made in relatively earlier stages of suicide ideation; consequently, they have less intent than non-impulsive attempts.

AB Suicide is a major public health issue in Japan, with very high rates of death compared to other countries in the Asia Pacific. Foreigners living in Japan may be at increased risk of suicide, but little is known about how their risk of suicide differs from that of their country of origin or Japanese nationals. We used data on suicide mortality from the Japan Vital Registration System for the period 2012-2016 to analyze risk of suicide mortality in Japan for Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and other nationalities living in Japan, adjusting for age and separately by sex. We estimated standardized mortality rates using both the Japanese population as a reference, and also the population of the home nation of the foreign residents. We found that Korean nationals living in Japan have significantly higher mortality rates than Japanese nationals, and that the suicide mortality rate of Korean nationals living in Japan is higher than in their home country, but that this is not the case for Chinese or other nationals resident in Japan. Koreans living in Japan have a very high risk of mortality due to suicide which may reflect the special social, economic, and cultural pressures they face as a marginalized population in Japan.

AB Background: Globalisation is mediated through a variety of flows including persons, information and ideas, capital, and goods. The process is increasingly recognised as a potential mediator of changes in attitudes and habits around the globe.
   Aim: This research investigated the relationship between globalisation and suicide rates in 35 countries over the period 1980-2006.
   Methods: The association between a globalisation "index" and suicide rates was tested using a fixed-effects regression model. The model also tested the influence of eleven other socio-economic variables on male and female suicide rates.
   Results: Overall, high levels of the globalisation index were associated with higher male and female suicide rates; however, the significance of this association dropped when assessed alongside other social and economic variables.
   Conclusions: While the nature of these findings should be regarded as exploratory, this paper highlights the need for researchers to consider the influence of world-changing phenomena like globalisation on suicide, which might deeply upset the traditional structure of societies with mixed types of impact.

AB Background To assess the influence of visual acuity (VA) on suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and depression.
   Methods From 2008 to 2012, a total of 28 919 nationally representative participants aged 19 years or older in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey underwent additional ophthalmological examinations by the Korean Ophthalmologic Society. Associations between best corrected VA in the better-seeing eye based on decimal fraction and mental health were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis after adjusting for possible biopsychosocial confounders. Self-reported mental health (suicidal ideation, suicide attempt and depression), Euro Quality of Life-Visual Analog Scale and counselling experience were evaluated by direct interviews. A nomogram for risk of suicidal ideation was generated.
   Results By multivariable logistic regression analysis, low VA was significantly associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempt but not depression. Participants with a VA of no light perception to 0.2 had a nearly twofold and threefold increased risk of suicidal ideation (adjusted OR, 1.85; 95% CI 1.04 to 3.27) and suicidal attempt (adjusted OR, 3.44; 95% CI 0.92 to 12.79), compared with participants with a VA of 1.0. Sociodemographic disparities, including age and socioeconomic status, existed for suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt and depression. Euro Quality of Life-Visual Analog Scale significantly decreased as VA decreased and was lower in participants who attempted suicide.
   Conclusions Low VA was associated with the occurrence of suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt. Ophthalmologists should embrace their responsibility to help reduce suicidality and prevent suicides in patients with low VA by encouraging them to seek psychiatric care.

AB Suicide is a serious public health problem worldwide. The suicide rate, i.e. the number of suicides per 100,000 of population, is considered to be an important indicator of national mental health and general well-being of society. The prevalence of suicide is often underestimated due to cultural, political and economic circumstances. The number of suicides in the world was estimated to be 804,000 in 2012, according to the WHO global suicide report. The age-standardized global suicide mortality rate was 11.4 per 100,000, accounting for 1.4% of all deaths. The highest crude suicide rate was in South Korea (36.6). In developed countries, male suicides have traditionally outnumbered female suicides. In 2012, the highest male-to-female suicide rate ratios (over 5.0) were found in Eastern Europe and the lowest in China (under 1.0). The risk to die by suicide increases with age. Notably, however, females in the age group 15-29 years had the highest suicide rate of all age groups in India and Latin America. The WHO estimates that for each adult suicide there may have been more than 20 others attempting suicide. Suicide risk is much higher in individuals who previously made a suicide attempt and research shows that suicide attempt is the single most important predictor of death by suicide. In suicide prevention work, strategies can be directed to the health care services or at the general population. A great need for preventive strategies for young people has been identified by the WHO. Therefore, an evidence school-based preventive method called Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) directed towards the entire classroom was developed in the EU-funded project 'Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe'.

AB This paper engages the literature on the legal geographies of labour and postdemocracy in order to examine the role of law in limiting the labour rights of non-standard workers. To do so, it analyses the effects of civil suits for obstruction of business against workers and trade union activists in South Korea. First embraced by liberal administrations as an alternative to authoritarian forms of labour control, civil suits for obstruction of business have become a common feature of labour struggles since 2002 and have led to millions of dollars in damage claims and provisional seizure of assets being applied against workers for engaging in collective action. We argue that by treating many ordinary trade union practices as threats of force that obstruct business and are thus liable for compensation, the law has been an essential component in the creation of a postdemocratic mode of labour control: one in which many fundamental labour rights are officially recognised, unlike under authoritarian regimes, but undermined in practice by narrowly limiting workers' ability to pursue lawful collective action.

AB Objectives. The objective of this study is to estimate the numbers and rate of emergency department visits in South Korea that are the result of pesticide poisoning and to describe their epidemiologic characteristics. Materials and methods. Data collected from the National Emergency Department Information System were used to estimate the number of emergency department visits due to pesticide poisoning in South Korea for the period spanning 2006 through 2009. Emergency department visits for pesticide poisoning were defined by ICD-10 codes (T60.0-T60.9). National estimates and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated per 100 000 population. Results. Among the 65 877 total poisoning-related emergency department visits in the data, 11 985 (18.2%) were emergency department visits resulting from pesticide poisoning. During the study period, the annual average rate of emergency department visits for pesticide poisoning was 26.8 per 100 000 population. Intentional pesticide poisoning (51.4%) was more frequent than unintentional. The fatality rate from intentional pesticide poisoning was also higher than that from unintentional or cases where the intention was unknown. In terms of age-specifi c rates of emergency department visits for pesticide poisoning, they increased with age, as did the gap between men and women. Conclusions. This study provide estimates for emergency department visits due to pesticide poisoning at the national level and suggests that pesticide poisonings, both intentional and unintentional, require significant public health interventions in South Korea.

AB Objectives. We assessed life expectancy increases in the past several decades in South Korea by age and specific causes of death.
   Methods. We applied Arriaga's decomposition method to life table data (19702005) and mortality statistics (1983-2005) to estimate age- and cause-specific contributions to changes in life expectancy.
   Results. Reductions in infant mortality made the largest age-group contribution to the life expectancy increase. Reductions in cardiovascular diseases (particularly stroke and hypertensive diseases) contributed most to longer life expectancy between 1983 and 2005 (30% in males and 28% in females). Lower rates of stomach cancer, liver disease, tuberculosis, and external-cause mortality accounted for 30% of the male and 20% of the female increase in longevity. However, higher mortality from ischemic heart disease, lung and bronchial cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, diabetes, and suicide offset gains by 10% in both genders.
   Conclusions. Rapid increases in life expectancy in South Korea were mostly achieved by reductions in infant mortality and in diseases related to infections and blood pressure. (Am J Public Health. 2010;100:896-903. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2009.160341)

AB ObjectiveSuicide is a major cause of premature mortality in patients with epilepsy. We aimed to identify the clinical correlates of suicide in these patients.
   MethodsWe conducted a matched, case-control study based on a clinical case registry of epilepsy patients (n = 35,638) treated between January 1994 and December 2011 at an academic tertiary medical center in Seoul, Korea. Each epilepsy patient in the suicide group (n = 74) was matched with three epilepsy patients in the nonsuicide group (n = 222) by age, gender, and approximate time at first treatment. The clinical characteristics of the patients in both groups were then compared.
   ResultsIn a univariate analysis, seizure frequency during the year before suicide, use of antiepileptic drug polytherapy, lack of aura before seizure, diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy, use of levetiracetam, psychiatric comorbidity, and use of antidepressants were all significantly higher in the suicide group than in the nonsuicide group. Multivariate analysis revealed that a high seizure frequency (odds ratio [OR] 3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-10.2), a lack of aura before seizure (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.7-9.3), temporal lobe epilepsy (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.6-8.6), and use of levetiracetam (OR 7.6, 95% CI 1.1-53.7) and antidepressants (OR 7.2, 95% CI 1.5-34.1) were all associated with a higher probability of suicide.
   SignificancePatients with temporal lobe epilepsy who experience seizures weekly or more frequently, experience a lack of aura, use levetiracetam, or take antidepressants are all at a higher risk of suicide and should be monitored closely.

AB Extant analyses of the relation between economic conditions and population health were often based on annualized data and were susceptible to confounding by nonlinear time trends. In the present study, the authors used generalized additive models with nonparametric smoothing splines to examine the association between economic conditions, including levels of economic activity in New York State and the degree of volatility in the New York Stock Exchange, and monthly rates of death by suicide in New York City. The rate of suicide declined linearly from 8.1 per 100,000 people in 1990 to 4.8 per 100,000 people in 1999 and then remained stable from 1999 to 2006. In a generalized additive model in which the authors accounted for long-term and seasonal time trends, there was a negative association between monthly levels of economic activity and rates of suicide; the predicted rate of suicide was 0.12 per 100,000 persons lower when economic activity was at its peak compared with when it was at its nadir. The relation between economic activity and suicide differed by race/ethnicity and sex. Stock market volatility was not associated with suicide rates. Further work is needed to elucidate pathways that link economic conditions and suicide.

AB This commentary discusses what is popularly regarded as the Roh Moo-hyun Phenomenon in today's South Korean society, as an attempt to shed some light on an interview which the late President Roh Moo-hyun had with the author in December 2008. This interview is unique not only because it became Roh's last interview conducted before his suicide on May 23, 2009, but also because it provides Roh's candid critical self-assessment on his own presidency, especially regarding his role in both domestic politics and the inter-Korean relationship, and the Korea-US relationship during his term in office, as well as commenting on Japan's approach to Northeast Asian regional politics. Reflecting on Roh's star-like rise to the presidency and fall from grace, this commentary alerts readers that Roh's last interview needs to be considered within the context of the Roh Moo-Hyun Phenomenon, especially in regard to the 2017 presidential election, because it will directly affect the fate of not just the pro-Roh group, with the largest share of the opposition in today's Korean society, but the Korean people as a whole at a time when the country's many leading civic groups are desperately seeking a Great Transformation.

AB Background: Suicidal ideation is a strong antecedent of suicidal behavior, associated with increased likelihood of suicide. Thus, suicidal ideation serves to identify which groups are at more risk of suicide and has policy implications for targeting groups to prevent suicide. Aims: A substantial body of research has addressed potential determinants of suicide ideation in Korea. Little attention has been paid, however, to analyzing the extent to which socioeconomic attainments (education, household income, and employment status) are associated with risk of suicidal ideation, drawing on nationally representative data. Methods: Data were drawn from the 2012 Korea Welfare Panel Study (KOWEPS). Among the 12,606 respondents, the findings are based on 1,500 young adults (age 18-35) and 3,469 middle-aged adults (age 36-55) who answered a question about suicidal ideation. Results: For young adults, respondents from 2-year and 4-year colleges and higher had lower probabilities of suicidal ideation compared with respondents from high school. People out of the labor force also exhibited an elevated risk of suicidal ideation compared with those in waged employment. Middle-aged adults displayed different patterns. Middle-aged respondents from 4-year colleges or higher had an increased likelihood of suicidal ideation. The likelihood of reporting suicidal ideation was predicted to decrease as household income increased only for middle-aged adults. Conclusions: The information about suicidal ideation was obtained from only one question of self-response, which limits the validity of the suicidal ideation measurement. The cross-sectional setting of the data prevents us from estimating causal relationships. Nevertheless, the findings imply that age-specific policy should be implemented to ameliorate differential risk for suicidal ideation and benefit public mental health in the long run.

DE Mental health services; Mental health R&D
AB World Health Organization has asserted that mental illness is the greatest overriding burden of disease in the majority of developed countries, and that the socioeconomic burden of mental disease will exceed that of cancer and cardiovascular disorders in the future. The life-time prevalence rate for mental disorders in Korea is reported at 27.6 %, which means three out of 10 adults experience mental disorders more than once throughout their lifetime. Korea's suicide rate has remained the highest among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations for 10 consecutive years, with 29.1 people out of every 100,000 having committed suicide. Nevertheless, a comprehensive study on the mental health services and the Research and Development (R&D) status in Korea is hard to find. Against this backdrop, this paper examines the mental health services and the R&D status in Korea, and examines their shortcomings and future direction. The paper discusses the mental health service system, budget and human resources, followed by the mental health R&D system and budget. And, by a comparison with other OECD countries, the areas for improvement are discussed and based on that, a future direction is suggested. This paper proposes three measures to realize mid and long-term mental health promotion services and to realize improvements in mental health R&D at the national level: first, establish a national mental health system; second, forecast demand for mental health; and third, secure and develop mental health professionals.

TI Discussion of Late-Life Suicide: How Social Workers Perceive and

SO EDUCATIONAL GERONTOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH-PROFESSIONALS; PREVENTION
AB As the prevalence of suicide among the elderly has developed in recent years into one of the more serious social problems in South Korea, preventing these elderly suicides has emerged as a national priority. Korean social workers play a major role in the recent elderly suicide prevention efforts that were implemented starting in 2007. The purpose of this qualitative study is to investigate the ways in which social work practitioners perceive, assess, and intervene in suicidal behavior by their elderly clients. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 14 social workers involved with elderly suicide prevention. Both in-depth interviews and field notes were analyzed through qualitative content analysis. Three main themes emerged from the data analysis: (a) an understanding of late-life suicide within an ecological framework with existential thought, (b) the challenges and barriers that hinder the provision of assistance to suicidal older adults, and (c) the assertion that elderly suicide prevention is to promote both well-being and well-dying. The findings revealed ways in which social workers incorporate unique perspectives into working with suicidal elderly clients. They also presented perceived challenges facing intervention and ways in which those challenges might be addressed. Identifying social workers' field experiences with suicidal older adults may contribute to the empirical knowledge base needed to better develop effective suicide prevention strategies. The implications for gerontological education and training are highlighted.

AB Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify distinctive characteristics of old-old suicide attempters (75 years and older) from young-old (60-74 years old) and middle-aged suicide attempters (45-59 years old).
   Methods: We included consecutive series of 920 patients aged 45 years and older who had visited the emergency room from 2009 to 2015 because of suicide attempts. They were divided into 3 groups according to age. Information about the suicide attempt and sociodemographic status was gathered through interviews with attempters or caregivers. Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were performed to evaluate the differences among the 3 groups.
   Results: We found that old-old suicide attempters had high intent to die and high medical lethality as a result of the attempt, and illness-related problems exerted a strong motivational effect on this group. Psychiatric drugs, pesticides, and herbicides were frequently used to attempt suicide. These attempts were less likely to be associated with alcohol consumption compared to other age groups.
   Conclusion: Old-old suicide attempters have different characteristics, compared with young-old and middle-aged counterparts. It is necessary to assess suicide risk and depression when examining patients with physical illness or when prescribing psychotropic drugs. High-risk groups should be given immediate intervention including psychiatric treatment before they act on high suicide intent.

AB Background:
   Suicide among older people is one of the most rapidly emerging healthcare issues. The objective of this study was to identify the factors associated with suicide ideation in the aged population in South Korea.
   Methods:
   The study recruited 684 subjects older than 65 years old (males = 147, females = 537, mean age = 78.20 +/- 7.02 years), and trained interviewers performed the interviews. The study was performed as part of a community mental health suicide prevention program. The subjects' socio-demographic data, physical health, alcohol problems, social relationships, psychological well-being, and depression severity were all considered. The Korean version of the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (K-BSI) was used to evaluate the intensity of suicide ideation. Correlation and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed to identify the factors associated with the K-BSI. The study results were tested using a path analysis.
   Results:
   Depression severity was positively correlated with suicide ideation, and economic status, psychological well-being, and social relationships were negatively correlated with suicide ideation. Depression severity had the largest direct impact, and economic status and social relationships had indirect impacts on suicide ideation. Psychological well-being exerted both direct and indirect influences.
   Conclusion:
   Depression severity was the most important predictor of suicide ideation among older people. Other direct and indirect factors played secondary roles. Effective suicide prevention strategies should focus on early detection and active intervention for depression. Socio-economic programs may also indirectly reduce suicide ideation among the aged population.

TI Suicide and Ambient Temperature: A Multi-Country Multi-City Study

LA English
DT Article
ID SOUTH-AFRICA; MORTALITY; SEASONALITY; RATES; ASSOCIATION; ENGLAND
AB BACKGROUND: Previous literature suggests that higher ambient temperature may play a role in increasing the risk of suicide. However, no multicountry study has explored the shape of the association and the role of moderate and extreme heat across different locations.
   OBJECTIVES: We examined the short-term temperature suicide relationship using daily time-series data collected for 341 locations in 12 countries for periods ranging from 4 to 40 y.
   METHODS: We conducted a two-stage meta-analysis. First, we performed location-specific time-stratified case-crossover analyses to examine the temperature suicide association for each location. Then, we used a multivariate meta-regression to combine the location-specific lag-cumulative nonlinear associations across all locations and by country.
   RESULTS: A total of 1,320,148 suicides were included in this study. Higher ambient temperature was associated with an increased risk of suicide in general, and we observed a nonlinear association (inverted J-shaped curve) with the highest risk at 27 degrees C. The relative risk (RR) for the highest risk was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.30, 1.36) compared with the risk at the first percentile. Country-specific results showed that the nonlinear associations were more obvious in northeast Asia (Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan). The temperature with the highest risk of suicide ranged from the 87th to 88th percentiles in the northeast Asian countries, whereas this value was the 99th percentile in Western countries (Canada, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the United Slates) and South Africa, where nearly linear associations were estimated. The country-specific RRs ranged from 1.31 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.44) in the United States to 1.65 (95% CI: 1.40, 1.93) in Taiwan, excluding countries where the results were substantially uncertain.
   DISCUSSION: Our findings showed that the risk of suicide increased with increasing ambient temperature in many countries, but to varying extents and not necessarily linearly. This temperature suicide association should be interpreted cautiously, and further evidence of the relationship and modifying factors is needed.

AB Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating, neurodegenerative condition frequently complicated by psychiatric symptoms. Patients with PD may be at higher risk for suicide than the general population, but previous estimates are limited and conflicting. The aim of this study is to estimate the suicide rate based on the clinical case registry and to identify risk factors for suicide among patients diagnosed with PD.
   Methods: The target sample consisted of 4362 patients diagnosed with PD who were evaluated at a general hospital in Seoul, South Korea, from 1996 to 2012. The standardized mortality ratio for suicide among PD patients was estimated. In order to identify the clinical correlates of suicide, case-control study was conducted based on retrospective chart review. The 29 suicide cases (age: 62.3 +/- 13.7 years; females: 34.5%) were matched with 116 non-suicide controls (age: 63.5 +/- 9.2 years; females 56.9%) by the year of initial PD evaluation.
   Results: The SMR for suicide in PD patients was 1.99 (95% CI 1.33-2.85). Mean duration from time of initial diagnosis to suicide among cases was 6.1 +/- 3.5 years. Case-control analysis revealed that male, initial extremity of motor symptom onset, history of depressive disorder, delusion, any psychiatric disorder, and higher L-dopa dosage were significantly associated with suicide among PD patients. Other PD related variables such as UPDRS motor score were not significantly associated with death by suicide.
   Conclusion: Suicide risk in PD patients is approximately 2 times higher than that in the general population. Psychiatric disorders, and also L-dopa medication need further attention with respect to suicide. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Suicide attempts are prevalent in association with major mood disorders, and risk is greater with bipolar disorder (BD) than major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. There may be similar relationships in juvenile mood disorders, but the evidence has not been compiled systematically and quantitatively.
   Method: We searched for reports of studies comparing rates of suicide attempts in children or adolescents diagnosed with BD or MDD, and applied random-effects meta-analysis.
   Results: In 6 reports from 1995 to 2017, with 2,303 participants diagnosed with mood disorder from the United States and South Korea, aged 3 to 18 years, rates of suicide attempts differed significantly by diagnosis: BD (31.5%) > MDD (20.5%) > hypomania or mania-only (8.49%). Risk of suicide attempts differed (BD > MDD) highly significantly by meta -analysis (odds ratio [OR] = 1.71, CI = 1.33-2.20, p <.0001), and was very similar if a study with attempts and suicidal ideation was excluded (OR = 1.64, CI = 1.26-2.15, p <.0001).
   Conclusion: Risk of suicide attempts in juvenile mood disorder patients ranked: BD > MDD >> hypomania or mania -only >> juvenile general population.

AB We examined how media coverage of a celebrity who died by suicide due to depression was associated with the change in the number of people who visited a psychiatrist for depression. For this, of all news articles published in South Korea between 2010 and 2017, we identified all cases in which a celebrity died by suicide due to depression. Further, from the Korean health big data system, we collected monthly data on the number of people who visited a psychiatrist for depression. Regression analyses showed that, when there was media coverage of celebrity suicide due to depression in a particular month, more people visited a psychiatrist for depression-not in the same month but in the following month. We also found that, when there was media coverage of celebrity suicide due to depression, more news articles provided information about depression treatment or prevention. But, the increase in the number of such news articles did not play mediating roles between the media coverage of celebrity suicide, of which depression was known to be the main cause, and the increase in the number of visits to a psychiatrist.

AB Objectives To investigate the magnitude and characteristics of the economic burden resulting from acute pesticide poisoning (APP) in South Korea. Methods The total costs of APP from a societal perspective were estimated by summing the direct medical and non-medical costs together with the indirect costs. Direct medical costs for patients assigned a disease code of pesticide poisoning were extracted from the Korean National Health Insurance Reimbursement Data. Direct non-medical costs were estimated using the average transportation and caregiving costs from the Korea Health Panel Survey. Indirect costs, incurred by pre-mature deaths and work loss, were obtained using 2009 Life Tables for Korea and other relevant literature. Results In 2009, a total of 11 453 patients were treated for APP and 1311 died, corresponding to an incidence of 23.1 per 100 000 population and a mortality rate of 2.6 per 100 000 population in South Korea. The total costs of APP were estimated at approximately US$ 150 million, 0.3% of the costs of total diseases. Costs due to pre-mature mortality accounted for 90.6% of the total costs, whereas the contribution of direct medical costs was relatively small. Conclusion Costs from APP demonstrate a unique characteristic of a large proportion of the indirect costs originating from pre-mature mortality. This finding suggests policy implications for restrictions on lethal pesticides and safe storage to reduce fatality and cost due to APP.

AB The aim of this study was to examine epidemiologic data regarding acute herbicide or insecticide poisoning in adults from 2011 to 2014 at the national level in South Korea. Further, the association between governmental regulations involving pesticides and changes in pesticide poisoning occurrences over time was determined. Data were obtained from the emergency department (ED)-based Injury In-depth Surveillance system conducted by the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). Governmental regulations on pesticides were downloaded from the homepage of the Korea Rural Development Administration. Pesticides were classified according to guidelines provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and by the respective Resistance Action Committee (RAC). Trends in the number of ED presentations and case fatality rate (CFR) due to pesticide poisoning were investigated. The overall CFR due to poisoning from herbicides or insecticides in adults in South Korea was 16.8% during 2011-2014. However, CFR significantly decreased over the 4-year period. The ED presentations of paraquat (PQ) poisoning fell significantly, whereas poisoning due to glyphosate, glufosinate, or combined herbicides increased markedly over the 4 years. Between 2011 and 2013, PQ was the most common pesticide poisoning, whereas glyphosate became the most frequent in 2014. PQ produced the highest rate of fatality followed by endosulfan. Although the frequency of PQ poisoning decreased, which may be attributed to governmental regulations, the CFR and incidence of pesticide poisoning in adults remain a public health concern that needs to be addressed.

AB This study is the first comprehensive analysis to investigate the potential association between stock market fluctuations and attempted suicide events as measured by self-inflicted injuries treated in hospitalization. Using nationwide, 15-year population-based data from 1998 through 2012, we observe that the occurrences for the hospitalizations of attempted suicides are apparently predicted by stock price movements. A low stock price index, a daily fall in the stock index, and consecutive daily falls in the stock index have been shown to be associated with increased risk of hospitalization in patients with attempted suicide. More specifically, stock price index is found to be significant impact on attempted suicide in the 45-54 age groups of both genders, whilst daily change is significant for both genders in the 25-34 and 55-64 age groups and accumulated change is only significant in female aged 25-44 and above 65. On the basis of the results, relevant organizations should consider the suicidal factors that relate prime-working-age and near-retirement-age people to better carry out specific suicide prevention measures, and, meanwhile, encourage those people to pay less attention towards daily stock price movements.

TI Impact of disability status on suicide risks in South Korea: Analysis of

AB Background: The elevated risk of suicide in people with disability has been suggested in the previous studies; however, the majority of study results have been limited to specific disability types, and there is a lack of research comparing the risk of suicide in people with disability in general.
   Objectives: To examine the hazard ratio of suicide according to the presence and the types of disability and identify patterns in the results.
   Methods: In this study, we used National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort data on 990,598 people, and performed analysis on the cause of death from 2003 through 2013. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratio of suicide associated with disability and its types.
   Results: The hazard ratio of suicide among people with disability was 1.9-folds higher compared to people without disability. The risk of suicide among different disability types was higher in mental disorder, renal failure, brain injury and physical disability. The hazard ratio of suicide in people with disability was not varied by income. The time to death by suicide for people with disability from the onset of their disability was 39.8 months on average.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that when the government plans suicide prevention policies, early and additional interventions specific to people with disability are needed. Disability due to mental disorder, renal failure should be given priority. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE Adolescence; Sexual intercourse; Suicide; Contexts of sexual intercourse
ID YOUTH; RISK; IDEATION
AB Purpose: For the current article an examination was done as to whether engaging in sexual intercourse before or during adolescence has a negative impact on the suicidal behaviors of suicide ideation, suicide attempt, and suicide lethality and whether the impact varies according to the context of sexual intercourse and/or gender. Methods: Adolescents who experienced casual sex and romantic sex were compared to adolescents who retained their virginity. Data was from samples drawn from the three waves (2010-2012) of the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-Based Survey. Logistic models were used to adjust for a wide array of confounding variables. Results: Any type of sexual intercourse increases risk of all suicidal behaviors. Sexual intercourse in a romantic relationship exhibits enhanced risk of suicidal behaviors compared to casual sex. Adjusting for experience of sexual violence, however, decreases risk of romantic sex substantially, turning some estimates statistically insignificant. In addition, risks for suicide lethality are greater for girls than boys. Conclusion: Romantic sex put adolescents at higher risk for suicidal behaviors than casual sex owing to prevalent sexual violence in the relationships. Girls suffer more substantively adverse outcomes than boys. These results suggest that adolescents will benefit from comprehensive education on sexuality and sexual behaviors regarding how to form and maintain a romantic relationship that is characterized by personal integrity and mutual respect. It is also important to help victims of sexual violence recover from traumatic events by providing emotional support and effective counseling.

AB Our study aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics and psychotropic prescription patterns of a history of suicide attempts in South Koreans with bipolar disorder (BD), by using only Korean data from the Research on Asian Psychotropic Prescription Pattern for Bipolar disorder. The patterns of clinical characteristics and psychotropic drug use were compared among 53 patients with a history of suicide attempts and 297 without this history; the potential effects of confounding variables were adjusted with binary logistic analyses for discrete variables and analyses of covariance for continuous variables. After adjusting the effects of age, sex, duration of illness, and enrollment as an outpatient, patients with a history of suicide attempts were characterized by a significantly more prevalent depressive episode, lower prevalent remission state, lower levels of hemoglobin, and more use of antidepressants, anxiolytics, and hypnotics compared to those without lifetime suicide attempt. The inability to plan goal-directed behavior may be an intervening factor in the relationship between suicide attempts and depression in BD. Relatively low hemoglobin levels can be associated with manic episodes in patients with a history of suicide attempts and the use of antidepressants, anxiolytics, or hypnotics can be associated with suicide attempts in BD patients.

AB Background: A diagnosis of cancer is associated with an increased suicide risk, and this risk is the highest within the first year of diagnosis. The aim of the present study was to determine risk factors of suicide occurring within the first year of cancer diagnosis (early suicide).
   Methods: The sampling pool consisted of 164,497 patients with cancer admitted to a general hospital in Seoul, South Korea, from 1996 to 2009. We conducted a 1:2 matched case-control study by matching 373 patients who died from suicide (cases) with 746 patients who did not die from suicide (controls) on age, sex, anatomic site, and at the time of cancer diagnosis. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression modeling.
   Results: Suicide within the first year after a cancer diagnosis occurred in 149 patients (40.0% of 373 total suicides). The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for early suicide was 1.65 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.40-1.94] and was significantly higher for biliary-pancreatic (SMR = 3.07; 95% CI = 2.02-4.46), lung (SMR = 1.94; 95% CI = 1.19-3.30), and stomach (SMR= 1.71; 95% CI = 1.16-2.42) cancers than for other cancers. Early and late suicide was significantly different in anatomic site (p = 0.01) and stage (p < 0.001), while not significant in other demographic factors. Advanced stage was more frequent among early suicide compared with late suicide (53.4 versus 18.7%; p < 0.001). Stage of cancer was independently associated with early suicide risk.
   Conclusions: Cancers with an advanced stage at diagnosis were associated with an increased risk of suicide within 1 year of diagnosis. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Recently suicides have been on the rise and become social issues around the world. Seoul, the capital of South Korea, has been no exception. Hence, to detect and respond early, Seoul Metropolitan Government has installed the suicide corresponding sensor system at two locations of Han-River bridges where suicide occurs frequently. This study analyzed the pilot system's performance of past 1 year and presented the following results. First, rescued people who attempted to suicide have increased in relation of the sensor system and it's determined to be verified based on early discovery, and prompt action of rescue operation. Second, after a pilot test for 1 year, surveillance cameras installed at blind spots have contributed to improve the effectiveness of the security system. Finally, as a result of the analyzing the death leap types, there are three following types of people who attempted to suicide: (1) a form of falling directly from the bridge rail, (2) a form of sitting on the bridge rail and jumping away, (3) a form of standing outside of the bridge rail and jumping away. Based on these results, it was implied that the proactive measures such as utilizing sensors are very effective in suicide prevention and they can be expanded to prevention of death leap in other places such as high-rise buildings.

AB Han is a destructive feeling in Korea. Although Korea accomplished significant exterior growth, Korean society is still experiencing the dark aspects of transforming han as evidenced by having the highest suicide rate in Asia. Some reasons for this may be the fragmentation between North and South Korea. If we can transform han then it can become constructive. I was challenged to think of possibilities for transforming han internally; this brings me to the correlational method through psychological and religious interpretation. This study is to challenge and encourage many han-ridden people in Korean society. Through the psychological and religious understanding of han, people suffering can positively transform their han. They can relate to han more subjectively, and this means the han-ridden psyche has an innate sacredness of potential to transform.

AB This paper examines the colonial discourse of the global population problem in Korea under Japanese rule (1910-1945). I consider the recent call of Alison Bashford to draw attention to the geopolitical and spatial dimensions of the colonial population discourse in the non-Western Japanese Empire and to interrogate global population from the perspective of East Asian imperialism in the twentieth century. By opening up the colonial archives on population through an examination of colonial state and pro-state magazines in Korea, such as Chsen (Korea) and Chsen oyobi Manchu (Korea and Manchuria), I demonstrate how metropolitan and colonial elites, including imperial and colonial state officials, politicians, intellectuals, physicians and so on, at pains to build Japan's empire, engaged in the debates on jink mondai (population problem) in 1920s and 1930s Korea. The details of the debate bring to light the ways in which the management of the population problem undergirded the complex issues of the peninsula and the empire at large, including emigration, Japanese settlement, the cultivation of Manchuria, the development of mining and heavy chemical industries, the Sino-Japanese War, Western imperial rule, and the emancipation of the coloured populations/races. Further, I delineate how these details were deeply imbedded in the racialized struggle between the Japanese race/coloured races vs. the white race in the global governance of the population and territory in the final phase of Japanese imperial aggression. By going beyond the Western, Anglo-Saxon debates on population, this paper seeks to showcase how East Asian imperial power responded to the white, Western discourse of race suicide vs. the yellow peril'.

AB Some East/Southeast Asian countries have experienced a rapid increase in suicide by charcoal burning over the past decade. Media reporting and Internet use were thought to contribute to the epidemic. We investigated the association between method-specific suicide incidence and both Internet search volume and newspaper reporting in Taiwan.
   Weekly data for suicide, suicide-related Google search volume, and the number of articles reporting suicide in four major newspapers in Taiwan during 2008-2011 were obtained. Poisson autoregressive regression models were used to examine the associations between these variables.
   In the fully adjusted models, every 10 % increase in Google searches was associated with a 4.3 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.1-7.6 %] increase in charcoal-burning suicide incidence in the same week, and a 3.8 % (95 % CI 0.4-7.2 %) increase in the following week. A one-article increase in the United Daily was associated with a 3.6 % (95 % CI 1.5-5.8 %) increase in charcoal-burning suicide in the same week. By contrast, non-charcoal-burning suicide was not associated with Google search volume, but was associated with the Apple Daily's reporting in the preceding week.
   We found that increased Internet searches for charcoal-burning suicide appeared to be associated with a subsequent increase in suicide by this method. The prevention of suicide using emerging methods may include monitoring and regulating online information that provides details of these methods as well as encouraging Internet service providers to provide help-seeking information.

AB Individuals with psychoses show excess mortality, which is a major public health concern. This study examined all-cause and suicide mortality rates in Korean patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, mood disorder, or mental and behavioral disorder due to psychoactive substance use and to compare this with that of the general population. Data were from the National Health Insurance cohort, 2002 to 2013. A total of 107,190 cases aged 15 years or over were included. Mortality rates per 100,000 person years (PY) were obtained. Poisson regression modelling was conducted to quantify the effect of baseline characteristics on all-cause and suicide mortality risks. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were also calculated. All-cause mortality was the highest among mental and behavioral disorder patients (1,051.0 per 100,000 PY), followed by schizophrenia (949.1 per 100,000 PY) and mood disorder patients (559.5 per 100,000 PY). Highest suicide mortality was found in schizophrenia (177.2 per 100,000 PY), mental and behavioral disorder (143.7 per 100,000 PY), and mood disorder patients (59.7 per 100,000 PY). The rate ratios (RRs) for all-cause and suicide mortality were reduced for younger populations and women. Psychoses patients had higher all-cause (schizophrenia, SMR 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2-2.5; mood disorder, SMR 1.4; 95% CI 1.3-1.5; mental and behavioral disorder, SMR 2.6; 95% CI 2.5-2.8) and suicide (schizophrenia, SMR 8.4; 95% CI 7.2-9.6; mood disorder, SMR 2.8; 95% CI 2.1-3.5; mental and behavioral disorder, SMR 6.8; 95% CI 5.7-7.9) mortality rates than the general population. These findings infer that efforts should be made to reduce excess mortality in psychoses.

TI Estimating the Risk for Suicide Following the Suicide Deaths of 3 Asian
   Entertainment Celebrities: A Meta-Analytic Approach
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY

AB Objective: Evidence suggests that there is an increase in the suicide rate following incidents of celebrity suicide in different countries, but there are no data on the overall suicide risk across countries. The duration of increased suicide rates is usually assumed to be on a monthly basis, but the weekly increase remains uncertain. This study aims at estimating the risk for suicide after the suicide deaths of entertainment celebrities in Asia (luring the first 4 weeks after the celebrity suicides and on a weekly basis.
   Method: An ecological, retrospective time-series analysis and a meta-analysis of the suicide deaths in 3 Asian regions: Hong Kong (from 2001 to 2003), Taiwan, and South Korea (both from 2003 to 2005).
   Results: The combined risks for suicide were found to be 1.43 (95% CI = 1.23 to 1.66), 1.29 (95% CI = 1.12 to 1.50), and 1.25 (95% CI = 1.08 to 1.45) in the first, second, and third week, respectively, after suicides of entertainment celebrities, while adjusting for secular trends, seasonality, economic situation, and temporal autocorrelation. The same-gender and same-method specific increases suggest that as people identify more with the celebrity, their risk for suicide rises. A medium-term rise in suicides up to 24 weeks after the incidents of celebrity suicide is also evident.
   Conclusion: This study is the first to estimate risk for suicides following celebrity suicides across 3 Asian regions. The results provide important information for public health policy makers in assessing the elevated risk associated with excessive media coverage of celebrity suicide and developing timely evidence-based interventions.

AB This study examines the association between unemployment, Medicaid provisions, the mental health industry, and adult suicides in nine US northeastern states from 1999 to 2009. Results show that increased unemployment is associated with more Medicaid beneficiaries and higher health care spending per beneficiary with no significant relationship with Medicaid mental health spending. The Medicaid beneficiary rate is positively associated with the number of mental health clinics, mental health and substance abuse social workers, mental health counselors, and psychiatrists, with no significant association with mental health physician offices or psychologists. Unemployment is also related with increasing suicide rates for the overall population and White non-Hispanics, aged 16-64, with the worst association for White non-Hispanic males. The composition of the mental health industry is also associated with suicide rates. Maintaining an appropriate mix of mental health facilities and professionals to prevent, diagnose, and treat mental health disorders remains a critical public health challenge.

AB Objective To estimate the 12-week remission rate of patients with depressive disorders and predictors of this in a naturalistic clinical setting in South Korea.
   Methods For people with DSM-IV depressive disorders about to receive treatment at 18 hospitals, data on sociodemographic and health status were obtained. A free choice of clinical interventions was allowed and naturalistic follow-up took place at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks later. Remission was defined as a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score of <= 7 sustained to 12 weeks or last follow-up, if earlier.
   Results For 723 participants, the 12-week remission rate was 31.4%. Remission was more likely in women, and in patients without a prior history of suicide attempt, and those with lower baseline anxiety.
   Conclusions Remission associated with unrestricted clinical interventions was comparable to STAR*D estimates for citalopram alone. Comorbid anxiety and previous suicide attempt were markers of worse outcome. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

DT Article
DE Outpatient follow-up; Psychiatric disorders; Suicide
ID HOSPITALIZATION; DEATH
AB Background: Patients with psychiatric disorders are considered to be at increased suicide risk following discharge. We aimed to identify suicide risk during one year after discharge among adults with psychiatric disorders compared to those without psychiatric disorders.
   Method: This study used a nationally representative cohort including patients discharged with an initial primary diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder and control subjects selected by 1: 3 case-control propensity matching between 2005 and 2012. The dependent variable was death by suicide during one year after discharge. Adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) of suicide risk were estimated by the Cox proportional hazard model.
   Results: In a cohort of 50,868 adults, the suicide rate was higher for patients with a psychiatric disorder compared to non-psychiatric patients (AHR 7.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.9-10.6), especially in young adults (AHR 18.6, 95% CI 6.4-54.1), and patients with multiple psychiatric disorders (AHR 12.5, 95% CI 7.9-20.0). Among psychiatric disorder categories, the suicide rate was highest for depressive disorder, followed by bipolar disorder, substance use disorder, schizophrenia. Patients with psychiatric disorders who received outpatient care during one year after discharge were at lower risk of suicide than those who did not receive or otherwise received fewer outpatient treatments.
   Limitations: Data were not available on risk factors such as suicide attempts. The suicide risk for shorter periods could not be determined due to the limited data.
   Conclusions: Patients with psychiatric disorders are at high suicide risk during one year after hospital discharge. Outpatient follow-up is an effective prevention strategy.

ID EUROPEAN COUNTRIES; MORTALITY; JAPAN; ASSOCIATION; ENGLAND; RISK
AB Background: The relation of income and socioeconomic status with suicide rates remains unclear. Most previous studies have focused on the relationship between suicide rates and macroeconomic factors (e.g., economic growth rate). Therefore, we aimed to identify the relationship between individuals' socioeconomic position and suicide risk.
   Methods: We analyzed suicide mortality rates across socioeconomic positions to identify potential trends using observational data on suicide mortality collected between January 2003 and December 2013 from 1,025,340 national health insurance enrollees. We followed the subjects for 123.5 months on average. Socioeconomic position was estimated using insurance premium levels. To examine the hazard ratios of suicide mortality in various socioeconomic positions, we used Cox proportional hazard models.
   Results: We found that the hazard ratios of suicide showed an increasing trend as socioeconomic position decreased. After adjusting for gender, age, geographic location, and disability level, Medicaid recipients had the highest suicide hazard ratio (2.28; 95% CI, 1.87-2.77). Among the Medicaid recipients, men had higher hazard ratios than women (2.79; 95% CI, 2.17-3.59 vs. 1.71; 95% CI, 1.25-2.34). Hazard ratios also varied across age groups. The highest hazard ratio was found in the 40-59-year-old group (3.19; 95% CI, 2.31-4.43), whereas the lowest ratio was found in those 60 years and older (1.44; 95% CI, 1.09-1.87).
   Conclusions: Our results illuminate the relationship between socioeconomic position and suicide rates and can be used to design and implement future policies on suicide prevention. (C) 2017 The Authors. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of The Japan Epidemiological Association.

AB Objective. Although the effect of occupation or employment status on suicide risk is notable, there are few studies on the effect of precarious employment on suicide. We compared suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in precarious workers and their non-precarious counterparts using a representative sample from South Korea.
   Method. The 2008 Korean Community Health Survey data were used for this study. Information was obtained on 52,161 participants (41,063 employees with non-precarious work and 11,098 employees with precarious work). The outcome of the logistic regression model was the presence of suicidal thoughts and attempts, and the independent variables were the demographics, socioeconomic status, and health status.
   Results. Employees with precarious work were more likely to exhibit suicidal ideation (OR = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.28-1.55) and suicide attempts (OR = 1.52; 95% CI, 1.02-2.27) than employees with non-precarious work. After controlling for income and education (Model 2) depressive feelings (Model 6), compared with unadjusted model, remained significant but the odds ratio was largely attenuated, indicating a strong association between suicidal risk and socioeconomic and feelings of depression.
   Conclusion. Precarious workers had a higher risk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts than non-precarious workers. Our study suggests that precarious employment is an important risk for suicide. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Oseltamivir was developed for prophylactic and therapeutic use against influenza, specifically targeting the viral enzyme's highly-conserved active site. In recent years, there have been case reports of neuropsychiatric events during or after oseltamivir treatment, in Japan, and other countries. However, a search of the literature revealed no such cases in South Korea. We present the case of a 15-year-old female adolescent diagnosed with depressive episode after taking oseltamivir. Oseltamivir is generally well tolerated. Its most frequent adverse effects include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. In influenza patients taking oseltamivir, neuropsychiatric adverse events include delirium, behavioral disturbance, suicide, delusion, panic attack, convulsion, depressed mood, loss of consciousness, etc. Reportedly, such neuropsychiatric adverse events were more common in children than in adults and generally occurred within 48 hours of administration. Here, we report a retrospective review case of an oseltamivir-related neuropsychiatric event in a female adolescent in South Korea. Psychiatry Investig 2010;7:302-304

AB Background: Despite abundant theoretical evidence of higher rates of suicide among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youths, little is known about the relationship between suicide and types of sexual intercourse experience in youths. This study examines the association between the type of intercourse experience and suicide risk outcomes (SROs: suicidal ideation, plans for suicide, suicidal attempts) from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey.
   Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 146,621 students aged 12-17 years for the years 2012 and 2013. We defined lesbian, gay, or bisexual youth as youths who engaged in a type of sexual intercourse (same-sex or both-sex intercourse). A chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate the association between intercourse experience and SROs.
   Results: The results showed that the prevalence of suicidal ideation was higher among youths with same-sex intercourse experience (45.9% for females, 33.7% for males) than among youths with opposite-sex intercourse experience (42.2% for females, 23.8% for males) and those with no experience in intercourse (21.0% for females, 12. 7% for males). After adjusting for revealed risk factors that were associated with suicide risks, among males, suicide risks based on intercourse experience seemed to increase in the following order: no experience in sexual intercourse, opposite-sex, same-sex, and then both-sexes sexual intercourse experience. Same-and both-sexes intercourse related SROs are strongly linked to violence (being physically assaulted, threatened, or bullied) and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV infection. Those having no sexual intercourse experience showed the least probability of suicide risks among youths.
   Conclusion: The SROs of youths with same-sex or both-sex intercourse experience had strong associations with gender (males), violence, and STDs. Therefore, school educators must continue to advocate for and to implement LGB inclusive policies and programs in order to promote safe and supportive learning environments where all students are protected from health risk behaviors.

AB Asia is the world's largest continent, occupying approximately half the earth's land mass and containing half the world's population. Although ethnically, culturally, economically, and religiously diverse, there are a number of factors common to all Asian countries, as well as some important differences. It is estimated that suicides in Asia contribute 60% to the global one million suicides annually, with three Asian countries (viz. China, India, and Japan) accounting for more than 40% of this figure. Other Asian countries with high suicide rates include Kazakhstan, Sri Lanka, and South Korea. The majority of people dying by suicide in Asia are young, and pesticides are one of the most common methods used. In many Asian countries, the male to female ratio is much narrower and in China it is reversed. Given that there are 10-20 attempts for every completed suicide and at least six people are directly affected by a suicide or a serious attempt, there may be as many as 60 million people in Asia suffering from the consequences of a suicidal act every year, but postvention remains a neglected area in Asia. Due to a variety of legal, socio-cultural, and religious factors suicide rates in many Asian countries are grossly underestimated and there are huge research and knowledge gaps. A fifth of Asian countries either do not collect national mortality statistics on suicide or even if they do, they do not report them to the World Health Organization (WHO). To reduce the enormous burden of suicide in Asia, there is a need for more and better research to inform policy and establish culturally relevant suicide prevention programmes.

AB Objectives To examine the hypothesis that the relationship between obesity and the risk of suicidal behaviour would differ according to sex and age.
   Setting Data from the 2007-2012 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) were used.
   Participants 36211 adults with body mass index (BMI) data were included and the mean age was 49.6years.
   Independent variable BMI.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures Suicide ideation and attempts.
   Design and analysis A cross-sectional study was performed. Multiple logistic regressions after controlling for socioeconomic variables and concomitant diseases were applied to see the relationship between obesity level and suicidal ideation or attempt.
   Results Women with severe obesity had the highest prevalence of suicide attempts and ideation, whereas among males, underweight men had the highest prevalence. After adjustment, obese men had a lower OR for suicide ideation (OR=0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.00). Among women, the ORs of severely obese and underweight women were 1.27 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.52) and 1.24 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.45), respectively. When grouped by age category, the ORs for suicide ideation in severely obese women aged 18 to <30years or attempts in severely obese women aged 30 to <50years were 2.30 (95% CI 1.36 to 3.89) and 3.07 (95% CI 1.50 to 6.31), respectively. However, overweight and obese women aged more than 50years exhibited significantly less ORs of suicide ideation, when compared with counterparts of normal weight.
   Conclusions The association between obesity and suicidal behaviour exhibited a different pattern by sex and age in South Korea. In particular, severely obese young women had a substantial risk of suicidal behaviour. Our study results highlighted the importance of obesity management in the prevention of suicide among young women, and may be helpful for the drafting of the health agenda in Asian countries with an obesity prevalence and culture similar to those in Korea.

ID SOUTH-KOREA; CANCER; INJURIES; FARMERS
AB The aim of this paper was to provide an overview of mortality and disease prevalence related to occupational diseases among agricultural workers in Korea. We evaluated the age-standardized mortality rates and the prevalence of chronic diseases and compared them with those of other populations using death registration data from 2004 through 2008 and the 2005 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In addition, we conducted a literature review on published articles examining the health status of farmers in Korea. Agricultural workers have a significantly higher mortality of cancer, tuberculosis, chronic respiratory diseases, liver diseases, suicide, motor and non-motor vehicle accidents. Compared to other populations, farmers have higher prevalence rates of arthritis and intervertebral disc disorders. The literature review revealed a number of work-related diseases among farmers, such as musculoskeletal diseases, pesticide poisoning, infections, and respiratory and neurologic diseases. Korean farmers demonstrate a distinct pattern of mortality and disease prevalence compared to other populations. Although lifestyle factors remain important contributors to those deaths and diseases, our study suggests that occupation is a major determinant as well. Intensive programs such as surveillance systems, therefore, should be developed in order to identify and prevent work-related diseases among agricultural workers in Korea.

AB Introduction: While previous research already exists on the impact of the current economic crisis and whether it leads to an increase in mortality by suicide, our objective in this paper is to determine if the increase in the suicide rate in Catalonia, Spain from 2010 onwards has been statistically significant and whether it is associated with rising unemployment.
   Methods: We used hierarchical mixed models, separately considering the crude death rate of suicides for municipalities with more than and less than 10,000 inhabitants as dependent variables both unstratified and stratified according to gender and/or age group.
   Results: In municipalities with 10,000 or more inhabitants there was an increase in the relative risk of suicide from 2009 onwards. This increase was only statistically significant for working-aged women (16-64 years). In municipalities with less than 10,000 inhabitants the relative risk showed a decreasing trend even after 2009. In no case did we find the unemployment rate to be associated (statistically significant) with the suicide rate.
   Conclusions: The increase in the suicide rate from 2010 in Catalonia was not statistically significant as a whole, with the exception of working-aged women (16-64 years) living in municipalities with 10,000 or more inhabitants. We have not found this increase to be associated with rising unemployment in any of the cases. Future research into the effects of economic recessions on suicide mortality should take into account inequalities by age, sex and size of municipalities.

AB Religion in Korea has been shaped by its followers to a degree, but the role of religion in Korea has been largely unexamined. This study examines the role of religion and the incorporation of religious beliefs and institutions in the field of disaster management. In doing so, the study examines how three religionsChristianity, Buddhism, and Confucianismoperate in Korea, in particular in terms of both care-oriented management and mitigation-oriented management approaches. While utilizing descriptive research as a methodology, policy measures have been suggested with the support of theological perspectives. Despite some difficulties in making a generalization, the major finding is that religion has a role to play in supplementing care-oriented management, with mitigation-oriented management approaches, by better grasping the nature of a disaster and its effective management while responding to regional culture. In addition, the Ministry of Public Safety and Security, local governments, and other government institutions must play new roles in incorporating religion in disaster management.

AB RationalePesticide self-poisoning is a major method of suicide in many agricultural communities worldwide. In addition, there are a number of known crime cases related to people being harmed by insecticides. Methomyl, a prohibited insecticide in the Republic of Korea, has high toxicity and is frequently used for self-poisoning. In this study, we investigated the source of origin of methamyl in a fatal poisoning case using stable isotope ratio analysis.
   MethodsTwo bottles of Soju from a crime scene were seized and nine different brands of methomyl products were collected from the neighborhood for analysis. In addition, the gastric contents and energy drink from the person who had committed suicide were analyzed. Isotope analysis using GC/Isolink/IRMS was conducted to determine the source of the methomyl by comparing their carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios. Linear discriminant analysis was utilized to verify the results.
   ResultsIsotope ratio analysis showed that the isotope ratio ranges of methomyl found in the Soju, the gastric contents of the suicide victim, and the energy drink bottle were similar to those of a seized methomyl product, Samgong methomyl 2011 (SG11). Thus, it was assumed that SG11 was used in this fatal poisoning case.
   ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the potential of stable isotope ratio analysis for the determination of insecticide origin in fatal poisoning cases.

AB Inflammation has been linked with a potential critical role in suicide. The purpose of this study is to examine the relation of CRP with suicidal behavior in the Korean population. We conducted a cross-sectional study in 4693 Korean adults aged 20-81 years who participated in the 2015 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. High sensitivity CRP levels were measured by immunoturbidimetric method. Suicidal ideation and suicide attempt were assessed by using a questionnaire. Data were analyzed in 2017. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to compute odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (Cis). The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 4.9% and that of suicide attempt was 0.4%. Suicidal ideation was more prevalent in the highest compared with the lowest serum CRP quartile (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.11-2.89) after adjustment for age, sex, household income, educational level, marital status, employment status, alcohol dependency, current smoking, physical activity, BMI, sleep duration, number of chronic diseases, restriction on activity, subjective health status, perceived stress, depression and depressive mood (p for trend <0.05). In conclusion, elevated levels of CRP were associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation among South Korean adults. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Cancer diagnosis is associated with an increased suicide risk, particularly within the first 1 year after diagnosis of cancer. Abnormal function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression and suicide. We examined genetic associations of the functional Bcl-1 polymorphism of (rs41423247) neuron-specific glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) gene, with death by suicide in cancer patients. Suicides occurring within a year of cancer diagnosis ('early suicide') were considered separately from those suicides during the second or subsequent year ('late suicide') after cancer diagnosis.
   Methods: The subjects consisted of 343 cancer patients admitted to a general hospital in Seoul, South Korea from 1996 to 2009, of which 182 had died by suicide and 161 were alive on December 31, 2009. Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sample of patients with cancer. We conducted a case-control association analysis of Bcl-1 polymorphism of NR3C1 gene.
   Results: Subjects carrying the GG genotype of Bcl-1 polymorphism were at increased risk of early suicide when compared to those carrying the CC genotype (OR 3.80, 95 % CI 1.02-14.16, p = .047). Similarly, those individuals carrying the GG genotype (recessive mode) had an increased risk of early suicide relative to the CC or CG genotype (OR 3.71, 95 % CI 1.03-13.43, p = .045). However, there were no differences in the genotype distributions of the NR3C1 Bcl-1 polymorphism between late suicide cases and controls.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the NR3C1 Bcl-1 polymorphisms may be involved in the susceptibility to suicide within the first year after cancer diagnosis among cancer patients in Korean population.

ID NORTHERN-IRELAND; RISK-FACTORS; SOUTH-KOREA; UNEMPLOYMENT; MORTALITY;
   IMPACT; GENDER; CRISIS; HEALTH; RATES
AB Background: Studies have identified employment as a protective factor against suicide. We examined employment status and risk of suicide in Ireland during the 11-year period 1996-2006, a period of economic boom commonly known as the Celtic Tiger. Methods: Data relating to the 5270 suicides and 789 deaths of undetermined intent registered as occurring in Ireland in 1996-2006 and relevant population data were obtained from the Irish Central Statistics Office and analysed using Poisson regression. Results: Unemployment fell from 12% in 1996 to 4% in 2000, a level at which it remained until 2006. Male and female rates of suicide and undetermined death were stable during 1996-2006 though suicide among unemployed men increased. Relative to employment, unemployment was associated with a 2-3-fold increased risk of male suicide and undetermined death but generally a 4-6-fold increased risk in women. Unemployment was associated with greater increased risk of suicide and undetermined death when its level was low (2001-06) than in the period of decreasing unemployment (1996-2000). Unemployment was a stronger risk factor in men aged 35-54 years and with increasing age in women. Retired persons aged > 55 years had a similar risk to their employed counterparts. Being a homemaker was associated with increased risk in women aged > 35 years. Conclusion: The current Irish context of rapidly increasing unemployment suggests that rates may rise again as in previous recessions. Appropriate social policy responses are required to mitigate the potential impact of unemployment on suicides.

TI Prevention of suicide with regulations aimed at restricting access to

   evidence

DT Review

AB Background Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for 14-20% of suicides worldwide. Regulation aimed at restricting access to pesticides or banning highly hazardous pesticides is one approach to reducing these deaths. We systematically reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness of pesticide regulation in reducing the incidence of pesticide suicides and overall suicides.
   Methods We did a systematic review of the international evidence. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase for studies published between Jan 1, 1960, and Dec 31, 2016, which investigated the effect of national or regional bans, and sales or import restrictions, on the availability of one or more pesticides and the incidence of suicide in different countries. We excluded other interventions aimed at limiting community access to pesticides. We extracted data from studies presenting pesticide suicide data and overall suicide data from before and after national sales restrictions. Two reviewers independently assessed papers for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We undertook a narrative synthesis of the data in each report, and where data were available for the years before and after a ban, we pooled data for the 3 years before and the 3 years after to obtain a crude estimate of the effect of the ban. This study is registered through PROSPERO, number CRD42017053329.
   Findings We identified 27 studies undertaken in 16 countries-five low-income or middle-income countries (Bangladesh, Colombia, India, Jordan and Sri Lanka), and 11 high-income countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, UK, and USA). Assessments largely focused on national bans of specific pesticides (12 studies of bans in six countries-Jordan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Greece [ Crete], South Korea, and Taiwan) or sales restrictions (eight studies of restrictions in five countries-India, Denmark, Ireland, the UK and the USA). Only five studies used optimum analytical methods. National bans on commonly ingested pesticides in five of the six countries studied, including four studies using optimum analytical methods, were followed by reductions in pesticide suicides and, in three of these countries, falls in overall suicide mortality. Greece was the only country studied that did not show a decrease in pesticide suicide following a ban. There were no high-quality studies of restricting sales to people for occupational uses; four of the seven studies (in three of the five countries studied-India, Denmark, and the USA) showed sales restrictions were followed by decreases in pesticide suicides; one of the two studies investigating trends in overall suicide mortality reported a fall in deaths in Denmark, but there were also decreases in suicide deaths from other methods.
   Interpretation National bans on highly hazardous pesticides, which are commonly ingested in acts of self-poisoning, seem to be effective in reducing pesticide-specific and overall suicide rates. Evidence is less consistent for sales restrictions. A worldwide ban on the use of highly hazardous pesticides is likely to prevent tens of thousands of deaths every year. Copyright (C) The Author(s).

AB Background: Asian dust storms (ADSs) have been associated with adverse health outcomes, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Considering the increasing global desertification driven by climate change, it is necessary to assess dust storm-related adverse health effects for establishing appropriate public health interventions. Recent studies have found that ambient air pollution has negative effects on mental health including cognitive disorders, depression, and suicide. However, these studies mostly focused on traditional anthropogenic pollutants from traffic exhaust or fossil fuel power plants; the association between dust storms and suicidal death is yet to be determined.
   Objective: To assess the association between ADSs and suicide risk in Seoul, South Korea from 2002 to 2015. Methods: To determine whether increased risk of suicide is associated with occurrence of ADSs, we performed a time-stratified case-crossover study that linked the national death statistics database with ADS occurrence data from the Korea Meteorology Administration. Exposure to ADSs was compared between the day of suicide and control days, matched to the day of the week, month, and year. We further examined whether the effect of ADSs on suicide risk differed according to ADS duration and intensity.
   Results: Over the 14-year period, 30,704 people died by suicide and 133 ADSs were reported. Of these, 55 ADSs lasted over 2 days (long-duration ADSs), and 67 ADSs had higher levels of particulate matter < 10 mu m in diameter (PM10) that exceeded the 50th percentile value over the total 133 ADS days (high-intensity ADSs). Exposure to ADS was associated with a 13.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5-22.4; P = .002) increase in suicide risk on the day of ADS occurrence. Long-duration and high-intensity ADSs were associated with a 19.8% (95% CI, 6.5-34.7; P = .003) and 17.0% (95% CI, 5.2-30.0; P = .004) increase in suicide risk, respectively. These associations remained robust after adjusting for local air pollution levels and meteorological factors. However, this association was not replicated in the unconstrained distributed lag model which revealed inferior goodness-of-fit to our data.
   Conclusions: Exposure to ADSs was associated with an increased risk of suicide, especially on the same day. This study provides novel evidence of a relationship between ADSs and suicide. These findings could help in establishing public health interventions for suicide prevention as well as in establishing dust storm warning systems. Future studies are warranted to confirm if our findings are replicable and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

AB Background: Sri Lanka has experienced major changes in its suicide rates since the 1970s, and in 1995 it had one of the highest rates in the world. Subsequent reductions in Sri Lanka's suicide rates have been attributed to the introduction of restrictions on the availability of highly toxic pesticides. We investigate these changes in suicide rates in relation to age, gender, method specific trends and birth-cohort and period effects, with the aim of informing preventative strategies.
   Methods: Secular trends of suicide in relation to age, sex, method, birth-cohort and period effects were investigated graphically using police data (1975-2012). Poisoning case-fatality was investigated using national hospital admission data (2004-2010).
   Results: There were marked changes to the age-, gender-and method-specific incidence of suicide over the study period. Year on year declines in rates began in 17-25 year olds in the early 1980s. Reduction in older age groups followed and falls in all age groups occurred after all class I (the most toxic) pesticides were banned. Distinct changes in the age/gender pattern of suicide are observed: in the 1980s suicide rates were highest in 21-35 year old men; by the 2000s, this pattern had reversed with a stepwise increase in male rates with increasing age. Throughout the study period female rates were highest in 17-25 year olds. There has been a rise in suicide by hanging, though this rise is relatively small in relation to the marked decline in self-poisoning deaths. The patterns of suicides are more consistent with a period rather than birth-cohort effect.
   Conclusions: The epidemiology of suicide in Sri Lanka has changed noticeably in the last 30 years. The introduction of pesticide regulations in Sri Lanka coincides with a reduction in suicide rates, with evidence of limited method substitution.

AB Very little information is available regarding psychiatry in North Korea, which is based on the legacy of Soviet psychiatry. This paper reviews the characteristits of psychiatry in former socialist countries and discusses its implications for North Korean psychiatry Under socialism, psychiatric disorders were attributed primarily to neurophysiologic or neurobiological origins. Psychosocial or psychodynainic etiology was denied or distorted in line with the political ideology of the Communist Party Psychiatry was primarily conterned with psychotic disorders, and this diagnostic category was sometimes applied based on political considerations. Neurotic disorders were ignored by psychiatry or were regarded as the remnants of capitalism. Several neurotic disorders characterized by high levels of somatization were considered to be neurological or physical in nature. The majority of "mental patients" were institutionalized for a long periods in large-scale psychiatric hospitals. Treatment of psychiatric disorders depended largely on a few influenced by the

AB Background. The interactive effect of personal factors and social factors upon suicide risk is unclear. We conducted prospective cohort study to investigate whether the impact of the economic crisis in 1997-1998 upon suicide risk differed according to Neuroticism and Psychoticism personality traits.
   Methods. The Miyagi Cohort Study in Japan with a follow-up for 19 years from 1990 to 2008 has 29432 subjects aged 40-64 years at baseline who completed a questionnaire about various health habits and the Japanese version of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire - Revised Short Form in 1990.
   Results. The suicide mortality rate increased from 4.6 per 100000 person-years before 1998 to 27.8 after 1998. Although both Neuroticism and Psychoticism were significantly associated with an increased risk of mortality during the whole period from 1990 to 2008, the impact of the economic crisis upon suicide risk differed between the Neuroticism and Psychoticism personality traits. Compared with the lowest category, the hazard ratios (HRs) for the highest Neuroticism increased from 0.66 before 1998 to 2.45 after 1998. On the other hand, the HRs for the highest Psychoticism decreased from 7.85 before 1998 to 2.05 after 1998.
   Conclusions. The impact of the 1997-1998 economic crisis upon suicide risk differed according to personality. Suicide risk increased among these with higher Neuroticism after the economic crisis, but this was not the case for other personality subscales.

AB The patterns of association between age and suicide rate vary by country, subpopulation and gender, and over time. To shed light on factors associated with these differences, we analysed suicide data from four populations, two 'Western' (Australia, the United States [US]) and two Asian (Japan and Hong Kong). We computed suicide rates in five-year age-groups (between 10 and 14 years and 85+ years) for men and women separately, and present graphical representations of the age patterns during selected five-year periods. Rates and age patterns differed markedly, as did gender patterns except in Hong Kong. In 1964-8, male suicide rates in Australia and US were represented by upward-sloping graphs, whereas in Japan the pattern was bimodal. By 1979-83, male patterns in Australia and US were bimodal, but Japan's was trimodal, including a middle-age peak reached in 1994-98. In contrast, female age patterns in the Western countries were shallowly convex or uniform, while in Hong Kong and Japan the upward-sloping graphs became, over time, less steep; by 2009-13, the pattern in Japan was uniform (flat). In recent decades, suicide rates of older men in Australia, US and Japan, and older women in Japan and Hong Kong, have fallen considerably. Suicide rates of men aged 45-64 in Australia and US also fell, though by 2009-13 the US rate had risen again. The suicide rate of Australian men in their twenties halved between 1994-98 and 2009-13, while rates for younger men and women in Japan have risen since 1994-98. In Hong Kong, suicide rates of young men have increased. Age patterns of suicide likely reflect period and cohort effects shaped by socioeconomic stressors, availability of health and welfare services, access to lethal methods of suicide, and other factors. Greater understanding of their impact on age patterns of suicide can result in potential preventive solutions.

AB Objective. Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for one-third of suicides worldwide, but few studies have investigated the national epidemiology of pesticide suicide in countries where it is a commonly used method. We investigated trends in pesticide suicide, and factors associated with such trends, in Taiwan, a rapidly developing East Asian country. Methods. We conducted an ecological study using graphical approaches and Spearman's correlation coefficients to examine trends in pesticide suicide (1987-2010) in Taiwan in relation to pesticide sales, bans on selected pesticides, the proportion of the workforce involved in agriculture and unemployment. We compared pesticide products banned by the Taiwanese government with products that remained on the market and pesticides that accounted for the most poisoning deaths in Taiwan. Results. Age-standardised rates of pesticide suicide showed a 67% reduction from 7.7 per 100,000 (42% of all suicides) in 1987 to 2.5 per 100,000 (12% of all suicides) in 2010, in contrast to a 69% increase in suicide rates by other methods. Pesticide poisoning was the most commonly used method of suicide in 1987 but had become the third most common method by 2010. The reduction was paralleled by a 66% fall in the workforce involved in agriculture but there was no strong evidence for its association with trends in pesticide sales, bans on selected pesticide products or unemployment. The bans mostly post-dated the decline in pesticide suicides; furthermore, they did not include products (e.g. paraquat) that accounted for most deaths and were mainly restricted to selected high-strength formulated products whilst their equivalent low-strength products were not banned. Conclusions. Access to pesticides, indicated by the size of agricultural workforce, appears to influence trends in pesticide suicide in Taiwan. Targeted bans on pesticides should focus on those products that account for most deaths.

AB Background: The prevalence of Korean adolescents with depression was 25.1% in 2017, and the suicide rate among Korean teens increased from 4.2 deaths per 100,000 in 2015 to 4.9 deaths per 100,000 in 2016, suggesting that a high prevalence of depression and suicide among adolescents is a serious social problem in South Korea. Owing to the rapid growth of e-cigarettes in the last several years, it is important for research on smoking and mental health to distinguish different uses of tobacco products. Objectives: To examine the relationship between depression and suicidality among Korean adolescents, classified into nonusers, conventional-cigarette-only users, e-cigarette-only users, and dual users. Methods: Data were examined from the 2017 Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey. The study included 62,276 students. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the association of depression and suicidality with electronic and conventional cigarette use. Results: There were significant differences among the users: dual users had a higher prevalence of depression and suicidality for both lifetime and current use; e-cigarette-only users had higher levels of depression and suicidality than nonusers; and among female adolescents, conventional-cigarette-only users, e-cigarette-only users, and dual users had a higher prevalence of depression and suicidality than male adolescents. Conclusions: This is the first study to assess the association of depression and suicidality with conventional and e-cigarette use using a nationally representative Korean adolescent sample. These findings suggest an urgent need for evaluation of and intervention for e-cigarette use by health professionals providing smoking cessation programs for adolescents.

AB Objective: To examine the association between the level of Internet addiction and suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in South Korean adolescents, focusing on the roles of family structure and household economic status.
   Methods: Data from 221 265 middle and high school students taken from the 2008-2010 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey were used in this study. To identify factors associated with suicidal ideation/attempts, multiple logistic regression analysis was performed. The level of Internet use was measured using the simplified Korean Internet Addiction Self-assessment Tool.
   Results: Compared with mild users of the Internet, high-risk users and potential-risk users were more likely to report suicidal ideation (nonuser, odds ratio [OR] 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05 to 1.15; potential risk, OR 1.49, 95% CI: 1.36 to 1.63; high risk OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.10) or attempts (nonuser, OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.42; potential risk, OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.38; high risk, OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.71 to 2.14). The nonuser group also had a slightly higher risk of suicidal ideation/ attempts compared with mild users. This association appeared to vary by perceived economic status and family structure.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that it is important to attend to adolescents who are at high risk for Internet addiction, especially when they do not have parents, have stepparents, or perceive their economic status as either very low or very high.

AB This study explored predictors of adolescent problem behavior utilizing panel data from the National Youth Policy Institute. Data were collected from June 2013 to August 2013 from 3195 middle school students living in 15 cities of South Korea. Data were analysed using hierarchical regression in two steps. The first step included gender and school record; the second step added emotional difficulty, parent-child relationship, peer relationships, self-esteem, materially oriented attitude, and appearance-oriented attitude. Results showed that male students had greater problem behaviors than female students. Greater emotional difficulties were associated with greater problem behaviors. On the other hand, a better parent-child relationship and better peer relationships were related to fewer problem behaviors. Notably, greater materially and appearance-oriented attitudes were related to greater problem behaviors. This study implies that excessively extrinsic values or attitudes should be discouraged to prevent teenager problem behavior.

AB Korea's Presidential Council on Nation Branding works hard to match the country's international image with the level of its economic clout. Despite the so-called "Han River Miracle," democratization, and cutting edge technology in several key industries, contemporary Korea seems to be in serious want of the wisdom that can give everlasting peace and joy to each of her citizens. In answer to this dramatic social situation, the development of a constructive Buddhist-Christian encounter in Korea could become a remarkable source of wisdom, not only for Koreans but also for mankind. To be sure, with Buddhists and Christians representing 42.95 and 55.1 percent respectively of the 53.8 percent of its citizens claiming a religion, Korea has the privilege of being uniquely situated for a meeting of the followers of Christianity and Buddhism. Yet in spite of these promising circumstances, this essay points to the existence of a huge gap between Buddhists and Christians in Korea-a state of affairs that has a negative impact on social life-and analyzes the reasons behind it. Against the backdrop of the Buddhist-Christian encounter, the Jogye Order's "2011 Asoka Declaration" to promote interreligious dialogue and social peace, and a Christian alternative community seeking to achieve the same goal at a grassroots level, represent prophetic initiatives to develop the wisdom needed to foster peace on the Korean peninsula and in Northeast Asia.

AB In light of escalating job insecurity due to increasing numbers of nonstandard workers, this study examined the association between nonstandard employment and mental health among South Korean workers. We analyzed a representative weighted sample of 2086 men and 1194 women aged 20-64 years, using data from the 1998 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Nonstandard employment included part-time work, temporary work, and daily work. Mental health was measured with indicators of self-reported depression and suicidal ideation. Based on age-adjusted prevalence of mental health, nonstandard employees were more likely to be mentally ill compared to standard employees. Furthermore, nonstandard work status was associated with poor mental health after adjusting for socioeconomic position (education, occupational class, and income) and health behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption, and exercise). However, the pattern of the relationship between nonstandard work and mental health differed by gender. Female gender was significantly associated with poor mental health. Although males tended to report more suicidal ideation, this difference was not statistically significant. Considering the increasing prevalence of nonstandard working conditions in South Korea, the results call for more longitudinal research on the mental health effects of nonstandard work.

AB This study aimed to investigate the sociodemographic and clinical correlates of a history of a suicide attempt in people with depression and their relationship with treatment outcomes and subsequent suicidal ideation and deliberate self-harm. Patients with depressive disorders according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, were recruited from 18 hospitals across South Korea. Data on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were obtained, and scales assessing depression, anxiety, and general functioning were administered during the first 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment. Baseline characteristics, responses to treatment, and suicidal ideation/deliberate self-harm during the follow-up period were compared according to a reported history or not of a suicide attempt. In a total of 723 participants, 143 (19.8%) with a history of a suicide attempt had an earlier age of onset, longer duration of illness, and a greater number of depressive episodes. Levels of depression and anxiety were significantly higher at baseline in this group who also experienced significantly lower remission and response rates, as well as longer time to remission. The case group was more likely to experience new suicidal ideation and carry out a deliberate self-harm act during the 12-week treatment period. In conclusion, a history of a suicide attempt in a Korean population with depression was characterized by more severe psychopathology, poorer treatment outcomes, and higher subsequent suicidal ideation and self-harm. Therefore, more intensive and longer-term treatment with particular ongoing clinical attention to risk is indicated in patients with these distinct, chronic, and severe forms of depression and ongoing high suicide risk.

AB Past urban research on Western nations tends to show high suicide rates in inner city and socioeconomically deprived areas. However, little is known about geographic variations in suicide in non-Western cities. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate smoothed standardised mortality ratios (2005-2010) for suicide in people aged 10 years or above in each geographic unit in Hong Kong at two levels, i.e. large street block (n = 1639; median population = 1860) and small tertiary planning unit group (n = 204; median population = 14,850). We further analysed their associations with a range of area socioeconomic characteristics and a deprivation index. The "city centre" of Hong Kong, a generally non-deprived area, showed mostly below average suicide rates. However, there were high rates concentrating in some socioeconomically deprived, densely populated areas, including some inner city areas, across the city. Males had greater geographic variations in rates than females, except the elderly group. The use of smaller geographic units revealed finer detailed suicide distribution than the use of larger units, and showed that suicide rates were associated with indicators of socioeconomic deprivation (population with non-professional jobs and low median household income), and social fragmentation (proportions of unmarried adults and divorced/separated adults), but not with Gini coefficient. Sex/age groups had different associations with suicide rates. Areas in the most deprived quintile had a suicide rate more than two times higher than the least deprived. The association between suicide and deprivation was stronger in males than females and more marked in the younger populations compared to the elderly. The spatial distribution of suicide in Hong Kong showed distinct patterning and a stronger association with income compared to findings from Western countries. Suicide prevention strategies should consider tackling the marked socioeconomic gradient in suicide and high risk in young and middle-aged males living in deprived areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Study Objectives: In comparison to other countries, the South Korean population has a short average sleep duration, and studies have suggested that insufficient sleep is a risk factor for suicidal behavior. This study aimed to examine the association of bedtime with suicidal ideation and with suicide planning, respectively, among Korean adolescents. Methods: This study included 48,218 participants from the 2017 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey. Participants were divided into three categories: pre-23:00 bedtime, 23:00-01:30 bedtime, and post-01:30 bedtime. Suicidal ideation and suicide planning were the main dependent variables, and multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the target association. Results: For both male and female respondents, compared to those who had a pre-23:00 bedtime, those whose bedtime was after 01:30 were more likely to have suicidal ideation (post-01:30 bedtime for men: OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.16-1.45; for women: OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.20-1.44). For suicide planning, the results were also significant for both genders (post-01:30 bedtime for men: OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.16-1.70; for women: OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.03-1.43). Odds of suicidal ideation were higher for those who had a post-01:30 bedtime on weekdays but not weekends. Conclusions: We found that, among adolescents, going to bed after 01:30 is significantly associated with suicidal ideation and suicide planning, after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related characteristics. Therefore, late bedtime should be the timepoint of a suicide intervention for adolescents, in order to prevent developing suicidal ideations and suicide planning.

AB Despite the wide recognition of the inverse association between socioeconomic position (SEP) and suicidal behaviors, its underlying process and potential mediators are little known. This study investigated the pathway from SEP to suicide attempts with attention to potential mediators.From the Korean Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2013, which is a nationwide cross-sectional survey of the health and nutritional status, a total of 34,565 participants (30 years) were included in the analysis. To unfold the pathways linking SEP to suicide attempts, the direct and indirect effects of 3 SEP measures (educational attainment, household income, and occupational group) and 3 mediators (physical illness, mental health problems, and problematic drinking) were differentiated using structured equation model (SEM).Most of direct and indirect effects of educational attainment, household income, and occupational group on suicide attempts were significant; Nonemployment status had the largest total (=0.291, P<.01) and direct effects (=0.212, P<.01), while educational attainment had the largest indirect effect (=-0.124, P<.01). Educational attainment was mainly mediated by physical illness and problem drinking, whereas household income and occupational group were mainly mediated by anxious or depressed mood and problem drinking. Physical illness played a major role in explaining suicide attempts, compared to mental health problem and problem drinking.Overall, experience of socioeconomic disadvantage increased suicide attempts independently of mental and physical problems. An extension of suicide prevention program is required for comprehensively targeting people with general problems such as physical illness and low SEP, complemented to narrowly targeting high risk group with, such as mental health problem.

AB Background Differences in life expectancy at birth across social classes can be more easily interpreted as a measure of absolute inequalities in survival. This study quantified age- and cause-specific contributions to life expectancy differences by income among 4 million public servants and their dependents in South Korea (9.1% of the total Korean population).
   Methods Using 9-year mortality follow-up data (208 612 deaths) on 4 055 150 men and women aged 0-94 years, with national health insurance premiums imposed proportionally based on monthly salary as a measure of income, differences in life expectancy at birth by income were estimated by age- and cause-specific mortality differences using Arriaga's decomposition method.
   Results Life expectancy at birth gradually increased with income. Differences in life expectancy at birth between the highest and the lowest income quartile were 6.22 years in men and 1.74 years in women. Mortality differentials by income among those aged epsilon 50 years contributed most substantially (80.4% in men and 85.6% in women) to the socio-economic differences in life expectancy at birth. In men, cancers (stomach, liver and lung), cardiovascular diseases (stroke), digestive diseases (liver cirrhosis) and external causes (transport accidents and suicide) were important contributors to the life expectancy differences. In women, the contribution of ill-defined causes was most important. Cardiovascular diseases (stroke and hypertensive disease) and external causes (transport accidents and suicide) also contributed to the life expectancy differences in women while the contributions of cancers and digestive diseases were minimal.
   Conclusions Reductions in socio-economic differentials in mortality from stroke and external causes (transport accidents and suicide) among middle-aged and older men and women would significantly contribute to equalizing life expectancy among income groups. Policy efforts to reduce mortality differentials in major cancers (stomach, liver and lung) and liver cirrhosis are also important for eliminating Korean men's socio-economic inequalities in life expectancy.

AB The study investigates the existing smart mental healthcare technologies and analyses the views of potential users in order to devise a comprehensive mental healthcare stepped-care model (CMHCSM) for managing individual preventive care or treatment. The development of various SmartMentalTech solutions may meet the growing demands in mental healthcare intervention and also overcome the limitations of traditional mental healthcare system regarding accessibility. South Korea and Japan have had a relatively high suicide rate and a rising prevalence of mental illness, with the prospect of using a category of products referred to as smart technologies in mental healthcare, hence SmartMentalTech. To investigate the application feasibility of a SmartMentalTech prototype for mental healthcare in South Korea and Japan, this comparative research examined various associated parameters. However, the rapid growth of mental healthcare technology may cause confusion among users regarding the best options to choose. To resolve this, a Health Psychological Approach was adopted and the comprehensive mental healthcare stepped-care model (CMHCSM) was applied. The findings of this study have thus classified 12 types of SmartMentalTech that have been applied to CMHCSM. In the choice of technology types, there were some differences between South Korean and Japanese users. The study concludes that SmartMentalTech should be promoted as an accompanying solution that is readily accessible for the users and describes the four steps of the stepped-care approach for comprehensive management. Further research in the form of an evidencebased analysis of the 12 types of smart technologies use in mental healthcare is recommended. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective The present study sought to identify inequalities in cause-specific mortality across different occupational groups in Korea.
   Methods The cohort included Korean workers enrolled in the national employment insurance programme between 1995 and 2000. Mortality was determined by matching death between 1995 and 2008 according to a nationwide registry of the Korea National Statistical Office. The cohort was divided into nine occupational groups according to the Korean Standard Occupational Classification (KSOC). Age-standardised mortality rates of each subcohort were calculated.
   Results The highest age-standardised mortality rate was identified in KSOC 6 (agricultural, forestry and fishery workers; male (M): 563.0 per 100 000, female (F): 206.0 per 100 000), followed by KSOC 9 (elementary occupations; M: 499.0, F: 163.4) and KSOC 8 (plant, machine operators and assemblers; M: 380.3, F: 157.8). The lowest rate occurred in KSOC 2 (professionals and related workers; M: 209.1, F: 93.3). Differences in mortality rates between KSOC 2 and KSOC 9 (M: 289.9, F: 70.1) and the rate ratio of KSCO9 to KSCO2 (M: 2.39, F: 1.75) were higher in men. The most prominent mortality rate difference was observed in external causes of death (M: 96.9, F: 21.6) and liver disease in men (38.3 per 100 000). Mental disease showed the highest rate ratio (M: 6.31, F: 13.00).
   Conclusions Substantial differences in mortality rates by occupation were identified. Main causes of death were injury, suicide and male liver disease. Development of policies to support occupations linked with a lower socioeconomic position should be prioritised.

AB Although the internet has become increasingly pervasive in our daily lives and interactions and has impacted existing social norms and ethics, very few studies have examined the relationship between the internet and ethics. In the face of increasing numbers of internet-related ethical violations, this lack of research constitutes a policy vacuum. This study investigates ethical controversies in cyberspace by examining actual events that occurred in South Korea, such as the "dog poop girl" incident, the suicide of a famous actress, a candlelight vigil against U.S. beef imports, and the arrest of a blogger named "Minerva." The study proposes a preliminary framework for evaluating ethical issues occurring on and via the internet, focusing on the agent's moral and legal responsibility and on internet regulation.

SO DEATH STUDIES

DT Article
ID HOPELESSNESS; BLACKS; WHITES
AB This study aimed to examine the validity of reasons for living (RFL) and the protective role they may play against suicidal ideation in college students in South Korea. A total of 277 undergraduate students participated by completing the College Student Reasons for Living Inventory (CS-RFL), along with measures of suicide risk including depression, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation. The five CS-RFL subscales displayed strong negative correlations with the three indicators of suicide risk. Hierarchical regression analysis results revealed significant main effects of Survival and Coping Beliefs and Moral Objections to Suicide on suicidal ideation after controlling for depression and hopelessness. Moreover, a general tendency toward lower levels of RFL, especially Moral Objections and Responsibility to Family and Friends, was observed compared to those reported in Asian American and European American students. Qualitative studies are needed to increase the validity of RFL inventories and verify whether the observed cultural differences, such as lower Moral Objections, are due to actual variance in underlying belief systems or mere systematic effects of the study variables or measurement bias. Overall, the strong relationship between RFL and suicidal ideation suggest that RFL may be an important factor in assessing suicide risk and devising preventive measures for Korean college students.

AB BackgroundPrevious studies have indicated that alcohol use disorder (AUD) and other psychiatric disorders increase the risk of suicide mortality. However, little research has investigated the concomitant effect of comorbid psychiatric disorders on suicide mortality. This study aimed to investigate the effect of comorbid AUD on suicide mortality of individuals with another psychiatric disorder using a national data sample.
   MethodsWe used the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort data from 2002 to 2013. We selected individuals with specific psychiatric disorders based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (F10-F48). Overall, the study included 741,601 participants. We utilized a prioritization process to identify the primary diagnosis for those with multiple diagnoses. All-cause mortality rates and suicide rates per 100,000 person-year (days) and the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) were calculated. Then, we compared the suicide-specific SMR of 3 different groups: (i) specific psychiatric disorder versus general public; (ii) specific psychiatric disorder comorbid with AUD versus general public; and (iii) specific psychiatric disorder comorbid with AUD versus specific psychiatric disorder without comorbid AUD.
   ResultsPatients with any specific psychiatric disorder showed higher suicide-specific SMR compared to the general population. Being comorbid with AUD further increased the risk of suicide among psychiatric patients. In particular, patients with bipolar affective disorders, organic mental disorders, or depressive disorders comorbid with AUD had about 2 to 4 times higher suicide-specific SMR compared to those without AUD (bipolar affective disorder: SMR=3.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.49, 4.54]; organic mental disorder: SMR=3.43, 95% CI [1.05, 5.81]; depressive disorder: SMR=2.06, 95% CI [1.52, 2.61]).
   ConclusionsOur data indicate that having a psychiatric disorder increases the risk of committing suicide. More importantly, comorbid AUD further increases this risk of suicidal death for certain psychiatric disorders. This shows the importance of determining whether patients with psychiatric disorders have comorbid AUD to prevent suicide.

AB This study investigated associations between the use of healthcare services and financial status and suicidal ideation (SI) in the past year among elderly people. Additionally, this study explored gender differences in such associations. Cross-sectional data of 1743 elderly people aged 65 years and above, who participated in the 2009 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, were analyzed. The results showed that lack of preventive care and failure to obtain necessary healthcare services during the last 12 months had a significant effect on SI, especially among elderly women. Low financial status (i.e., receipt of National Basic Livelihood Security (NBLS) assistance) was significantly associated with SI among elderly men. The findings of this study emphasize the need for community-based suicide intervention services, especially for elderly men who receive NBLS and elderly women who do not undergo medical checkups and fail to obtain necessary medical services. Multiple intervention approaches, including the provision of community-based geriatric psychiatric services, improved social support, links with general hospital services, and local monitoring programs, are likely to be useful.

ID RISK-FACTORS; SUICIDE; PREVALENCE
AB Objective The suicide rate in South Korea is very high and is expected to increase in coming years. Intoxication is the most common suicide attempt method as well as one of the common reason for presenting to an emergency medical center. We used decision tree modeling analysis to identify predictors of risk for suicide by intentional intoxication.
   Methods A single-center, retrospective study was conducted at our hospital using a 4-year registry of the institute from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016. Demographic factors, such as sex, age, intentionality, therapeutic adherence, alcohol consumption, smoking status, physical disease, cancer, psychiatric disease, and toxicological factors, such as type of intoxicant and poisoning severity score were collected. Candidate risk factors based on the decision tree were used to select variables for multiple logistic regression analysis.
   Results In total, 4,023 patients with intoxication were enrolled as study participants, with 2,247 (55.9%) identified as cases of intentional intoxication. Reported annual percentages of intentional intoxication among patients were 628/937 (67.0%), 608/1,082(56.2%), 536/1,017 (52.7), 475/987 (48.1%) from 2013 to 2016. Significant predictors identified based on decision tree analysis were alcohol consumption, old age, psychiatric disease, smoking, and male sex; those identified based on multiple regression analysis were alcohol consumption, smoking, male sex, psychiatric disease, old age, poor therapeutic adherence, and physical disease.
   Conclusion We identified important predictors of suicide risk by intentional intoxication. A specific and realistic approach to analysis using the decision tree modeling technique is an effective method to determine those groups at risk of suicide by intentional intoxication.

AB Background: Despite advances in our understanding of the countercyclical association between economic contraction and suicide, less is known about the levels of and changes in inequalities in suicide. The authors examined social and geographical inequalities in suicide in Japan from 1975 through 2005.
   Methods: Based on quinquennial vital statistics and census data, the authors analyzed the entire population aged 25-64 years. The total number of suicides was 75,840 men and 30,487 women. For each sex, the authors estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% credible intervals (CIs) for suicide using multilevel logistic regression models with "cells'' (cross-tabulated by age and occupation) at level 1, seven different years at level 2, and 47 prefectures at level 3. Prefecture-level variance was used as an estimate of geographical inequalities in suicide.
   Results: Adjusting for age and time-trends, the lowest odds for suicide was observed among production process and related workers (the reference group) in both sexes. The highest OR for men was 2.52 (95% CI: 2.43, 2.61) among service workers, whereas the highest OR for women was 9.24 (95% CI: 7.03, 12.13) among security workers. The degree of occupational inequalities increased among men with a striking change in the pattern. Among women, we observed a steady decline in suicide risk across all occupations, except for administrative and managerial workers and transport and communication workers. After adjusting for individual age, occupation, and time-trends, prefecture-specific ORs ranged from 0.76 (Nara Prefecture) to 1.36 (Akita Prefecture) for men and from 0.79 (Kanagawa Prefecture) to 1.22 (Akita Prefecture) for women. Geographical inequalities have increased primarily among men since 1995.
   Conclusions: The present findings demonstrate a striking temporal change in the pattern of social inequalities in suicide among men. Further, geographical inequalities in suicide have considerably increased across 47 prefectures, primarily among men, since 1995.

AB Introduction We investigated the effect of unmet medical need on the mental health of Republic of Korea (ROK) Armed Forces personnel, as most of the service members work in remote areas and often experience such unmet needs.
   Methods This study used secondary data from the 2014 Military Health Survey (MHS), conducted by the ROK School of Military Medicine and designed to collect military health determinants. Descriptive statistics showed the general characteristics of the study populations by variable. We specifically compared the population after stratifying participants by suicide ideation. An analysis of variance was also carried out to compare Kessler Psychological Distress Scale 10 Scores. Additionally, dependent spouses and children of both active-duty service members and retirees are included among those entitled to Military Health System healthcare.
   Results Among the 4967 military personnel, 681 (13.7%) individuals reported an experience of unmet medical need within the past 12 months and gave reasons of 'no time (5.15%)', 'long office wait (2.6%)', 'no money (0.22%)', 'long distance from base (1.19%)', 'illness but not very serious (1.65%)', 'mistrust in doctors (1.95%)' and 'pressure due to performance appraisal (0.95%)'. Regression analysis revealed that unmet medical need was significantly associated with negative mental health (beta=1.753, p < 0.0001) and increased suicide ideation (OR=2.649, 95% CI 1.84 to 3.82). Also, soldiers reporting unmet medical need due to 'no money', 'no time' or 'pressure due to performance appraisal' were significantly more likely to experience similar negative mental health effects.
   Conclusions Our study indicates that unmet medical need is significantly associated with soldiers' mental health decline and suicide ideation, highlighting the importance of providing military personnel with timely, affordable and sufficient medical care.

AB We examine the association between ties to delinquent friends and suicidal ideation among adolescents, and whether this association varies across neighborhoods. We analyze two waves of data from the Korean Youth Panel Survey, which comprise nationally representative samples of high school students in South Korea, a country with the highest suicide rate in the developed world. Results from hierarchical linear models show that, net of individual and contextual-level predictors, connections to delinquent peers significantly raise the odds of adolescent suicidality. We also find this relationship to be stronger in more affluent and better-quality neighborhoods. We draw on the concept of the "black sheep effect" to discuss the implications of these findings.

AB What does the human look like in South Korea? This article identifies two different figurations of the human in contemporary South Korea: the alpha human and the Korean. The alpha human is a human imagined, shaped, and circulated on the network of technosciences and media; it is embraced by technoscientific researchers, entrepreneurs, policy makers, and journalists. The alpha human's defining characteristic is the extended longevity, or even immortality, made possible by the developments in biomedicine, artificial intelligence, and robotics. On the other hand, the figure of the Korean is imagined to be going through a crisis of survival, as it is excluded or displaced from technoscientific as well as socioeconomic networks. It is represented by the indexes of fertility, inequality, and suicide, as well as reports of lived experiences of Koreans across generations. What does it mean to craft such a futuristic figure, or even a fantasy, of the immortally networked alpha human when the Korean is figured as experiencing dispossession and disparity? This article suggests that the alpha human is a decontextualized figure that can propose only technofuturistic escape but no vision for collective action.

AB This study investigated the factors associated with suicidal ideation among 174 North Korean refugees (aged 13-27 years) residing in South Korea. Specifically, we compared sociodemographic, familial, social, and psychological characteristics between participants with and without suicidal ideation. Twenty-nine refugees (16.7%) had exhibited suicidal ideation in the past 12 months. These refugees had significantly lower levels of familial cohesion (U = 1459.0; p < 0.001), self-esteem (U = 1032.0; p < 0.001), and resilience (U = 1190.0; p < 0.001), as well as higher levels of expressional suppression (U = 1202.5; p < 0.001) and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (U = 1303.0; p = 0.001), (with Cohen's d > 0.5), compared to those without suicidal ideation. A multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the level of emotional suppression and familial cohesion were significantly associated with suicidal ideation, after controlling for the other variables. Familial and individual interventions, particularly those focused on encouraging emotional expression and familial cohesion, will be useful for North Korean refugee youth, who have a high risk of suicide.

AB Background This study aimed to examine whether the socioeconomic context of urban areas affects differences in adult mortality from injuries in the districts of all seven South Korean metropolitan cities, after adjusting for individual demographic and socioeconomic indicators.
   Methods Two different sets of data were used in this study: (1) the National Death Registration data from 2003 to 2008; and (2) the National Census in 2005. Variables for individual characteristics were gender, age, residential area and educational level. A geographic deprivation index was calculated based on the Carstairs Index. Multilevel Poisson regression models were used to analyse the relationship between area deprivation levels and injury mortality.
   Results Greater mortality risks of traffic accidents, falls, suicide and all injuries were found in the elderly, the less educated and men, compared with their counterparts. The most deprived districts were at greater risks of death due to traffic accidents (risk ratio (RR)= 1.34; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.73), falls (RR= 1.63; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.20), suicide (RR= 1.09; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.17) and all injuries (RR= 1.14; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.22) compared with the least deprived districts, even after individual level socioeconomic variables were controlled for. However, area level deprivation did not show cross level interactions with the individual level education in estimating fatal injury risks.
   Conclusions Both contextual and compositional effects of socioeconomic status on injury mortality among urban areas in South Korea should be considered in allocating resources for injury prevention.

AB Objective Despite the increasing number of North Korean defectors, research on their mental health conditions and suicidal thoughts and behaviors has not been conducted systematically. We examined the prevalence and risk factors of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in North Korean defectors.
   Methods This study focused on 300 North Korean defectors recruited from regional resettlement centers in South Korea, In-person interviews based on the North Korean version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview were conducted to diagnose mental disorders and assess suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between suicidal thoughts and behaviors and socio-demographic variables, and DSM-IV mental disorders.
   Results Lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts were 28,3,13,3, and 17,3%, respectively. Female sex (OR; 2,0,95% Cl; l.0-3.9), presence of health problems in the past year (2.6, 95% Cl: 1.4-4.6), and absence of both South Korean acquaintances (1,9, 95% Cl: 1.0-3.4) and North Korean family (1.7, 95% Cl: 1.0-2.9) were associated with higher odds of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, after adjusting for participant age, sex, and education. Presence of a mental disorder was associated with a significantly increased odd of suicide ideation, plan, and attempt. Of all mental disorder categories, agoraphobia had the strongest association with suicidal ideation (6.5,95% CI: 2.0-21.6), plans (7.7, 95% CI: 2.5-23.2) and attempts (12.0,95% Cl: 3.5-40.8),
   Conclusion Suicidal thoughts and behaviors among North Korean defectors are higher than the general population in South Korea, especially show high rates in transit countries. Further study should focus on the changes in suicidal thoughts and behaviors according to the settlement process and early prevention.

AB Background As with previous economic downturns, there has been debate about an association between the 2008 economic crisis, rising unemployment, and suicide. Unemployment directly affects individuals' health and, unsurprisingly, studies have proposed an association between unemployment and suicide. However, a statistical model examining the relationship between unemployment and suicide by considering specific time trends among age-sex-country subgroups over wider world regions is still lacking. We aimed to enhance knowledge of the specific effect of unemployment on suicide by analysing global public data classified according to world regions.
   Methods We retrospectively analysed public data for suicide, population, and economy from the WHO mortality database and the International Monetary Fund's world economic outlook database from 2000 to 2011. We selected 63 countries based on sample size and completeness of the respective data and extracted the information about four age groups and sex. To check stability of findings, we conducted an overall random coefficient model including all study countries and four additional models, each covering a different world region.
   Findings Despite differences in the four world regions, the overall model, adjusted for the unemployment rate, showed that the annual relative risk of suicide decreased by 1.1% (95% CI 0.8-1.4) per year between 2000 and 2011. The best and most stable final model indicated that a higher suicide rate preceded a rise in unemployment (lagged by 6 months) and that the effect was non-linear with higher effects for lower baseline unemployment rates. In all world regions, the relative risk of suicide associated with unemployment was elevated by about 20-30% during the study period. Overall, 41 148 (95% CI 39 552-42 744) suicides were associated with unemployment in 2007 and 46 131 (44 292-47 970) in 2009, indicating 4983 excess suicides since the economic crisis in 2008.
   Interpretation Suicides associated with unemployment totalled a nine-fold higher number of deaths than excess suicides attributed to the most recent economic crisis. Prevention strategies focused on the unemployed and on employment and its conditions are necessary not only in difficult times but also in times of stable economy.

AB Objectives: This study examines how living arrangements are associated with suicidal ideation for older adults in South Korea, which has the highest suicide rate among OECD countries, and a particularly high suicide rate for older persons.Methods: Analyzing a sample of 5795 women and 3758 men aged 65 and older from a nationwide representative cross-sectional data-set, we examined how many older adults think about suicide over a one-year period, why they think about suicide, and whether living arrangements are associated with suicidal ideation.Results: About 1 out of 12 respondents in our sample reported suicidal ideation. While women and men did not differ in the prevalence of suicidal ideation, women attributed their suicidal feelings to health problems, while men attributed theirs to economic difficulties. Logistic regression results indicated that living arrangements are associated with suicidal ideation for men but not women. Older men living with a spouse were less likely to have suicidal ideation than older men with other living arrangements (i.e., living alone, living with children without spouse, living with spouse, and others).Conclusions: Our results highlight the importance of living arrangements to older men's suicidal ideation. We discuss gender differences in the implications of living arrangements to suicidal ideation within the context of Confucian culture.

AB Background: Paraquat is associated with a high rate of fatalities in acute poisoning. This study aimed to examine the association between the national public health policy that banned the use of paraquat and the incidence of pesticide-associated mortality.
   Methods: All external causes of death from 2009 to 2013 of Korea were analyzed. The intervention was a national public health policy that annulled the authorized use (2011) and banned the purchase of paraquat (2012). Two periods were compared as follows: before (2009-2010) and after (2012-2013) the intervention period. The main outcome was pesticide-associated death coded on the death certificate. Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjustment for gender, age, season and weekday of death, province, education level, marital status, and occupation was performed to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for pesticide-associated mortality. The effect sizes of the intervention across all intents (Accident, Suicide, Homicide, and Undetermined) were compared by adding an interaction term (intervention*intent group) to the above model.
   Results: A total of 127,866 deaths from for all external causes were analyzed, including 65,538 from 2009 to 2010 and 62,373 from 2012 to 2013. Pesticide-associated mortality decreased from 9.7% (2009-2010) to 6.5% (2012-2013) (p < 0.001). The AOR (95% CI) of the intervention on pesticide-associated mortality was 0.59 (0.56-0.62). The AORs of the intervention according to intent were 0.72 (0.55-0.96) in the Accident group, 0.61 (0.58-0.64) in the Suicide group, 1.29 (0.43-3.87) in the Homicide group, and 0.44 (0.38-0.50) in the Undetermined group.
   Conclusion: The national public health policy that banned paraquat resulted in a significant decrease in pesticide-associated mortality.

AB Objective: This is a cross-sectional study using a free depression and suicide screening smartphone application, which contains the data from the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) and a Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R).
   Method: The free application was downloaded worldwide from Apple's App Store and Android Market, and the participants who downloaded the application were actively measured.
   Results: The subjects totaled 208,683 men and women. 72.6% of the subjects were females, and 81.4% of the subjects were aged between 10 and 29 years. In total, 25.7% of the participants were recorded CES-D positive, and there were differences among the groups based on sex (X-2 = 1065.82, p < 0.001), age (X-2 = 1420.75, p < 0.001), and psychiatric history (X-2 = 1502.21, p < 0.001). The highest score of CES-D, 40.69 +/- 15.79 and that of SBQ-R, 13.68 +/- 4.97 was reported by the participants with a history of schizophrenia. The characteristics associated with suicide were as follows: depression (OR 8.92, 95% CI: 8.71-9.13), female (OR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.36-1.43), 30-49 age group (OR 2.51, 95% CI: 2.29-2.72), 50 or older age group (OR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.35-1.61), and psychiatric history (OR 1.98, 95% CI: 1.89-2.06).
   Conclusion: The smartphone application may be a useful tool for screening depression and suicide. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID COLLECTIVE MEMORY
AB This article examines how Roh Moo Hyun, the 16th President of South Korea, was remembered during the several months following his suicide in May 2009. For this purpose, the article focuses on major commemorative texts about Roh published during this period and identifies three recurring themes in the emerging commemorative narrative about him: (1) a defiant dreamer who aspired to build a good society, (2) a nonmainstream politician who challenged the status quo and therefore was destroyed, and (3) a democratic president of common people. Building upon sociological approaches to collective memory, this article situates these themes in the larger sociopolitical context of contemporary Korea and argues that the living memory of Roh helps us understand the role of collective memory in promoting group cohesion, the deeply political nature of memory, and the importance of cultural symbols to the interactive process of constructing the commemorative narrative.

AB Although previous studies have suggested that childhood trauma and parental death are strongly associated with suicidality in adulthood, it is still unclear how these factors interact within the same population. A total of 1396 adults were recruited through nationwide multistage probability sampling in South Korea. Subjects were evaluated through face-to-face interviews using the Suicidality Module of the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview and the Early Trauma Inventory Self Report-Short Form. Among the 1396 adults, the group that experienced both childhood trauma and parental death had the highest current suicidality risks (F = 12.16, p < 0.0001) and lifetime suicide attempt ((2) = 35.81, p < 0.0001) compared with the other groups, which were only childhood trauma, only parental death, and neither. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that middle-to-high current suicidality risk and lifetime suicide attempt were significantly associated with concurrent childhood trauma and parental death (odds ratio, 3.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.99-6.65) as well as with only childhood trauma (odds ratio, 1.95; 95% confidence interval, 1.33-2.87), after adjusting for age, sex, education, marital status, household monthly income, and living area. Emotional abuse was the only type of childhood trauma significantly associated with higher current suicidality scores in those who experienced childhood parental death than in those who did not (F = 3.26, p = 0.041). Current suicidality risk and lifetime suicide attempt are associated with experiencing both parental death and trauma, especially emotional abuse, in childhood, whereas experiencing only childhood parental death is associated with neither.

AB Background: This study aimed to estimate the burden of acute pesticide poisoning and to determine its trend with recently implemented pesticide regulations
   Methods: Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs) due to acute pesticide poisoning using the methods of the Global Burden ofDisease Study 2013. The values of YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs were stratified by sex, age groups, intentionality of poisoning, and causative agents.
   Results: From 2006 to 2014, DALYs decreased by 69% (from 69,550 to 21,742). The decreasing tendency ofDALYs was especially marked from 2011. The total burden of acute pesticide poisoning was mainly caused by YLLs and intentional pesticide poisoning. The highest DALYs due to acute pesticide poisoning occurred m those in their 40s and 50s; however, the decreased rates of DALYs were higher in those aged 10-49 years than m those aged more than 50 years. Herbicides including paraquat contributed to the largest proportion of total DALYs.
   Conclusion: As this is the first study to quantify the burden of acute pesticide poisoning using DALYs, our results provide comprehensive evidence of the importance of using strict regulations to prevent public health hazards due to acute pesticide poisoning.

AB Background: Death by suicide is a preventable public health concern worldwide. The aim of this study is to investigate the probability of suicide death using baseline characteristics and simple medical facility visit history data using Cox regression, support vector machines (SVMs), and deep neural networks (DNNs).
   Method: This study included 819,951 subjects in the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS)-Cohort Sample Database from 2004 to 2013. The dataset was divided randomly into two independent training and validation groups. To improve the performance of predicting suicide death, we applied SVM and DNN to the same training set as the Cox regression model.
   Results: Among the study population, 2546 people died by intentional self-harm during the follow-up time. Sex, age, type of insurance, household income, disability, and medical records of eight ICD-10 codes (including mental and behavioural disorders) were selected by a Cox regression model with backward stepwise elimination. The area of under the curve (AUC) of Cox regression (0.688), SVM (0.687), and DNN (0.683) were approximately the same. The group with top .5% of predicted probability had hazard ratio of 26.21 compared to that with the lowest 10% of predicted probability.
   Limitations: This study is limited by the lack of information on suicidal ideation and attempts, other potential covariates such as information of medication and subcategory ICD-10 codes. Moreover, predictors from the prior 12-24 months of the date of death could be expected to show better performances than predictors from up to 10 years ago.
   Conclusions: We suggest a 10-year probability prediction model for suicide death using general characteristics and simple insurance data, which are annually conducted by the Korean government. Suicide death prevention might be enhanced by our prediction model.

AB Suicide is a major public health problem. Previous studies have reported a significant association between acute exposure to air pollution and suicide; little attention has been paid to the long-term effects of air pollution on risk of suicide. We investigated whether long-term exposure to particulate matter of <= 10 mu m in diameter (PMio), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) would be associated with a greater risk of death by suicide. The study sample comprised 265,749 adults enrolled in the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (2002-2013) in South Korea. Suicide death was defined as per ICD-10 code. Data on air pollution exposure used nationwide monitoring data, and individual exposure levels were assigned using geographic information systems. Air pollution exposure was categorized as the interquartile range (IQR) and quartiles. Hazards ratios (HRs) were calculated for the occurrence of suicide death after adjusting for potential covariates. During the study period, 564 (0.2%) subjects died from suicide. Increases in IQR pollutants (7.5 mu g/m(3) for PM10, 11.8 ppb for NO2, and 0.8 ppb for SO2) significantly increased HR for suicide death [PM10: HR 3.09 (95% CI: 2.63-3.63); NO2: HR = 1.33 (95% CI: 1.09-1.64); and SO2: HR = 1.15 (95% CI: 1.07-124)]. Compared with the lowest level of air pollutants (Quartile 1), the risk of suicide significantly increased in the highest quartile level (Quartile 4) for PM10 (HR = 4.03; 95% CI: 2.97-5.47) and SO2 (HR 1.65; 95% CI: 1.29-2.11) and in the third quartile for NO2 (HR = 1.52; 95% CI: 1.17-1.96). HRs for subjects with a physical or mental disorder were higher than that those for subjects without the disorder. Subjects living in metropolitan areas were more vulnerable to long-term PK10 exposure than those living in non-metropolitan areas. Long-term exposure to air pollution was associated with a significantly increased risk of suicide death. People having underlying diseases or living in metropolitan areas may be more susceptible to high air pollution exposure. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the associations between negative life events, social support, depressive and hostile symptoms, and suicide risk according to gender in multinational Asian patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). A total of 547 outpatients with MDD (352 women and 195 men, mean age of 39.58 +/- 13.21 years) were recruited in China, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Taiwan. All patients were assessed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the Symptoms Checklist 90-Revised, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and the List of Threatening Experiences. Negative life events, social support, depressive symptoms, and hostility were all significantly associated with suicidality in female MDD patients. However, only depressive symptoms and hostility were significantly associated with suicidality in male patients. Depression severity and hostility only partially mediated the association of negative life events and poor social support with suicidality in female patients. In contrast, hostility fully mediated the association of negative life events and poor social support with suicidality in male patients. Our results highlight the need of in-depth assessment of suicide risk for depressed female patients who report a number of negative life events and poor social supports, even if they do not show severe psychopathology.

TI Air Pollution and Suicide in 10 Cities in Northeast Asia: A
   Time-Stratified Case-Crossover Analysis
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
LA English
DT Article
ID TEMPERATURE; EXPOSURE; RISK
AB BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence suggesting an association between air pollution and suicide. However, previous findings varied depending on the type of air pollutant and study location.
   OBJECTIVES: We examined the association between air pollutants and suicide in 10 large cities in South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan.
   METHODS: We used a two-stage meta-analysis. First, we conducted a time-stratified case-crossover analysis to estimate the short-term association between nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter [aerodynamic diameter <= 10 mu m (PM10), aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), and PM10-2.5] and suicide, adjusted for weather factors, day-of-week, long-term time trends, and season. Then, we conducted a meta-analysis to combine the city-specific effect estimates for NO2, SO2, and PM10 across 10 cities and for PM2.5 and PM10-2.5 across 3 cities. We first fitted single-pollutant models, followed by two-pollutant models to examine the robustness of the associations.
   RESULTS: Higher risk of suicide was associated with higher levels of NO2, SO2, PM10, and PM10-2.5 over multiple days. The combined relative risks (RRs) were 1.019 for NO2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.999, 1.039), 1.020 for SO2 (95% CI: 1.005, 1.036), 1.016 for PM10 (95% CI: 1.004, 1.029), and 1.019 for PM10-2.5 (95% CI: 1.005, 1.033) per interquartile range (IQR) increase in the 0-1 d average level of each pollutant. We found no evidence of an association for PM2.5. Some of the associations, particularly for SO2 and NO2, were attenuated after adjusting for a second pollutant.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that higher levels of air pollution may be associated with suicide, and further research is merited to understand the underlying mechanisms.

AB Background: A growing body of research evidence from countries around the world indicates that economic recession is associated with increases in suicide, particularly in males of working age.
   Aims: To explore contributory and ameliorating factors associated with economic recession and suicide and thereby stimulate further research in this area and encourage policy makers to consider how best to reduce the impact of recession on mental health and suicidal behaviour.
   Method: We conducted a selective review of the worldwide literature focusing on possible risk factors, mechanisms and preventative strategies for suicidal behaviour linked to economic recession.
   Results: A model of how recession might affect suicide rates is presented. A major and often prolonged effect of recession is on unemployment and job insecurity. Other important effects include those exerted by financial loss, bankruptcy and home repossession. It is proposed these factors may lead directly or indirectly to mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and binge drinking and then to suicidal behaviour. Countries with active labour market programmes and sustained welfare spending during recessions have less marked increases in suicide rates than those that cut spending on welfare and job-search initiatives for the unemployed. Other measures likely to help include targeted interventions for unemployed people, membership of social organisations and responsible media reporting. Good primary care and mental health services are needed to cope with increased demand in times of economic recession but some governments have in fact reduced healthcare spending as an austerity measure.
   Conclusion: The research evidence linking recession, unemployment and suicide is substantial, but the evidence for the other mechanisms we have investigated is much more tentative. We describe the limitations of the existing body of research as well as make suggestions for future research into the effects of economic recession on suicidal behaviour.

AB In this article, I observe the way Bongha, a small town of South Korea, constructs the tourist experience, using continually maintained silence regarding certain aspects of the past. The town became famous after the former president Moo-hyun Roh committed a politically controversial suicide in 2009. Then Bongha serves as memory-dispositif, putting forward memory aids for Roh that are chosen to highlight his life selectively. Visitors participate in this covert silence by coordinating their behavior into unscripted, but noticeable norms. Touring Bongha brings one into an encounter with mediated memory, and the mourners atone and engage in a pilgrimage to this remote site, full of pregiven memories of Roh, which caused them a sense of indebtedness.

AB This study explores the trajectory of suicidal ideation in childhood and adolescence and identifies its strong predictors. Secondary data obtained from two nationally representative cohorts of South Korean youth were longitudinally analyzed using frequencies, percentages, and discrete time survival analysis. This study revealed an increase in the occurrence of suicidal ideation in adolescence, a higher prevalence of suicidal ideation among females than among males, and differences in predictors of suicide ideation by developmental stages and gender. The results suggest that multifaceted factors specific to developmental stages and gender should be simultaneously considered to diminish the occurrences of suicidal ideation.

AB Background: Injury is a major public health problem and accounts for 10% of the global burden of disease. This study intends to present the temporal trend in the injury burden in Korea and to compare the burden size by injury mechanism and age group.
   Methods: This study was a nationwide population-based observational study. We used two data sets, the death certificates statistics and the Korean National Hospital Discharge Survey data (2004-2012). We calculated age-standardized disability-adjusted life year (DALY) from years of life lost (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD) and trend analysis.
   Results: The DALYs of road injury decreased (P=0.002), falls did not exhibit a trend (P=0.108), and self-harm increased overall (P=0.045). In the road injury, the YLLs decreased across all 4 age groups (0-44,15-49, 50-79, >= 80) and the YLDs decreased in the 0-14-year-old group. In total, the DALYs of road injuries decreased in the 0-14-year-old group. In the fall injury, although the YLLs decreased in the over 80-year-old group, the YLDs increased in the 50-79-year-old group and the over 80-year-old group. The burden of self-harm injury was high in the age group 15 years and over, especially in the 15-49-year-old group.
   Conclusion: The leading causes of the injury burden were road injuries, falls, and self-harm. The burden of road injury and self-harm have recently shown a gradual decreasing tendency. On the other hands, that of fall injuries are continually high in the age group over 50 years of age.

AB Background: Suicide among adults in the Korean population merits study to improve the understanding of the salient risk and protective factors because suicide rates in Korea have increased dramatically over the past 20 years. However, the association between social participation and suicidal ideation is poorly understood. Thus, this study aimed to identify the components of social participation in Korean society and to examine the processes through which the components of social participation influence the degree of suicidal ideation people experience across age groups.
   Methods: This study used survey data from the 2010 Seoul Welfare Panel Study. The sample population was restricted to adults aged 20 or older and was categorised into three groups by respondents' ages. The groups were defined as 'young adults' (aged 20- 39), 'middle-aged adults' (aged 40-64) and 'the elderly' (age 65 or more). Three dimensions of social participation were identified by factor analysis - friendship network and hobby group, religious involvement, and instrumental social participation.
   Results: In the young adult group, only instrumental participation was statistically significant (-0.10, p = 0.06). In the 'middle-aged adult group, only friendship network and hobby group had a strong association with suicidal ideation (-0.11, p = 0.01). Interestingly, for the elderly, religious involvement was related to suicidal ideation, but in a positive way (0.26, p = 0.02).
   Conclusion: The study results supported the theory that different components of social participation are associated with a lower risk of suicidal ideation in different stages of adulthood.

AB Background: The mental health of the offspring of immigrants is a major public health concern. In this study, we examined associations of multicultural status and parental country of birth with adolescent mental health in South Korea, and assessed the effect of socioeconomic position (SEP) on these associations.
   Methods: We used four waves of the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBS) between 2011 and 2014, including 294,324 participants (149,219 boys and 145,105 girls aged 13-18 years) as study subjects. KYRBS is a cross-sectional survey conducted annually by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The participants in the KYRBS were drawn as stratified multistage clustered samples from Korean middle schools and high schools. We calculated the age-adjusted 12-month prevalence of depressive mood and suicidal behaviors by parental country of birth, and estimated the effects of SEP indicators on the relationship.
   Results: The age-standardized prevalence of suicidality (suicide ideation, plans, and attempts) was significantly different between multicultural and non-multicultural boys. The impact of multicultural status on mental health varied with parental foreign-born status and maternal country of birth. Compared with non-multicultural counterparts, boys with Japan-born mothers showed lower prevalence ratios (PRs) of suicidal plans (PR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.16-0.70). Girls with Japan-born mothers also showed lower PRs of depressive mood (PR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.63-0.95) and suicidal ideation (PR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.41-0.83), while adolescents with Korean-Chinese mothers showed similar PRs. Boys with foreign-born fathers as well as boys with two foreign-born parents were at a greater risk of suicidality than non-multicultural boys. The magnitude of the relationship between multicultural status and mental health outcomes was generally attenuated after adjusting for SEP indicators.
   Conclusions: In general, adolescents with Japan-born mothers showed lower PRs of depressive mood and suicidality than non-multicultural adolescents, while those with Korean-Chinese mothers showed similar PRs. Boys who had foreign-born fathers generally showed greater PRs of depressive mood and suicidality than non-multicultural boys. To ensure the effective implementation of policies to reduce mental health problems among multicultural adolescents in South Korea, detailed information should be considered regarding the cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds of families, such as parental country of birth and SEP.

DE Jeju April 3 incident; Survivors; Suicidal ideation; Suicide attempt
ID CES-D SCALE; DEPRESSION; PREVALENCE; IDEATION
AB Background: The Jeju April 3 incident refer to a series of armed uprisings and counterinsurgency that occurred between 1948 and 1954 on Jeju Island, South Korea. These events resulted not only in an estimated 15,000-30,000 deaths but also in numerous casualties and the destruction of many villages on the island. We investigated the relationship between lifetime suicidal attempts, current suicidal risk, and exposure to the traumatic experiences associated with the Jeju April 3 incident.
   Methods: The present study assessed the lifetime suicidal behaviors of 110 aging survivors of the Jeju April 3 incident and 492 community-dwelling older adults who had not personally experienced this incident. Participants completed a questionnaire gathering demographic information and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) items on suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and suicide attempts. To obtain information regarding depressive symptoms, we administered the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D).
   Results: The prevalence rate for suicidal ideation within the past month in survivors was 42.7%, 95% CI [33.88, 52.07], and that in the comparison group was 15.4%, 95% CI [12.53, 18.91]. The survivor group reported higher rates of lifetime suicide attempts (8.2%, 95% CI [4.36, 14.82]) than the comparison group (2.0%, 95% CI [1.11, 3.70]).
   Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of the study design limits the interpretation of results.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that the psychological consequences of the Jeju April 3 incident, which occurred almost 70 years ago, may be long lasting. Our data can also contribute to interventions designed to prevent the development of serious psychological sequelae following traumatic events.

AB Background: Self-immolation (SI) is considered one of the most painful, dramatic, and at the same time most inexplicable methods of suicide, with a high social impact. Prevalence rates are particularly high in Iran, and in north-western Iran specifically. Here, we report sociodemographic, psychological, and psychiatric characteristics of patients attempting self-immolation (PSIs), compared to patients with accident burns (PABs). Method: Patients referred to the Burns Emergency Unit of the Besat Hospital (Hamadan, Iran) were enrolled in the present study between winter 2015 and summer 2016. After burn-related treatments and surgery, a thorough interview was undertaken covering sociodemographic characteristics, burn-related information, and psychiatric background. Results: A total of 79 patients were enrolled. Among these, 19 (31.7%) had attempted suicide via SI. Compared to the PABs, the PS's were predominantly females; they reported family and marital problems as the main triggers for SI. The psychiatric interviews indi- cated that PSIS often suffered from major depressive disorders, adjustment disorders, and bipolar disorders. The prevailing feelings reported were guilt and shame. A binary logistic regression showed that feelings of guilt and marital and family problems predicted SI. Conclusions: The prevalence of SI was surprisingly high. Marital and family conflicts as a proxy for highly distressing social interactions, along with female gender and feelings of guilt and shame were strongly associated with SI. Family and couple counseling specifically tailored to difficulties experienced by women might reduce the risk of SI. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Objective In South Korea, the number of deaths from suicide has increased in the last two decades, and suicide has become both a social and political problem. In this study, after controlling the variables influencing suicidal ideation, it was expected that it would be determined if anxiety symptoms are independently related to suicidal ideation.
   Methods Data were obtained from 327 psychiatric outpatients accomplished a self-reported questionnaire that included sociodemo-graphic characteristics and clinical variables as well as self-rating scales for measuring the severity of one's anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. Logistic-regression analyses were used to determine the correlation between anxiety symptoms and significant suicidal ideation, adjusting for covariates.
   Results The patients with significant suicidal ideation were shown to be less educated, unemployed, never married, divorced, or separated by death, or living alone, and were shown to have a lower income, a drinking habit, a higher number of past suicide attempts, and more family members who committed suicide, than the patients without significant suicidal ideation. After adjusting the covariates influencing significant suicidal ideation, anxiety symptoms were associated with significant suicidal ideation. However, after adjusting for depressive symptoms, only the trait anxiety was associated with significant suicidal ideation.
   Conclusion These findings suggest that anxiety symptoms are an independent risk factor for suicidal ideation. Clinicians may thus use anxiety symptoms for the screening examination when evaluating suicidal ideation and risk, and will have to actively evaluate and treat the anxiety symptoms of patients with suicidal tendencies.

AB Objective: The current study examined the prevalence and associated factors of suicidality among Korean cancer patients. Moreover, the association of multiple psychological morbidities with suicidality was investigated among cancer patients. Methods: A cross-sectional, multi-center survey of 400 cancer patients was administered in five cancer-treatment hospitals throughout South Korea. Study variables were assessed using standardized measures including the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview suicidality module, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Results: 20.1% (80/399) of patients were positive cases of suicidality. Having no religion (p = .010), poor performance status (p = .000), and psychological comorbidity (p = .021) were significantly associated with the experience of suicidality in the multivariate analysis. Compared to "fully active" patients, patients who were capable of self-care but unable to perform any work activities had about a six times higher risk of suicidality (p = .000). Compared to patients with no psychological morbidity, the risk of suicidality was significantly higher among patients with comorbid anxiety and depression (p = .024), those experiencing comorbid depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (p = 0.051), and those experiencing comorbid anxiety, depression and PTSD (p = .001). Conclusions: This study found that having no religion, impaired levels of overall functioning, and "multiple psychological morbidities" were associated with suicidality in Korean cancer patients. These findings suggest a need for careful monitoring of these factors and enhanced comprehensive care addressing both the physical and psychosocial functioning of patients with cancer in suicide prevention efforts.

AB Background: This study compared risk factors for depression and suicidal ideas among cancer patients for comparison with the general population, and identified influencing factors. Materials and Methods: We analyzed data from 2,472 cancer patients in the National Cancer Center and nine Regional Cancer Centers and frequency-matched data for age and sex from 2,349 members of the general population who completed the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2008. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors affecting depression and suicidal ideas. Results: Cancer patients were not likely to have more depression (OR=0.96, 95% CI=0.79-1.18) and were less likely to have suicidal ideas (OR=0.64, 95% CI=0.53-0.79) compared to the general population. Female sex, more stress, and lower quality of life were influencing factors. The additional risk factors for suicidal ideas among cancer patients included income (OR=0.62, 95% CI=0.43-0.91), smoking (OR=1.63, 95% CI=1.06-2.50), recurrence (OR=1.50, 95% CI=1.15-1.95), and chemotherapy (OR=1.66, 95% CI=1.26-2.19). Conclusions: No differences appeared in depression rates between cancer patients and the general population, and cancer patients were less likely to have suicidal ideas. However, cancer patients were likely to have more risk factors than the general population, and those classified as being at high risk of suicide should receive distress management and social economic support, from early in the treatment process.

AB Background: Primary care in South Korea has no effective screening system to identify high-risk suicide patients despite to the possibility of hidden patients. The present study examined the prevalence of suicidal ideation and depression among primary care patients and investigated rates of recognition and management strategies of physicians as they encountering patients with suicidal ideation and depression in primary care settings.
   Methods: This study was conducted as a two-part survey of patients visiting primary care clinics and their physicians. (1) The survey for patients was administered over 17 days in two areas and assessed socio-demographic characteristics, health behavior and the prevalence of suicidal ideation and depression. The participants were 1363 outpatients; 848 lived in urban area, and 515 were from rural area. (2) We surveyed the physicians' recognition of patients with suicidal ideations and depression as well as their current management. Eighteen doctors at 15 local clinics (8 in urban area and 7 in rural area) participated in this survey.
   Results: The prevalence rates of suicidal ideation and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 >= 10) were 18.3% (95% confidence interval: 16.2-20.3) and 13.9% (95% CI 12.6-15.7), respectively in primary care settings. The rates of suicidal ideation and depression were approximately 2.4 times and 1.4 times higher, respectively than those in community dwelling people. Ten (69.7%) and 4 (26.7%) of the 15 clinics staffed physicians who did not recognize suicidal ideation and depression, respectively. Five (83.3%) of 6 and 4 (38.6%) of 14 physicians who recognized suicidal ideation and depression among their patients respectively, only recommended psychiatry without any arrangements for a referral.
   Conclusion: Our findings imply that many patients with suicidal ideations and depression in primary care settings are under-diagnosed and under-treated. As a result, education and training of the identification and management of suicidal ideation and depression should be made available to physicians in primary care settings.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to examine factors associated with the use of mental health consultation for depressive symptoms.
   Methods: We used data from the 2013 Community Health Survey, which included responses from 13,269 individuals who reported that they had experienced depressive symptoms for more than 2 weeks in Korea. We investigated associations between mental health consultation rates for depressive symptoms and sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the significance of associations.
   Results: Among participants who report depressive symptoms, 16.0% (n = 2120) undergo mental health consultation. Respondents with a college education or over are more likely to undergo mental health consultation (odds ratio (OR) = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.21-1.84) than respondents with less education. Individuals aged 70 years or above are less likely to receive mental health consultation than those aged between 19 and 29 years. Females exhibit higher mental health consultation rates than males. Respondents who are divorced show greater odds of receiving mental health consultation than respondents who are married and cohabitate with their spouse.
   Conclusions: This study indicates that rates of use of mental health consultation services are lower among older adults and men and higher among divorced people. Educational level shows a significant positive association with mental health consultation among Koreans. The results could have implications for mental health policy in many ways in Korea.

AB Verbal bullying among adolescents, which has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, often involves swearing or sexually ridiculing one's family members or peers. Because many factors underlying the initiation of verbal bullying remain unknown, Giorgi's phenomenological method was used to examine the essence and meaning of verbal bullying among adolescents, which is an urgent issue in the field of nursing in South Korea. In this descriptive phenomenological study, researchers examined the behavior of 16 adolescents. Four themes emerged from examination: Egocentric Relational Violence, Learning Through Observation and Imitation, The Synchronization of Stigma and Aggression, and The Dilemma of Deviance and Habituation. Findings indicated that a confluence of factors impact verbal bullying among adolescents. To prevent verbal bullying, it is necessary to understand the progress of off enders' deviance and develop intervention activities through mental health services.

SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION

DT Article
ID COMMUNITY MEDIATION; SOUTH-KOREA
AB It is commonly assumed that conflicts in China and other Asian countries that share its cultural heritage are resolved through mediation rather than adjudication or appeals to political institutions. Archival sources in China and interviews with urban and rural officials reveal that the preference for mediation in China and other Asian and even Western societies is largely correlated with region, class, and gender and therefore does not constitute a national pattern. Historical (19th century and Maoist China) and more contemporary evidence reveals that mediation-to the extent that it was actually performed at the grassroots level-was but one method of resolving problems in China. Other methods included interpersonal violence, collective action, and even feigned suicide. A disaggregated perspective on conflict resolution is a more accurate representation of China as it deepens market reforms and a more powerful way to predict China's capacity to manage the conflicts that follow such reforms.

A comparison of the data collected before (2006) and after (2015) this study showed a decrease in non-occupational pesticide poisoning. Pesticide poisoning showed an age central tendency of 30 to 44 years, area central tendency for northern Jiangsu, and seasonal central tendency of occupational pesticide poisoning in autumn. Pesticide poisoning remains a major health concern in China. Government agencies together with scientists should focus their efforts on the prevention of potential threats to vulnerable groups such as the elderly, women, and children.

AB OBJECTIVEThis study investigated whether health literacy is associated with depressive symptoms among Korean adults, when adjusting for relevant risk factors for depression.
   METHODSData were collected from a sample of 585 community-dwelling Korean adults living in Seoul and Kwangju, South Korea, using a quota sampling strategy. A cross-sectional, multivariate regression analysis was used to investigate the association between health literacy and depressive symptoms.
   RESULTSWhen controlled for covariates, a lower level of health literacy was significantly associated with a higher level of depressive symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONHealth literacy may play an important role in preventing and treating depression. Future research is needed to determine if improving health literacy, through health promotion interventions, can enhance community-dwelling Korean adults' understanding of depressive symptoms and relevant treatment options.

AB As a proposal to contributing to lessening of teenage suicide rate in South Korea, this study aimed to find a solution for conflict between teenage children and parents, the essential factor for juvenile delinquency, via an improved communication method between the two groups. Juvenile delinquency, still increasing despite new programs and systems conducted by governments and organizations, was approached in the perspective of family. Through surveys, it was shown parents' poor attitudes towards their children, such as demand for coercive submission, constant nagging and interrupting by directly cutting children off to speak over, were main obstacles to better communication. Thus this study proposes a communication service, preventing one-sided communication of parents' and providing space for adolescents to express their personal issues and problems, in which in response parents could only give positive feedback.

AB Background: The investigations of the risk factors for suicidal ideation among middle-aged adults may be especially important for predicting suicidal actions, given the steep increase in suicide among Koreans aged 45-54. Few studies have sought to investigate the effect of socio-demographic status on suicidal ideation among middle-aged adults.
   Objective: This study investigated the influence of socio-demographic status on suicidal ideation among middle-aged adults in South Korea.
   Methods: The sample consisted of middle-aged men (n = 3,214) and middle-aged women (n = 4,087) aged 40-64 years who had participated in the 2005 cross-sectional Seoul Citizens Health and Social Indicators Survey. Using multiple logistic regression analysis, we examined the effect of socio-demographic status, health behaviours and health status on suicidal ideation in middle-aged adults.
   Results: The outstanding finding was that suicidal ideation was most prevalent among middle-aged women who engaged in manual labour (i.e. blue-collar workers) (OR = 2.77, 95% CI = 1.20-6.42). The absence of a spouse was significantly associated with suicidal ideation among middle-aged men (OR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.30-3.40).
   Conclusions: The effect of enhanced security related to stable employment was strongest among middle-aged women in blue-collar jobs, and the effect of intensive counselling services was strongest among divorced or widowed middle-aged men.

AB Objective Low-income adults are considered to be a group at high risk for suicide. We sought to examine the effect of type D personality and other socio-demographic factors on suicidality in low-income, middle-aged Koreans.
   Methods In total, 306 low-income, middle-aged Koreans [age: 49.16 +/- 5.24 (40-59) years, 156 males, 150 females] were enrolled from the Korean National Basic Livelihood Security System. Socio-demographic data, including employment status, income, health, marital status, and educational attainment, were gathered. Beck's 19-item Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI) was applied to evaluate suicidality, and the DS14 was used to assess type D personality
   Results Unemployment (p<0.01) and absence of spouse (p=0.03) predicted higher SSI scores independent of other socioeconomic factors. All type D personality scores [i.e., negative affectivity (NA), social inhibition (SI), and total score] predicted higher SSI scores independent of all socioeconomic factors (all, p<0.001). Subjects with type D personality had higher SSI scores (p<0.001), and the association between suicidality and socio-demographic factors (employment or physical health) could be found only in subjects without type D personality.
   Conclusion Type D personality was a risk factor for suicide in low-income Koreans, independently from socio-economic factors. In addition, the socio-demographic factors were less prominently associated with suicidality in those with type D personality.

AB Women live much longer than men in Korea, with remarkable gains in life expectancy at birth for the past decades. The gender differential has steadily increased over time, reaching a peak of more than 8 years in 19805, and decreased thereafter to 6.7 years in 2005. Studies to investigate the pattern and contributing factors to changes in the life expectancy gender gap have been mostly from Western countries, and there has been no such study in Asian countries, except in Japan. We therefore aimed to examine age- and cause-specific contributions to the changing gender differentials in life expectancy in Korea, in particular the decline of the gap, using a decomposition method. Between 1970 and 1979 when the gender gap in life expectancy widened, faster mortality decline among women in ages 20-44 explained 66% of the total increase in the gender gap, which would be due to substantial improvements in reproductive health among women and excess male mortality in occupational injuries and transport accidents. Although greater survival advantage among elderly women over 70 contributed to further increase in the gender gap, the contributions from younger ages with the ages 15-64 contributing the most (-2 years) resulted in the overall reduction of the gender gap which began in 1992 and continued to 2005. Among causes of death, liver diseases (-0.5 years, 38% of the total decline), transport accidents (-0.4 years, 31%), hypertensive diseases (-0.3 years, 19%), stroke (-0.1 years, 11%), and tuberculosis (-0.1 years) contributed the most to the overall 1.4 years reduction in the gender gap. However, changes in mortality from lung cancer (+0.3 years), suicide (+0.3 years), chronic lower respiratory diseases (+0.2 years), and ischemic heart diseases (+0.1 years) contributed to widening the gap during the same period. In sum, while smoking-related causes of death have contributed most to the narrowing gap in most other industrialized countries, these causes contributed toward increasing the gender gap in Korea. Instead, liver disease, hypertension-related diseases, and transport accidents were major contributing causes of death to the narrowing of gender differentials in life expectancy in Korea.

AB Introduction As the number of cancer survivors is rapidly increasing with the increased incidence of the disease and improved survival of patients, the prevalence of, and risk factors for, mental health problems and suicidality among cancer survivors should be examined.
   Methods and analysis Using data obtained from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2007-2013), we examined 1285 and 33 772 participants who had been and never been diagnosed with cancer, respectively. We investigated the risks of feelings of sadness and suicide attempts among cancer survivors and general population and examined differences in the risks of cancer survivors among subgroups according to cancer-related characteristics.
   Results The median age of survivors at the time of the survey and at diagnosis was 63 and 54 years, respectively. After adjusting for sex, level of education, household income, occupation, marital status, cancer type, current status of treatment, age at diagnosis and years since diagnosis, the risk of suicide attempts was significantly higher in participants diagnosed with cancer before 45 years of age compared with those diagnosed at 45-64 years (adjusted OR=3.81, 95% CI 1.07 to 13.60, P=0.039), and the higher risk of suicide attempts with borderline significance was found in those for whom more than 10 years had passed since diagnosis compared with those for whom the diagnosis was made only 2-10 years ago (adjusted OR=3.38, 95% CI 0.98 to 11.70, P=0.055). However, feelings of sadness were not significantly associated with any cancer-related characteristic.
   Conclusion Our results reveal an increased risk of suicide attempts among cancer survivors diagnosed early in life and in those for whom more than 10 years has passed since the diagnosis, suggesting the need for intensive monitoring and support for mental health problems and suicidal risks in this population.

AB Although major depressive disorder (MDD) has a variety of symptoms beyond the affective dimensions, the factor structure and contents of comprehensive psychiatric symptoms of this disorder have rarely been explored using the 18-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). We aimed to identify the factor structure of the 18-item BPRS in Korean MDD patients. A total of 258 MDD patients were recruited from a multicenter sample of the Clinical Research Center for Depression of South Korea study. Psychometric scales were used to assess overall psychiatric symptoms (BPRS), depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), global severity (Clinical Global Impression of Severity Scale), suicidal ideation (Scale for Suicide Ideation), functioning (Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale), and quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment-abbreviated version). Common factor analysis with oblique rotation was used to yield factor structure. A four-factor structure was designed and interpreted by the symptom dimensions to reflect mood disturbance, positive symptoms/apathy, bipolarity, and thought distortion/ mannerism. These individual factors were also significantly correlated with clinical variables. The findings of this study support the view that the BPRS may be a promising measuring tool for the initial assessment of MDD patients. In addition, the four-factor structure of the BPRS may be useful in understanding the mood and psychotic characteristics of these patients. Copyright (C) 2014, Kaohsiung Medical University.

AB Background: East Asian countries have high suicide rates. However, little is known about clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with suicidality in Asian populations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors associated with suicidality in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) from six Asian countries.
   Methods: The study cohort consisted of 547 outpatients with MDD. Patients presented to study sites in China (n = 114), South Korea (n = 101), Malaysia (n = 90), Singapore (n = 40), Thailand (n = 103), and Taiwan (n = 99). All patients completed the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Global Severity Index(SCL-90R), the Fatigue Severity Scale, the 36-item short-form health survey, the Sheehan Disability Scale, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Patients were classified as showing high suicidality if they scored >= 6 on the MINI suicidality module. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine sociodemographic and clinical factors related to high suicidality.
   Results: One hundred and twenty-five patients were classed as high suicidality. Unemployed status (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.43, p < 0.01), MADRS score (adjusted OR 1.08), p < 0.001, and GSI (SCL-90R) score (adjusted OR 1.06, p < 0.01) were positively related to high suicidality. Hindu (adjusted OR 0.09, p < 0.05) or Muslim (adjusted OR 0.21, p < 0.001) religion and MSPSS score (adjusted OR 0.82, p < 0.05) were protective against high suicidality.
   Conclusions: A variety of sociodemographic and clinical factors were associated with high suicidality in Asian patients with MDD. These factors may facilitate the identification of MDD patients at risk of suicide.

AB Objective: This study explored the clinical characteristics and risk factors of suicidal ideation in a sample of first graders from South Korea. Children's depression and aggression and maternal depression were examined as possible risk factors.
   Methods: This study is a school-based, cross-sectional study of 5 elementary schools in Gunpo City, South Korea. Participants were 707 first graders (mean age, 6.54 years) and their mothers. We assessed children's depressive and aggressive symptoms using the Behavior Assessment System for Children-2 (BASC-2) and maternal depression using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Two items from BASC-2 and I item from BDI identified children's and maternal suicidal ideation.
   Results: Twenty-seven (3.8%) children evidenced suicidal ideation. Children with suicidal ideation had higher mean scores of depression domain (10.11 +/- 5.34 vs 4.57 +/- 3.44, P < .0001) and aggression domain (7.78 +/- 3.84 vs 3.80 +/- 2.85, P < .0001) on BASC-2 and maternal depression (9.78 +/- 6.45 vs 7.28 +/- 5.38, P = .02) on BDI. In regression analysis, children's depression (odds ratio [OR], 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.32; P = .001) and aggression (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.41; P = .002) contributed significantly to children's suicidal ideation, whereas maternal depression was not significantly related to children's suicidal ideation (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.92-1.06; P = .75).
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated that even first graders had a considerable prevalence of suicidal ideation and that depression and aggression were associated with suicidal ideation in young children. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: To examine whether continuous antidepressant treatment during the first 6 month reduces the risk of relapse/recurrence of depression in South Korea.
   Methods: We used National Health Insurance Data covering the period from 2001 through 2004. The study population consisted of 117,087 adult patients who received antidepressants after being diagnosed with depression. The continuous antidepressant was defined as evidence of antidepressant prescriptions for 75% of the first 6 months of treatment. Relapse or recurrence during the next 18-month period was defined by evidence of a new episode requiring antidepressant treatment, psychiatric hospitalization, electroconvulsive therapy, emergency department visit or attempted suicide. We compared the relapse/recurrence rate during the 18-month follow-up period in patients receiving continuous treatment and those who discontinued early using a Cox's proportional hazard model.
   Results: Patients receiving continuous antidepressant treatment experienced a lower risk of relapse/recurrence (Hazard ratio: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.40-0.44). Three or more follow-up visits in the first 3 months also reduced the risk of relapse/recurrence. Factors associated with a significant increase of relapse/recurrence were comorbid medical illness, anxiety disorder, and alcohol abuse. The small benefit of SSRIs was appeared only in the early discontinued treatment subgroup, not in the continuous treatment subgroup.
   Limitations: We were not able to consider the antidepressant utilization pattern.
   Conclusions: Continuous antidepressant treatment and frequent follow-up visits during the acute phase were associated with a significant reduction in the likelihood of relapse or recurrence of depression. Our results provide important evidence on the effectiveness of antidepressant treatment in South Korea. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We examined the prevalence, correlates, and psychiatric comorbidities of community-dwelling subjects with problematic Internet use (PIU). In an epidemiological survey of mental disorders among Korean adults conducted in 2006, 6510 subjects (aged 18-64 years) completed the Korean version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV psychiatric disorders; Diagnostic Interview Schedule exploring pathological gambling; Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale-Version 1.1 Screener; questionnaire for sleep disturbances; and questionnaire for suicidal ideations, plans, and attempts. Young's Internet Addiction Test was administered to 3212 individuals who had used the Internet within one month before the interviews in order to identify problematic Internet users (cutoff > 39). The prevalence of PIU was 9.3% in the general population of South Korea. Being male, younger, never married, or unemployed were all associated with increased risks of PIU. Significant positive associations were observed between PIU and nicotine use disorders, alcohol use disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, pathological gambling, adult type ADHD symptoms, sleep disturbances, suicide ideas and suicide plans compare to subjects without PIU, after controlling for socio-demographic variables. These findings suggest that careful evaluation and management of such psychiatric disorders is needed for individuals with PIU. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of lifetime unintentional-injury experience and evaluate the quality of life of unintentional-injury victims, to provide useful data for the development of interventions aimed at decreasing the incidence of unintentional injuries. Design, sample, and methods: This study utilized data obtained from cross-sectional surveys of 24,327 Korean individuals aged 19-65 years, performed using face-to-face interviews. Demographic characteristics, unintentional-injury experience, attributes of health behavior, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questions were included in the study instruments. Results: About 11.8% of the subjects had experienced an unintentional injury that required hospitalization at least once in their lifetime. Being older, being male, having less education and lower income, working in a blue-collar job, and being enrolled in medical aid progams were associated with increased likelihood of having an unintentional injury. Among the HRQoL and risk-taking behavior variables, limitations in daily activities, suicide ideation, and binge drinking were significantly associated with injury experience. Conclusion: Public health efforts to prevent unintentional injuries should target high-risk populations such as males, those with low incomes and education levels, and binge drinkers. Efforts should also be made to enhance the HRQoL of injury victims.

AB Suicidal probability is an actual tendency including negative self-evaluation, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, and hostility. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of psychosocial variances in the suicidal probability of adolescents, especially the role of mediating variance. This study investigated the mediating effects of psychosocial factors such as depression, anxiety, self-esteem, stress, and social support on the suicidal probability among 1,586 adolescents attending middle and high schools in the Kyunggi Province area of South Korea. The relationship between depression and anxiety/suicidal probability was mediated by both social resources and self-esteem. Furthermore, the influence of social resources was mediated by interpersonal and achievement stress as well as self-esteem. This study suggests that suicidal probability in adolescents has various relationships, including mediating relations, with several psychosocial factors. The interventions on suicidal probability in adolescents should focus on social factors as well as clinical symptoms.

AB Dementia is a major public health problem affecting 5.5 million people in USA. This qualitative study explored the caregiving experience of Korean American (KA) families of persons with dementia (PWD). Adult KA caregivers of PWD (n = 18) were recruited for semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis yielded four themes: challenges in finding resources, struggling with mental health issues, traveling the path of acceptance, and finding ways to survive. Due to the language barrier, most KA caregivers reported using Korean Internet for information on dementia and caregiving. Some traveled to South Korea seeking medical assistance for dementia (medical tourism). Importantly, some KA caregivers expressed suicidal thoughts and depression. Unexpectedly, familism prevented help seeking and possible relief from their difficulties. There is an urgent need to improve access to dementia care services and education for the KA community. Building a trusting relationship with healthcare providers is even more important for KA caregivers to address their mental health concerns.

   DIFFERENTIALS; TRENDS; MEN; AGE
AB Background: The educational attainment of Koreans has greatly increased, which was expected to reduce the magnitude of the population attributable fraction (PAF) of mortality associated with low education levels. However, increase in the relative risk (RR) of mortality among those with lower educational levels actually increased the PAF. The purpose of this study was to examine the change in the PAF of lower educational levels for mortality in Korea, where educational attainment has improved and is associated with the exacerbation of inequalities in mortality levels.
   Methods: National census data were used to derive educational levels. The mortality-associated RR of lower educational levels was calculated by reference to national census and death certificate data from 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010. PAFs were calculated for all-cause mortality, malignant neoplasms, cerebrovascular disease, heart disease, and suicide by gender and age group (30-44 and 45-59 years).
   Results: The PAF of low educational level in terms of total mortality has decreased since 1995 in both genders. This trend was more prominent among those aged 30-44 years. However, the PAFs of suicide in younger females (30-44 years) and of cerebrovascular disease in older males (45-59 years) have increased. The RRs of all-cause mortality and those of the four leading causes of death in those with the lowest educational levels have increased, especially in females aged 30-44 years.
   Conclusions: The consistent and sharp increase in the attainment of education has contributed to the reduction in the PAFs of lower education for mortality, despite the fact that mortality inequalities have not improved. Efforts to reduce health inequalities must promote healthy public policy and address public health policies.

AB Objectives: To examine the hypothesis that respondents with any of three specific sleep patterns would have a higher likelihood of suicidality than those without reports of these patterns in Korean adolescents.
   Setting: Data from the 2011-2013 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey were used.
   Participants: 191 642 subjects were included. The survey's target population was students in grades 7 through 12 in South Korea.
   Independent variable: Sleep time.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures: Suicidal thoughts, plans and attempts.
   Results: The odds of suicidal thoughts in subjects with very short or long time in bed were 1.487-fold higher (95% CI 1.219 to 1.815) or 0.611-fold lower (95% CI 0.460 to 0.811), respectively, than for subjects with 7 h/day in bed; the odds were similar for suicidal plans. The odds of suicidal thoughts in subjects with early or late awakening times were 1.231-fold higher (95% CI 1.050 to 1.442) or 1.528-fold lower (95% CI 1.000 to 2.334), respectively, than for subjects with 7 h/day in bed; these odds were lower for suicidal plans and attempts. The odds of suicidal thoughts in subjects with early bedtime were 1.748-fold higher (95% CI 1.302 to 2.346), the odds of suicidal plans in people with an early bedtime were 2.494-fold higher (95% CI 1.671 to 3.722) and the odds of suicide attempts in subjects with late bedtime were 1.313-fold higher (95% CI 1.005 to 1.716) than for subjects with a bedtime of 23: 00.
   Conclusions: The sleep-related time is associated with suicide-related behaviours in Korean adolescents. Multilateral approaches are needed to identify the greatest risk factors for suicidal behaviours.

AB The present study examined the differences in the psychological wellbeing of 270 Polish (198 female) and 209 South Korean (87 female) students. Specifically, it tested the difference in depressive symptom severity between Polish and Korean students, and how this difference may be accounted for by stress and sensitivity to frustration. Poles and Koreans were chosen for this investigation as they vary in terms of culture with Koreans being more collectivistic and more dependent on social context. It was hypothesized that Koreans will have higher levels of depressive symptom severity than Poles due to the elevated levels of stress and sensitivity to frustration. Participants in both countries completed a set of questionnaires including the PHQ-9 - Patient Health Questionnaire, the STAR - Situational Triggers of Aggressive Responses Scale, and the Perceived Stress Scale - PSS 10. We found that Koreans were more depressed than Poles due to the higher stress levels and sensitivity to frustration. We discuss our study from two culturally distinct perspectives: psychological and philosophical. As this article addresses the problem of frustration and stress with attention to social context of emotional expression (or restraining from it), a philosophical concept of resentment may turn out to be a promising area of further research and interpretation.

AB As a part of Korea's smoking cessation policy, the price of tobacco was increased in January 2015. Initially, the smoking rate among adolescents began to decrease. The current data, however, show that the adolescent smoking rate is on the rise. Alongside price policies, there is a need to further understand additional preventive measures that promote successful smoking cessation by identifying the factors that influence maintenance of smoking cessation in adolescents. This study aimed to identify the factors that influence smoking cessation in adolescents after attempting smoking cessation after increase in tobacco price. The study used large-scale, nationwide, secondary data obtained from the Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-Based Survey. The sample included a total of 627 subjects who reported an attempt to quit smoking after the tobacco price increased. Descriptive statistics, t test, the chi(2) test, and multiple logistic regression were used. The results showed that household economic status, school type, suicidal ideation, experience of exposure to secondhand smoke at home, and experience of witnessing teaching staff smoking were significant factors related to maintenance of smoking cessation among adolescents. To increase the success rate of smoking cessation, future intervention programs should include school environment structure and address emotional and psychological issues such as suicide.

AB Background. Alcohol is an important factor that contributes to emergency department (ED) visits due to injury. However, the role of alcohol in elderly patients visiting ED due to injury has not been clearly defined. This study aims to examine age and alcohol as risk factors of injury severity and clinical outcomes.
   Methods. This study included patients who visited EDs between January 2011 and December 2016. Data was obtained from the Emergency Department-Based Injury In-depth Surveillance of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, South Korea. Injury patients aged >= 18 years were included, but those who visited the ED more than 48 hours after injury, with unknown clinical outcomes (admission, mortality, and excess mortality ratio-adjusted injury severity score [EMR-ISS]) were excluded.
   Results. We analyzed 887,712 patients, of whom 131,708 (17.7%) non-elderly and 9,906 (7.0%) elderly had alcohol-related injury. Falls and slips are the most common injury mechanism (37.9%) in patients consuming alcohol (36.3% non-elderly/58.40% elderly). The injury occurred on roads (40.6%), houses (33.8%), and commercial facilities (11.9%) in elderly patients consuming alcohol. Suicide rate was 12.0% in elderly and 9.7% in non-elderly patients. According to the time of day of injury, evening (60.8%) was the most common in elderly and night (62.6%) in non-elderly patients. Admission rate (odds ratio [OR] 2.512 confidence interval [CI] 2.407-2.621), intensive care unit (ICU) care rate (OR 5.507 [CI] 5.178-5.858), mortality rate (OR 4.593 [CI] 4.086-5.162), and EMR-ISS >25 (OR 5.498 [CI] 5.262-5.745) were compared between patients with alcohol-related injury and non-elderly with non-alcohol-related injury patients. Alcohol consumption in elderly patients results in significant impairment and increases EMR-ISS, ICU care rate, and mortality rate. To reduce injury in elderly patients, alcohol screening, appropriate counseling, and intervention are needed.

AB Background: Despite the sharp rise in antidepressant use, the underutilization of mental healthcare services for depression remains a concern. We investigated factors associated with the underutilization of mental health services for potential depression symptoms in the Republic of Korea, using a nationally representative sample.
   Methods: Data were obtained from the Community Health Survey (2011-2012) conducted in the Republic of Korea. Participants comprised adults who reported potential depression symptoms during the year prior to the study (n = 21,644); information on professional mental healthcare use for their symptoms was obtained. The association of demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors with consultation use was analysed via multiple logistic regression. Adjusted odds ratio and 95 % confidence intervals were estimated.
   Results: Among those reporting potential depression symptoms, only 17.4 % had consulted a medical/mental health professional. Elderly individuals of both genders had significantly lower consultation rates compared to middle-aged individuals. Unmet healthcare needs and a history of diabetes mellitus were associated with lower consultation rates. After stratification by age, elderly individuals with the lowest education and income level were significantly less likely to seek professional mental health services. Married, separated, or divorced men had lower consultation rates compared to unmarried individuals, whereas married, separated, or divorced women had higher rates.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that target strategies for vulnerable groups identified in this study-including elderly individuals-need to be established at the community level, including strengthening social networks and spreading awareness to reduce the social stigma of depression.

AB Purpose: In Korea, registration of paraquat-containing herbicides was canceled in November 2011, and sales thereof were completely banned in November 2012. We evaluated the effect of the paraquat ban on the epidemiology and mortality of herbicide-induced poisoning.
   Materials and Methods: This retrospective study analyzed patients treated for herbicide poisoning at 17 emergency departments in South Korea between January 2010 and December 2014. The overall and paraquat mortality rates were compared pre-and post-ban. Factors associated with herbicide mortality were evaluated using logistic analysis. To determine if there were any changes in the mortality rates before and after the paraquat sales ban and the time point of any such significant changes in mortality, R software, version 3.0.3 (package, bcp) was used to perform a Bayesian change point analysis.
   Results: We enrolled 2257 patients treated for herbicide poisoning (paraquat=46.8%). The overall and paraquat poisoning mortality rates were 40.6% and 73.0%, respectively. The decreased paraquat poisoning mortality rate (before, 75% vs. after, 67%, p=0.014) might be associated with increased intentionality. The multivariable logistic analysis revealed the paraquat ban as an independent predictor that decreased herbicide poisoning mortality (p= 0.035). There were two major change points in herbicide mortality rates, approximately 3 months after the initial paraquat ban and 1 year after complete sales ban.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that the paraquat ban decreased intentional herbicide ingestion and contributed to lowering herbicide poisoning-associated mortality. The change point analysis suggests a certain timeframe was required for the manifestation of regulatory measures outcomes.

AB This article aimed to compare the level of suicidal ideation in the religiously affiliated and nonaffiliated groups and identify the moderating effect of religion variables on the relationship between depression and suicidal ideation. The sample in this study was 1180 residents who were older than 60 years and who resided in Gangwon Province, South Korea. We studied the cross-sectional relationships among religions and studied variables including organizational religious activity (ORA), non-ORA (NORA), intrinsic religiosity (IR), depression, well-being, and suicidal ideation. After controlling for sociodemographic variables, the depression, well-being, and suicidal ideation level in the religiously affiliated group were not significantly different from that of the religiously nonaffiliated group and the variables also were not significantly different between Christians and Buddhists. The effect of depression on suicidal ideation was significantly moderated by ORA and IR, and the effect showed different patterns by religion; ORA was a moderator only among the Buddhist group, and IR only moderated the relationships among the Christians.

AB Background: Income is not frequently used to monitor health equity on a national level largely due to the lack of public data on income. Information on income allows policy makers to identify the economically disadvantaged population in a country directly. We examined differences in life expectancy (LE) at birth by income and quantified age- and cause-specific contributions to the LE differences using national health insurance data. Methods: Data from a nationally representative sample of 1 097 333 South Koreans (2% of the total population) collected between 2002 and 2010 (39 737 deaths) were used. National health insurance premiums were used to estimate income level. Age- and cause-specific contributions to differences in LE at birth by income were estimated using Arriaga's decomposition method. Results: LE at birth gradually increased with income in both genders. Interquintile income LE differences were 7.93 years in males and 3.82 years in females. Most of LE differentials were attributed to differences in mortality in middle-aged and older adults. Suicide and cerebrovascular accidents were the two leading causes of death contributing the most to income LE differences in both males and females. The top 10 causes of death accounted for over 50% of the total LE differences by income in both genders. Alcohol-related causes of death explained the majority of the gender differences in the income LE differentials. Conclusions: Income differentials in LE at birth according to national health insurance premiums and data linkage systems could provide a valuable opportunity for monitoring and prioritizing population health inequalities in South Korea.

ID PERSISTENT INSOMNIA; RISK; MORTALITY; THERAPY; COHORT
AB Sleeping pills are one of the most common drugs taken by adults when afflicted by insomnia. Adverse effects of pharmacotherapy, however, should not be overlooked, and monitoring is needed to check for an overdose of sleeping pills. We reviewed zolpidem overdose and patient suicide with benefits and disadvantages of pharmacotherapy. Cases of adverse effects concerning the central nervous system, including delirium and hallucination, as well as abnormal behavior during sleep, are commonly reported among patients who have taken zolpidem for more than 1 year. The serious problem of long-term prescription to medication can lead to a higher mortality rate of insomniac patients. An alternative to medication for treating insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy, which can improve sleeping habits. Cognitive behavioral therapy induces patients to recognize and change the negative thoughts that affect their sleep. Medical providers should be aware of the adverse effects of sleep inducers and provide sufficient information to their patients about them. When establishing treatment plans, they should encourage patients to make the proper decisions and try to reduce the adverse effects of any medication as much as possible.

AB This study analyses the incidences and patterns of paraquat poisoning from calls received at the Malaysia National Poison Centre (NPC) since 2004 following the ban of the herbicide (2004-2006) and subsequent restriction up to year 2015. Related reported cases to the centre over twelve years (2004-2015) were retrieved and studied in respect to socio-demographic characteristics, mode and type of poisonings, exposure routes and location of incident. Ages of poisoned victims range from 10 months old to 98 years with males being intoxicated more frequently than females (ratio male to female = 2.7). The age group mainly involved in the poisoning was 20-39 years. The most common mode was intentional (62.8%) followed by unintentional (36.9%). Among the 1232 reported cases, suicidal poisoning was the highest (57.2%); accidental poisoning (30.8%) and occupational poisoning (3.3%). The findings showed an upward trend of suicidal poisoning over the years, clearly emphasizing the need for more stringent and effective enforcement to ensure the safe use of paraquat.

TI Poverty in Global Perspective: Is Shame a Common Denominator?
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Focussing on the psychosocial dimensions of poverty, the contention that shame lies at the 'irreducible absolutist core' of the idea of poverty is examined through qualitative research with adults and children experiencing poverty in diverse settings in seven countries: rural Uganda and India; urban China; Pakistan; South Korea and United Kingdom; and small town and urban Norway. Accounts of the lived experience of poverty were found to be very similar, despite massive disparities in material circumstances associated with locally defined poverty lines, suggesting that relative notions of poverty are an appropriate basis for international comparisons. Though socially and culturally nuanced, shame was found to be associated with poverty in each location, variably leading to pretence, withdrawal, self-loathing, 'othering', despair, depression, thoughts of suicide and generally to reductions in personal efficacy. While internally felt, poverty-related shame was equally imposed by the attitudes and behaviour of those not in poverty, framed by public discourse and influenced by the objectives and implementation of anti-poverty policy. The evidence appears to confirm the negative consequences of shame, implicates it as a factor in increasing the persistence of poverty and suggests important implications for the framing, design and delivery of anti-poverty policies.

AB BackgroundNo systematic reviews have been conducted into the prevalence of personality disorders (PD) in Asian populations. This review aims to investigate the prevalence of all PD subtypes within community and clinical Asian (Chinese, Indian, Japanese and South Korean) populations worldwide.
   MethodSeven databases were searched in addition to manual examination and reference tracking. Exclusion criteria were applied with the remaining studies subjected to quality appraisal.
   ResultsNineteen studies were included for review. Results were grouped by community studies in Asian countries, clinical studies in Asian countries and comparative studies. Prevalence of PD assessed by clinical judgement was lower than that by diagnostic tools. The highest rates of PD were found in suicidal cohorts within the various countries. Four of the five comparative studies found lower prevalence rates of PD in Asians compared with the overall sample.
   ConclusionInsufficient consistent research has been published to ascertain the prevalence of PD in Asians and whether it is higher or lower than in Western cohorts. Asians presenting with suicidal ideation may benefit from PD assessment. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The objective of this study was to identify the association of blood lead level (BLL) with mortality in inorganic lead-exposed workers of South Korea. A cohort was compiled comprising 81,067 inorganic lead exposed workers working between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2004. This cohort was merged with the Korean National Statistical Office to follow-up for mortality between 2000 and 2008. After adjusting for age and other carcinogenic metal exposure, all-cause mortality (Relative risk [RR] 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.79), digestive disease (RR 3.23, 95% CI 1.33-7.86), and intentional self-harm (RR 2.92, 95% CI 1.07-7.81) were statistically significantly higher in males with BLL >20 mu g/dl than of those with BLL <= 10 mu g/dl. The RR of males with BLL of 10-20 mu g/dl was statistically higher than of those with BLL <= 10 mu g/dl in infection (RR 3.73. 95% CI, 1.06-13.06). The RRs of females with 10-20 mu g/dl BLL was statistically significantly greater than those with BLL <10 mu g/dl in all-cause mortality (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.16-3.20) and colon and rectal cancer (RR 13.42, 95% CI 1.21-149.4). The RRs of females with BLL 10-20 mu g/dl (RR 10.45, 95% CI 1.74-62.93) and BLL >= 20 mu g/dl (RR 12.68, 95% CI 1.69-147.86) was statistically significantly increased in bronchus and lung cancer. The increased suicide of males with >= 20 mu g/dl BLLs, which might be caused by major depression, might be associated with higher lead exposure. Also, increased bronchus and lung cancer mortality in female workers with higher BLL might be related to lead exposure considering low smoking rate in females. The kinds of BLL-associated mortality differed by gender.

TI Economic crises and mortality: a review of the literature
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
ID INFANT-MORTALITY; LIFE EXPECTANCY; HEART-DISEASE; HEALTH; STRESS;
   ALCOHOL; IMPACT; RISK; MEN; SUSCEPTIBILITY
AB Background:
   Studies evaluating the association of economic variables with mortality have produced mixed findings.
   Objective:
   We sought to evaluate whether economic crises confer increase in mortality.
   Methods:
   We reviewed studies analysing mortality in the general population in periods of economic crisis compared with periods prior to or after the crisis, by searching PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and the World Wide Web.
   Results:
   Eleven studies were included in this review; they referred to economic crises that occurred in Russia, South Korea, as well as South or Central American, African or European countries (5, 2, 2, 1 and 1 studies respectively). Periods of economic crises were associated with the increase in all-cause mortality in seven out of eight studies that reported specific relevant data and increase in cardiovascular mortality in six out of seven studies. Increase in mortality because of respiratory infections, chronic liver disease, suicides, homicides and mortality in infants was noted in association with economic crises in all 5, 4, 6, 5 and 3 studies, respectively, that reported specific relevant data. Mortality from transport accidents decreased with economic crises in five out of six studies.
   Conclusion:
   Economic crises in less affluent countries are accompanied with the increase in all-cause mortality, as well as mortality from most of the major specific causes. Further data are needed to establish the effect of economic crises on mortality in more affluent countries. We believe that the above-mentioned association could be attributed to increased psychosocial stress during such periods, among other factors. Public health authorities should be aware of this issue and consider appropriate preventive and control measures.

AB Background: The appropriate length of time for patients who visit clinics with significant suicidal ideation to be closely monitored is a critical issue for clinicians. We evaluated the course of suicidal ideation and associated factors for persistent suicidality in patients who entered treatment for depression with significant suicidal ideation.
   Methods: A total of 565 patients who had both moderate to severe depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score r-E-, 14) and significant suicidal ideation (Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI-B) score >= 6) were recruited from 18 hospitals in South Korea. Participants were assessed using the SSI-B, HAMD, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and Clinical Global Impression Scale-severity during a 12-week naturalistic treatment with antidepressant intervention. Participants were classified into resolved suicidality or persistent suiciclaliiy groups according to whether their suicidal ideation improved to SSI-B scores <6 and were sustained for 12 weeks.
   Results: During the 12-week treatment, 206 (36.4%) patients were classified in the resolved su c clality group. Persistent suicidality was associated with intervention with SSRls, higher SSI-B baseline score, and no HAMD or HALV1A remission. The proportions of participants who had persistent suicidal ideation even with HAMD remission or response were 0.25 and 0.34, respectively. Limitations: This study was observational, and ihe treatment modality was naturalistic.
   Conclusions: A considerable number of patients had persistent suicidal ideation despite 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment. Close monitoring for suicidal ideation may be needed beyond the initial weeks of treatment and even after a response to antidepressants is observed. (C) 2014 Elsevier E3.\/. All rights reserved

AB Pyrethroids, organic compounds similar to natural pyrethrums, constitute the majority of insecticides. Pyrethroids are widely used around the world owing to their excellent selective toxicity to certain insects. In addition, they are easily found in daily life, accounting for most household pesticides. Owing to the easy access to pyrethroid insecticides, pyrethroid-related accidents and suicides have occurred yearly. For the first time, nine pyrethroids commonly used in South Korea and their seven major metabolites were simultaneously analyzed and validated in human plasma using liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Plasmas spiked with these pyrethroids and their metabolites were prepared and deproteinized via the addition of acetonitrile. This deproteinized supernatant was filtered and directly injected to ascertain the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. For a sensitive and reproducible analysis, all the pyrethroid and metabolite analysis conditions for the multiple reaction monitoring mode were optimized in advance and employed. The validation parameters of the method, including the specificity, linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, accuracy, precision, recovery, matrix effect, and stability were also evaluated. The R-2 value of linearity was greater than 0.997 for all the analytes, the accuracy ranged from 81.8% to 112.3%, the precision from 0% to 10.1%, and the recovery from 90.9% to 112.4%, depending on the analyte. The stability was 97.0% to 107.0% in fresh plasma and 97.6% to 107.7% in corrupt plasma. The results were satisfactory for all the validation parameters. Furthermore, authentic pyrethroid-poisoned samples were analyzed using this validation method, to determine the suitability; deltamethrin and its metabolites, cis-DBCA and 3-PBA, were successfully analyzed.

   THOUGHTS
AB Objective: Epidemiological evidence suggests that work stress is associated with suicidal ideation (SI). However, only few studies in this area have drawn on well-established theoretical work stress models (i.e., the job-demand-control [JDC] model, the effort-reward-imbalance [ERI] model, and the model of organizational injustice [OM. Utilization of such models allows though for theory-based assessments and workplace interventions. Since evidence on those models' relationship with suicide-related outcomes is currently inconclusive (with regard to JDC), markedly sparse (OJ) or lacking (ERI), we aimed to provide additional or initial evidence.
   Methods: We drew on original data from six cross-sectional studies, which were conducted in four countries (i.e., South Korea, China, Australia, and Germany). Work stress was measured by established questionnaires and was categorized into tertiles. In each study, SI was assessed by either one or two items taken from validated scales. Associations of work stress with SI were estimated for each study and were pooled across studies using multivariate random-effects logistic modeling.
   Results: In the pooled analyses (n = 12,422) all three work stress models were significantly associated with SI with odds ratios fluctuating around 2. For instance, the pooled odds ratios for highest versus lowest work stress exposure in terms of job strain, OJ, and ERI equalled 1.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.52, 2.41), 1.98 (95% CI = 1.48, 2.65), and 2.77 (95% CI = 1.57, 4.88), respectively. Patterns of associations were largely consistent across the individual studies.
   Conclusion: Our study provides robust evidence of a positive association between work stress and SI. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB There is an urgent need for mental healthcare in the workplace though little has been done so far to address that. Many tragic incidents such as workplace suicide and death due to 'workplace bullying', 'violence' and 'overwork' have happened in South Korea and Japan. The unemployment rate of workers suffering from mental health problems is also increasing, which aggravates the risk of serious economic impacts for an aging population. Therefore, it is crucial to establish a mental health management system at the workplace level. This chapter presents a model based on the use of smart technologies for mental healthcare services to enhance the ergonomics and quality of working conditions at the workplace, and to help create a mentally healthy workplace. With the rapid development of SmartMentalTech, an innovative shift with new ways of delivering mental healthcare services is taking place changing the way service users, employers, and system designers use technology to deliver mental healthcare at the workplace. The objective of this chapter is to suggest an ergonomic platform where viable applications related to psychological challenges at the workplace are provided by service users, developers, practitioners, decision makers, and policymakers. The approach of Occupational Health Psychology (OHP) emphasizes on the significance of workplace design, management and psychosocial risk mitigation. There are differences across service users; therefore, the challenges facing the managers of mental healthcare services at the workplace are daunting. Currently 12 types of developed SmartMentalTech can be used for personalized care. This chapter provides a comprehensive account on how to set up and to manage mental healthcare delivery in order to minimize workplace mental health problems and the social stigma of mental health issues by establishing a new comprehensive mental healthcare stepped-care model (CMHSCM) system for service users' satisfaction and healthy intelligent workplace in a timely and economically responsive manner.

AB Medical utilization due to organic sleep disorders has increased remarkably in South Korea, which may contribute to the deterioration of mental health in the population. We analyzed the relationship between organic sleep disorders and risk of hospitalization due to mood disorder. We used data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) National Sample Cohort 2002-2013, which included medical claims filed for the 15,537 patients who were newly diagnosed with a mood disorder in a metropolitan region, and employed Poisson regression analysis using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models. By the results, there was a 0.53% hospital admission rate among 244,257 patients with outpatient care visits. Patients previously diagnosed with an organic sleep disorder before specific outpatient care had a higher risk for hospitalization. Such associations were significant in females, patients with a longer duration of disease, or those who lived in the largest cities. In conclusion, considering that experiencing a sleep disorder by a patient with an existing mood disorder was associated with deterioration of their status, health policy makers need to consider insurance coverage for all types of sleep disorders in patients with psychological conditions.

TI Social Welfare Centers Protect Outpatients with Mood Disorders from Risk
   of Hospital Admission
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; SUICIDE RISK; QUALITY; SUPPORT; STRESS; CARE
AB Background
   South Korea faces difficulties in the management of mental disorders, and those difficulties are expected to gradually worsen. Therefore, we analyzed the relationship between social welfare centers and hospital admission after outpatient treatment for mood disorders.
   Methods
   We used data from the National Health Insurance Service National Sample Cohort 2002-2013, which included all medical claims filed for the 50,160 patients who were newly diagnosed with a mood disorder among the 1,025,340 individuals in a nationally representative sample. We performed a logistic regression analysis using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models to examine the relationship between social welfare centers and hospital admission after outpatient treatment for mood disorders (ICD-10: F3).
   Results
   There was a 3.9% admission rate among a total of 99,533 person-years. Outpatients who lived in regions with more social welfare centers were less likely to be admitted to a hospital (per increase of five social welfare centers per 100,000 people; OR: 0.958; 95% CI: 0.919-0.999). Social welfare centers had an especially strong protective effect on patients with relatively mild mood disorders and those who were vulnerable to medical expenditures.
   Conclusions
   Considering the protective role of social welfare centers in managing patients with mood disorders, health-policy makers need to consider strategies for activating mental healthcare.

AB Background: Decomposition of socioeconomic inequalities in life expectancy by ages and causes allow us to better understand the nature of socioeconomic mortality inequalities and to suggest priority areas for policy and intervention. This study aimed to quantify age- and cause-specific contributions to socioeconomic differences in life expectancy at age 25 by educational level among South Korean adult men and women.
   Methods: We used National Death Registration records in 2005 (129,940 men and 106,188 women) and national census data in 2005 (15, 215, 523 men and 16,077,137 women aged 25 and over). Educational attainment as the indicator of socioeconomic position was categorized into elementary school graduation or less, middle or high school graduation, and college graduation or higher. Differences in life expectancy at age 25 by educational level were estimated by age- and cause-specific mortality differences using Arriaga's decomposition method.
   Results: Differences in life expectancy at age 25 between college or higher education and elementary or less education were 16.23 years in men and 7.69 years in women. Young adult groups aged 35-49 in men and aged 25-39 in women contributed substantially to the differences between college or higher education and elementary or less education in life expectancy. Suicide and liver disease were the most important causes of death contributing to the differences in life expectancy in young adult groups. For older age groups, cerebrovascular disease and lung cancer were important to explain educational differential in life expectancy at 25-29 between college or higher education and middle or higher education.
   Conclusions: The contribution of the causes of death to socioeconomic inequality in life expectancy at age 25 in South Korea varied by age groups and differed by educational comparisons. The age specific contributions for different causes of death to life expectancy inequalities by educational attainment should be taken into account in establishing effective policy strategies to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in life expectancy.

AB Precarious employment and unemployment are important factors that impact suicidal behavior. This study investigated (1) how employment transitions among permanent employment, precarious employment, and unemployment are associated with suicidal ideation in working employees and compared (2) whether individuals transitioning among these three states were more vulnerable than those remaining. Using nationally representative longitudinal data between 2012-2017, a total of 25,862 adults aged 25 to 59 years old without a record of suicidal ideation were included at baseline. Transitions in employment status (permanent work, precarious work, or unemployment) and suicidal ideation were analyzed using hierarchical logistic regression models. Compared to the "permanent to permanent" group, individuals in the "permanent to precarious" (odds ratio (OR) 1.74, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.29-2.35], "permanent to unemployment" (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.32-2.96), "precarious to precarious" (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.21-2.85), and the "precarious to unemployment" (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.05-1.95) groups had higher odds of suicidal ideation. The magnitude of such odds was generally higher than that of individuals at annual unemployment or precarious states. The results show that adults moving in and out of different employment states have higher odds of suicidal ideation than individuals at annually static precarious or unemployment status.

ID RISK; ADOLESCENTS; DEPRESSION; YOUTH
AB The purpose of this study was to examine the evidence to determine if there are gender differences in suicidal ideation of adolescents. This study examined the main effect of risk factors front 5 domains and protective factors front domain in relation to suicidal ideation by gender and identified the most important predictors of suicidal ideation for males (N = 654) and females (N = 658). This study was a cross-sectional survey and elata were collected through self-report questionnaires. In the univariate analysis, especially, risk factors from behavioral variables and psychosocial-environmental variables appeared to be gender skewed. For males, all behavioral variables were predictive of suicidal ideation. For the females, unlike the males, Wang-tta or victim of bullying behavior and sexual orientation as behavioral variables were predictive of suicidal ideation. For males, parental divorce and parental alcohol abuse as psychosocial-environmental variables were, predictive of suicidal ideation. For the females, again unlike for the males, all the psychosocial-environmental variables were not predictive of suicidal ideation. Die most important predictors of suicidal ideation for males as a result of the multivariate analysis were history of suicidal attempt, depression, hostility, smoking, parental alcohol abuse, communication with friends, and self-esteem. The most important predictors of suicidal ideation for females as a result of the multivariate analysis were depression, hostility, sexual orientation, and self-esteem. These results would indicate that air effective suicide screening and prevention program for adolescents should consider gender differences.

AB Background There is inconsistent evidence regarding the presence of a socioeconomic differential in adolescent all-cause and cause-specific mortality. This study examines possible socioeconomic mortality differentials in Korean adolescents.
   Method A total of 330 321 boys and 311830 girls aged 10-19, who are health insurance beneficiaries for civil servants and private school teachers of Korean Health Insurance Cooperation, were followed for 9 years (1995-2003). Parental income information was linked to national death certificate data.
   Results For boys, all-cause mortality showed a graded inverse relationship with income level in both 10-14 year Olds (RR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.40-1.91) and 15-19 year Olds (RR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.40-1.91). The major contributor was mortality differentials from external causes, with differentials of transport accident death the most important. Mortality from circulatory disease was higher in the lowest income groups in 15-19 year Olds (RR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.09-4.50). A significant socioeconomic gradient of non-external cause mortality was found in 15-19 year olds. For girls, socioeconomic differentials were less evident than boys. The all-cause mortality gradient for girls was smaller than for boys and only significant between the lowest and the highest tertile in both 10-14 year Olds and 15-19 year Olds (RR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.02-1.72, RR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.11-1.72, respectively). There were significant socioeconomic mortality differentials in all external causes and transport accidents and a marginally significant difference in suicide mortality for 10-19 year olds. Mortality from non-external causes showed no social gradient in girls.
   Conclusions Socioeconomic differentials in all-cause mortality were observed in adolescents, even in early youth. This pattern might also apply to mortality from non-external causes, especially cardiovascular disease in 15-19 year old males.

AB Objective The purpose of this investigation was to identify distinctive clinical correlates of psychotic major depression (PMD) as compared with non-psychotic major depression (NPMD) in a large cohort of Korean patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).
   Methods We recruited 966 MDD patients of age over 18 years from the Clinical Research Center for Depression of South Korea (CRESCEND) study. Diagnoses of PMD (n=24) and NPMD (n=942) were made with the DSM-IV definitions and confirmed with SCID. Psychometric scales were used to assess overall psychiatric symptoms (BPRS), depression (HAMD), anxiety (HAMA), global severity (CGI-S), suicidal ideation (SSI-Beck), functioning (SOFAS), and quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF). Using independent t-tests and chi(2) tests, we compared clinical characteristics of patients with PMD and NPMD. A binary logistic regression model was constructed to identify factors independently associated with increased likelihood of PMD.
   Results PMD subjects were characterized by a higher rate of inpatient enrollment, and higher scores on many items on BPRS (somatic concern, anxiety, emotional withdrawal, guilt feelings, tension, depression, suspiciousness, hallucination, motor retardation, blunted affect and excitement) global severity (CGI-s), and suicidal ideation (SSI-Beck). The explanatory factor model revealed that high levels of tension, excitement, and suicidal ideation were associated with increased likelihood of PMD.
   Conclusion Our findings partly support the view that PMD has its own distinctive clinical manifestation and course, and may be considered a diagnostic entity separate from NPMD.

   PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; UNITED-STATES; MORTALITY; HEIGHT; TRENDS; DEATHS
AB Introduction: This study was conducted to examine the characteristics of intentional fall injuries and the factors associated with their prognosis.
   Methods: The study included 8992 patients with unintentional falls from a height (nonintentional group) and 144 patients with intentional falls from a height (intentional group). General and clinical characteristics were compared between the 2 groups. Intentional fall cases were divided into severe and nonsevere groups, and the factors associated with severe injury were evaluated by comparing these groups.
   Results: The most common age group was younger than 14 years in the nonintentional group and between 30 and 44 years old in the intentional group. For the nonintentional group, 65% of the patients were male, and 48% were male in the intentional group. Fall heights of more than 4 m were most common in the intentional group. Discharge was the most common result in the nonintentional group; however, death before arrival at the emergency department (ED) or during ED treatment occurred in 54.9% of patients in the intentional group. In the severe injury group within the intentional group, patients were older, and the height of the fall was higher. Factors associated with severe injury in the intentional group included being a high school graduate rather than a college graduate and greater fall height.
   Conclusion: The risk of severe injury increased with fall height in the intentional group, and a high school level of education rather than a college level of education was associated with more severe injury. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Backgrounds We explored the association between working hours and unmet dental needs among adults who have experienced dental pain, and how this relationship varied by demographic and lifestyle factors. Methods We used the data of 9594 adults who reported dental pain from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) V and VI. We conducted a logistic regression analysis to determine the association between working hours and unmet dental needs, followed by a subgroup analysis and Cochran-Armitage trend tests. Results Among the 4203 male subjects, 1661 (39.5%) experienced unmet dental needs. They also showed a significant dose-response relationship between working hours and unmet dental needs (OR 1.21 [95% CI 0.97-1.51], OR 1.30 [95% CI 0.99-1.69], OR 1.33 [95% CI 1.04-1.71], OR 1.58 [95% CI 1.21-2.07] compared to no working hours), whereas female participants did not. The significance of the association was preserved among participants with increased consumption of alcohol, urban residence, and who brushed their teeth at least twice a day. It was also stronger among those who lacked access to dental services or did not perceive the need for dental care. Conclusion Among adults who have experienced dental pain, unmet dental needs had higher odds of occurring in males who worked longer, and this relationship appears to be influenced by consumption of alcohol, region of residence, tooth-brushing frequency, and access to and perception of dental care. Accordingly, policies should be drafted to reduce unmet needs by considering these factors.

DT Article

AB Introduction: The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology and outcomes of patients with therapeutic hypothermia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) caused by self-inflicted intoxication.
   Methods: We performed a multicenter retrospective registry-based study of adult OHCA patients presenting to 24 hospitals over 6 years across South Korea. Data included demographics, resuscitation variables, postresuscitation variables, and self-inflicted intoxicants. Neurologic outcomes were categorized according to the Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) scale and were dichotomized as either good discharge outcomes (CPC 1 and 2) or poor discharge outcomes (CPC 3-5).
   Results: A total of 930 OHCA cases were identified, 24 (2.6%) of which were classified as cardiac arrest caused by acute intoxication. The mean age of cases was 57.2 +/- 12.9 years. The mean time from collapse to return of spontaneous circulation was 35.4 +/- 18.7 minutes. The presenting rhythm was pulseless electrical activity in 6 patients (25%) and asystole in 18 patients (75%). Eleven patients (46%) survived to hospital discharge, and of these, good discharge outcomes (CPC 1 and 2) were achieved in 21% (5/24). For pesticide intoxication, the survival-to-discharge rate was 62% (8/13), and the rate of good neurologic outcome was 23% (3/13).
   Conclusion: Patients with OHCA caused by self-inflicted intoxication represented 2.6% of all OHCA patients. They showed a high rate of unwitnessed cardiac arrest and a very low rate of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Pesticides were the main cause of cardiac arrest, and these cases had a very high discharge to survival rate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: This study examined the influence of home and school environments, and individual health-risk behaviours on body weight outcomes in Korean adolescents. Study design: This was a cross-sectional observational study.
   Methods: Quantile regression models to explore heterogeneity in the association of specific factors with body mass index (BMI) over the entire conditional BMI distribution was used. A nationally representative web-based survey for youths was used.
   Results: Paternal education level of college or more education was associated with lower BMI for girls, whereas college or more education of mothers was associated with higher BMI for boys; for both, the magnitude of association became larger at the upper quantiles of the conditional BMI distribution. Girls with good family economic status were more likely to have higher BMIs than those with average family economic status, particularly at the upper quantile of the conditional BMI distribution. Attending a co-ed school was associated with lower BMI for both genders with a larger association at the upper quantiles. Substantial screen time for TV watching, video games, or internet surfing was associated with a higher BMI with a larger association at the upper quantiles for both girls and boys. Dental prevention was negatively associated with BMI, whereas suicide consideration was positively associated with BMIs of both genders with a larger association at a higher quantile.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that interventions aimed at behavioural changes and positive parental roles are needed to effectively address high adolescent BMI. (C) 2015 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: This study aimed at assessing the changes in mental disorders in the French working population between 2006 and 2010, using Rationally representative prospective data and a structured diagnostic interview for major depressive episode (MDE) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and also at exploring the differential changes in mental disorders according to age, origin, occupation, public/private sector, self-employed/employee status and work contract.
   Methods: The data came from the prospective national representative Sante et ltineraire Professionnel (SIP) survey, including a sample of 5600 French workers interviewed in 2006 and 2010. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used to measure MDE and GAD. Analyses were performed using weighted generalized estimation equations, and were stratified by gender.
   Results: No changes in MDE and GAD were observed for both genders among the working population. No differential changes were observed, except one the prevalence of GAD increased among women working in the public sector while there was no change among women in the private sector.
   Limitations: Two data collections over a 4-year period may not capture the effects of the crisis on mental disorders properly.
   Conclusion: No changes in mental disorders between 2006 and 2010 were found but the increase in the prevalence of anxiety among women in the public sector may be of particular interest for prevention policies. High levels of social protection in France might contribute to explain these non-significant results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study assessed the extent to which developmental assets predict or contribute to the reduction of health risk behaviors among Korean adolescents. The concept of developmental assets was introduced by Benson and his colleagues as building blocks for healthy child and adolescent's development. Their framework of 40 developmental assets encompasses positive external environmental factors and internal personal qualities which strongly influence adolescents' quality of life. We analyzed data from our 'Korean Youth Health Related Behaviors and Developmental Assets Survey.' The survey was based on self-reported questionnaires we distributed to 3,739 grade 9 students at eight schools across two cities in South Korea in 2001. The 40 developmental assets were measured by using 5-point Likert scales, and health risk behaviors were measured in terms of the prevalence or the experience rate. We identified the predictors of each health risk behavior among the 40 developmental assets using multiple logistic regression analyses. We found that the assets of 'restraint', 'positive peer influence', and 'time at home' were commonly the most important predictors associated with decreased reports of most health risk behaviors except depression. 'Self-esteem' was the most important predictor of decreased reports of depression and suicide. Other internal and external developmental assets were identified as important predictors to specific behaviors. We concluded that the positive asset promotion approach would be more effective and important than the risk factor approach in preventing effectively health risk behaviors among adolescents, and that intervention programs should include more comprehensive and adolescent-based strategies to promote adolescents' health and quality of life by a multi-level multi-dimensional approach.

AB Although having a mental illness has become common, many people tend to hide their illness and avoid seeking treatment. One of the reasons for not seeking treatment is the stigma of mental illness. Celebrity confessions about their experiences of mental illness can reduce such stigma, because the public obtains more knowledge about the illness and becomes more familiar with it. However, little research has been conducted on the influence of a celebrity's confession about mental illness on the public's health behaviors related to the illness. The present study examined the effects of the media coverage of celebrities with panic disorder on information-seeking, providing information about the illness, and the number of people who visited a psychiatrist in South Korea. For this, we collected all the news articles on celebrities' confessions regarding their panic disorder, search frequency of panic disorder, the number of questions on a Questions & Answers (Q&A) Website, a number of blog posts about panic disorder, and the number of people that visited a psychiatrist for panic disorder between 2010 and 2015. We found that there were positive correlations between the media's coverage of celebrities with panic disorder with other variables. In addition, the search frequency and the number of questions on the Q&A Website were also positively associated with the number of people who visited a psychiatrist. Regression analysis showed that the search frequency was the most significant predictor of the increase in the number of people who visited a psychiatrist for panic disorder.

AB Purpose: In late 2012, South Korea revised the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act to make selected medications including acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and cold medications available in nonpharmacy outlets, including the 24-hour convenient stores (CVS). The objective of this study was to identify whether the characteristics and trend of self-poisonings associated with these medications were altered after the legislative change.
   Methods: A retrospective study was performed using national data from the Emergency Department (ED)-based Injury In-depth Surveillance database. The patients diagnosed with poisoning were sorted from 2011 to 2016 and included in the study. As the Act was implemented from 2013, the demographic characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared before and after January 2013. A piecewise regression analysis was performed to determine the association between the monthly use of acetaminophen, medication for cold, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the incidence of total poisonings before and after the January 2013.
   Results: Among 1536277 patients included in the database, 17523 patients diagnosed with poisoning were enrolled. After the legislative change, the etiology of poisoning did not change, although the frequency of hospitalization from ED was significantly increased. The monthly trend for poisoning due to acetaminophen, cold medications, and NSAIDs showed no significant slope change between before and after the legislative change. The proportional use of acetaminophen and cold medications was significantly decreased, while that of NSAIDs was unchanged before and after the legislative change.
   Conclusions: The change in the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act was not associated with any change in the monthly frequency of medication-related poisoning.

AB Introduction: This study examined the levels of utilitarian walking by age and gender and associations between utilitarian walking, meeting global physical activity guidelines, and psychological well-being in a nationally representative sample of South Korean adolescents.
   Methods: The 2016 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey included complete self-reported data from 60,548 adolescents aged 12-17 years (M age = 14.8 +/- .02). Utilitarian walking was the exposure variable and outcome variables included meeting the World Health Organization's moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) recommendation (>= 60 min/day), happiness, and stress. Covariates included age, gender, area of residence, economic status, and academic performance. The Complex Samples (CS) general linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted.
   Results: A significant age x gender interaction was observed on weekly utilitarian walking. Boys showed higher utilitarian walking than girls (5.8 vs. 5.1 h/wk; p < .001). The age differences were more apparent among girls with younger age generally showing higher utilitarian walking than older age except 12 vs. 13 years (p < .001). Among boys, age differences were only observed for 12 vs. 13 years and 13 vs. 14 years (p < .001). Weekly utilitarian walking for 1-5 h (Odds ratio[OR]: 1.73, 95% Confidence interval[CI]: 1.41-2.13) and > 5 h (OR: 5.26, 95% CI: 4.32-6.41), compared to < 1 h, were associated with meeting the MVPA recommendation (p-for-trend < .001). Compared to adolescents who reported < 1 h/wk on utilitarian walking, those reporting 1-5 h/wk (OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.12-1.25) and > 5 h/wk (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.22-1.37) were associated with higher odds of being happy in a linear fashion (p-for-trend < 0.001) after adjusting for MVPA in addition to covariates. No associations were observed between utilitarian walking and no/low stress.
   Conclusion: Higher levels of utilitarian walking were associated with meeting the MVPA recommendation and being happy. Future studies should investigate the correlates of utilitarian walking to inform interventions and strategies to promote such walking among Korean adolescents.

AB Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of age at onset of the first major depressive episode on the clinical features of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) in a large cohort of Korean depressed patients. Materials and Methods: We recruited 419 MDD patients of age over 18 years from the Clinical Research Center for Depression study in South Korea. At the start of the study, the onset age of the first major depressive episode was self-reported by the subjects. The subjects were divided into four age-at-onset subgroups: childhood and adolescent onset (ages <18), early adult onset (ages 18-44), middle adult onset (ages 45-59), and late onset (ages 60+). Using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and ordinal logistic regression analysis with adjusting the effect of age, the relationships between clinical features and age at onset of MDD were evaluated. Results: There was an apparent, but inconsistent conelotion between clinical features and age at onset. Earlier onset MDD was significantly associated with higher proportion of female gender [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=0.570,p=0.022], more previous suicide attempts (AOR=0.635,p=0.038), greater number of previous depressive episodes (F=3.475, p=0.016) and higher scores on the brief psychiatric rating scale (F=3.254, p=0.022), its negative symptom subscale (F=6.082, p<0.0001), and the alcohol use disorder identification test (F=7.061, p<0.0001). Conclusion: Early age at onset may increase the likelihood of distinguishable MDD subtype, and age at onset of the first major depressive episode is a promising clinical indicator for the clinical presentation, course, and outcome of MDD.

AB Background
   Our current understanding of Asian American mortality patterns has been distorted by the historical aggregation of diverse Asian subgroups on death certificates, masking important differences in the leading causes of death across subgroups. In this analysis, we aim to fill an important knowledge gap in Asian American health by reporting leading causes of mortality by disaggregated Asian American subgroups.
   Methods and Findings
   We examined national mortality records for the six largest Asian subgroups (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese) and non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs) from 2003-2011, and ranked the leading causes of death. We calculated all-cause and cause-specific age-adjusted rates, temporal trends with annual percent changes, and rate ratios by race/ethnicity and sex. Rankings revealed that as an aggregated group, cancer was the leading cause of death for Asian Americans. When disaggregated, there was notable heterogeneity. Among women, cancer was the leading cause of death for every group except Asian Indians. In men, cancer was the leading cause of death among Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese men, while heart disease was the leading cause of death among Asian Indians, Filipino and Japanese men. The proportion of death due to heart disease for Asian Indian males was nearly double that of cancer (31% vs. 18%). Temporal trends showed increased mortality of cancer and diabetes in Asian Indians and Vietnamese; increased stroke mortality in Asian Indians; increased suicide mortality in Koreans; and increased mortality from Alzheimer's disease for all racial/ethnic groups from 2003-2011. All-cause rate ratios revealed that overall mortality is lower in Asian Americans compared to NHWs.
   Conclusions
   Our findings show heterogeneity in the leading causes of death among Asian American subgroups. Additional research should focus on culturally competent and cost-effective approaches to prevent and treat specific diseases among these growing diverse populations.

AB Purpose: Accidental drowning can cause out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We investigated the effect of drowning location on outcomes of individuals who experienced drowning-OHCA.
   Methods: All cases of emergency medical service-treated drowning-OHCA in South Korea from January 2006 to December 2013 were analyzed. Cases were excluded if there was a preceding injury, no information on event location, or suicide. Cases were divided into 4 groups: recreational water with mandatory safety regulations (group 1, public swimming pool; group 2, beach) and nonrecreational water without mandatory safety regulations (group 3, natural freshwater; group 4, seawater). The main outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted using natural freshwater as the reference location.
   Results: We analyzed 1691 drowning-OHCAs (public swimming pools, 3.4%; public beaches, 5.2%; unsupervised seawater, 33.8%; and unsupervised open freshwater, 57.6%). The rate of survival to discharge was 4.6% for all cases, 17.5% for cases in public swimming pools, 9.1% for cases in public beaches, 4.9% for cases in unsupervised seawater, and 3.3% for cases in unsupervised open freshwater (p < 0.01). The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for survival relative to natural freshwater were 3.97 (95% CI, 1.77-8.89) for public swimming pools, 2.81 (95% CI, 1.22-6.45) for public beaches, and 1.54 (95% CI, 0.88-2.70) for unsupervised seawater.
   Conclusion: Individuals who experience drowning-OHCA in public locations with safety regulations had a better rate of survival. There should be improved public awareness of the significantly greater risk of drowning-OHCA in locations that have no safety regulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Our goal was to examine the relationship between attention and suicidal ideation in a school-based adolescent population. This cross-sectional study involved 2,462 students from eight high schools in South Korea (1,021 males and 1,441 females, mean age 17.3 +/- 0.6 years). The participants completed the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and took part in computerized attention tasks. Participants with high SSI scores (16 or higher) exhibited a higher mean number of omission errors (OEs) and commission errors (CEs) on the visual sustained attention tasks than did participants with low SSI scores (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). On the divided attention tasks, the high SSI group exhibited a higher mean number of CEs than the low SSI group did (p < 0.001). In a general linear model adjusting for age, gender, and high BDI (10 or higher), membership in the high OE group in the visual sustained attention tasks was associated with high SSI scores (p = 0.015). Belonging to the high OE or CE group in the divided attention tasks were associated with high SSI scores (p = 0.024 and p = 0.035, respectively). For both the visual sustained and divided attention tasks, interactions between gender and high OE rates were significant (p <= 0.001 and p = 0.013, respectively). In the post hoc analysis, membership in the high OE group was associated with high SSI scores for girls. In a multiple linear regression analysis including all participants and controlling for age, gender, and BDI scores, higher numbers of OEs and CEs on the visual sustained attention tasks predicted higher SSI scores (p < 0.001 and p = 0.019, respectively). On the divided attention task, the number of CEs was positively correlated with the SSI score (p = 0.031). The findings of this study indicate an association between attention deficits and increased suicidal ideation in adolescents after controlling for depressed mood. The current results suggest a direct link between attention deficits and increased suicidality independent of depressive symptoms in adolescents.

AB Background: Although research conducted within the military has assessed the health and mental health problems of military personnel, little information exists about personnel who seek care outside the military. The purpose of this study is to clarify the personal characteristics, mental health diagnoses, and experiences of active duty U.S. military personnel who sought civilian sector services due to unmet needs for care. Materials and Methods: This prospective, multi-method study included 233 clients, based in the United States, Afghanistan, South Korea, and Germany, who obtained care between 2013 and 2016 from a nationwide network of volunteer civilian practitioners. A hotline organized by faith-based and peace organizations received calls from clients and referred them to the network when the clients described unmet needs for physical or mental health services. Intake and follow-up interviews at 2 wk and 2 mo after intake captured demographic characteristics, mental health diagnoses, and reasons for seeking civilian rather than military care. Non-parametric bootstrap regression analyses identified predictors of psychiatric disorders, suicidality, and absence without leave (AWOL). Qualitative analyses of clients' narratives clarified their experiences and reasons for seeking care. The research protocol has been reviewed and approved annually by the Institutional Review Board at the University of New Mexico. Results: Depression (72%), post-traumatic stress disorder (62%), alcohol use disorder (27%), and panic disorder (25%) were the most common diagnoses. Forty-eight percent of clients reported suicidal ideation. Twenty percent were absence without leave. Combat trauma predicted post-traumatic stress disorder (odds ratio [OR] = 8.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.66, 47.12, p = 0.01) and absence without leave (OR = 3.85, 95% CI 1.14, 12.94, p = 0.03). Non-combat trauma predicted panic disorder (OR = 3.64, 95% CI 1.29, 10.23, p = 0.01). Geographical region was associated with generalized anxiety disorder (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49, 0.99, p = 0.05). Significant predictors were not found for major depression, alcohol use disorder, or suicidal ideation. Clients' narrative themes included fear of reprisal for seeking services, mistrust of command, insufficient and unresponsive services, cost as a barrier to care, deception in recruitment, voluntary enlistment remorse, guilt about actual or potential killing of combatants or non-combatant civilians, preexisting mental health disorders, family and household challenges that contributed to distress, and military sexual trauma. Conclusions: Our work clarified substantial unmet needs for services among active duty military personnel, the limitations of programs based in the military sector, and the potential value of civilian sector services that are not linked to military goals. We and our institutional review board opted against using a control group that would create ethical problems stemming from the denial of needed services. For future research, an evaluative strategy that can assess the impact of civilian services and that reconciles ethical concerns with study design remains a challenge. Due to inherent contradictions in the roles of military professionals, especially the double agency that makes professionals responsible to both clients and the military command, the policy alternative of providing services for military personnel in the civilian sector warrants serious consideration, as do preventive strategies such as non-military alternatives to conflict resolution.
