AB Aim: This study aims to determine the characteristics and severity of suicide mortality in Inner Mongolia between 2008 and 2015.
   Methods: The death data between 2008 and 2015 was collected from the Death Registry System,(1) and the suicide mortality were calculated. Suicide mortality for total of eight years and two periods (2008-2011 and 2012-2015) were tested by the X-2-test. Logistic regression analysis was used to test the risk of suicide between these two observation periods by gender and region. The age-specific suicide mortality was displayed through a semi-logarithmic line chart using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Then, the prohibited pesticides and proportion of organophosphorus pesticides were calculated.
   Results: The suicide mortality (7.20/10(5)) in 2008-2011 was higher than the suicide mortality (4.84/10(5)) in 2012-2015 (X-2 = 62.28, P = 0.00). Intentional self-poisoning by and exposure to pesticides(2) and intentional self-harm by hanging(3) were the two main ways of suicide, accounting for nearly 80%. The all-cause suicide mortality increased with age (r = 0.837, P = 0.005) in 2008-2011 and (r = 0.863, P = 0.003) in 2012-2015, and suicide mortality was higher in males than in females.
   Limitation The DRS did not provide the pesticides used by people who committed suicide by pesticide poisoning.
   Conclusion: Suicide mortality dropped like a waterfall in Inner Mongolia between 2008 and 2015, and the most obvious drop was pesticide suicide.The general drop in suicide mortality, especially the drop in pesticide poisoning suicide mortality, may be attributable to social policies that benefited the residents and the prohibition of selected pesticides. Favorable policies can effectively decrease suicide mortality.

DT News Item
AB Mongolia, has been warming more than twice as fast as the global average. Global warming is not a uniform process and unique ecosystems are feeling the heat. The grasslands are on the verge of ecological collapse. The worst weather condition is the dreaded dzud, an ice crust that forms over vegetation when rain freezes. The livestock losses spurred a wave of suicides among herders. Climate change is a serious problem in Mongolia, although Mongolians enjoy one of the highest literacy rates in the world.

AB Background: Although 75% of suicides occur in low-and middle-income countries, few studies have examined suicidal behaviors among young people in these countries. Aims: This study aimed to examine what individual characteristics were associated with suicidal plans and attempts among Mongolian youth and whether suicidal risks and behaviors varied by urban and rural locations. Method: Logistic regression analyses were utilized to investigate suicidal plans and attempts among 5,393 adolescents using the Global Student Health Survey-2013. Results: Adolescents who lived in urban areas were at higher risk for suicidal plans and behaviors than those who lived in rural areas; however, the patterns of suicidal risks were similar. Specifically, individual characteristics, such as being female, feeling lonely and worried, smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, and having fights at school, were associated with suicidal plans and behaviors regardless of the residential places. Limitations: A number of important variables have not been included in the questionnaire such as depression, family and parental support, household income, family constructs etc. Conclusion: Given the comparable patterns of risk between urban and rural adolescents and the relatively high rates of suicidal plans and attempts, similar mental health services and interventions are necessitated for both urban and rural areas.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence and predictors of suicidal behavior among Mongolian high school students. Females were more likely to have suicidal behavior than males. No close friends, feelings of loneliness, insomnia, self perception of underweight or overweight, carrying a weapon were significant predictors of students' suicidal behavior. Missing school without permission, being bullied and going hungry were also important risk factors of suicidal ideation. Families and Schools are important environments to prevent high students' suicide. Improving students' psychological well being, quality of relationship with people, and support resources are critical to prevent suicidal behavior.

AB This paper presents a new way of recycling aluminum and iron in boiler slag derived from coal combustion plants for the production of a sulfate-based complex coagulant containing ferric sulfate and aluminum sulfate. The boiler slag sample was determined for more complete characterization by means of scanning electron microscopy(SEM), X-ray diffraction(XRD), X-ray fluorescence(XRF) and other techniques. An analysis for the boiler slag sample collected from Baotou Steel Plant located in Inner Mongolia, PR China showed that the quantity of iron and aluminum oxides, in general, accounted for about 35% of the boiler slag. XRD analysis indicates that predominate minerals such as kaolinite, quartz, calcium suicide, hematate and metakoalin exist in this boiler slag. This boiler salg was evaluated to determine the efficiency of converting the iron and aluminum components of the material into a sulfate-based complex coagulant when heated with sulfuric acid at different temperatures and reaction times. The maximum concentrations of Fe3+ and Al3+ in the complex coagulant prepared from the boiler slag were obtained at 130 degrees C and after 3 h of reaction time. These concentrations were 0.04 M Fe3+ and 0.46 M Al3+, respectively. The corresponding conversion efficiencies of aluminum and iron were 66.2 and 95.0% in the boiler slag, respectively. Finally, the prepared sulfate-based complex coagulant proved to be an effective agent for reducing the turbidity and chemical oxygen demand(COD) of a typical domestic sewage sample.
