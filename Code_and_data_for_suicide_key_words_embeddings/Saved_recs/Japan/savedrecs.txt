AB Introduction: The number of suicides in Japan sharply increased in 1998, and has continued in recent years. Therefore, suicide is one of the most important social issues in Japan. In this report, we examine the suicide trends and main causative factors of suicide among women in Japan. We also discuss further suicide prevention measures based on the results.
   Materials and Methods: This research examined the annual suicide rate among women in Japan in 1993, 1994, 2003 and 2004, focusing on age-classified suicide rates and the causative factors of suicide in 2003 and 2004. In addition, we compared the suicide rates of the first period (1993 and 1994) and the second (2003 and 2004) in detail.
   Results: "Health problems", both mental and physical, ranked first among causative factors in all age groups; addressing this factor, as well as others, will be important in preventing suicide among women in Japan.
   Conclusion: Suicide prevention based on the causative factors of suicide by age group is of urgent importance.

AB Suicide is a global public health problem and solutions to it can be found only through a global dialog. The suicide rate in Japan has been alarming, but Japan has made substantial efforts to reduce this rate, making prevention a high priority. This report reviews the developmental stages of a comprehensive policy of suicide prevention in Japan from 1998 to 2013. Our review suggests that suicide prevention activities were facilitated by the 2006 Basic Act for Suicide Prevention and the 2007 General Principles of Suicide Prevention Policy. Along with the establishment of a Special Fund program for local governments, the Basic Act and General Principles led to the development of a comprehensive and multi-sector approach to suicide prevention. Suicide rates in Japan, especially among middle-aged men, decreased consistently after 2009, suggesting that the initiatives were effective. Continuous monitoring is needed to evaluate Japan's suicide prevention policy.

AB Purpose
   This study examined trends in the suicide rates of persons with foreign background in Japan.
   Methods
   Using the nationwide death records in the Vital Statistics of Japan, we first reported the age-adjusted suicide rates of 8 foreign nationals (Brazil, China, Korea, Peru, the Philippines, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States) in Japan by sex from 1980 to the mid-2010s. We also computed rate ratios to compare the suicide rate of each group with those of the Japanese population. Second, we focused on Koreans, who had the highest suicide rate in Japan. We compared the suicide rates of Koreans in Japan with Koreans in South Korea to examine whether their suicide rates were more closely related to those of their country of origin or those of their host country.
   Results
   We found that the suicide rates of Koreans and Chinese in Japan were similar to or higher than those of Japanese, while other groups tended to show lower suicide rates. Most notably, Koreans displayed consistently high suicide rates from 1980 to the mid-2010s, which were nearly twice as high as those of the Japanese population. Korean males and females in Japan had higher suicide rates than those in South Korea.
   Conclusions
   Immigrants in Japan were not necessarily influenced by the suicide rates of the host country. The high suicide rates among Korean residents in Japan might be explained by various disadvantages and adversities that they face in Japan.

AB Double-suicide cases have long been common in Japan, particularly among lovers. Classical studies conducted in the 1950s are well known. According to a report by Ohara, the double-suicide rate in Japan was recorded as 3.1% in 1954. Nevertheless, recent tendencies have not been reported. To assess the latest trends of double suicide, extensive studies were conducted in a populous area of Kanagawa, Japan, during 1999-2011. Suicides during the period in the domestic area claimed 23,195 victims. In all, 82 cases of double suicide were extracted, with 170 victims, meaning that double suicides occurred with incidence of 0.73% among all suicides. The mean age and standard deviation were 51.6 +/- 16.1 years, with 83 men and 87 women. The suicide-partner relationships included 40 cases (48.8%) of married couples, 13 (15.9%) of unmarried lovers, and 10 (12.2%) of elderly woman and her son/daughter dyads. No significant difference was found from Western countries in the incidence of double-suicide cases in Japan, except for a higher incidence of suicide involving elderly people and their sons/daughters. The traditional style of double suicide by lovers has become less frequent in modern Japanese society, presumably because of changing marriage styles and values.

AB Suicide is a major public health issue in Japan, with very high rates of death compared to other countries in the Asia Pacific. Foreigners living in Japan may be at increased risk of suicide, but little is known about how their risk of suicide differs from that of their country of origin or Japanese nationals. We used data on suicide mortality from the Japan Vital Registration System for the period 2012-2016 to analyze risk of suicide mortality in Japan for Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and other nationalities living in Japan, adjusting for age and separately by sex. We estimated standardized mortality rates using both the Japanese population as a reference, and also the population of the home nation of the foreign residents. We found that Korean nationals living in Japan have significantly higher mortality rates than Japanese nationals, and that the suicide mortality rate of Korean nationals living in Japan is higher than in their home country, but that this is not the case for Chinese or other nationals resident in Japan. Koreans living in Japan have a very high risk of mortality due to suicide which may reflect the special social, economic, and cultural pressures they face as a marginalized population in Japan.

AB Background: Suicide is one of the leading causes of mortality in both South Korea and Japan. Aims: The study aims to compare the descriptive epidemiology of suicide over the last two decades (1985-2006) and to explore the conditions associated with the different distribution of suicides in both countries. Methods: Age-standardized suicide rates were obtained from the OECD Health Data 2009. Age-specific suicide rates for the age groups were calculated from the WHO Mortality Database. Suicide methods were identified based on ICD-10. Results: Through 1980-2000, Japan showed consistently higher suicide rates compared to Korea. However, from the mid-1990s, Korea showed an acute increase of suicides and finally surpassed Japan; the age-standardized suicide rate of Korea increased from 10.2 (per 100,000) in 1985 to 21.5 in 2006, while it slightly increased from 18.4 to 19.1 in Japan. The highest age-specific suicide rate was observed among Japanese men aged 45-64 years and Korean men aged over 64 years. The increase of elderly suicides among Korean women was notable. The gender ratio increased in Japan and decreased in Korea, respectively. The preferred suicide methods were hanging and pesticide poisoning in Korea and hanging in Japan. Because of the limited number of observations, hypothesis testing of specific risk factors was not possible. Conclusions: Age and gender distribution of suicide rates differed considerably between the two countries. Welfare protection throughout the life course in both countries, and pesticide regulation in Korea would be helpful in reducing the burden of suicide mortality in both countries, even if the social values could not be changed in a short time.

   RECOGNITION; AWARENESS
AB Design, Materials and Methods: A recent nationwide increase in the number of suicides in Japan has been noted. According to a study by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, the yearly average number of suicides nationwide totaled 22,410 from 1988 to 1997 but exceeded 30,000 starting in 1998; this steep rise has become a major social issue. However, the current reality is that recent epidemiological studies of suicide, studies on the contexts of suicide, and examination of suicide prevention measures have had absolutely no effect. The fact is that in 2005 as well the yearly average number of suicides in Japan exceeded 30,000; realistic suicide prevention measures linked to a decline in the number of suicides must be promptly taken. Thus, we reviewed suicide prevention measures previously implemented in Japan and we considered whether specific suicide prevention measures could be elucidated in light of these results, as we reported here.
   Results and Conclusion: We reviewed previous suicide prevention measures by individual age groups in Japan. As a result, we found that previous suicide prevention measures in Japan focused on measures for the elderly. Nevertheless, the current reality is that previously implemented suicide prevention measures have not been linked to a decline in the number of suicides. What did have an effect was in the form of measures to deal with suicides implemented at the local level. In addition, factors for the recent increase in the number of suicides in Japan were unemployment and overwork among middle-aged men. That is, future measures targeting unemployment and overwork among middle-aged men must be implemented and seek to decrease the number of suicides. Successes with suicide prevention measures overseas were implemented at the national level, and measures with respect to numerous contexts were implemented for individual age groups. With the medical establishment, police, and government in step at the national level, suicide prevention measures with respect to the major contexts of suicide in Japan should also be undertaken with local residents at the local level as well. Rather than immediately concluding suicide prevention measures after decline in the number of suicides has been indicated, these measures should be implemented on a long-term basis.

AB Objective Lethality of the chosen method during a suicide attempt is a strong risk factor for completion of suicide. We examined whether annual changes in the pattern of suicide methods is related to annual changes in suicide rates among older adults in South Korea and Japan.
   Methods We analyzed annual the World Health Organization data on rates and methods of suicide from 2000 to 2011 in South Korea and Japan.
   Results For Korean older adults, there was a significant positive correlation between suicide rate and the rate of hanging or the rate of jumping, and a significant negative correlation between suicide rate and the rate of poisoning. Among older adults in Japan, annual changes in the suicide rate and the pattern of suicide methods were less conspicuous, and no correlation was found between them.
   Conclusion The results of the present study suggest that the increasing use of lethal suicide methods has contributed to the rise in suicide rates among older adults in South Korea. Targeted efforts to reduce the social acceptability and accessibility of lethal suicide methods might lead to lower suicide rate among older adults in South Korea.

AB By focusing on the elderly suicide rates, this study lays out the different suicide regulation and prevention policies of three developed countries - Japan, the Netherlands, and South Korea. The main goal is to compare and analyze how these policies, with disparate ways of handling suicide, influence elderly suicide rates in relation with their countries' respective differing suicide determinants. By applying the 'Method for Synthesizing about Public Policies' created by Morestin, Gauvin, Hogue, and Benoit to check the status of efficiency and of any issues of public policies, it concludes that South Korea shows promise, while Japan's suicide rates have certainly been scaling down. Conversely, in terms of the use of euthanasia, suicide rates in the Netherlands have been continuously rising.

The number of suicides has remained at about 30,000 every year since 1998. Middle-aged (55-59 years) and elderly men have especially high suicide rates. In 2002, The Council of Learned People on Measures Against Suicides (organized by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare) released its report on national suicide prevention strategies. Although national suicide prevention strategies have just begun to be established, some prefectures or regions have undertaken unique suicide prevention measures.

AB Introduction, and Materials and Methods: In 1998, the number of suicides increased rapidly in Japan and they have continued at this level since then. This situation presents a very serious social problem in Japan. In the present study, we examined data regarding the monthly distribution of suicide in 10 prefectures with the 5 highest (Akita, Iwate, Shimane, Yamagata and Miyazaki) and 5 lowest (Nara, Tokushima, Okayama, Kanagawa and Kyoto) suicide rates in Japan and nationally in Japan during 32-year period. We also calculated the average number of suicides per day in each month.
   Results and Conclusion: During the study period, suicide rates among each men and women tended to be high from March to July; they also tended to be high in September. Therefore, although it is important to carry out suicide prevention measures continuously, they must be strengthened from spring to early summer as well as in early autumn. Suicide prevention measures should also be implemented in cooperation with relevant organizations and citizens.

ID SENILE DEPRESSION; CHOLESTEROL
AB Design, and Materials and Methods: A recent increase in the number of suicides in Japan has been noted. According to Vital Statistics of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare suicide deaths in Japan numbered about 23,500 in 1997 but rose sharply to about 32,000 in 1998, marking a peak in suicide deaths. Afterwards, the number of suicides surpassed 30,000 annually and the number remains high. According to some reports in Japan, health problems including mental health problems were most frequently the major problem faced by individuals upon their suicide. Therefore, we have primarily reviewed suicide due to physical illness in Japan and we hope this review leads to the formulation of new measures to prevent suicide.
   Results and Conclusion: We reviewed suicide due to physical illness primarily in Japan. There are several reports that physical illness, be it cancer or not, is linked to suicide. Various physical illnesses have been linked to suicide. Succumbing to suicide from an exhausted mental state due to physical illness has also often been observed. In routine practice, we must fully ascertain not only the patient's illness but his or her mental state as well. Moreover, we must also convey this to not only the patient but also to the patient's family so that they can ascertain the patient's symptoms. Measures to prevent suicide due to physical illness must be taken not just by the medical establishment but must also be considered at the regional and national level.

AB Following the economic crash of the late 1990s, the suicide rate in Japan increased to a rate of over 30000 people per year and has been one of the highest in the world. Cultural factors have influenced this high suicide rate, such as a tradition of honorable suicide as well as permissive attitudes towards suicide that remain in modern times. Additionally, the economic downturn, particularly the trend of unemployment in middle-aged men, also played a significant role in the high suicide rate. The suicide rate has started to decrease in recent years perhaps in part due to suicide prevention measures undertaken by the government.

AB Objective: Suicide is one of the major social issues in Japan. According to a report of the National Policy Agency, there were approximately 22 000 to 24 000 annual suicides between 1994 and 1997 and there have been over 30 000 annual suicides in Japan since 1998. For these reasons, we think it is important to discuss the economic factor related to suicides in recent years.
   Method: In this study, we examined suicide rates and the average disposable income per household in Japan in the last 15 years (ie 1994-2008) and discussed the statistical analysis of the average disposable income per household and the associated suicide rates.
   Results and Discussion: During the research period, annual suicide rates per 100 000 population in Japan ranged from 16.9 to 25.5 among the total population, from 23.1 to 38.0 among men, and from 10.9 to 14.7 among women. The annual average disposable income per household (ten thousand yen) ranged from 424.0 to 549.9. The average disposable income per household was related to the suicide rate among the total population and among men. The average disposable income per household was not related to the suicide rate among women.
   Conclusion: We believe that this discussion will be useful in developing specific suicide preventive measures.

AB Japan and South Korea have among the highest suicide rates in the world. However, the age, gender, and time trends in each country differ substantially. Age-Period-Cohort (APC) analysis of suicide rates was conducted to better understand these differences. Using age- and gender-specific data on suicide between 1986 and 2015 in Japan and Korea, we implemented APC analysis to decompose the country-specific trends into age, calendar period, and birth cohort effects. APC analysis revealed three trends: (1) there was a sharp increase in suicide around retirement age in Korea but not in Japan (age effect); (2) there was a dramatic increase in suicide during the three decades of observation in Korea (period effect) whereas rates were more stable in Japan; and (3) the post-War generation in Japan (including baby boomer) had lower rates of suicide compared to generations born before 1916 or after 1961 (birth cohort effect), whereas suicide rate has increased linearly in each generation in Korea. Although Japan & Korea share high suicide rates, our APC analysis suggests divergent causes underlying these trends. Japanese suicide rates plateaued among the cohorts who experienced the post-War rapid economic growth (women born in 1951-1956 and men born in 1916-1961) (birth cohort effect) due to a strong social safety net for this cohort, while suicide rates in Korea continue to rise with each generation and is particularly elevated in post-retirement age. Japan and Korea need to pay more attention to suicide prevention in more recent birth cohorts.

AB This study investigates suicide rates among OECD countries, with particular effort made to gain insight into how suicide in Japan is different from suicides in other OECD countries. Several findings emerged from fixed-effect panel regressions with country-specific time-trends. First, the impacts of socioeconomic variables vary across different gender-age groups. Second, in general, better economic conditions such as high levels of income and higher economic growth were found to reduce the suicide rate, while income inequality increases the suicide rate. Third, the suicide rate is more sensitive to economic factors captured by real GDP per capita, growth rate of real GDP per capita, and the Gini index than to social factors represented by divorce rate, birth rate. female labor force participation rate, and alcohol consumption. Fourth, female and elderly suicides are more difficult to be accounted for. Finally, in accordance with general beliefs, Japan's suicide problem is very different from those of other OECD countries. The impact of the socioeconomic variables on suicide is greater in Japan than in other OECD countries. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Depression is considered the primary risk factor for older people's suicide. When considering suicide measures, it is necessary to clarify the relationship between depressive symptoms, social capital, and suicide rates. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the relationship between community-level social capital, depressive symptoms, and suicide rates among older people in Japan. We analyzed the data gathered from 63,026 men and 72,268 women aged 65 years and older, totaling 135,294 subjects in 81 municipalities with a population of over 100,000 participants in the 2013 Sixth Long-Term Care Needs Survey and another survey conducted by Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES) in 2013 including the same question items as the survey in Japan. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the male suicide standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was positively correlated with depressive symptoms (B = 2.318, p = 0.002), and received emotional support (B = -2.622, p = 0.014) had a negative correlation with the male suicide SMR. In older males particularly, the received emotional support in the community was independently associated with the suicide rate. Therefore, fostering social support in a community could act as a countermeasure to suicide among older males in Japan.

ID YOUTH SUICIDE; HONG-KONG; ENGLAND; TRENDS; IMPACT; TAIWAN; WALES
AB An epidemic of carbon monoxide poisoning suicide by burning charcoal occurred in Hong Kong and Taiwan. An epidemic also emerged in Japan from February 2003 and resulted in an increase of 10-20 % in overall suicide rates in younger adults (aged < 45 years) in the mid-2000s. We investigated the spatial and temporal evolution of the epidemic to assess its impact on the epidemiology of suicide in Japan.
   Mortality data were obtained from the official vital statistics of Japan. Smoothed standardized mortality ratios of charcoal-burning and non-charcoal-burning suicide were estimated for the period 2003-2013 using Bayesian hierarchical models. Joinpoint regression analysis was performed to analyze secular trends in suicide rates by gender, method used and geographic location between 1999 and 2013.
   Suicide by burning charcoal rose sharply in the mid-2000s and was not accompanied by a simultaneous decline in alternative methods. The epidemic of charcoal-burning suicide in Japan showed a pronounced spatial pattern, being concentrated in rural prefectures particularly among males. For men but not women, the epidemic contributed to the widening of urban-rural disparities in suicide rates (higher rates in rural areas).
   Our results differ from previous research in other Asian countries (e.g., Taiwan), where the epidemic of charcoal-burning suicide emerged more prominently in urban areas. In Japan, the introduction and diffusion of charcoal burning contributed to a real excess in suicide rates, as well as a widening of the urban/rural disparity in suicide.

AB Using time series techniques, this paper examines the relationship between the suicide rate and income inequality in Japan. Since both the suicide rate and income inequality (Gini coefficient) in Japan are integrated of order one for the sample period 1951-2007, the existence of cointegration is a prerequisite for the successful modeling of their relationship. The Durbin-Hausman test shows that the suicide rate is cointegrated with income inequality and the unemployment rate. The dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) and fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) methods demonstrate that income inequality and the unemployment rate are positively and significantly related to the suicide rate in Japan, and there is evidence supporting the parameter stability of our suicide model. Furthermore, the lag-augmented vector autoregression (LA-VAR) approach shows that there exists unidirectional Granger-causality from income inequality to the suicide rate. Hence, the fluctuations in Japan's suicide rate are partially explained by income inequality.

AB The patterns of association between age and suicide rate vary by country, subpopulation and gender, and over time. To shed light on factors associated with these differences, we analysed suicide data from four populations, two 'Western' (Australia, the United States [US]) and two Asian (Japan and Hong Kong). We computed suicide rates in five-year age-groups (between 10 and 14 years and 85+ years) for men and women separately, and present graphical representations of the age patterns during selected five-year periods. Rates and age patterns differed markedly, as did gender patterns except in Hong Kong. In 1964-8, male suicide rates in Australia and US were represented by upward-sloping graphs, whereas in Japan the pattern was bimodal. By 1979-83, male patterns in Australia and US were bimodal, but Japan's was trimodal, including a middle-age peak reached in 1994-98. In contrast, female age patterns in the Western countries were shallowly convex or uniform, while in Hong Kong and Japan the upward-sloping graphs became, over time, less steep; by 2009-13, the pattern in Japan was uniform (flat). In recent decades, suicide rates of older men in Australia, US and Japan, and older women in Japan and Hong Kong, have fallen considerably. Suicide rates of men aged 45-64 in Australia and US also fell, though by 2009-13 the US rate had risen again. The suicide rate of Australian men in their twenties halved between 1994-98 and 2009-13, while rates for younger men and women in Japan have risen since 1994-98. In Hong Kong, suicide rates of young men have increased. Age patterns of suicide likely reflect period and cohort effects shaped by socioeconomic stressors, availability of health and welfare services, access to lethal methods of suicide, and other factors. Greater understanding of their impact on age patterns of suicide can result in potential preventive solutions.

AB Suicide rates in Japan have increased dramatically in recent years, making Japan's male rate the highest among developed economies. This study revises the standard economic model of suicide to accommodate Japan's experience, focusing on the change in human capital for the unemployed. We then use the new model and detrended data to empirically investigate the relationship between the suicide cycle and the unemployment cycle. Unlike previous aggregate time series studies, we find that the relationship between the suicide rate and the unemployment rate is significantly and robustly positive for both men and women even after controlling for several social variables.

AB The annual number of suicides in Japan totaled around 23,000 in 1997 and abruptly increased to around 31,000 in 1998. This figure has remained high since then. This abrupt increase in the number of suicides was primarily due to an increase in suicides occasioned by economic concerns. The association between various economic factors and suicide must be studied in detail and over the long term in order to ascertain the association between economic concerns and suicide. This study examined the relative poverty rate and the suicide rate in Japan over 30 years and discussed the association between those two rates. The results suggest that the relative poverty rate may be associated with the suicide rate for both sexes. This association is true for men in particular. The organizations and professionals involved in implementing suicide prevention measures should be cognizant of the current findings and consider formulating additional specific measures.

DE suicide; divorce; unemployment; Japan; Australia
ID PREFECTURE; INCREASES
AB Design and Materials and Methods: Japan has a high suicide rate, ranking tenth in the world. The suicide rate in Australia is relatively low in comparison with other countries. In Japan as well as other countries, most important events occurred after 1990. Therefore, in the present study, we researched the annual suicide, unemployment, GDP growth, and divorce rates and compared each of these between Japan, which has a high suicide rate, and Australia, which had a low suicide rate during 1990-2000. Additionally, we assessed the correlation of the suicide rates with the unemployment, GDP growth, and divorce rates in both Japan and Australia.
   Results and Conclusion: During the study period in Japan, the annual suicide rates correlated significantly with the annual unemployment rates: r(11) = 0.92, F-(1,F- 9) = 53.12, and p < 0.001 (y = 3.48x + 7.93), while they did not correlate with the annual GDP growth rates: r(11) = 0.52 and p = 0.10 (y = -1.00x + 20.82). Moreover, the annual suicide rates correlated significantly with the annual divorce rates: r(11) = 0.91, F-(1,F- 9)= 43.59, and p < 0.001 (y = 12.68x - 1.87). In Australia, the annual suicide rates did not correlate with the annual unemployment (r(11) = 0.28 and p = 0.40 (y = -0.16x + 14.28)), GDP growth (r(11) = 0.02 and p = 0.96 (y = 0.01x + 12.93)), and divorce rates (r(11) = 0.19 and p = 0.58 (y = 1.49x + 8.93)). Therefore, each country's administration, medical staff, police, and citizens should pay close attention to the increase in suicide rates when the unemployment and divorce rates show an increasing trend, particularly in countries that already have a high suicide rate, such as Japan.

AB Introduction: The rapid increase in suicide since 1998 is a major social issue in Japan. In Shimane Prefecture, Japan, it is also necessary to discuss suicide prevention from various angles.
   Materials and Methods: This research examined trends for suicide from 1995-2006 in Shimane Prefecture. The number of suicides by sex, age group, and suicide rates in 1995-1996 and 2005-2006 were compared. In addition, this report examined the current state of suicide prevention measures taken in Shimane Prefecture, and further suicide prevention measures are discussed.
   Results and Discussion: The total number of suicides increased in 1998, and this trend has continued since, except in 2005. There were more suicides among men during 2005-2006 than there were during 1995-1996. Men in the age groups ages 20-29, 30-39, 50-59, 70-79, and 80 or over had higher suicides in 2005-2006 than in 1995-1996. There were numerous suicides among women in the 70-79 age groups and in those 80 or over in both 1995-1996 and 2005-2006. Suicide prevention measures in Shimane Prefecture have been carried out to some extent. Suicide prevention measures must be discussed in concert among various fields in order to establish more effective suicide prevention measures in the future.

AB Sex differences in suicide rates and suicide methods was compared among adolescents in South Korea, Japan, Finland, and the United States. This study analyzed suicide rates and suicide methods of adolescents aged 15-19 years in four countries, using the World Health Organization mortality database. Among both male and female adolescents, the most common method of suicide was jumping from heights in South Korea and hanging in Japan. In Finland, jumping in front of moving objects and firearms were frequently used by males, but not by females. In the United States, males were more likely to use firearms, and females were more likely to use poison. The male to female ratio of suicide rates was higher in the United States (3.8) and Finland (3.6) than in Korea (1.3) and Japan (1.9). Sex differences in suicide methods may contribute to differences in the suicide rates among males and female adolescents in different countries.

AB Background Suicide is a major social and health issue in Japan. We assessed prevalence of attempted suicide and explored individual, interpersonal, behavioral, and psychological risk factors associated with attempted suicide in a general community sample of youth in a metropolitan Japanese city. Method Survey of 2,095 participants age between 15 and 24 who were recruited using street-intercept techniques. Results Overall, 6% of males and 11% of females reported a prior suicide attempt. For males, attempted suicide was independently associated with experience of school bullying, being homosexual or bisexual, history of drug use, experience of unwanted sex, history of a diagnosed sexually transmitted infection, and low self-esteem. For females, attempted suicide was independently associated with being younger (ages 15-19 compared to 20-24), experience of school bullying, history of drug use, and history of smoking. Conclusion Prevention intervention programs for youth in Japan are necessary to achieve national aims to reduce attempted suicides and suicide mortality.

AB Existing models for understanding suicide fail to account for the distinctiveness of Internet group suicide, a recent phenomenon in Japan. Drawing from an ethnography of Internet suicide websites, two social commentaries in Japanese popular culture, and the work of developmental psychologist Philippe Rochat, I argue that participation in Internet suicide forums and even the act of Internet group suicide result from both a need for social connectedness and the fear of social rejection and isolation that this need engenders. These needs and fears are especially strong in the case of Japan, where the dominant cultural rhetoric ties selfhood closely to the social self that is the object of perception and experience by others. I show how such an understanding of Internet group suicide helps us to understand some of its basic characteristics, which are otherwise difficult to explain and which have puzzled the Japanese media and popular accounts: the "ordinariness" or casual nature of Internet group suicide, the wish for an easy or comfortable death, the wish to die with others, and the wish to "vanish." Internet group suicide sheds light on questions of Japanese selfhood in modernity and expands our understanding of suicide in Japan in general.

AB After the launch of governmental financial support for the development of a regional suicide prevention programme, 'Emergency Fund to Enhance Community-Based Suicide Countermeasure' in 2009, suicide mortality rates in Japan have decreased from 25.7 (in 2009) to 16.5 (in 2018) per 100,000 population. Therefore, to explore the effects of governmental financial support on suicide mortality rates in Japan, the present study determined the relationship between the trends of empirical Bayes standardised Mobile Ratio of suicide mortality ratio in all 47 Japanese prefectures (EBSMR-RR) and the execution amounts of 10 sub-divisions of 'Emergency Fund to Enhance Community-Based Suicide Countermeasure' using stepwise multiple regression analysis. The female EBSMR-RR was only significantly/inversely related to the municipal 'development of listeners and leaders', whereas male EBSMR-RR was significantly/inversely related to prefectural 'enlightenment', and 'intervention models', but significantly/directly related to prefectural 'personal consultation support'. The present findings suggest the inverse relationship between financial support and the suicide mortality rates in Japan. Furthermore, the independent factors in the reduction of suicide mortality rates between males and females provide important information for planning a scientifically evidence-based and more cost-effective regional suicide prevention programmes.

AB There were more than 30,000 suicides in 1998 in Japan, and since then, the numbers have remained high. In 2009, the number of suicides per a day was c. 90. This phenomenon constitutes a major social problem. One of the major reasons for the rapid increase in the number of suicides appears to be the worsening economic problems. It is therefore necessary to research the relationship between economic issues and suicide. In this study, we examined the relationship between the value of the Nikkei Stock Average and suicide rates in Japan. The value of the Nikkei Stock Average may be related to suicide among men. On the basis of the results, relevant researchers and organizations should understand the factors that relate to suicide to better carry out specific suicide prevention measures.

AB Suicide is a major public health concern in Japan. This study aimed to characterize the trends in suicide mortality in Japan by method since 1979. Using data from the Japan vital registration system, we calculated age-standardized rates of suicide mortality separately by sex and method. We conducted a log-linear regression of suicide mortality rates separately by sex, and linear regression analysis of the proportion of deaths due to hanging, including a test for change in level and trend in 1998. While crude suicide rates were static over the time period, age-adjusted rates declined. The significant increase in suicide mortality in 1998 was primarily driven by large changes in the rate of hanging, with suicide deaths after 1998 having 36.7% higher odds of being due to hanging for men (95% CI: 16.3-60.8%), and 21.9% higher odds of being due to hanging for women (95% CI: 9.2-35.9%). Hanging has become an increasingly important method for committing suicide over the past 40 years, and although suicide rates have been declining continuously over this time, more effort is needed to prevent hanging and address the potential cultural drivers of suicide if the rate is to continue to decline in the future.

AB Background: Previous investigations regarding the effects of suicide reports in the media on suicide incidence in Japan have been limited and inconclusive and, although Internet use has greatly increased, its influence on suicide is completely unknown. Thus, the relationship between newspaper articles about suicide, Internet use, and the incidence of suicide in Japan was examined.
   Methods: A linear model was fitted to time series data from January 1987 to March 2005 (218 months).
   Results: Consistent with previous findings, the number of newspaper articles about suicide was a predictor of suicide among both male and female subjects. Internet use was also a predictor of suicide among males, probably because males spent more time online than females.
   Conclusion: Because this is the first, preliminary study examining the association between Internet use and suicide, further research is required to verify the present findings.

ID MENTAL-DISORDERS; COMORBIDITY; FEATURES
AB Background: The incidence of suicide has increased markedly in Japan since 1998. As psychological autopsy is not generally accepted in Japan, surveys of suicide attempts, an established risk factor of suicide, are highly regarded. We have carried out this study to gain insight into the psychiatric aspects of those attempting suicide in Japan.
   Methods: Three hundred and twenty consecutive cases of attempted suicide who were admitted to an urban emergency department were interviewed, with the focus on psychosocial background and DSM-IV diagnosis. Moreover, they were divided into two groups according to the method of attempted suicide in terms of lethality, and the two groups were compared.
   Results: Ninety-five percent of patients received a psychiatric diagnosis: 81% of subjects met the criteria for an axis I disorder. The most frequent diagnosis was mood disorder. The mean age was higher and living alone more common in the high-lethality group. Middle-aged men tended to have a higher prevalence of mood disorders.
   Conclusion: This is the first large-scale study of cases of attempted suicide since the dramatic increase in suicides began in Japan. The identification and introduction of treatments for psychiatric disorders at emergency departments has been indicated to be important in suicide prevention.

AB Background: In Japan, a dramatic rise in suicide rates was observed in the 1950s, especially among the younger population, and then the rate decreased rapidly again in the 1960s. The aim of this study was to assess secular trends in method-specific suicides by gender and age in Japan between 1950 and 1975. We paid special attention to suicides by poisoning (solid and liquid substances), and their contribution to dramatic swings in the overall suicide rate in Japan during the 1950s and 1960s.
   Methods: Mortality and population data were obtained from the Vital Statistics of Japan and Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan, respectively. We calculated method-specific age-standardized suicide rates by gender and age group (15-29, 30-49, or 50+ years).
   Results: The change in the suicide rate during the research period was larger in males than females in all age groups, and was more marked among people aged 15-29 years compared to those aged 30-49 years and 50 years or over. Poisoning by solid and liquid substances overwhelmingly contributed to the dramatic change in the overall suicide rates in males and females aged 15-49 years in the 1950s and 1960s. For the peak years of the rise in poisoning suicides, bromide was the most frequently used substance.
   Conclusions: Our results for the 1950s and 1960s in Japan illustrated how assessing secular trends in method-specific suicides by gender and age could provide a deeper understanding of the dramatic swings in overall suicide rate. Although rapid increases or decreases in suicide rates have been also observed in some countries or regions recently, trends in method-specific suicides have not been analyzed because of a lack of data on method-specific suicide in many countries. Our study illustrates how the collection and analysis of method-specific data can contribute to an understanding of dramatic shifts in national suicide rates.

DE recent; Japan; factor; the number of new housing starts; suicide; rate
AB Introduction: The number of suicides in Japan has increased rapidly, with over 30,000 in 1998 and over 30,000 in 2010. We have studied potential indicators of suicide trends in detail to decrease of suicides.
   Materials and Methods: We researched the annual suicide rates and the number of new housing starts, and we discuss whether the number of new housing starts is an indicator of suicide trends.
   Results: From 1974-1988, there was no significant relationship between the number of new housing starts and suicide rates for either men or women. From 1994-2008, however, this relationship was significant for both men and women.
   Conclusion: Based on these results, the number of new housing starts may serve as an indicator of recent suicide trends for both men and women.

ID DEPRESSION; TRENDS
AB In recent years there have been over 30000 suicides annually in Japan. This is one of the most serious problems for Japanese society. Because mental disorder is closely associated with suicide, factors related to the increase in mental disorders and suicides should be clarified. In this study, various data regarding social factors were evaluated to assess the correlation of the number of patients with mental disorders and suicides among the 47 prefectures of Japan. Various data regarding social factors, such as income, savings, or rate of divorce, were obtained from the database of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan. Among the factors, the annual income and the amount of savings were significantly correlated with the number of patients with mental disorder. On the other hand, while the annual income did not have a significant correlation with suicides, the amount of savings had a significant correlation with suicides. In conclusion, the annual income and amount of savings may both be one of the important factors involved in mental disorders, and the savings may also be a factor affecting suicides. These analyses are valuable in helping to clarify the causes of mental disease, and can hopefully contribute to the health and welfare of Japanese.

AB The authors designed a questionnaire to investigate the differences in German and Japanese general Practitioners' (GP) awareness of suicide and attitudes toward patients with suicidal ideation in their respective societies. The purpose of this study was to obtain insights leading to a better means of suicide prevention in primary care in Japan. The background for conducting the study was declining suicides in the past 20 years and the lower suicide rate in Germany compared with the present situation in Japan, where the number of suicides has in recent years continued to exceed 30,000, resulting in a suicide rate approximately 2 times higher than that in Germany. The questionnaire was randomly mailed to GPs in Okayama-Prefecture (western Japan) and Hamburg-State (northern Germany) and was collected in the same way. The patterns of answers were compared between the 2 countries, and the differences were statistically analyzed. Japanese GPs seem to have a lower will to prevent suicide in daily practice compared to German GPs and a great lack of knowledge about treatment of suicidal patients. These observations suggest that improving GPs' interest in the problem of suicide and providing training programs for the treatment of patients with suicidal intentions might be a means of achieving better suicide prevention in Japan.

AB Background: In the past two decades, rates of suicide mortality have declined among most OECD member states. Two notable exceptions are Japan and South Korea, where suicide mortality has increased by 20 % and 280 %, respectively.
   Methods: Population and suicide mortality data were collected through national statistics organizations in Japan and South Korea for the period 1985 to 2010. Age, period of observation, and birth cohort membership were divided into five-year increments. We fitted a series of intrinsic estimator age-period-cohort models to estimate the effects of age-related processes, secular changes, and birth cohort dynamics on the rising rates of suicide mortality in the two neighboring countries.
   Results: In Japan, elevated suicide rates are primarily driven by period effects, initiated during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. In South Korea, multiple factors appear to be responsible for the stark increase in suicide mortality, including recent secular changes, elevated suicide risks at older ages in the context of an aging society, and strong cohort effects for those born between the Great Depression and the aftermath of the Korean War.
   Conclusion: In spite of cultural, demographic and geographic similarities in Japan and South Korea, the underlying causes of increased suicide mortality differ across these societies-suggesting that public health responses should be tailored to fit each country's unique situation.

AB The number of suicides in Japan has increased from approximately 22,000 per year in 1988-1997 to over 30,000 per year since then. It has also increased in Mie prefecture during that period. In the present study, we investigated the correlation between annual suicide rates in Mie prefecture, Japan from 1996-2002 and the annual unemployment rate in Japan from 1996-2002 among males. Among the results, annual suicide rates in total correlated with the unemployment rate in Japan, but the relation was not statistically significant: r(7)=0.76, r(2) (7)=0.58, p=0.05 (y=3.54x+6.37); the rates in males, however, correlated significantly with the unemployment rate in Japan: r(7)=0.85, r(2) (7)=0.73,p=0.01 (y=5.72x+4.49). In addition, we found that annual suicide rates in total correlated significantly with the male unemployment rates. When a patient is unemployed and in a bad situation, the medical staff and the family should be aware of the correspondence between suicide rates and unemployment.

AB Introduction: The number of suicides in Japan has increased from approximately 22,000 per year from 1988-1997 to over 30,000 per year since then. The number of suicides in Mie Prefecture as well, has increased after 1997. In the Japanese economy, the bubble collapsed in the 1990s, and the unemployment rates in Japan have increased rapidly since 1998.
   Design, Materials, and Methods: We investigated the total number of suicides and the suicide rates in Mie Prefecture from 1995-2002 in cooperation with the First Department of Criminal Investigation of the Mie Prefectural Police Headquarters. We also investigated the unemployment rates from 1995-2002 in cooperation with the Department of Work in Mie Prefecture. We focused on the correlation of annual suicide rates in Mie Prefecture with the unemployment rates in Japan during the test period.
   Results and Conclusion: The number of suicides was 2,183 for males and 1,099 for females. The total annual suicide rates correlated significantly with the unemployment rates in Japan: r(8) = 0.83, r(2)(8) = 0.68, p = 0.01; the suicide rates for males correlated significantly with the unemployment rates in Japan: r(8) = 0.91, r(2)(8) = 0.82, p = 0.002. On the other hand, the suicide rates for females did not correlate with the unemployment rates in Japan: r(8) = 0.34, r(2)(8) = 0.12, p = 0.40. Our results indicate that unemployment, which is an important factor in suicide in general, seems to be particularly relevant for the increase in suicide rates in males. When male patients are in a difficult situation on account of being unemployed, the family and medical staff should pay close attention to the patient.

ID SEVERE ECONOMIC RECESSION; UNEMPLOYMENT; MORTALITY; RATES
AB Design, Materials and Methods: A recent nationwide increase in the number of suicides in Japan has been noted. Japan's yearly average number of suicides nationwide exceeded 30,000 after 1998; this steep rise has become a major social issue. A decline in the number of suicides is not apparent today, and suicide prevention measures must be promptly studied. Thus, we reviewed previously reported risk factors and danger signs for suicide in an easy-to-understand format and hope this effort assists in suicide prevention.
   Results and Conclusion: We summarized risk factors for suicide and suicide precursors. In order to prevent suicide, risk factors for suicide and suicide precursors should be kept in mind based on, in addition to administrative, police, medical, and welfare aspects, aspects in terms of the community, family, and colleagues in the workplace. Doing so and distinguishing these signs in the early stages will be linked to a true decline in the suicide rate. Moreover, a framework for cooperation of the community and residents with the. administration and police should be further enhanced and linked to a prompt decline in the suicide rate.

AB Japan has the highest suicide rates among the OECD countries and this public health problem seems to be accelerating in over the recent decades. Investigating and understanding the suicidal behaviour is of crucial importance to society and health policy makers. Such an investigation could provide with useful information for those responsible in formulating the national policies on suicide prevention. This study estimates dynamic econometric models for total, male and female suicides in Japan for the period of 1957-2009. Using the ARDL approach to cointegration, we find that the associations of suicide with sociological factors (divorce and fertility rates) were stronger than those with economic factors (per capita GDP and unemployment) for females.

AB During the recent half decade, Japan's suicide rate at approximately 25 deaths per 100 000 people has been one of the highest rates in the world. From the perspective of suicide prevention by restricting access to suicidal means, the aim of the present study was to examine what kind of suicidal method increased during prolonged economic slump. During 21 years (1981-2001), for all suicide victims (5161 cases) the gender, age, and suicide methods were investigated. The yearly full unemployment rate was also used as a representative socioeconomic factor during the same periods in Japan using government statistics, and the relationship between methods of suicide and full unemployment rate was investigated. Pearson's correlation suggested that there was a significant correlation only for hanging rate (r=0.736, P<0.001), but not for the percentages of other methods of suicide. This finding that unemployed persons may have a susceptibility towards certain suicide methods could help in the prevention of suicides. Mental health in Japan should be given more attention, especially for the working population, and social programs offering help should be considered widely.

AB Objective: Suicide rates in Japan were high in 1998 and have remained high since then. Many researchers have discussed the current state of suicide in Japan and the world; however, there are various opinions about the relationship between suicide and climate.
   Subjects and Method: In the present study, we report on long-term data of suicide and examine five climatic issues in Japan as a whole and in 10 selected prefectures: the five with the highest suicide rates in 2006 (Akita, Iwate, Shimane, Yamagata and Miyazaki Prefectures) and the five with the lowest (Nara, Tokushima, Okayama, Kanagawa and Kyoto Prefectures).
   Results: Annual age-adjusted suicide rates were found to have a significant inverse correlation with annual mean air temperature in the five prefectures with the highest suicide rates and in the three prefectures with the lowest suicide rates among women. Annual age-adjusted suicide rates were significantly correlated with annual mean relative humidity in the three prefectures with the highest suicide rates among women and with the annual total sunshine duration in the three prefectures with the highest suicide rates among women.
   Conclusion: It is important that these associations between suicide and climatic factors be discussed further from various viewpoints, including those of many researchers and relevant organizations.

AB This study aimed to explore the gender-based seasonal patterns of suicide in Japan between 2005 and 2012. With data from Japanese official reports, we carried out Prais-Winsten regression and Wilcoxon signed-rank test analysis with Stata 12.0 and SPSS 14.0. The suicide number was significantly higher in March, April, May, June, July, and October for both genders. The suicide number in men was markedly higher than that in women in every month. The suicide number in 2010 was lower than that in 2009 for men, while that in 2011 was higher than that in 2010 for women. The findings displayed that the nationwide television and publicity intervention campaigns might have positive effects on decreasing suicide of men while women suffered a post-earthquake increase. In terms of interventions, we should not only square up the seasonal patterns but also the gender differences in vulnerability.

AB The relationship between climate change and violent behavior has been well documented in previous studies. Violence has two dimensions: outward violence (i.e., crime) and inward violence (i.e., suicide). To our knowledge, rigorous empirical studies have not been performed to investigate how climate change affects both criminal and suicidal behavior. This study aims to estimate the effects of climate change on crime and suicide in Japan by using prefecture-level monthly panel data on climate, crime, and suicide between 2009 and 2015. Even after controlling for prefecture, yearly, and monthly effects, we found that many climate factors affected both crime and suicide in Japan. In particular, more aggressive behavior and an increased number of suicides were observed when the average temperature increased. Furthermore, we predicted how changes in the climate of Japan will affect future patterns of criminal and suicidal behavior based on two climate change scenarios.

AB BACKGROUND: Suicide is one of the most important public health issues in both Japan and the United States. This study is to clarify the differences in methods of suicide between the two countries, among various races within the United States, and between genders and age-groups.
   METHODS: Vital statistics mortality data and the estimated population in 1999 in Japan and in the United States were used. Age-adjusted mortality rates were calculated using the age-specific total population of Japan and the United States as a standard population. In addition, the proportionate distribution of suicide methods was calculated.
   RESULTS: Age-adjusted mortality rates from suicide in Japan were about 2 times higher for males and 3 times higher for females compared with the United States. The most common method among both genders in Japan was hanging, followed by jumping from a high place. In the United States, it was firearms among both genders, followed by hanging among males and drugs among females. For Asians in the United States, hanging was the method of choice for about half among both genders; hanging was the most common method for the age group of 40 years or more among males and for all age groups among females. Firearms were the method of choice for the 20-39 age group among males.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall suicide rates among Asians in the United States were lower than Japan, the methods were similar to those in Japan.

AB Background The charcoal burning suicide epidemics in both Hong Kong and Taiwan have been well documented. However, little is known about the situation in Japan.
   Aims To examine the impact of charcoal burning suicide on the overall and other method-specific suicide rates between 1998 and 2007 in Japan.
   Method Using data obtained from the Vital Statistics of Japan, negative binomial regression analyses were performed to investigate the impact of the charcoal burning method.
   Results In males and females aged 15-24 and 25-44 years, the charcoal burning epidemic led to a substantial increase in overall suicides, without a decrease in other methods. In all other age groups, no such trend was observed.
   Conclusions In young Japanese, the charcoal burning method may have appealed to individuals who might not have chosen other highly or relatively lethal methods, and consequently led to an increase in overall suicides.

AB In Japan, implementation of suicide prevention policies is mainly supported by public funds. However, it is unclear what kinds of suicide prevention strategies people prefer. We conducted a survey to clarify people's preferences regarding suicide prevention strategies adopted in Japan. This was a cross-sectional self-administered questionnaire survey. Participants were recruited through a lecture held by the first author at their university. We distributed questionnaires to 324 people present at the lecture; 249 completed questionnaires were included in the final analysis. We estimated suicide prevention strategy preferences using full profile conjoint analysis. For all six prevention strategies, the inclusion of each strategy in the policy profile was statistically significantly related to the positive evaluation of the overall policy profile. Marginal Willingness to Pay (MWTP) for restriction of access to means showed the highest value of the six suicide prevention strategies. MWTP was the lowest for public awareness activities. Preferred suicide prevention strategies in Japan are restriction of access to means and enhancement of psychiatric services. The results of this study indicate the strategies that are preferred have a high level of evidence of suicide prevention and do not directly intervene in a person's free will to die by suicide.

AB Background: Previous research on hourly diurnal variation in suicide frequency has often suffered from geographical and time-span limitations in the data. We studied diurnal and daily variations of suicide by analyzing a large dataset based on the national death registry in Japan between 1974 and 2014.
   Methods: The diurnal and daily patterns of 873,268 suicide deaths over 41 years were examined by sex and age group through Poisson regression and visual inspection. We also investigated whether these patterns are related to Japan's economic conditions.
   Results: Suicide by middle-aged males was most frequent in the early morning especially on Mondays after the end of Japan's high growth period. We also observed large midnight peaks in suicides among young and middle-aged males. The proportion of early morning suicide deaths by young and middle-aged males increased as the country's unemployment rose. Females and elderly males were more likely to die by suicide during the day than at night.
   Limitation: Our study examined time of death, not time of suicide attempt. It is possible that there is a discrepancy between the two.
   Conclusions: Different subpopulations die by suicide at different times of the day and days of the week. Time patterns of suicide varied considerably over time, suggesting that they cannot be explained by biological circadian rhythm alone. Our findings suggest that the patterns are partly explained by economic conditions. Future suicide prevention efforts should consider the time patterns of suicide unique to each subpopulation, especially when economic growth is depressed.

AB Background. Little is known about whether particular suicide methods have contributed differently to the recent unfavourable suicide mortality trends in Japan. Analysing such trends may shed light on the effect of potentially preventable factors, such as the impact of restricting access to certain popular suicide methods, on overall rates. Therefore, we assessed recent trends in method-specific suicide by gender and age in Japan.
   Method. Suicide mortality and population data between 1990 and 2011 were obtained from the Vital Statistics of Japan and used to calculate method-specific mortality rates. Suicide methods were divided into seven groups: overdose, gases, hanging, drowning, cutting, jumping and other means. Age was divided into four groups: 15-24, 25-44, 45-64 and 65+ years. We applied joinpoint regression to the data and quantified the observed changes.
   Results. The results of the joinpoint regression analyses showed a sharp increase in overall suicide rates for males and females of all ages until the late 1990s. Suicide from hanging and jumping, in particular, contributed to this increase. After 2000, an increasing trend in overall suicide rates in both males and females aged 15-24 and 25-44 years was observed, with overdose, gases and hanging contributing to this increasing trend.
   Conclusions. Our findings revealed that different suicide methods varied in their contribution to the recent overall suicide transition in Japan. Regarding factors associated with the recent increase in suicides by overdose, gases, hanging and jumping, further research is needed in order to promote and implement effective means restriction strategies.

AB Although several case reports have suggested a relationship between accessing Internet suicide sites and the incidence of suicide, the influence of the Internet on the incidence of suicide is not known. Thus, we examined the association between Internet suicide-related searches and the incidence of suicide in 20- and 30-year-old individuals in Japan. The Box-Jenkins transfer function model was applied to monthly time series data from January 2004 to May 2010 (77 months). The terms "hydrogen sulfide," "hydrogen sulfide suicide," and "suicide hydrogen sulfide suicide" at (t-11) were related to the incidence of suicide among people aged in their 20 s (P = 0.005, 0.005, and 0.006, respectively) and people aged in their 30 s (P = 0.013, 0.011, and 0.012, respectively). "BBS on suicide" at (t-5) and "suicide by jumping" at (t-6) were related to the incidence of suicide in people aged 30-39 (P = 0.006 and 0.001, respectively). Internet searches for specific suicide-related terms are related to the incidence of suicide among 20- and 30-year-old individuals in Japan. Routine interrogation by a clinician about visiting Internet suicide websites and stricter regulation of these websites may reduce the incidence of suicide among young people.

AB Background: Suicide rates in Japan are relatively high in OECD countries. A national fund to help local authorities implement suicide prevention programs was launched in 2009. The national suicide prevention project was transferred from the Cabinet Office to the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare on April 2016, with a greater focus on mental health promotion by local governments. Aims: The aim of the present study was to (a) identify local authorities' implementation of suicide prevention programs in terms of local health policies, and (b) examine the associations between local health resources and suicide rates in Japan. Method: We investigated the types of programs implemented under the fund, and correlations with authorities' sociodemographic characteristics and mental health and welfare resources. Results: A majority of authorities implemented general suicide prevention programs. More focused programs addressing issues such as mental health in the workplace, alcohol problems, and attempted suicide were less frequently implemented. There were significantly fewer suicides in health regions with a higher ratio of psychiatrists to residents or a lower ratio of psychiatric beds. Limitations: A causal relationship between suicide rates and characteristics of local authorities cannot be inferred from the data. Conclusion: A community mental health system that operated in parallel to the current system may result in fewer inpatients and a reduction in Japan's suicide rate.

AB Background. Japan has one of the highest suicide rates in the world. Cohort analysis has suggested that alcohol consumption is a risk factor for suicide in Japan. However, this relationship has not been observed at the population level when a measure of per capita total alcohol consumption has been analysed. The present study employed a time-series analysis to examine whether these contradictory findings may be due to the existence of beverage-specific effects on suicide. Methods. An autoregressive integrated moving average model was used to assess the relationship between the consumption of different types of alcohol and suicide rates from 1963 to 2007. The data comprised age-adjusted suicide rates for the ages 15-69, and information on beverage-specific alcohol consumption per capita (15+). The unemployment rate was included as a control variable. Results. During 1963-2007, male suicide rates increased substantially whereas female rates decreased slightly. Consumption of distilled spirits was significantly related to male suicide rates (but not in women) with a 1 L increase in consumption associated with a 21.4% (95% confidence interval: 3.2-42.9) increase in male suicide rates. There was no statistically significant relationship between suicide and any other form of alcohol consumption (beer, wine, other alcohol). Conclusion. This is the first study that has shown an association between spirits consumption and male suicide in Japan. Potentially beneficial policy changes include increasing spirits prices through taxation, reducing the physical availability of alcohol and discouraging the practice of heavy drinking.

AB The male suicide mortality in Japan reached the highest in 1998, since statistics were first recorded in 1899. We investigated whether the recent high suicide rates were associated with economic and demographic factors, using the Pearson's correlation and multivariate regression analyses. The annual numbers of suicide deaths, economic variables, and the proportion of elderly people between 1995 and 2000 were obtained for all the 47 prefectures in Japan. The correlation analyses showed that the male SMR of suicide was mostly associated with the economic variables and the proportion of the elderly men. The female SMR of suicide was associated with the job application rate, and the proportion of elderly women in several years. The multivariate regression analyses showed that the male SMR of suicide was mostly associated positively with the job application rate and the proportion of elderly men and negatively with the amount of household savings and public assistance rate. The largest proportion of the variance of the male SMR of suicide was explained by the set of independent variables in 1998. The goodness-of-fit of the model concerning the female SMR of suicide was poor.

AB We examined 169 deceased persons and 76 homicide-suicide cases reported in Japan's Kanagawa Prefecture from 1999 to 2011. The relationships between homicide-suicide perpetrators and homicide victims; the numbers of victims; their age, sex, causes and places of death; motivation; and the presence or absence of a suicide note were extracted and examined. The relationship between homicide-suicide perpetrators and homicide victims was examined based on findings from the following: 24 married couples (31%), 22 parents and children aged 18 years (29%), 19 parents and children aged 17 years (25%), seven families (9%), two couples (3%) and two miscellaneous relationships (3%). The perpetrators comprised 39 men and 40 women, with a mean age of 51.6 years. The victims comprised 39 men and 51 women, with a mean age of 35.4 years. In our study, approximately half of the perpetrators were female, which differed greatly from the reports from Western countries, where most perpetrators were male. Homicide-suicides among married couples accounted for a higher proportion of overall homicide-suicide deaths in Western countries. In Japan, homicide-suicide occurred more frequently with parents and children. Cases in which a mother committed suicide after having killed her young children accounted for a high proportion of these deaths. Because these events occur so frequently in Japan, we recommend making particular efforts to reduce homicide-suicides among mothers and children.

AB Aims. A reduction in the carbon monoxide content of domestic gas and car exhaust gas has been associated with a decrease in gassing suicides in many western countries. In Japan, a reduction in the carbon monoxide content of domestic gas supply began in the early 1970s, and carbon monoxide emissions standards of new passenger cars were significantly strengthened in 1978. However, little is known about the impact of detoxification of these gases on gassing-related suicides in Japan. Therefore, we examined the changing patterns of suicide due to domestic gas or car exhaust gas inhalation by gender and age in Japan between 1968 and 1994.
   Methods. Suicide mortality data were obtained from the Vital Statistics of Japan. In this study, age was divided into four groups: 15-24, 25-44, 45-64 and 65+ years. Method of suicide was divided into three groups: domestic gas, car exhaust gas and non-gases. We calculated method-specific age-standardised suicide rates by gender within each of the four age groups. We applied joinpoint regression to the data and quantified the observed changes.
   Results. Suicide rates by domestic gas, regardless of gender and age, increased from 1968 to the mid-1970s and then decreased sharply. The proportion of all suicides accounted for by domestic gas was comparatively high in the mid-1970s among females aged 15-24 and 25-44 years, while for other gender-age-groups the proportion of domestic gas suicides remained small, even at the peak. For females aged 15-44 years, the decrease in domestic gas suicides appeared to cause a substantial decrease in overall suicides in this gender/age group. Car exhaust gas was a more common method for males, particularly those aged 25-64 years. Car exhaust gas suicide rates for males aged 25-64 years peaked in the mid-1980s, followed by a sharp decrease.
   Conclusions. A reduction in the carbon monoxide content of the domestic gas, which began in the early 1970s in Japan, was associated with a decrease in domestic gas suicides for both genders of all ages. Concerning females aged 15-44 years, a decrease in domestic gas suicides caused a substantial decrease in overall suicides in this gender/age group since the proportion of domestic gas suicides among all suicides combined was comparatively large. However, it remains uncertain whether the introduction of catalytic converters in the 1970s in Japan resulted in a reduction of suicides from car exhaust gas inhalation.

ID SUICIDE RATES
AB On March 11, 2011, Japan experienced an earthquake of magnitude 9-9.1, called the Great East Japan Earthquake, with a subsequent giant tsunami, which caused massive damage to the Tohoku region Pacific coast (Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures), and a nuclear accident that occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Disaster-related deaths occurred mainly in the elderly, and more than half of the disaster-related deaths occurred in Fukushima prefecture, where the nuclear accident occurred. During the first 2 years after the Great East Japan Earthquake, the suicide standard mortality ratio (SMR) in the three affected prefectures decreased. Three years after the disaster, however, the suicide SMR rose to the pre-disaster level in Iwate and Miyagi prefectures and exceeded the suicide SMR before the disaster in Fukushima prefecture. Mental health service providers for disasters should keep in mind that suicide rates can eventually increase after a disaster, even if they initially decrease.

AB Netto shinju, or Internet group suicide, is a contemporary form of Japanese suicide where strangers connect on the Internet and make plans to commit suicide together. In the past decade, numerous incidents have occurred whereby young Japanese make contact on the Internet, exchange tips on suicide methods, and make plans to meet offline for group/individual suicide. A systematic qualitative content/thematic analysis of online communications posted on a popular Japanese suicide bulletin board yielded a textured, thematic understanding of this phenomenon. Themes identified reflected Shneidman's theory of suicide but with an emphasis on interpersonal concerns that are embedded in Japanese culture.

ID INTERVENTION; RATES
AB AimIn Japan, the Cabinet Office released the General Principles of Suicide Prevention Policy' in 2007 and suggested nine initiatives. In 2009, a national fund was launched to help prefectures (the administrative divisions of Japan) and local authorities implement five categories of suicide-prevention programs. This paper examines the impact of the national fund on the establishment of the systems for suicide prevention and the implementation of these initiatives among local authorities.
   MethodsThe present study included 1385 local authorities (79.5%) from all 47 prefectures that responded to the cross-sectional questionnaire survey.
   ResultsImproved suicide-prevention systems and the implementation of nine initiatives in April 2013 were observed among 265 local authorities (19.1%) that implemented Training of community service providers' and Public awareness campaigns'; 178 local authorities (12.9%) that implemented Face-to-face counseling', Training of community service providers' and Public awareness campaigns'; and 324 local authorities (23.4%) that implemented Trauma-informed policies and practices'. There was no significant difference in suicide-prevention systems and the implementation of nine initiatives between 203 local authorities (14.7%) that implemented only Public awareness campaigns' and 231 local authorities (16.7%) that did not implement any suicide-prevention programs.
   ConclusionThe results of our study suggest that the national fund promoted the establishment of community systems for suicide prevention and helped implement initiatives among local authorities. The national suicide-prevention strategy in Japan should explore a standard package of programs to guide community suicide-prevention efforts with a sustained workforce among local authorities.

AB Objective. - The objective of this study was to explore factors associated with hara-kiri as a method of suicide and suicidal behavior in contemporary Japan.
   Methods. - A retrospective study was conducted on medical records of 421 patients (174 male; 247 female) who were considered suicidal and treated at the Kitasato University Hospital Emergency Medical Center in Japan between January 2006 and March 2008. We compared hara-kiri and all other methods regarding sociodemographics and clinical features of all suicidal patients.
   Results. - Instances of hara-kiri suicide attempt had the highest proportion of males (63%) among all suicide and suicidal behavior. One-way analysis of variance revealed significant differences between hara-kiri and other suicide attempt methods in the age of the suicidal patients. Result of multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that those who attempted hara-kiri suicide were likely to be male, be diagnosed with schizophrenia, survive, and be married.
   Conclusion. - Our findings indicate that hara-kiri as a method of suicide and suicidal behavior remain prevalent in Japan, and the study findings also suggest that both clinical and cultural factors might play a role in hara-kiri as a method of suicide and suicidal behavior.

ID STRATEGIES
AB BackgroundSuicide is a critical global health issue. Japan has had a high suicide rate for the last 12 decades. In 2007, the Japanese Central Government Office issued the General Principles of Suicide Prevention Policy. An important component of this policy was the gatekeeper training (GKT) program. GKT is a widely recommended suicide prevention intervention. This study aimed to investigate the association between the announcement of the national suicide prevention policy and implementation of GKT programs in Japan.MethodsWe performed a systematic review of public documents from central and local governments and research literature using three Japanese databases and PubMed. Characteristics of eligible reports and the report quality of local government information were summarized.ResultsAll local governments provided information about GKT activities. Over 80% of local governments had specific GKT webpages, but useful localized information and program evaluations were limited. Our literature search identified 122 eligible reports. The number of reports increased markedly from 2011 to 2014. However, few of the reviewed research studies used validated outcome measures.ConclusionsThe announcement of the national suicide prevention policy increased the implementation of GKT programs in Japan. However, there remains a need for integration of knowledge and evaluation of GKT programs.

TI Relationships between suicide and three economic factors in South Korea

DE Suicide; South Korea; Unemployment; Factor
ID UNEMPLOYMENT; JAPAN; RECORD
AB The number of suicides in South Korea totaled 4840 in 1995 and 8569 in 1998; in Japan, suicides totaled 21,420 in 1995 and 31,755 in 1998. Suicide prevention is an important issue for both South Korea and Japan. In South Korea, factors related to the increase in suicides must be clarified, and specific suicide prevention measures must be promptly discussed in order to decrease the number of suicides. Therefore, this report examined suicide and unemployment rates and increased rates of mining and industrial production and of money supply in South Korea from 1990 to 2002. This report also discusses the relationships between suicide and unemployment rates and increased rates of mining and industrial production and increased rates of money supply during the same period.
   During the period studied, annual suicide rates ranged from 7.1 to 18.3 per 100,000 populations. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the suicide rate was clearly related to the unemployment rate, but the suicide rate was not related to increased rates of mining and industrial production and increased rates of money supply. Thus, when unemployment rates increase, relevant organizations and the community should pay close attention to the increase in suicide rates. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: To assess the relationship between hours of sunlight and railway suicide attempts, 3-7 days before these attempts.
   Methods: All railway suicide attempts causing railway suspensions or delays of 30 min or more between 2002 and 2006. We used a linear probability model to assess this relationship. This study was conducted at Tokyo, Kanagawa, and Osaka prefectures in Japan. Data were collected from the railway delay incident database of the Japanese Railway Technical Research Institute and public weather database of the Japan Meteorological Agency,
   Results: About 971 railway suicides attempts occurred between 2002 and 2006 in Tokyo, Kanagawa, and Osaka. Less sunlight in the 7 days leading up to the railway suicide attempts was associated with a higher proportion of attempts (p=0.0243). Sunlight over the 3 days before an attempt had a similar trend (p=0.0888). No difference was found in sunlight hours between the clays with (median: 5.6 [IQR: 1.1-8.8]) and without (median: 5.7 [IQR: 1.0-8.9]) railway suicide attempts in the evening. Finally, there was no apparent correlation between the railway suicide attempts and the monthly average sunlight hours of the attempted month or those of a month before.
   Limitations: Railway suicides were not the main suicidal methods in Japan,
   Conclusions: We observed an increased proportion of railway suicide attempts after several days without sunlight. Light exposure (blue light or bright white light) in trains may be useful in reducing railway suicides, especially when consecutive days without sunshine are forecasted. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Methods: We estimated the Poisson regression model using original data on 109 celebrity suicides and daily suicide counts (n = 8035) in Japan from 1989 through 2010. Various fixed effects were included in the model to control for the effects of seasonal variations and time-specific shocks.
   Results: The media reports on celebrity suicides were associated with an immediate increase in total suicides. The total number of suicides increased by 4.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.4-6.7) on the day that media reports on celebrity suicides were published. The increase during the post-report period lasted for about 10 days after the publication of news reports. The average effect of celebrity suicides on total suicides over the 10-day post-reporting period was estimated to be highest when the suicide by nationally recognized politicians was reported (14.8%; CI: 10.9-18.7), whereas reports on the deaths of entertainment celebrities were followed by a 4.7% increase (CI: 2.9-6.5) in suicide counts.
   Conclusions: This study presents evidence that media reports on celebrity suicides have an immediate impact on the number of suicides in the general population. Our findings also highlight the importance of responsible and cautious media reporting on suicide.

AB Background: The number of hospital admissions related to suicide attempts is increasing worldwide. The Emergency Department (ED) is recognized in Japan as an opportunity to intervene with suicide attempters however, the prevalence of suicide attempters in the ED is unknown. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted to provide this information.
   Methods: We conducted searches of databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ICHUSHI, CiNii) to identify studies about suicide attempters in the ED in Japan. A meta-analysis was used to calculate the pooled prevalence proportion of suicide attempters in the ED, and their prevalence proportion of psychiatric disorder and method of suicide in suicide attempters.
   Results: The search of Japanese studies identified 3338 records, of which 70 were included in the meta-analysis. A total of 25 studies reported the psychiatric diagnosis and 62 studies reported the method of suicide. The pooled prevalence proportion of suicide attempters was 4.7%. Mood disorders were the most frequent psychiatric disorders (ICD: 30%, DSM: 35%), and poisoning was the most frequent method of attempting suicide (52%).
   Limitations: There might be a publication bias because only published studies were included. There also might be an information bias, such as reporting bias or misclassification, because most of studies included in the analysis used retrospective designs.
   Conclusions: The results provide clear evidence of the prevalence of suicide attempters in the ED in Japan. The results indicate that suicide attempters in the ED have a higher proportion of mood disorders, and that the most common method of suicide is poisoning. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Internet; Japan; Loneliness; Subjectivity; Suicide; Suffering
ID LONELINESS; SELF; CULTURE; IKIGAI; LIFE
AB Most striking in the recent rise of suicide in Japan are the increase in suicide among young Japanese and the emergence of Internet suicide pacts. An ethnography of suicide-related Web sites reveals a distinctive kind of existential suffering among visitors that is not reducible to categories of mental illness and raises questions regarding the meaning of an individual "choice" to die, when this occurs in the context of an intersubjective decision by a group of strangers, each of whom is too afraid to die alone. Anthropology's recent turn to subjectivity enables analyses of individual suffering in society that provide a more nuanced approach to the apparent dichotomy between agency and structure and that connect the phenomenon of suicide in Japan to Japanese conceptions of selfhood and the afterlife. The absence of ikigai [the worth of living] among suicide Web site visitors and their view of suicide as a way of healing show, furthermore, that analyses of social suffering must be expanded to include questions of meaning and loss of meaning and, also, draw attention to Japanese conceptions of self in which relationality in all things, including the choice to die, is of utmost importance.

AB Background: Previous research has produced conflicting findings concerning whether birthdays are associated with an increased risk of suicide. This study examined the association in Tokyo, Japan.
   Methods: Suicide data (ICD-10 codes X60-X84) for the period 2001-2010 were obtained from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. A time-stratified case-crossover design was used with conditional logistic regression analysis being performed to estimate within-subject birthday exposures' while controlling for meteorological conditions and public holidays.
   Results: There were 27,007 suicides in the study period. For males the 5 days before the birthday and the week after the birthday were associated with significantly higher odds for suicide with the odds ratio being highest on the actual birthday (OR =1.677, 95% CI: 1.294, 2.172). For females, significantly higher odds for completed suicide were observed 7-11 days before the birthday. Stratified analyses showed different at risk time patterns among men from different age groups, and that married men had higher odds for suicide on, and for the 4 days before and in the 2 weeks after their birthday.
   Limitations: We lacked detailed information on suicides which would have enabled a better understanding of the observed associations.
   Conclusions: Birthdays are associated with an increased risk for suicide in Tokyo, Japan. Health professionals who work with individuals at risk of suicide should be made aware that birthdays are associated with an elevated suicide risk. This information should also be communicated in wider suicide prevention campaigns. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The relationship between suicide and disaster is an important problem but it's not clear. We conducted this study to determine whether a natural disaster affects suicide rates.
   We collected data on suicides during the 84 months before and the 60 months after the earthquake and compared the suicide rate in Kobe to that in Japan as a whole. We also examined what groups were significantly affected.
   Compared with Japan as a whole, the suicide rates in Kobe significantly decreased in the 2 years after the earthquake.
   An influence on suicide rate after the disaster clearly appeared in middle-aged men.

TI Lithium in Tap Water and Suicide Mortality in Japan

DT Article
DE lithium; suicide rate; Japan
ID DRINKING-WATER; RISK; MOOD
AB Lithium has been used as a mood-stabilizing drug in people with mood disorders. Previous studies have shown that natural levels of lithium in drinking water may protect against suicide. This study evaluated the association between lithium levels in tap water and the suicide standardized mortality ratio (SMR) in 40 municipalities of Aomori prefecture, which has the highest levels of suicide mortality rate in Japan. Lithium levels in the tap water supplies of each municipality were measured using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. After adjusting for confounders, a statistical trend toward significance was found for the relationship between lithium levels and the average SMR among females. These findings indicate that natural levels of lithium in drinking water might have a protective effect on the risk of suicide among females. Future research is warranted to confirm this association.

AB We studied the correlations among sunspot numbers, business cycles, and suicide mortalitites. Based on data from Japan between 1971 and 2001, a significant negative correlation between sunspot numbers and unemployment rate was found, R = -.17. The correlation between suicide mortality and unemployment rate was positive for males (R = .46) and negative for females (R = -.69). Both are statistically significant. The hypothesis that variation of sun activity may affect the economy and the unemployment rate and hence increase the male suicide mortality is raised.

ID PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSY; SOCIAL-FACTORS; UNEMPLOYMENT; DISORDERS
AB There have been no longitudinal studies in Japan examining national-level data for suicide risk by marital and employment status. We examined the age-adjusted relative suicide risk (RR) by marital and employment status from national data acquired for all suicides in Japan occurring in the past 25 years.
   All deaths identified as suicides according to ICD-9 and ICD-10 were extracted from vital statistics data of Japan for the years 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005. Population statistics for Japanese residents aged epsilon 15 years were obtained from the census.
   Suicide rates for almost all categories analyzed decreased in both genders between 1985 and 1990 and increased between 1995 and 2000, especially among men. Unemployed and divorced men had a consistently higher RR in each year analyzed. Unemployed and divorced women had a higher risk than those in other categories, especially in 2000 and 2005. In women, particularly in 1980, 1985 and 1990, those who were unemployed and never married had a similar RR to those who were unemployed and divorced.
   Unemployed and divorced people were at a high risk of suicide over the past 25 years, particularly in 2000 and 2005. Our findings suggest that the effects of divorce and unemployment on suicide risk are synergistic.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the link between suicide and meteorological parameters in the 23 wards of Tokyo, Japan.
   Materials and methods: Monthly data (from January 2008 to December 2012) of suicide stratified by the type of suicide, i.e. hanging, drowning and jumping, were obtained from the Tokyo Medical Examiner's Office official web site. Monthly meteorological parameters (atmospheric pressure, air temperature, humidity and daylight hours) in the 23 wards of Tokyo were also used for the required period. The effects of meteorological parameters on suicide were explored.
   Results: The number of suicides was 110.4 +/- 14.7 (80-149) for men and 55.6 +/- 9.1 (41-87) for women in the 23 wards of Tokyo, Japan. The mean air temperature was 16.6 degrees C +/- 7.7 degrees C (4.829.6 degrees C). The number of suicides by drowning for men was significantly and positively correlated with air temperature, and weakly and positively correlated with humidity. In addition, the number of suicides by drowning for men was significantly and negatively correlated with atmospheric pressure.
   Conclusions: The number of suicides by drowning was associated with meteorological parameters, especially in men, in the 23 wards of Tokyo, Japan.

AB Introduction: In Japan, there have been over 30,000 suicides per year in the 11 years since 1998, as reported by the National Police Agency. The causative factors for suicides must be investigated in detail by age group to determine specific preventive measures that could bring about an immediate decrease in suicides.
   Materials and Methods: In this report, we studied the number and proportion of causative factors of suicide for each age group in Japan in 1994, 1996, and 1998.
   Results and Conclusion: There were 21,679 suicides in 1994, 23,104 in 1996, and 32,863 in 1998. The number of suicides in 1998 among men was approximately 1.58 and 1.50 times higher than the numbers in 1994 and 1996, respectively, and the number of suicides in 1998 among women was approximately 1.38 and 1.28 times higher than the numbers in 1994 and 1996, respectively. The number of suicides in 1998 represented an increase for individuals aged 10 or over from the numbers in 1994 and 1996. In particular, the number in 1998 represented an increase from the numbers in 1994 and 1996 in the 50-59-year and 60-64-year age groups among men and the 25-29-year and 30-39-year age groups among women. We must pay special attention to suicide among middle-aged men due to problems classified in this study as "life and economic problems" and address the main causative factors for the rapid increase in the number of suicides in recent years in both genders. Relevant researchers and organizations must cooperate in implementing suicide prevention measures.

TI The Impact of Improving Suicide Death Classification in South Korea: A
   Comparison with Japan and Hong Kong
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID UNDETERMINED DEATHS; ECONOMIC-CRISIS; RATES; AGE; STATISTICS; MORTALITY
AB Introduction
   The suicide rate of South Korea has increased dramatically during the past decades, as opposed to steadily decreasing trends in Japan and Hong Kong. Although the recent increase of suicide in South Korea may be related to changing socioeconomic conditions and other contextual factors, it may also reflect, in part, a reduction of misidentified suicide cases due to improving classification of manner of death.
   Method
   We compared the annual proportional change of suicide, undetermined death, and accidental death from South Korea with those of Japan and Hong Kong from 1992 to 2011; a greater proportional change of the manner-of-death categories during the period is indicative of a relatively less stable registration and hence a greater potential for misclassification bias on reported suicide trends. Subgroup analyses stratifying the deaths by methods were also conducted. To estimate the impact, the age-standardized rates of these three death categories in each site were calculated.
   Results
   We found that, during the 20-year observation period, the proportional change of suicide, undetermined death, and accidental death in South Korea was significantly greater than Japan and Hong Kong. Similar observations were made in subgroup analyses. While death rates of the three manners in Japan and Hong Kong generally moved in a parallel fashion, the increase of suicide in South Korea occurred concomitantly with a significant reduction of its accidental death rate. 43% of the increase in suicides could be attributed to the decrease in accidental deaths, while 57% of the increase could be due to fundamental causes.
   Conclusion
   Our data suggest that, during the mid-1990s and after, the increasing burden of suicide in South Korea initially was masked, in part, by misclassification. Thus, the later apparently rapid increase of suicides reflected steadily improving classification of manner of death, as well as a more fundamental increase in the suicide rate.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the clinical features of suicide attempts and the Great East Japan earthquake in Kanagawa. We enrolled 592 patients who attempted suicide and were hospitalized for inpatient treatment. Clinical features were compared between before the earthquake (A) and after the earthquake (B) groups. The number of suicide attempts increased from 286 to 306. The rate of increase in suicide attempts in men was the highest in the age group of 40-59years. The frequency of joblessness, family psychiatric histories, precipitating event, and alcohol intake at suicide attempt was significantly higher in the B group than in the A group. The number of patients in serious condition in the B group was significantly higher than that in the A group. Other clinical features related to suicide in people who were indirectly affected by the earthquake disaster should be investigated to develop targeted prevention strategies.

DE Ecological study; Income; Leisure time; Suicide; Working hours
AB This study describes an ecological study that evaluated the combined effects of working hours, income, and leisure time on suicide in all 47 prefectures of Japan. In men, the age-adjusted rate of suicide (per 100,000 population) was significantly correlated with working hours (r=0.587, p < 0.0001) as well as significantly and negatively correlated with income (r=-0.517, p=0.0002) and times for the leisure activities of self-education (r=-0.447, p=0.0016) and hobbies (r=-0.511, p=0.0002). In addition, a stepwise multiple regression analysis identified time for leisure social activities as a determining factor in suicide rate, even after adjusting for working hours and income. However, the impact of time for leisure social activities on suicide rate was smaller than that of working hours and income. In contrast, none of these factors affected suicide rate in women. These results suggest that increasing leisure time may be useful for preventing suicide among men in Japan.

DE suicide; depression; medicalization; Japan
ID ILLNESS; SCHIZOPHRENICS; EXPERIENCE
AB In Japan, suicide has long been depicted as an act of free will, even aestheticized in the cultural notion suicide of resolve. Amid the record-high Japanese suicide rates since the 1990s, however, Japanese psychiatrists have been working to medicalize suicide and, in the process, confronting this deeply ingrained cultural notion. Drawing on two years of fieldwork at psychiatric institutions around Tokyo, I examine how psychiatrists try to persuade patients of the pathological nature of their suicidal intentions and how patients respond to such medicalization. I also explore psychiatrists' ambivalent attitudes toward pathologizing suicide and how they limit their biomedical jurisdiction by treating only what they regard as biological anomaly, while carefully avoiding the psychological realm. One ironic consequence of this medicalization may be that psychiatrists are reinforcing the dichotomy between normal and pathological, "pure" and "trivial," suicides, despite their clinical knowledge of the tenuousness of such distinctions and the ephemerality of human intentionality. Thus, while the medicalization of suicide is cultivating a conceptual space for Japanese to debate how to bring the suicidal back onto the side of life, it scarcely seems poised to supplant the cultural discourse on suicide that has elevated suicide to a moral act of self-determination.

AB Monthly suicide rates in Japan were analyzed for the period from 1976 to 1994 to clarify trends and recurring effects. The data were separated by sex, and the least-squares method was used. The major findings were (1) a significant positive correlation between unemployment rate and suicide rate for both sexes, (2) the suicide rate was highest in April for both sexes, and (3) an upsurge in male suicide mortality was noted from 1983 to 1990. These findings may well be associated with socioeconomic factors as well as neurobehavioral variables.

AB Suicide, assisted suicide and euthanasia are elusive and controversial issues worldwide. To discuss such issues from only one perspective may be limiting. Therefore, this paper was written by authors from various regions, each of whom has been asked to reflect on the issues. The countries/cultures are: Australia, China, Cuba, Ireland, India, Japan, Russia, South Africa, The Netherlands, North America (Turtle Island) and United States. Historically and today, suicide is viewed differently. Assisted suicide and euthanasia are equally seen from multifarious perspectives. Highlighting development in the Netherlands, Australia's Northern Territory and Japan (ie. the famous Yamanouchi Case), the review shows growing re-examination of the right to die. There appear, however, to be no uniform legal and ethical positions. Further debate and discussion globally is needed to avoid myopic perspectives.

AB Akita Prefecture currently has the highest rate of suicide in Japan. Given this alarming statistic, investigation of the underlying causes of suicide and identification of strategies for suicide prevention are imperative. Members of the Akita Prefectural Medical Association (APMA) see most of the individuals who commit suicides in Akita Prefecture, so data from the APMA would prove advantageous in any investigation of suicides. In this study, members of the APMA who had attended to individuals who had committed suicide were asked to complete a questionnaire about the case to determine the factors underlying suicide in Akita Prefecture. From 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002, a total of 138 cases (102 males, 36 females) of suicide were reported. Most suicide cases were of 50-69 year olds. Many cases involved relatively lethal methods (such as hanging). Most suicides were performed at home and at a time when the rest of the family was asleep or absent. The most common complaint appeared to be economic-related problems. Depressive disorder was the most common psychiatric disorder, and many cases displayed high depressive trait scores. The present results do not exclude the possibility that economic-related problems are playing a major role in recent increases in suicide numbers. However, strategies for dealing with depression as well as economic-related problems are considered important.

The interview included sections of socio-demographic characteristics, physical conditions, and a psychiatric interview producing DSM-IV diagnoses of mental disorders prior to suicide (or at survey). We compared prevalences of mental disorders between the two groups, using conditional logistic regression.
   Results: A significantly higher proportion with any mental disorder was found in the suicide group (653%) compared to the control group (4.8%) (p = 0.003, odds ratio [OR] = 7.5). The population attributable risk proportion associated with mental disorder was 0.24. Mood disorder, particularly major depressive disorder, was the most strongly associated with suicide (p<0.001). Anxiety disorder, alcohol-related disorder, and brief psychotic disorder were also significantly associated with suicide (p<0.05). These patterns were unchanged after adjusting for serious chronic physical conditions. Limitations: The present study had some limitations, such as small sample size, sampling bias and information bias.
   Conclusions: Most mental disorders, particularly mood disorder, were significantly associated with a greater risk of suicide in Japan, independent of physical conditions. Mental disorders are a major target of suicide prevention programs in Japan. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide data relating to 1979-2014 were obtained from three East Asian jurisdictions (Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan) and two 'Western' countries (Australia, New Zealand). Rates and age patterns of suicide have changed markedly since 1979. Graphs of these patterns largely remained either upward-sloping, bimodal or flat (uniform) over the 36 years, male commonly differing from female, and East Asian patterns more like each other than those of the Western countries. Japan's male middle-aged suicide rate reached a peak in 1999-2003, which, like increased rates among working age males in Hong Kong and Taiwan, has been attributed largely to consequences of Asian financial crises. Male to female ratios of suicide rates have remained higher in the Western countries, but late life suicide rates have decreased to varying extents in all five jurisdictions. Identifying reasons for differences between jurisdictions in their suicide rates and patterns at particular times, and over time, is likely to point to factors (period, cohort, psychosocial or cultural) that protect against or foster suicidal ideation. This avenue of research may assist in identifying ways of preventing suicide.

SO MEDICINE SCIENCE AND THE LAW

ID IDEATION; MORTALITY; HEALTH
AB In Japan, the suicide rate has remained high since 1998, and effective suicide prevention measures that can bring about an immediate decrease in suicides are needed now. Specific suicide prevention measures must be based on the results of detailed research into the trends and causative factors of suicide. In the present study, we investigated the number of suicides and the proportion of causative factors in persons aged 60 or over compared with the total number of suicides in Japan from 1999 to 2005. We also discussed the causative factors of suicide among men and women aged 60 or over in detail. During the period from 1999 to 2005, the proportion of the number of suicides in persons aged 60 or over to the total number of suicides changed from 28.9% to 31.1% among men and from 42.5% to 45.9% among women. The most common causative factor was 'health problems' among both men and women, and the second most common cause was 'economic and life problems' among men. 'Family problems' was one of the major causative factors among both men and women. Therefore, more attention needs to be paid to persons aged 60 or over with regard to these factors in particular. Professionals and organizations involved in suicide prevention must work cooperatively to prevent suicide.

TI Does the installation of blue lights on train platforms prevent suicide?
   A before-and-after observational study from Japan
SO JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Suicide; Railway; Suicide prevention; Blue lights
AB Background: Railway and metro suicides constitute a major problem in many parts of the world. Japan has experienced an increase in the number of suicides by persons diving in front of an oncoming train in the last several years. Some major railway operators in Japan have begun installing blue light-emitting-diode (LED) lamps on railway platforms and at railway crossings as a method of deterring suicides, which is less costly than installing platform screen doors. However, the effectiveness of the blue lights in this regard has not yet been proven.
   Methods: This study evaluates the effect of blue lights on the number of suicides at 71 train stations by using panel data between 2000 and 2010 from a railway company in a metropolitan area of Japan. We use a regression model and compare the number of suicides before and after and with and without the intervention by the blue light. We used the number of suicides at 11 stations with the intervention as the treatment group and at the other 60 stations without the intervention as the control group.
   Results: Our regression analysis shows that the introduction of blue lights resulted in a 84% decrease in the number of suicides (CI: 14-97%).
   Limitation: The analysis relies on data from a single railroad company and it does not examine the underlying suicide-mitigation mechanism of blue lights.
   Conclusion: As blue lights are easier and less expensive to install than platform screen doors, they can be a cost-effective method for suicide prevention. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Suicide is a major health issue worldwide, including in Japan. Japanese public health nurses (PHNs) play a distinctive role in suicide prevention, although few studies have delineated this role. The purpose of this study was to develop a conceptual framework that elucidates PHNs activities for suicide prevention. Design and Sample: Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2012-2013 with 15 PHNs who worked in Tokyo metropolitan regions. Data were analyzed qualitatively using grounded theory, and a conceptual framework with seven categories was developed. Results: Three phases that depict the PHNs suicide prevention activities emerged. Phase I, Pursuing to understand suicide cases, included two categories: tracing back individual suicide cases and raising consciousness among the general public. Phase II, Spreading a web of care, included three categories: knitting a caring network, weaving regular programs into the web, and continuing to be a member of the web. Phase III, Maintaining motivation and commitment, included two categories: legitimatizing suicide prevention and cultivating continued commitment in the community. Conclusion: The activities of suicide prevention by PHNs included a process of developing a caring network that lead to the enhancement of the caring capacity of the community as a whole.

AB Objective: To compare suicide rates and characteristics in East Asian and Western countries.
   Method: Data from five East Asian jurisdictions and five English-speaking Western countries were obtained from national offices responsible for collection of statistics. Data were graphed to demonstrate differences between East Asian and Western age patterns of suicide. Relevant literature was reviewed, including observations concerning suicide rates in various non-English-speaking European countries.
   Results: Age patterns and rates of suicide differ between East and West and across time, but with Japan's and the United States patterns progressively becoming more similar.
   Conclusions: Sociocultural factors affect suicide patterns and rates; choice of method and cohort effects affect rates. Strategies for prevention of suicide should give attention to culture-related precipitants of suicide.

ID CONTAGIOUS METHOD
AB Background: To date, the clinical features between patients in Japan who have attempted suicide by charcoal burning and those who have attempted suicide by other methods in the context of a mental disorder diagnosis as assessed by structured interviews have not been reported.
   Methods: We enrolled 647 consecutive patients who attempted suicide and were hospitalized for inpatient treatment. Psychiatric diagnoses, frequency of suicide attempts, and clinical features were compared between charcoal burning and other suicide methods.
   Results: Twenty of the 647 patients (3.1%) had attempted suicide by charcoal burning. The ratio of men to women was significantly higher by this method compared with that of other methods. The proportion of patients with mood disorders was significantly higher in the charcoal burning group than that in the other methods group. The occurrence of a psychiatric history in patients in the charcoal burning group was significantly lower than that in the other methods group.
   Limitations: The study sample was limited to a single hospital.
   Conclusions: The results demonstrate the clinical characteristics of patients who attempted suicide by charcoal burning. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the clinical features of patients who have attempted suicide by charcoal burning in Japan. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article explores ideas expressed by older, rural Japanese to explain suicide among their age peers. It also looks at how older Japanese conceptualize residing with children and grandchildren in terms of dependency and stress. While the multigeneration household often is represented by both young and old in Japan as an ideal living situation for the elderly, many elders also see coresidence as a significant source of stress due to conflicting values held between generations. For many rural elderly, the stress associated with coresidence is viewed as being sufficiently severe to lead some of them to end their lives. Based on conversations held with elders in rural Japan, these themes are contextualized in terms of Japanese concepts of suicide.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical features of suicide attempts in elderly patients (65 years) in Japan. We enrolled 546 patients who attempted suicide and were hospitalized for inpatient treatment. Characteristics were compared between the elderly and non-elderly patients. Compared with the non-elderly group, the incidence of mood disorders was significantly higher and the average length of stay in the intensive care unit and the duration of hospitalization were significantly longer in the elderly group. Elderly patients hospitalized for attempted suicide were more likely to have mood disorders than the non-elderly.

TI Act or Disease? The Making of Modern Suicide in Early Twentieth-century
   Japan
SO JOURNAL OF JAPANESE STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article explores the process by which suicide was conceptualized in prewar Japan. First, it examines how psychiatry established primacy over sociology and psychology in order to label suicide as mental illness. Second, it investigates how, with the rise of a totalitarian regime, sociocultural elements were incorporated into the psychiatric discourse in order to reconcile the idea of suicide as pathology with the cult of voluntary death that was engulfing the nation. I argue that, to maintain their authority, psychiatrists conceptualized suicide less as a disease and more as a historical act, to the detriment of the theoretical coherence of their discipline.

AB The relationships between age-specific suicide mortality rates and social life factors for all 47 Japanese prefectures in 1980, 1985, and 1990 were assessed by multiple regression analysis after factor analysis on 20 social life indicators. During this period, Japan experienced a secondary oil crisis in 1980-1983 and a bubble economy in 1986-1990. It was concluded that (1) low income was the major determinant which positively affected suicide mortality rate in middle-aged men during a previous 20-yr. period (1970-1990), (2) urbanization was negatively associated with male suicide mortality rates in most of the age classes in the 1980s, (3) unemployment was one of the major determinants of increased suicide mortality rate in middle-age men in the 1980s, and (4) unemployment was the major factor which was inversely associated with suicide mortality rate for elderly women from 1980 to 1990 in Japan.

AB This article reviews evidence supporting the hypothesis that suicide rates in Japan could be reduced by elevating serotonin levels via increasing the average duration of sleep. Seven major relevant findings were apparent in the literature: 1) Sleep loss is associated with suicide, but the direction of causality is equivocal. 2) Decreased serotonergic activity may be involved in suicidal behavior. 3) Sleep debt may decrease serotonergic activity. 4) The suicide rate in Japan has remained at a heightened level for the past 12 years. 5) The average sleep duration in Japan has decreased over the past 40 years. 6) The average sleep duration in Japan is among the lowest in the world. 7) The average sleep duration in Japan plateaued in 1995 and has been relatively stable since. From the research reviewed, two major problematic issues were apparent: I) Most people in Japan receive inadequate sleep. 2) Individuals whose sleep is inadequate are unlikely to be sufficiently physically active to stimulate serotonergic systems to a desirable level. I propose that public health initiatives encouraging at longer duration of sleep may provide a relatively simple way of addressing the disturbing current trend in Japan. The combination of actigraph and brain serotonin level measurement could allow large population-based cohort studies to be designed, to elucidate the causal links between sleep duration, serotonin levels, and suicide rates.

AB The relationships between male or female age-adjusted suicide mortality and social life factors for all 47 Japanese prefectures in 1980, 1985 and 1990 were investigated by stepwise multiple regression analysis after classification of 20 social life indicators by factor analysis. During this period, Japan experienced the second economic crisis (the so-called secondary oil crisis) in 1980-1983 and economic prosperity (bubble economy) in 1986-1990. In all the three years, male suicide mortality was significantly related inversely to the urbanization and economic development factor, the result of which was consistent with the data in our previous study for the years 1970 and 1975. Similarly, the male mortality was positively related to the factor of migration of workers in the three years. No factor significantly related to female mortality for all the three years was found. It is suggested that (1) urbanization was a major determinant which prevented male suicide mortality during the past 20 years (1970-1990) in Japan; (2) migration of workers became an important factor for male suicide mortality during these 10 years; and (3) female suicide mortality was less vulnerable to social life factors for these 20 years than the male mortality.

AB The present study aimed to establish willingness to pay for suicide prevention among taxpayers in Japan. We conducted an internet-based questionnaire survey using a double-bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation, and analyzed data for 956 participants. The median willingness to pay to reduce the mortality risk from suicide by 25% was JPY 1,572 ($13.67 USD). Being married was significantly associated with willingness to pay. The willingness to pay to reduce the mortality risk from suicide may be lower than that to reduce other mortality risks such as traffic accidents.

TI Association between the Density of Physicians and Suicide Rates in
   Japan: Nationwide Ecological Study Using a Spatial Bayesian Model
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; RISK; MORTALITY; DIVORCE; AREAS
AB Background
   Regional disparity in suicide rates is a serious problem worldwide. One possible cause is unequal distribution of the health workforce, especially psychiatrists. Research about the association between regional physician numbers and suicide rates is therefore important but studies are rare. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between physician numbers and suicide rates in Japan, by municipality.
   Methods
   The study included all the municipalities in Japan (n = 1,896). We estimated smoothed standardized mortality ratios of suicide rates for each municipality and evaluated the association between health workforce and suicide rates using a hierarchical Bayesian model accounting for spatially correlated random effects, a conditional autoregressive model. We assumed a Poisson distribution for the observed number of suicides and set the expected number of suicides as the offset variable. The explanatory variables were numbers of physicians, a binary variable for the presence of psychiatrists, and social covariates.
   Results
   After adjustment for socioeconomic factors, suicide rates in municipalities that had at least one psychiatrist were lower than those in the other municipalities. There was, however, a positive and statistically significant association between the number of physicians and suicide rates.
   Conclusions
   Suicide rates in municipalities that had at least one psychiatrist were lower than those in other municipalities, but the number of physicians was positively and significantly related with suicide rates. To improve the regional disparity in suicide rates, the government should encourage psychiatrists to participate in community-based suicide prevention programs and to settle in municipalities that currently have no psychiatrists. The government and other stakeholders should also construct better networks between psychiatrists and non-psychiatrists to support sharing of information for suicide prevention.

AB This study explored the current implementation status of and opinions and concerns regarding suicide education at schools of social work in Japan. We conducted a survey of faculty members who taught at least one of the social work subjects. About half the respondents had given a lecture of some kind on suicide, and more than 80% agreed that suicide is an important topic to include in social work program curricula. However, more than half indicated they did not have enough knowledge or skills to teach students about suicide, and more than 60% were concerned about adverse psychological effects of suicide education on students. Our findings highlight the importance of providing faculty members with guidelines for teaching students about suicide.

ID SUICIDE ATTEMPT; RISK-FACTORS; SELF-HARM; INTERVENTION; REPETITION
AB Background: A previous suicide attempt is a potent risk factor for suicide later on. Crisis intervention, psychiatric and psychosocial evaluation at emergency medical facilities, and follow-up care for suicide attempters are considered important components for suicide prevention. The Japanese Multimodal Intervention Trials for Suicide Prevention (J-MISP) includes a randomized, controlled, multicenter trial of post-suicide attempt case management for the prevention of further attempts (ACTION-J) to address the continuing increase in suicides in Japan. The primary aim of ACTION-J is to examine the effectiveness of an extensive intervention for suicide attempters in prevention of recurrent suicidal behavior, as compared with standard intervention. This paper describes the rationale and protocol of the ACTION-J trial.
   Methods/Design: In this clinical trial, case management intervention will be provided at 19 emergency medical facilities in Japan. After crisis intervention including psychiatric evaluation, psychosocial assessment, and psychological education, subjects will be randomly assigned to either a group receiving continuous case management or a control group receiving standard care. Suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, and general health condition will be evaluated as secondarymeasures. The intervention was initiated in July 2006. By December, 2009, 842 subjects will be randomized. Subject follow-up will continue for 1.5 to 5 years.
   Discussion: Suicide is a complex phenomenon that encompasses multiple factors. Case management by multi-sector collaboration is needed. ACTION-J may provide valuable information on suicide attempters and may develop effective case management to reduce future risk for suicide attempters.

AB Whereas sex ratios are likely to affect the likelihood of marriage, how sex ratios affect health and survival is underexplored. This study uses suicide as a measure of mental health and examines how suicides are affected by sex ratios. As women tend to marry men older than themselves, shrinking populations will lead to higher sex ratios (i.e., higher proportions of men) in the marriage market. Using data from Japan, I find that high sex ratios, both early-life and current, are correlated with higher male suicide rates, whereas female suicide rates are generally not affected. The results of this study have important implications for public health in countries where imbalanced sex ratios are a concern. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In 1997-1998 a widespread economic crisis hit the economies of many East/Southeast Asian countries; its impact on suicide rates across the region has not been systematically documented. We investigated the impact of the Asian economic crisis (1997-1998) on suicide in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand. Suicide and population data for the period 1985-2006 were extracted from the World Health Organisation's mortality database and Taiwanese mortality statistics. Sex-specific age-standardised suicide rates for people aged 15 years or above were analysed using joinpoint regression. Trends in divorce, marriage, unemployment, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and alcohol consumption were compared with trends in suicide rates graphically and using time-series analysis. Suicide mortality decreased in the late 1980s and early 1990s but subsequently increased markedly in all countries except Singapore, which had steadily declining suicide rates throughout the study period. Compared to 1997, male rates in 1998 rose by 39% in Japan, 44% in Hong Kong and 45% in Korea; rises in female rates were less marked. Male rates also rose in Thailand, but accurate data were incomplete. The economic crisis was associated with 10,400 more suicides in 1998 compared to 1997 in Japan, Hong Kong and Korea. Similar increases in suicide rates were not seen in Taiwan and Singapore, the two countries where the economic crisis had a smaller impact on GDP and unemployment. Time-series analyses indicated that some of the crisis's impact on male suicides was attributable to increases in unemployment. These findings suggest an association of the Asian economic crisis with a sharp increase in suicide mortality in some, but not all, East/Southeast Asian countries, and that these increases were most closely associated with rises in unemployment.

AB Background: Suicide rates have been related to educational level and other socioeconomic statuses. However, no prospective study has examined the association between educational level and the risk of suicide in Japan.
   Methods: We examined the association of education level and suicide risk in a population-based cohort of Japanese men and women aged 40-59 years in the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study Cohort I. In the baseline survey initiated in 1990, a total of 46 156 subjects (21 829 men and 24 327 women) completed a self-administered questionnaire, which included a query of educational level, and were followed up until the end of December 2011. Educational levels were categorized into four groups (junior high school, high school, junior or career college, and university or higher education). During a median follow-up of 21.6 years, the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of suicide according to educational level were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards regression model adjusted for age; study area; previous history of stroke, ischemic heart disease, or cancer; self-reported stress; alcohol consumption; smoking; living with spouse; and employment status. A total of 299 deaths attributed to suicide occurred.
   Results: The HR for university graduates or those with higher education versus junior high school graduates was 0.47 (95% CI, 0.24-0.94) in men, and that for high school graduates versus junior high school graduates was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.24-0.79) in women.
   Conclusions: High educational levels were associated with a reduced risk of suicide for both Japanese men and women.

AB Background Few studies have investigated large population-based cohorts for an association between alcohol consumption and suicide.
   Aims To investigate the possible association between alcohol intake and suicide.
   Method We used nationwide population-based cohort data from the Japan Public Health Centre-Based Prospective Study cohort. A total of 43 383 men aged 40-69 years participated. Death from suicide was defined according to ICD-10 as codes X60-X84.
   Results During the 367817 person-years of follow-up, there were 168 suicides. Compared with occasional drinkers, the pooled multivariate relative risk (RR; with 95% CI) of suicide for nondrinkers and regular heavy drinkers was 2.3 (1.2-4.6) and 2.3 (1.2-4.7) respectively The RR increased with the amount of alcohol consumed (P for trend=0.004).
   Conclusions There is a U-shaped association between alcohol consumption and subsequent suicide.

AB Injury is the leading cause of death among children and adolescents in Japan. Despite this, until now there has been comparatively little research on this phenomenon. The purpose of this study was to examine if there was seasonal variation in child and adolescent injury mortality in Japan in 2000-2010.
   Vital statistics injury mortality data were obtained from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan. The seasonality of the major causes of unintentional injury (transport accidents, drowning and suffocation) and intentional injury (suicide and homicide) mortality was examined for children and adolescents aged 0-19. Incidence ratios (IR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to determine the difference between the numbers of observed and expected seasonal deaths.
   The annual average injury mortality rate among children and adolescents was 9.0 per 100,000. Deaths from transport accidents, drowning, suffocation and suicide had a significant seasonality. There was a summer peak for transport accidents (IR 1.15, 95 % CI 1.10-1.19) and drowning (IR 2.00, 95 % CI 1.88-2.11), a spring peak for suicide (IR 1.09, 95 % CI 1.04-1.14), while the incidence of suffocation was higher in winter (IR 1.12, 95 % CI 1.03-1.21).
   Child and adolescent injury mortality from transport accidents, drowning, suffocation and suicide has a pronounced seasonality in Japan. More research is now needed to find the circumstances underpinning different forms of injury mortality in different periods of the year so that effective interventions can be designed and implemented to reduce the burden of injury mortality among Japanese children.

AB Objective: This case-control psychological autopsy study aimed to explore a relationship between sleep disturbances and suicide among Japanese, as well as determine the importance and usability of screening for sleep disturbances in suicide prevention.
   Methods: A semi-structured interview was conducted with the close family members of 49 adult suicide completers and 145 gender-, age-, and residential municipality-matched living controls. The survey included sections on demographics, sleep disturbances, and mental disorders. Conditional logistic regression analyses were performed to compare sleep disturbance prevalence between the two groups.
   Results: A significantly higher prevalence of sleep disturbances was found among the suicide group (75.5%) compared to the controls (11.0%) (odds ratio [OR]=21.6, p < 0.001). The association remained significant after adjusting for mental disorders (OR = 12.7, p < 0.001). The population attributable risk percent of suicide associated with sleep disturbances and mental disorders was estimated to be 56.4% and 35.3%, respectively.
   Conclusions: The study confirmed that sleep disturbances are an important risk factor of suicide, independent of mental disorders. Sleep disturbances accounted for a greater proportion of suicide cases than did mental disorders in the Japanese population given the higher prevalence, and could thus be considered an important target in suicide prevention in Japan.

AB Background: There is a shortage of empirical data concerning precipitating factors for suicides in Japan. The purpose of the present study was to clarify gender differences of precipitating factors for suicide attempts in Japan.
   Methods: The subjects were high-lethality suicide attempters who were admitted to the Nippon Medical School Hospital Critical Care Medical Center between March 1, 2010 and March 31, 2012. Precipitating factors for suicide attempt, method of suicide attempt, psychiatric diagnoses and other sociodemographic data were collected from the patients' medical records retrospectively, and statistical analyses were performed for categorical variables of male/female.
   Results: The total number of subjects was 193 (88 males and 105 females). The rate of subjects attempting suicide by poisonous gas was significantly higher in males while that of subjects attempting suicide by drug overdose was significantly higher in females. The rate of subjects diagnosed with "major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder" was significantly higher in males while that of subjects diagnosed with "personality disorders" or "dysthymic disorder" was significantly higher in females. Subjects with "health problems", "financial problems", "work problems", "debts (others)" or "unwanted transfer" were significantly more numerous among males; subjects with "family problems", "parent-child relations" or "loneliness" were significantly more frequently found among females.
   Conclusions: Mental disorders were the most common precipitating factor for suicide attempts regardless of gender. Significant gender differences were observed in psychiatric diagnoses, methods of suicide attempt and psychosocial problems. This indicates the necessity of suicide prevention measures corresponding to these gender differences.

AB Because suicide is increasingly becoming a public health threat in Japan, it is necessary to identify high-risk groups to develop effective preventive measures. The suicide mortality trends from 1985 to 2006 for Japanese aged between 15 and 79 years were analyzed by a Bayesian age-period-cohort analysis to evaluate the independent effects of age, period, and birth cohort. Age-specific effect showed an overall increase with age in both genders, but a distinct increase was noted only among men aged between 50 and 64 years. The period effect exhibited a sudden rise in 1998; this effect was more apparent in men than in women. The cohort-specific effect increased in male birth cohorts born after 1926 and in female birth cohorts born after 1956. In conclusion, a gender difference was detected in the effects of age, period, and cohort on suicide risk among Japanese.

TI Regional Changes in Charcoal-Burning Suicide Rates in East/Southeast
   Asia from 1995 to 2011: A Time Trend Analysis
SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English

AB Background
   Suicides by carbon monoxide poisoning resulting from burning barbecue charcoal reached epidemic levels in Hong Kong and Taiwan within 5 y of the first reported cases in the early 2000s. The objectives of this analysis were to investigate (i) time trends and regional patterns of charcoal-burning suicide throughout East/Southeast Asia during the time period 1995-2011 and (ii) whether any rises in use of this method were associated with increases in overall suicide rates. Sex- and age-specific trends over time were also examined to identify the demographic groups showing the greatest increases in charcoal-burning suicide rates across different countries.
   Methods and Findings
   We used data on suicides by gases other than domestic gas for Hong Kong, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore in the years 1995/1996-2011. Similar data for Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand were also extracted but were incomplete. Graphical and joinpoint regression analyses were used to examine time trends in suicide, and negative binomial regression analysis to study sex- and age-specific patterns. In 1995/1996, charcoal-burning suicides accounted for <1% of all suicides in all study countries, except in Japan (5%), but they increased to account for 13%, 24%, 10%, 7%, and 5% of all suicides in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore, respectively, in 2011. Rises were first seen in Hong Kong after 1998 (95% CI 1997-1999), followed by Singapore in 1999 (95% CI 1998-2001), Taiwan in 2000 (95% CI 1999-2001), Japan in 2002 (95% CI 1999-2003), and the Republic of Korea in 2007 (95% CI 2006-2008). No marked increases were seen in Malaysia, the Philippines, or Thailand. There was some evidence that charcoal-burning suicides were associated with an increase in overall suicide rates in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan (for females), but not in Japan (for males), the Republic of Korea, and Singapore. Rates of change in charcoal-burning suicide rate did not differ by sex/age group in Taiwan and Hong Kong but appeared to be greatest in people aged 15-24 y in Japan and people aged 25-64 y in the Republic of Korea. The lack of specific codes for charcoal-burning suicide in the International Classification of Diseases and variations in coding practice in different countries are potential limitations of this study.
   Conclusions
   Charcoal-burning suicides increased markedly in some East/Southeast Asian countries (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore) in the first decade of the 21st century, but such rises were not experienced by all countries in the region. In countries with a rise in charcoal-burning suicide rates, the timing, scale, and sex/age pattern of increases varied by country. Factors underlying these variations require further investigation, but may include differences in culture or in media portrayals of the method.
   Please see later in the article for the
   Editors' Summary
   Editors' Summary
   Background
   Every year, almost one million people die by suicide globally; suicide is the fifth leading cause of death in women aged 15-49 and the sixth leading cause of death in men in the same age group. Most people who take their own life are mentally ill. For others, stressful events (the loss of a partner, for example) have made life seem worthless or too painful to bear.
   Strategies to reduce suicide rates include better treatment of mental illness and programs that help people at high risk of suicide deal with stress. Suicide rates can also be reduced by limiting access to common suicide methods. These methods vary from place to place. Hanging is the predominant suicide method in many countries, but in Hong Kong, for example, jumping from a high building is the most common method. Suicide methods also vary over time. For example, after a woman in Hong Kong took her life in 1998 by burning barbecue charcoal in a sealed room (a process that produces the toxic gas carbon monoxide), charcoal burning rapidly went from being a rare method of killing oneself in Hong Kong to the second most common suicide method.
   Why Was This Study Done? ?
   Cases of charcoal-burning suicide have also been reported in several East and Southeast Asian countries, but there has been no systematic investigation of time trends and regional patterns of this form of suicide. A better understanding of regional changes in the number of charcoal-burning suicides might help to inform efforts to prevent the emergence of other new suicide methods. Here, the researchers investigate the time trends and regional patterns of charcoal-burning suicide in several countries in East and Southeast Asia between 1995 and 2011 and ask whether any rises in the use of this method are associated with increases in overall suicide rates. The researchers also investigate sex- and age-specific time trends in charcoal-burning suicides to identify which groups of people show the greatest increases in this form of suicide across different countries.
   What Did the Researchers Do and Find? ?
   The researchers analyzed method-specific data on suicide deaths for Hong Kong, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore between 1995/1996 and 2011 obtained from the World Health Organization Mortality Database and from national death registers. In 1995/1996, charcoal-burning suicides accounted for less than 1% of all suicides in all these countries except Japan (4.9%). By 2011, charcoal-burning suicides accounted for between 5% (Singapore) and 24% (Taiwan) of all suicides. Rises in the rate of charcoal-burning suicide were first seen in Hong Kong in 1999, in Singapore in 2000, in Taiwan in 2001, in Japan in 2003, and in the Republic of Korea in 2008. By contrast, incomplete data from Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand showed no evidence of a marked increase in charcoal-burning suicide in these countries over the same period. Charcoal-burning suicides were associated with an increase in overall suicide rates in Hong Kong in 1998-2003, in Taiwan in 2000-2006, and in Japanese women after 2003. Finally, the annual rate of change in charcoal-burning suicide rate did not differ by sex/age group in Taiwan and Hong Kong, whereas in Japan people aged 15-24 and in the Republic of Korea people aged 25-64 tended to have the greatest rates of increase.
   What Do These Findings Mean? ?
   These findings show that charcoal-burning suicides increased markedly in several but not all East and Southeast Asian countries during the first decade of the 21st century. Moreover, in countries where there was an increase, the timing, scale, and sex/age pattern of the increase varied by country. The accuracy of these findings is likely to be limited by several aspects of the study.
   For example, because of the way that method-specific suicides are recorded in the World Health Organization Mortality Database and national death registries, the researchers may have slightly overestimated the number of charcoal-burning suicides. Further studies are now needed to identify the factors that underlie the variations between countries in charcoal-burning suicide rates and time trends reported here. However, the current findings highlight the need to undertake surveillance to identify the emergence of new suicide methods and the importance of policy makers, the media, and internet service providers working together to restrict graphic and detailed descriptions of new suicide methods.

DE Public awareness campaigns; Suicide; Depression; Japan
AB Background: Public awareness campaigns about depression and suicide have been viewed as highly effective strategies in preventing suicide, yet their effectiveness has not been established in previous studies. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a public-awareness campaign by comparing suicide counts before and after a city-wide campaign in Nagoya, japan, where the city government distributed promotional materials that were aimed to stimulate public awareness of depression and promote care-seeking behavior during the period of 2010-2012.
   Methods: In each of the sixteen wards of the city of Nagoya, we count the number of times that the promotional materials were distributed per month and then examine the association between the suicide counts and the frequency of distributions in the months following such distributions. We run a Poisson regression model that controls for the effects of ward-specific observed and unobserved heterogeneities and temporal shocks.
   Findings: Our analysis indicates that more frequent distribution of the campaign material is associated with a decrease in the number of suicides in the subsequent months. The campaign was estimated to have been especially effective for the male residents of the city.
   Limitation: The underlying mechanism of how the campaign reduced suicides remains to be unclear.
   Conclusion: Public awareness campaigns can be an effective strategy in preventing suicide. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigates the abrupt increase in the number of suicides in Japan in 1998 and the subsequent persistence of suicide thereafter; it does so by undertaking data decompositions in terms of demographic factors, reasons for suicide, employment status, and access to the means of committing suicide. The decomposition results regarding the growth in the Japanese suicide rate from 1997 to 1998 show that a large proportion of the abrupt increase in the number of suicides can be attributed to middle-aged men with financial problems, and that the self-employed subset of the population contributed significantly to growth in the suicide rate. Meanwhile, persistently high suicide rates since 1998 can be largely attributed to the younger generation (i.e., those aged 20-39). In accordance with the decomposition results, prefecture-level panel data regression established a correlation between suicide and economic hardship. In particular, the unemployment rate and the individual bankruptcy rate were found to be positively associated with the suicide rates of all males, males aged 20-39, and males aged 40-59, while individual bankruptcy was found to affect middle-aged males more than younger males.

AB A substantial amount of evidence indicates that news coverage of suicide deaths by celebrities is followed by an increase in suicide rates, suggesting a copycat behavior. However, the underlying process by which celebrity status and media coverage leads to increases in subsequent suicides is still unclear. This study collected over 1 million individual messages ("tweets") posted on Twitter that were related to 26 prominent figures in Japan who died by suicide between 2010 and 2014 and investigated whether media reports on suicide deaths that generated a greater level of reactions by the public are likely to be followed by a larger increase in actual suicides. We also compared the number of Twitter posts and the number of media reports in newspaper and on television to understand whether the number of messages on Twitter in response to the deaths corresponds to the amount of coverage in the traditional media. Using daily data from Japan's national death registry between 2010 and 2014, our analysis found an increase in actual suicides only when suicide deaths generated a large reaction from Twitter users. In contrast, no discernible increase in suicide counts was observed when the analysis included suicide deaths to which Twitter users did not show much interest, even when these deaths were covered considerably by the traditional media. This study also found suicides by relatively young entertainers generated a large number of posts on Twitter. This sharply contrasts with the relatively smaller volume of reaction to them generated by traditional forms of media, which focuses more on the deaths of non-entertainers. The results of this study strongly suggest that it is not sufficient to examine only traditional news media when investigating the impact of media reports on actual suicides. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

ID IMPACT
AB Media reports of suicides have an impact on suicide rates. However, countermeasures to this media effect have not been evaluated. We examined the association between media reports of suicides accomplished with the use of hydrogen sulfide, the voluntary stoppage of sales of suicide-related products, and suicide rates for people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s in Japan. The Box-Jenkins transfer function model was applied to monthly time series data from February 2003 to December 2009 (83 months). In the male suicide time series, media reports of suicide were not related to suicide counts (omega((R)) = 8.988, P = 0.694). Similarly, stopping the sale of bath salts was not related to the number of suicides (omega((S)) = -7.344, P = 0.694). However, in the female suicide time series, media reports of suicide were related to the number of suicides (omega((R)) = 17.225, P = 0.049). Similarly, stopping the sale of bath salts was related to the number of suicides (omega((S)) = -18.545, P = 0.040). The results suggest that stopping the sale of bath salts might be effective in reducing the number of copycat suicides among the women in their 20s, 30s, and 40s. In practice, stopping the sale of suicide-related products might be a potentially effective countermeasure to prevent copycat suicides triggered by media coverage of suicides.

AB The number of suicides in Japan has increased from approximately 22 000 per year from 1988 to 1997 to >30 000 per year since 1998. Likewise, the number of suicides has been increasing in Mie Prefecture. The purpose of the present study was to examine the incidence of and circumstances surrounding all suicide cases during 1996-2002 in Mie Prefecture and to compare the data with those from 1989 to 1995. In Mie Prefecture, the age-specific suicide rate during the second 7-year period included marked increases among men aged 50-59 and 60-69 years. Among women, the age-specific suicide rate increased with age during both 7-year periods. During the second period, psychiatric disorders as causative factors increased in all generations. They were especially important for women of the younger generation, whereas economic problems were the most common causative factor among men aged 40-64. Physical illness as a causative factor in suicide was high among the elderly, but among the other age groups this factor trailed behind economic difficulties for men and psychiatric. disorders for women. To prevent suicide, social cooperation as well as a plenitude of visiting nurses and psychiatric care is required, and early detection and treatment are also important.

AB Background: To respond to the rapid surge in the incidence of suicide in Japan, which appears to be an ongoing trend, the Japanese Multimodal Intervention Trials for Suicide Prevention (J-MISP) have launched a multimodal community-based suicide prevention program, NOCOMIT-J. The primary aim of this study is to examine whether NOCOMIT-J is effective in reducing suicidal behavior in the community.
   Methods/Design This study is a community intervention trial involving seven intervention regions with accompanying control regions, all with populations of statistically sufficient size. The program focuses on building social support networks in the public health system for suicide prevention and mental health promotion, intending to reinforce human relationships in the community. The intervention program components includes a primary prevention measures of awareness campaign for the public and key personnel, secondary prevention measures for screening of, and assisting, high-risk individuals, after-care for individuals bereaved by suicide, and other measures. The intervention started in July 2006, and will continue for 3.5 years. Participants are Japanese and foreign residents living in the intervention and control regions (a total of population of 2,120,000 individuals).
   Discussion: The present study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the community-based suicide prevention program in the seven participating areas.

AB Background: Pharmacists could play a significant role in providing care for suicidal individuals. Previous studies reported that gatekeeper attitudes toward suicide could affect caregiving behaviors toward people at risk for suicide. Nevertheless, only few studies have examined the attitudes of pharmacists toward suicide. Aims: This study explores the factors associated with the attitudes of pharmacists toward suicide. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire and written explanation of the study were mailed to 541 pharmacists who had registered for the Board Certified Psychiatry Pharmacy Specialist Seminar in Tokyo, Japan. A Japanese version of the Attitudes Toward Suicide questionnaire was used to assess participant attitudes toward suicide. Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to assess relationships between participant attitudes toward suicide as well as demographics, occupational, and personal factors. Results: Participants who had previously received suicide-related education were more likely to have positive attitudes toward suicide prevention. Conversely, those with a lifetime history of suicidal thoughts had more permissive attitudes toward one's right to commit suicide. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that pharmacist suicide prevention training programs should aim to alter permissiveness attitudes of trainees toward suicide.

AB Purpose An analysis model based on monthly or fortnight data is inadequate to precisely evaluate the impact of media reporting of suicide on suicide rates as well as the time lag from exposure to the report of a suicide. Thus, we used daily time-series data and examined the association between newspaper articles on suicide and suicide attempts in Japan.
   Methods The Box-Jenkins transfer function model was applied to daily time-series data for the period March 27-May 21, 2008.
   Results Newspaper articles on suicide using hydrogen sulfide at (t - 1) were related to suicide attempts at (t) (ps < 0.001 and 0.05). Newspaper articles on suicides using hydrogen sulfide on the front page at (t - 1) were related to suicide attempts at (t) ( p < 0.00). The magnitude of the impact of newspaper articles about suicide at (t - 1) or (t - 3) on "copy-cat'' suicide attempts became greater as the number of news articles violating the media suicide recommendations increased.
   Conclusions The time lag between exposure to newspaper reports of suicide and attempts was 1 or 3 days, and the magnitude of the impact of front page articles was about four times as great as that of suicide articles in general.

AB It is considered that people from poor countries get depressed which ultimately leads to suicide. It is estimated that one million people commit suicide every year worldwide. It is considered from statistics that global annual suicide fatalities could rise to 1.5 million by 2020. Economically and culturally the most influential countries of East Asia are China, Japan and South Korea. To find the underlying causes for such a high suicide rate was the basic purpose of this article. We selected 100 suicide research articles as well as World Health Organisation's statistics related to suicide in East Asian countries. Stress and insecurity, whether related to employment or in relationship, are the basic causes which ultimately take an individual to the verge of suicide. Some people also find suicide a mean to get rid of life due to some lethal diseases. Aged persons consider themselves out of life so they adopt suicide. The government has already taken serious steps to minimise the death rate caused by suicide. Stress in education institutions has to be negotiated by taking some steps in education policy. Consistent efforts should be made to cope with this problem.

ID RISK-FACTORS; TRENDS; AGE; AVAILABILITY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MORTALITY;
   AUTOPSY; ACCESS; CHINA; WEST
AB Background: The gender ratio (male/female) of suicide rates greatly differs by country and by age group. These differences are accompanied by differences in the use of violent methods of suicide.
   Methods: The gender ratio of suicide rates and the methods used were calculated from the most recently available official electronic mortality data published by the four countries (two Eastern (Korea and Japan) and two Western (Australia and the United states) countries) and from the World Health Organization [WHO] mortality database. Suicide gender ratios based on 95% Confidence intervals (CIs) were used to compare the countries between age groups.
   Results: The gender ratio of suicide rates was higher in the United States (3.9) and Australia (3.3), where gender differences in suicide methods were more prominent, than in Korea (1.8) and Japan (2.7). In the United States and Australia, the gender ratios greatly increased in the elderly (age 70 years and over), with a higher use of firearms by men. The gender ratio of suicide rates was lowest (1.0) in the young (age 20-29) in Korea, where hanging was a more common method in women than in men.
   Limitations: The study does not consider the various other factors that may have influenced gender differences of suicide rate.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that differences in suicide methods play a role in determining the differences in the gender ratio of suicide rates between countries. Because suicide methods varied with gender, age, and country and may play a role in the suicide rates of each group, these parameters should be taken into account in the design of suicide prevention measures.

AB To determine the factors underlying suicide in Akita prefecture, a questionnaire survey was conducted among members of the Akita Prefectural Medical Association (APMA), regarding suicide cases they attended. During the investigation period (1 July 2001-30 June 2002), the total number of suicide cases was 243 (138 completed, 105 attempted). Significant differences were identified between completed and attempted suicide groups in terms of gender, age distribution, and suicidal methods. Specifically, in the completed suicide group, the number of male completers exceeded that of female completers, the number of middle-aged or elderly completers was high, and the majority of completed suicide cases involved hanging as the suicide method. Conversely, in the attempted suicide group, the number of female attempters exceeded that of male attempters, younger attempters were frequent, hanging was rare, and drug overdose or cutting was common. In addition, the number of cases involving a history of previous suicide attempts was significantly higher in the attempted suicide group than in the completed suicide group. The results of the present study support the concept that the completed and attempted suicide groups are essentially of a different nature. Furthermore, the number of cases involving a history of previous suicide attempts was found to be significantly lower in the completed suicide group than in the attempted suicide group. This result indicates the difficulty in decreasing the number of completed suicides by simply providing intervention and care for individuals who have attempted suicide.

AB Hara-kiri is a unique Japanese custom, primarily stemming from the manners and customs that a samurai held. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical features of individuals who attempted suicide by hara-kiri. We enrolled 647 patients who had attempted suicide. Clinical features were compared between those who had employed hara-kiri and those who had used other methods. 25 of the 647 subjects had attempted suicide by hara-kiri. The ratio of men to women and the proportion of patients with mood disorders were significantly higher in the hara-kiri group than in the other methods group. The average length of stay in either the hospital or in the intensive care unit was also longer in the hara-kiri group than in the other methods group. Hara-kiri is an original Japanese method of attempting suicide, and suicide attempts by hara-kiri may be aimed at maintaining a reputation or taking responsibility.

   In Japan, over 30,000 people commit suicide annually, and the number of suicides committed by middle-aged to elderly people is increasing, as in other economically developed countries. Many of the individuals committing suicide have underlying psychological diseases. 0In the current situation, collection of correct information and appropriate use of this information are considered to be important.

AB Objective: No large population-based prospective study has investigated the risks of suicide and death by other externally caused injuries (ECIs) among stroke patients. The purpose of this study was to examine whether stroke increases the risks of suicide and ECI deaths. Methods: We analyzed data from the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study between 1990 and 2010. Poisson regression models were used to calculate adjusted risk ratios (RR) for suicide and ECI deaths. To adjust for unmeasured confounders, case-crossover analyses of all stroke patients who died by suicide and ECIs were also performed. Results: A population-based cohort of 93,027 Japanese residents was established. During the follow-up period, 4793 residents had been diagnosed as having stroke. During this period, there were 22 suicides and 53 ECI deaths among stroke patients and 490 suicides and 675 ECI deaths among those who were stroke-free. Stroke patients were at increased risk for death by suicide and ECIs within the first 5 years after a stroke (suicide: RR = 10.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.3-16.6; ECI: RR = 12.8, 95% confidence interval = 9.0-18.2). Furthermore, case-crossover analyses confirmed the results of the Poisson regression models. Conclusions: The RRs of suicide and ECI deaths within the first 5 years after a stroke were noticeably high. These findings underscore the need for clinicians and health care professionals to be aware of causes of death after a stroke and closely monitor patients during the first few poststroke years.

AB The lack of social support is the most common risk factor for late-life suicide. Few previous community-based interventions against the lack of social relationships reduced suicide. This study aims to evaluate outcomes of a community-based prevention program against suicide amongst the elderly in rural Japan. During 1995-2002, the program based on population strategy including group activity, psychoeducation and self-assessment of depression but no screening for depression, was implemented for elderly residents in Yuri town, Japan (5-year average population 6817; 5-year average suicide rate [>= 65 years old] 291.4/10(5)). Changes in the relative risk of suicide for individuals (>= 65 years old) before and after the 8-year implementation were estimated by the incidence rate ratio (IRR), using a quasi-experimental design with a neighboring reference, Chokai town, Japan (5-year average population 8136; 5-year average suicide rate [>= 65 years old] 216.5/10(5)). The risk of elderly females in Yuri completing suicide was reduced by 76% (age-adjusted IRR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.10-0.58), while there was no change in the risks for Yuri's elderly males and both Chokai's elderly males and females. General loglinear analysis estimated a ratio of the female IRR in Yuri to that in its Akita prefecture of 0.35 (95% CI, 0.14-0.84), showing that the reduction of the risk in the intervention area was greater than a historical trend. A community-based suicide prevention through a group intervention designed to increase knowledge and to cultivate social relationships would be effective for elderly females but not males.

DE Suicide rate; Asia countries; social expenditure
AB An empirical study reported that the economic crisis in European countries affected their suicide rates and described that an increase in social services expenditures of US$10 per person in labor market programs impacted the decrease in unemployment suicides by 0.038%. However, there has no study that the economic crisis in Asia countries affected their suicide rates. Since 2008, South Korea has been ranked first for suicide rate in the OECD countries. Many studies have blamed the economic crisis that followed from the US financial crisis in 2007 as the critical cause. However, in the case of Japan, the suicide rate decreased in the same time period (2008-2011) even though they faced the same financial crisis. The purpose of this study was to examine why the different situations in Korea and Japan occurred with the economic crisis through testing whether the government's social service expenditure affects the people's suicide rate in Asia countries. These efforts will contribute to understanding the critical role of social service.

AB AimAlthough the female suicide rate in Japan is one of the highest among OECD countries, little has been done to assess the psychosocial and psychiatric characteristics of Japanese female suicide completers. This study aimed to examine sex differences in psychosocial and psychiatric characteristics of suicide completers using a psychological autopsy study method, and to identify female suicide factors and intervention points to prevent female suicides.
   MethodsA semi-structured interview was conducted with close family members of adult suicide completers. The interview included questions regarding sociodemographic factors, suicide characteristics, previous suicidal behaviors and a family history of suicidal behaviors, financial problems, and physical/psychiatric problems. Fisher's exact test and the Student's t-test were used to explore sex differences in these survey items, and individual descriptive information of female suicide cases was also examined.
   ResultsOf the 92 suicide completers, 28 were female and 64 were male. Females had a significantly higher prevalence of a history of self-harm/suicide attempts (P < 0.001). The prevalence of eating disorders was significantly higher among females than males (P < 0.01).
   ConclusionThe findings of this study highlight the importance of providing psychological and social support to caregivers of those who repeatedly attempt suicide and express suicidal thoughts, and to suggest the need to improve community care systems to be aware of suicide risk factors among female suicide attempters.

SO OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE-OXFORD

DT Article
DE Incidence; mental disorders; overwork; suicide; workers' compensation
AB Background Mental disorders and suicide resulting from overwork or work-related stress have become major occupational health issues worldwide, particularly in Asian countries. However, no studies have reported incidence rates of mental disorders and suicide by sex, age group and industry, using a national database containing all cases involving compensation in Asian countries.
   Aims The present study examined incidence rates of occupational mental disorders and suicide by sex, age group and industry using a database containing all cases involving compensation for mental disorders and suicide in Japan over a 5-year period.
   Methods Cases involving compensation for mental disorders and suicide in Japan between January 2010 and March 2015 were analysed. Incidence rates over the 5-year study period were calculated by sex, age group and industry.
   Results In total, 1990 cases involving compensation for mental disorders and suicide (619 women and 1371 men) between January 2010 and March 2015 were analysed. The incidence rate involving compensation was higher in employees aged between 30 and 39 years. In men, incidence rates were higher in 'accommodation/eating/drinking services', 'information/communication' and 'scientific research, professional and technical services'. In these industries, incidence rates were particularly high for those aged 29 years or younger.
   Conclusions Our findings highlight the importance of promoting mental health support for younger employees and increasing awareness of their working conditions. Differences in incidence rates by sex, age and industry should be taken into consideration in the development of a national policy and industry and age-specific preventive measures for overwork-related mental disorders and suicide.

AB Background Seasonality in youth suicide has been speculated to be associated with the school calendar, as it tends to increase at the beginning of the academic year or after a long break, but robust empirical evidence remains scarce.
   Methods We examined the nationwide death records in the Vital Statistics of Japan to investigate the seasonal patterns of suicide among youth. Our data set included 108 968 suicides by individuals who died at 6-26 years of age between 1974 and 2014 in Japan. The daily frequencies of death were plotted against the Japanese school calendar, which has little regional and temporal variations. We also estimated a Poisson regression model to uncover the cyclical patterns of suicide deaths.
   Results We found that the frequencies of suicide by middle school students (ages 12-15 years) and high school students (ages 15-18 years) sharply increased around the dates when a school session began in April and September. These tended to be low during school breaks. The results of regression analysis suggested middle school students were more than twice as likely to die by suicide when the summer break ended and the second semester began, compared with the baseline week in July. Similarly, the frequency of suicide for high school students also increased by similar to 40% at the end of the summer break. Importantly, no such pattern was found for those aged 18-26 years.
   Conclusions Our findings strongly indicate that the cyclical pattern of youth suicide is closely related to the school calendar.

AB Introduction: Between 1988 and 1997, the number of suicides in Japan has increased from approximately 22,000 per year from 1988 to 1997. This number has increased to over 30,000 per year since 1998. This increase in the number of suicides is one of the important medical and social problems in Japan. A similar increase has been observed in Mie Prefecture.
   Design, Materials, and Methods: We examined All inquest records made during 1996-2002 in cooperation with the First Department of Criminal Investigation of Mie Prefectural Police Headquarters. During the test period, we recorded the annual average atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, rainfall, and duration of daylight hours in a year. This recording was carried out in Mie Prefectural office in cooperation with the Tsu meteorological observatory. We then calculated the correlation between the aforementioned ecological factors and the annual suicide rates in Mie Prefecture.
   Results and Conclusion: During the test period, the number of suicides was 1,979 and 969 in males and females, respectively. The annual suicide rates ranged from 17.2 to 26.9 per 100,000. The annual suicide rates in females correlated significantly with the average temperature. Additionally, this rate showed a significant negative correlation with the average duration of daylight hours. Therefore, the Administration, police, medical staff, and the general public must understand and be aware of the significant association between these ecological factors and suicidal risk in females.

AB Objective: We examined the relationship of increasing prescription volume of newer antidepressants, introduced in Japan in 1999, to national rates of suicide.
   Method: The relationship between annual changes in rates of suicide (obtained from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare Vital Statistics Database) and prescription volume of the newer antidepressants paroxetine, fluvoxamine, and milnacipran (obtained from the database of IMS Japan K.K.), stratified by gender and age groups, was modeled statistically for the years 1999 through 2003. Effects of unemployment and alcohol consumption and the interaction of gender and age with antidepressant prescribing were assessed.
   Results: From 1999 through 2003 in Japan, total antidepressant prescriptions increased 57% among males and 50% among females. Approximately 80% of this increase involved the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). To reduce a limitation of ecological analysis, we compared annual change in prescription and suicide rates, which eliminates the effect of long-term (secular) linear trends. We found an inverse association between year-to-year changes in the suicide rate and prescription volume of newer antidepressants (fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and mitnacipran) (beta = -1.34, p = .008) and SSRIs specifically (fluvoxamine, paroxetine) (beta = -1.41, p = .019). An increase of I defined daily dose of SSRI use/1000 population/day was associated with a 6% decrease in suicide rate. Exploratory analysis suggested a stronger association in males, who experienced a greater increase in antidepressant use. Changes in unemployment and alcohol consumption rates did not explain the association.
   Conclusion: In Japan during 1999 through 2003, absent long-term linear trend effects, annual increases in prescribing of newer antidepressant medications, mainly SSRIs, were associated with annual decreases in suicide rates, particularly among males.

DE Natural disasters; Suicide; Japan; Social connectedness; Social capital

AB Previous research shows no consensus as to whether and how natural disasters affect suicide rates in their aftermath. Using prefecture-level panel data of natural disasters and suicide in Japan between 1982 and 2010, we estimate both contemporaneous and lagged effects of natural disasters on the suicide rates of various demographic groups. We find that when the damage caused by natural disasters is extremely large, as in the case of the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake in 1995, suicide rates tend to increase in the immediate aftermath of the disaster and several years later. However, when the damage by natural disasters is less severe, suicide rates tend to decrease after the disasters, especially one or two years later. Thus, natural disasters affect the suicide rates of affected populations in a complicated way, depending on the severity of damages as well as on how many years have passed since the disaster. We also find that the effects of natural disasters on suicide rates vary considerably across demographic groups, which suggests that some population subgroups are more vulnerable to the impact of natural disasters than others. We then test the possibility that natural disasters enhance people's willingness to help others in society, an effect that may work as a protective factor against disaster victims' suicidal risks. We find that natural disasters increase the level of social ties in affected communities, which may mitigate some of the adverse consequence of natural disasters, resulting in a decline in suicide rates. Our findings also indicate that when natural disasters are highly destructive and disruptive, such protective features of social connectedness are unlikely to be enough to compensate for the severe negative impact of disasters on health outcomes.

AB Aim:
   To clarify the impact of biopsychosocial factors on psychiatric training under the new and traditional postgraduate medical education system in Japan and to compare them with young psychiatrists from other countries.
   Methods:
   Psychiatric residents and early-career psychiatrists were recruited in Japan and other countries. Using mail-based and web-based self-administered questionnaires, we evaluated participants' demographic information, motivation to become psychiatrists, interest and commitment to various aspects of psychiatry, and reactions to a case vignette, focusing on biopsychosocial factors.
   Results:
   A total of 137 responses, 81 from Japan and 56 from other countries, were collected. Before starting psychiatric training, Japanese participants showed a strong interest in 'mind' and less interest in 'brain' and 'environmental factors', while the interest in 'brain' and 'environmental factors' is presently as high as that in 'mind.' Japanese participants reported less commitment to their training toward ICD/DSM-based diagnosis, interview, pharmacotherapy, psychosocial treatment and epidemiology, compared with participants from other countries. In particular, Japanese participants showed less commitment to their training in suicide prevention, despite their perception of its high importance due to a high suicide rate in Japan. Suicide risk of a case vignette proved to be differently assessed according to participants' commitment levels to each aspect of psychiatry.
   Conclusion:
   Our results suggest that young psychiatrists' attitudes concerning the biopsychosocial model generally become well-balanced with psychiatric training, however sociocultural factors do not seem to be well represented in the Japanese psychiatric training system. Additional training on sociocultural issues, such as suicide in Japan, should be considered.

Analysis of Google data and figures released by the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare indicated that the volume of searches using the search terms jisatsu (suicide) and jisatsu houhou (suicide method) are not correlated with the suicide death rate. In addition, a rising suicide death rate might be related to the increase in suicide-related search activity (particularly utsu [depression]), but an increase in suicide-related search activity itself is not directly linked to the rise of suicide death rate.

AB Aim
   Suicide victims have various distresses or motives. There are few studies on how these motives toward suicide relate with each other. We used network analyses to extract the structures of correlations among the motives for suicide.
   Methods
   We obtained datasets of suicide victims from 2007-2009 in Japan in cooperation with Ibaraki Prefectural Police Headquarters. The data were analyzed by network centrality measures and a structural analysis by block modeling.
   Results
   Among the motives, depression and physical illness showed relatively high scores of 'degree centrality', whereas depression and unemployment showed relatively high scores of 'betweenness centrality'. Structural analysis by block modeling resulted in eight blocks. The most important block comprised eight motives, including conflict between parent and child, marital conflict, economic hardship, and overloaded with debt.
   Conclusion
   Depression and physical illness were important and priority areas for completed suicides, although these two motives had different influences on suicide behaviors. Furthermore, structural analysis revealed the important role of a block, including some familial and financial motives, which induced hopelessness. Our results suggest that it might be useful to consider the common ways in which motivations for suicide are tied together when suicide intervention is launched from a social model point of view.

AB Background: In Japan, although many suicidal studies were previously conducted in tertiary emergency department (ED) settings, no published studies have reported on suicidal patients presenting to the secondary EDs. The aim of the study was to describe the characteristics of suicidal patients and the referral rates to a psychiatrist overall and by type of facility.
   Methods: Questionnaires were sent to all secondary and tertiary EDs in Tochigi prefecture, Japan. Data were collected for cases who presented in September 2009. Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and t-tests compared the results by gender and type of ED.
   Results: All 74 EDs responded to the survey. There were 81 patients who attempted or died by suicide (36 men and 45 women). The most common method of suicide attempt was drug overdose (57%) followed by stabbing (17%). About a half used prescription drugs to attempt or die by suicide. The majority had a history of psychiatric disorders, and 35% had previous suicide attempt. About a half were admitted to medical or surgical unit; 33% were discharged home; and 9% died. After excluding those who died, 53% were referred to a psychiatrist, but 47% were not referred to a psychiatrist. The referral rate was lower for cases seen at secondary EDs (38%) compared to tertiary EDs (67%).
   Conclusion: Although professional organizations suggest that suicidal patients are seen by a psychiatrist, many were not, especially at secondary EDs. Further research is needed to assure that suicidal patients presenting to EDs receive appropriate psychiatric assessment and follow-up after discharge.

SO JOURNAL OF FORENSIC AND LEGAL MEDICINE

DT Article
DE Suicide; Physician
ID DOCTORS; DEATH; EXPERIENCE; MORTALITY
AB Numerous studies on physician suicide in various countries have been reported but no data from Japan on the issue can be found to date. In this study, physician suicides in the special wards of Tokyo Metropolitan area in 1996-2010 were investigated retrospectively. A total of 87 cases were enrolled. The results suggested that physician suicide has been linked to pre-existing psychiatric illnesses and occupational problems, and that psychiatrists have a relatively higher suicide risk compared to those majoring in other specialities of medicine. A distinctive feature was that 19 cases had used either drugs or devices which were accessible due to their profession some time during the process of committing suicide. Another notable feature was that 4 out of 5 anaesthesiologists enrolled in the study had chosen poisoning for their suicide method, with the drugs frequently used in their speciality. The findings advocate strongly for efficient suicide prevention measures for physicians including an early detection and treatment of psychiatric illnesses, as well as an urgent need for a more effective pharmacy management in applicable institutions together with the implementation of self discipline on each physician. This is the first broad academic study on physician suicide in Japan. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

TI The Apocryphal Suicide of Saigo Takamori: Samurai, <i>Seppuku</i>, and
   the Politics of Legend
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID MEIJI JAPAN
AB According to standard reference works, the Meiji leader Saigo Takamori committed ritual suicide in 1877. A close reading of primary sources, however, reveals that Saigo could not have killed himself as commonly described; instead, he was crippled by a bullet wound and beheaded by his followers. Saigo's suicide became an established part of Japanese history only in the early 1900s, with the rise of bushido as a national ideology. By contrast, in the 1870s and 1880s, the story of Saigo's suicide was just one of many fantastic accounts of his demise, which also included legends that he ascended to Mars or escaped to Russia. Remarkably, historians have treated Saigo's suicide as an unproblematic account of his death, rather than as a legend codified some four decades later. This essay links the story of Saigo's suicide to the rise of modern Japanese nationalism, and examines other Saigo legends as counternarratives for modern Japan.

AB Background: Suicide is a grave public health issue that is responsible for a high mortality rate among individuals aged 15 44 years. Attitudes toward suicide among medical staff members have been associated with appropriate therapeutic responses to suicidal individuals. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of parental rearing on attitudes toward suicide among Japanese medical college students.
   Methods: We examined the association between parental bonding and attitudes toward suicide in 160 medical college students in Japan. The Parental Bonding Instrument was used to assess the attitudes and behaviors of parents. The attitudes toward suicide were evaluated using the Japanese version of the Attitudes Toward Suicide questionnaire.
   Results: The mean age of the subjects was 25.2 +/- 4.0 years old. The majority of the participants in our study agreed that anyone could commit suicide (88.8%) and that suicide is preventable (86.3%). After adjusting for age and sex, multivariate regression analysis revealed that maternal care approached a statistically significant association with the "right to suicide" attitude. Under the same conditions, maternal care was shown to be significantly associated with the " common occurrence" attitude. No other significant relationships were observed between parental bonding and attitudes toward suicide.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that a higher level of maternal care ensures that children think that suicide occurs less commonly. The promotion of best practices for suicide prevention among medical students is needed. Child rearing support might be associated with suicide prevention.

AB A suicide cluster within a given community may be defined as a group of suicides or suicide attempts, or both, that happen closer together in time and space than would generally be expected. However, since the perception of clustering may itself be a risk factor for suicide, suicide clusters differ almost from all other event clusters. The aim of this article, therefore, is to discuss the unique pattern of suicide cluster and introduce a novel type of categorization taking into account varieties of studies, which investigate suicide clusters within diverse settings. This article concludes with challenging areas in suicide cluster studies and emphasizing that each community must deal rapidly and appropriately with any perceived suicide clusters.

DE Natural rate of suicides; Cointegration; Time series; OECD
ID COINTEGRATION; UNEMPLOYMENT
AB This paper provides further evidence on the hypothesis of the natural rate of suicide using the time series data for 15 OECD countries over the period 1970-2004. This hypothesis suggests that the suicide rate of a society could never be zero even if both the economic and the social conditions were made ideal from the point of view of suicide (Yang and Lester, 1991). This research relates the suicide rates to harmonized unemployment and divorce rates to test the natural hypothesis statistically. We also address methodological flaws by earlier suicide studies by employing autoregressive-distributed lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration advocated by Pesaran et al. (2001). In majority of regression equations, the constant term was positive and statistically significant, indicating a non-zero natural suicide rate. In particular, we find evidence that at aggregate level. Turkey has the lowest (3.64) and Japan has the highest (13.98) natural rate of suicides. In terms of the male natural suicide rates, the United Kingdom ranks the lowest (4.73) and Belgium ranks the top (15.44). As for the female natural suicide rates, japan takes the lead (16.76) and Italy has the lowest (5.60). The results are also compared and contrasted to each other with a view to drawing plausible policy conclusions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide is a major public health issue. In Japan, local governments are responsible for suicide prevention, and local government officers are therefore expected to act as gatekeepers for suicide prevention. In this study, through a questionnaire survey, the authors examined the current knowledge and attitudes concerning suicide prevention among local government officers and healthcare and welfare professionals, and the effects of providing suicide prevention education on their knowledge of and attitudes toward suicide and its prevention. One hundred eighty-three local government officers and 432 healthcare/welfare professionals completed the survey before and after a single education session. Before the session, the local government officers and healthcare/welfare professionals showed mainly positive attitudes toward suicide prevention efforts, with little difference between the two groups. After the training, knowledge and attitudes were further improved for most questionnaire items. Respondents with one or more experiences of suicide prevention training showed significantly more knowledge and positive attitudes before the training than those with no such experience. Moreover, knowledge of depression and having a sympathetic attitude were found to be especially associated with the overall attitude that "suicide can be prevented". Training in suicide prevention was shown to be effective in promoting appropriate knowledge and attitudes among local government officers and healthcare/welfare professionals who are gatekeepers for preventing suicide. Our findings confirm the importance of suicide prevention education, and will contribute to creating a standard educational program on suicide prevention in Japan.

AB Objectives: In most Western and Asian countries, a higher risk of suicide is found among elderly people than those in other age groups. However, the treatment needs of elderly people who are at risk of committing suicide are not well understood. We conducted an overview of studies that assessed the impact of suicide prevention interventions on suicide rates in elderly people in Japan. We interpreted the results of these studies, as well as prominent findings associated with other successful interventions, within a framework of the suicidal process and preventive strategies.Method: We assessed six quasi-experimental studies of community-based interventions providing universal depression screening, subsequent care, and education to elderly people in Japan, and performed a combined analysis of outcome data.Results: Screening interventions were associated with lower suicide rates. We also found a gender difference in the response to subsequent psychiatric or primary care. Two types of interventions decreased the rate of suicide among elderly people: crisis helplines and screening interventions. These interventions featured a close link between universal, selective, and indicated prevention strategies, which reflect different approaches tailored to the size and risk profile of the target individuals.Conclusion: Successful interventions appear to hinge on systematic links between multi-level prevention interventions. Multi-level interventions for depression screening may result in lower suicide rates among elderly individuals in communities, although primary care interventions alone appear to be insufficient in men. The benefit of linked multi-level prevention interventions may highlight the importance of the multiple steps and components of the suicidal process.

AB Suicide attempt is a potent risk factor of subsequent suicide. Understanding the characteristics of suicide attempters is important for preventing suicide. The authors investigated aggression in medically serious suicide attempters at an emergency department. Trait aggression was evaluated in 55 suicide attempters and 71 healthy individuals as a control group using the Japanese version of the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BAQ). Total BAQ scores (t = 2.782, P = 0.006) and the hostility scores (t = 3.735, P < 0.001) were significantly higher in the suicide attempters than the controls. It suggested that to focus on aggression and its management is one of the key components for preventing suicide.

TI Suicide in Mie Prefecture, Japan, since 1990
SO WEST INDIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID DEPRESSION
AB The number of suicides in Japan has increased to over 30 000 per year since 1998. Similarly, the number of suicides has been increasing in Mie Prefecture. In the present study, we examined the incidence and the circumstances of all suicidal cases that were reported to the Mie Prefectural Police Headquarters during the thirteen-year period 1990-2002. In Mie Prefecture, the number of suicides per year averaged 363.1. The largest numbers occurred in the spring and early summer months. For men, suicides were most common in the 50-59-year age group; for women, they were most common in the 70-79-year age group. As for the methods of suicide, hanging was, the most frequent for both genders. The major causative factors of suicide were described as "suffering from physical illness", "psychiatric disorders" and "economic difficulties". Of these, "psychiatric disorders" was the most important causative factor for the younger groups of both genders. For the middle-aged group of men, the most important causative factor was "economic difficulties". "Suffering from physical illness" was the most serious causative factor for the elderly group of both genders. In order to prevent suicide, urgent strategies for effective medical treatment and social cooperation are required.

DE Gender difference; Japan; Suicide
ID TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS; FEMALE LABOR-FORCE; SOCIOECONOMIC-FACTORS;
   SEX-DIFFERENCES; RISK-FACTORS; POPULATION; DEPRESSION; ADULTS; RATES;
   MALES
AB Background: The effects of socio-economic factors on suicide were gender-dependent. Japanese suicide mortality gender ratio (male: female) had gradually increased during the twentieth century.
   Methods: With the data covering 1947-2010 collected from Japanese official websites, we conducted non-parametric rank test, curve estimations, spearman ranking correlation and quantile regression in succession with Stata version 12.0.
   Results: The suicide mortality rate in male with a "U" shape had been always higher than that in female with a "J" shape. The male suicide mortality peaked around in 1955 (38.5 per 100,000 populations), dropped quickly afterwards until the 19705; it increased in the 19805 with another peak in 2003 (33.2 per 100,000 populations). For female, an overall decreasing trend was seen with a peak during the 1950s (23.5 per 100,000 populations in 1958). It dropped gradually afterwards with small variations in 1970s and 80s, and was stabilized after 1995 (9.3 per 100,000 populations). The unemployment rate could be used as a single positive predictor of suicide mortality for men (p < 0.01), while the total fertility rate (TFR) (p < 0.01) and divorce rate (p < 0.01) were significantly associated positively and negatively with women's suicide, respectively.
   Limitations: The impact of mental disorders was not analyzed and age specific analysis was not conducted.
   Conclusion: The findings of these gender differences in, and the associated factors with, suicide in Japan, warranted further studies including delineation of the implications of differential economic pressure between genders, as well as child rearing pressure and marriage satisfaction.

ID UNITED-STATES; RISK-FACTORS; DEATH
AB Background: Marital status is one of the most frequently replicated predictors of suicide. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of marital status on the risk of suicide by gender, using a large population-based cohort in Japan.
   Methods: The Miyagi cohort study was a population-based, prospective cohort study of Japanese adults aged between 40 and 64 years. Between June and August 1990, 47,604 participants residing in 14 municipalities of Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, completed a questionnaire on various health-related lifestyles, including marital status. During 18 years of follow-up, 146 of the participants committed suicide. We used the Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for suicide mortality according to marital status with adjustment for potential confounders.
   Results: A total of 106 and 40 deaths from suicide were recorded during 344,813 and 365,524 person-years of follow-up among 20,671 men and 21,076 women, respectively. We found that marital status was significantly associated with the risk of completing suicide only in men. Among men, after multivariate adjustment, HRs in reference to married were as follows: widowed or divorced, 2.84 (95% CI: 1.37-5.90); unmarried, 1.56 (95% CI: 0.67-3.64). A significantly increased risk of suicidal death was observed among widowed or divorced men, whereas no such trend was evident for women.
   Conclusions.: Our results suggest that men who are widowed or divorced, or unmarried, are at increased risk of suicide, whereas no such risk is evident for women. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim: The aim of the study was to investigate the incidence of and risk factors for repetition of suicidal behavior within a year after admission for drug overdose in Japan.
   Methods: Patients admitted to the emergency department of a general public hospital in Tokyo for drug overdose of prescribed medicine and/or over-the-counter drugs between March 2008 and February 2009 were followed up after 1 year. Demographic characteristics, previous suicide attempts, and mental health state were examined by self-report questionnaire and interview at recovery from the initial attempt. Information about suicidal behavior during the follow-up period was obtained from the outpatient psychiatrists by postal questionnaire 1 year after discharge.
   Results: Of 190 patients admitted to the emergency department, 132 patients answered the questionnaire and had the interview. Information about thefollow-up period for 66 patients was obtained. Of the 66 patients, 28 patients attempted suicide again and two patients committed suicide during the 1-year follow-up period. Psychiatric diagnosis of personality disorder and denial of suicidal intent at the time of recovery were associated with increased risk for another suicide attempt. Lethality levels of suicidal behaviors before and after admission were associated with each other.
   Conclusion: The rate of fatal and non-fatal suicide attempt within a year after admission for self-poisoning was substantial. Psychiatric diagnosis of personality disorder was a risk factor for repetition of suicide attempt. Clinicians should pay attention to the means of previous suicide attempts even though the patient denies suicidal intent at recovery.

ID DEPRESSION
AB Background: As the suicide rate in Japan has remained high since 1998, various suicide prevention measures have been implemented in Japanese local communities.
   Aims: To report our findings on the effect of a psychoeducational video as a suicide prevention measure in a Japanese rural town.
   Methods: Questionnaires were randomly mailed to 2,000 residents aged between 30 and 79 years. Within 4 weeks, volunteers in the town visited the residents individually and collected the questionnaires. The variables reported in this study are demographics, awareness of suicide prevention measures available in the town, whether the residents watched the video, help-seeking from advisers regarding suicidal ideation and financial problems and attitudes towards suicide.
   Results: We analysed data collected from 1,118 people who reported their demographics (i.e. sex, age, and job) and whether they had watched the video. By conducting a series of logistic regression and multiple regression analyses and controlling for demographic variables, we found that watching the video had substantial psychoeducational effects.
   Conclusion: Despite conducting a cross-sectional study, our new suicide prevention measures were considered effective for psychoeducation. However, further studies using a longitudinal design are needed.

AB Background. The interactive effect of personal factors and social factors upon suicide risk is unclear. We conducted prospective cohort study to investigate whether the impact of the economic crisis in 1997-1998 upon suicide risk differed according to Neuroticism and Psychoticism personality traits.
   Methods. The Miyagi Cohort Study in Japan with a follow-up for 19 years from 1990 to 2008 has 29432 subjects aged 40-64 years at baseline who completed a questionnaire about various health habits and the Japanese version of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire - Revised Short Form in 1990.
   Results. The suicide mortality rate increased from 4.6 per 100000 person-years before 1998 to 27.8 after 1998. Although both Neuroticism and Psychoticism were significantly associated with an increased risk of mortality during the whole period from 1990 to 2008, the impact of the economic crisis upon suicide risk differed between the Neuroticism and Psychoticism personality traits. Compared with the lowest category, the hazard ratios (HRs) for the highest Neuroticism increased from 0.66 before 1998 to 2.45 after 1998. On the other hand, the HRs for the highest Psychoticism decreased from 7.85 before 1998 to 2.05 after 1998.
   Conclusions. The impact of the 1997-1998 economic crisis upon suicide risk differed according to personality. Suicide risk increased among these with higher Neuroticism after the economic crisis, but this was not the case for other personality subscales.

AB Background: Recent research in Japan and Taiwan has found that the volume of Internet searches each month on Google for suicide-related terms is sometimes associated with the monthly suicide rate. The present study sought to examine whether this association between suicide rates and Google searches for suicide are found over regions.
   Methods: Suicide rates in the state of America in 2009 were examined for their association with search volume on Google for "commit suicide," "how to suicide" and "suicide prevention."
   Results: Suicide rates for the 50 American states were positively associated with the search volume for all three terms.
   Conclusions: Internet searches for suicide may provide a faster way of monitoring possible trends in suicide than waiting for central governments to compile suicide statistics. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article
ID INCOME INEQUALITY; HEALTH; GENERATION; AREA
AB Background: Geographical inequalities in suicide have risen dramatically across 47 prefectures in Japan since 1995. We sought to examine temporal changes in the associations between prefecture-level economic conditions and completed suicide during the recent 35 years, controlling for individual composition in each prefecture. Methods: Based on quinquennial vital statistics and census data from 1975 to 2010, we analysed the entire population aged 25-64 years. The total number of suicides was 87 553 men and 34 559 women. As indicators of prefecture-level economic conditions, we used average yearly income, average savings and income inequality (measured by Gini coefficients for yearly income). For each sex, we estimated odds ratios and 95% credible intervals for suicide using multilevel logistic regression models, with cells at level 1, years at level 2 and prefectures at level 3. Results: Even after adjusting for individual age, occupation and time trends, low average savings at prefecture level were associated with a higher risk of suicide among men (odds ratio in low vs. high savings: 1.13, 95% credible interval: 1.05-1.21), whereas no clear patterns were observed with other economic indicators. When we further examined the associations in year-specific models by conducting a two-level analysis, both average yearly income and average savings were inversely associated with suicide risk in recent years. No clear association was found between income inequality and suicide risk for either sex. Conclusion: The present findings suggest that low area socioeconomic status may be driving the growing geographical inequalities in suicide in Japan, primarily among men.

AB With the sustained economic recession, suicide has been increasing in Japan (more than 300 000 victims annually since 1998), particularly among middle-aged employees. Development of preventive measures is needed; however, employees have limited knowledge of the basic information about depression and suicide. One office in Saitama Prefecture, Japan, has been provided with a mental health support program. An initial questionnaire survey was conducted in December 1999. It contained demographic data and information about working styles and daily habits, including alcohol and tobacco use, quality of sleep, social support, the general well-being schedule, and knowledge/attitude toward depression and suicide. Of 225 eligible people, 216 men and women participated. Most of them had stressful schedules and demanding jobs. Their subjective well-being was generally poorer relative to the reference. The mean score of knowledge was 10.5 (SD = 2.02) for 14 items. The accuracy rates ranged from 97.6% incorrect (false) for such items as 'Most suicide victims consult psychiatrists before their deaths' to 42.1% correct (true) for 'A suicidal individual tends to be accident-prone for traffic accidents and injuries.' One-fourth of them had unfavorable attitudes toward depressive colleagues. Neither age nor gender was related to knowledge level and attitude. Variations were observed in the knowledge that employees had toward depression and suicide. A program that provides employees with appropriate information related to mental health is needed.

AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the frequency and correlates of suicidal behavior among homeless people in Japan.
   Methods A face-to-face survey was conducted in two districts of Tokyo, Japan, with 423 subjects who resided on streets and riversides and in urban parks and stations (street homeless) or who were residents of shelters, cheap hotels, or welfare homes for homeless people (sheltered homeless).
   Results When questioned about suicidal ideation in the previous 2 weeks, 51 subjects (12.2 % of valid responses) had a recurring wish to die, 29 (6.9 %) had frequent thoughts of suicide, and 22 (5.3 %) had made suicide plans. In addition, 11 (2.9 %) subjects had attempted suicide in the previous 2 weeks and 74 (17.7 %) reported that they had ever attempted suicide. In univariate logistic regression analyses, street homelessness, lack of perceived emotional social support, poor subjective health perception, visual impairment, pain, insomnia, poor mental well-being, and current depression were significantly associated with recurrent thoughts of suicide in the previous 2 weeks. Among these, current depression had the greatest significance. In multivariate logistic regression analyses after controlling for depression, street homelessness and lack of perceived emotional social support were significantly associated with recurrent thoughts of suicide in the previous 2 weeks.
   Conclusion Comprehensive interventions including housing and social support as well as mental health services might be crucial as effective strategies for suicide prevention among homeless people.

AB Rises in suicide rates following media reports of the deaths by suicide of public figures are a well-documented phenomenon. However, it remains unclear why, or by what exact mechanism, celebrity suicides act to increase suicidal risk in the wider public due to the lack of data showing how the public understands and reacts to the suicide of well-known figures. This study used a supervised machine learning approach to investigate the emotional content of almost 1 million messages sent on Twitter related to the suicides of 18 prominent individuals in Japan between 2010 and 2014. The results revealed that different demographic characteristics of the deceased person (age, gender, and occupation) resulted in significant differences in emotional response; notably that the suicides of younger people, of women and of people in entertainment careers created more emotional responses (measured as a ratio of emotionally-coded tweets within the overall volume of tweets for each case) than for older people, men, and those in other careers. Moreover, certain types of emotional response were shown to correlate to subsequent rises in the national suicide counts, with "surprised" reactions being positively correlated with the suicide counts, while a high proportion of polite messages of condolence were negatively correlated. The study demonstrates the importance of, and describes a methodology for, considering the content of social media messages, not just their volume, in research into the mechanism by which these widely-reported deaths increase suicide risk in the broader public.

Chemical suicide records an increased incidence worldwide being one of "imported" autolytic methods, original from Japan, but propagated through websites. Intentional death by H2S inhalation raises important issues as the lethal gas can be obtained by mixing substances available on the market and because it leads to high mortality rate in suicide attempts in rescuers, family members and forensic research teams.

AB Introduction A growing body of literature has demonstrated that cancer patients have a higher risk of suicide and cardiovascular mortality compared with the general population, especially immediately after a cancer diagnosis. Using data from the National Cancer Registry in Japan launched in January 2016, we will conduct the first nationwide population-based study in Japan to compare incidence of death by suicide, other externally caused injuries (ECIs) and cardiovascular disease following a cancer diagnosis with that of the general population in Japan. We will also aim to identify the patient subgroups and time periods associated with particularly high risk.
   Methods and analysis Our study subjects will consist of cancer cases diagnosed between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2016 in Japan and they will be observed until 31 December 2018. We will calculate standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and excess absolute risks (EARs) for suicide, other ECIs and cardiovascular death compared with the general population in Japan, after adjustment for sex, age and prefecture. SMRs and EARs will be calculated separately in relation to a number of factors: sex; age at diagnosis; time since cancer diagnosis; prefecture of residence at diagnosis; primary tumour site; behaviour code of tumour; extension of tumour; whether definitive surgery of the primary site was performed; and presence/absence of multiple primary tumours.
   Ethics and dissemination The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board and ethics committee of the National Cancer Center Japan and Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences. The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

AB The connection between divorce and suicide risk in Asia is unclear. To understand the contribution of cultural transitions to suicide among the divorced, we compare age- and sex-specific suicide rates among divorced men and women from five Pacific Rim populations: Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and the state of Victoria in Australia. On a cultural spectrum, we consider Hong Kong and Taiwan to lie between the more individualistic Australian culture and the more collectivistic Japanese and Korean cultures. Coefficients of aggravation (COA) are also compared.
   Suicide rates were found to be higher among the divorced than among other marital status groups in all five populations, but this difference was small in Victoria. The effect of divorce was significantly greater for men than for women only in Japan and South Korea. In the other populations, divorced men and women were at equal risk. Age trends in suicide rates for the divorced groups differed across populations. The COAs for the divorced group aged 40 or younger in the East Asian populations were higher than the COAs for older divorced groups, though this was not the case in the Victorian population.
   Suicide patterns among the divorced in the East Asian populations can be understood in terms of the legacy of Confucian traditions. Gender differences in Japan and South Korea may reflect either gender inequality (male dominance in formal interactions and emotional dependence in domestic life within a deteriorating Confucian family support system) or unique socio-cultural factors among married women. Divorced East Asian groups aged 40 or younger may be at a higher risk of suicide due to individual-level cultural ambivalence combined with a desire for systemic-level emotional interdependence. Social welfare regimes in the four East Asian populations need to fill the vacancy left by retreating traditional family systems. Research implications are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Devastating disasters may increase suicide rates due to mental distress. Previous domestic studies have reported decreased suicide rates among men following disasters. Few reports are available regarding factors associated with disasters, making it difficult to discuss how these events affect suicide rates. This study aimed to observe changes in suicide rates in disaster-stricken and neighboring areas following the Great East Japan Earthquake, and examine associations between suicide rates and economic factors.
   Monthly suicide rates were observed from March 2009 to February 2013, during which time the earthquake occurred on March, 2011. Data were included from disaster-stricken (Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima Prefectures) and neighboring (control: Aomori, Akita, and Yamagata Prefectures) areas. The association between changes in suicide rates and economic variables was evaluated based on the number of bankruptcy cases and ratio of effective job offers.
   In disaster-stricken areas, post-disaster male suicide rates decreased during the 24 months following the earthquake. This trend differed relative to control areas. Female suicide rates increased during the first seven months. Multiple regression analysis showed that bankruptcy cases (beta = 0.386, p = 0.038) and ratio of effective job offers (beta = -0.445, p = 0.018) were only significantly associated with male post-disaster suicide rates in control areas.
   Post-disaster suicide rates differed by gender following the earthquake. Our findings suggest that considering gender differences might be important for developing future post-disaster suicide prevention measures. This ecological study revealed that increasing effective job offers and decreasing bankruptcy cases can affect protectively male suicide rates in control areas.

AB On 11 March 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake and subsequent tsunami hit East Japan. We aim to investigate the impact of trauma experiences related to the earthquake on suicide risk among young children, stratified by child sex. Participants at baseline were children who were exposed to the 2011 disaster at preschool age (affected area, n=198; unaffected area, n = 82, total n = 280). From July 2013 to May 2014, suicide risk was assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID) in a follow-up interview conducted by a child psychiatrist or psychologist (N = 210, follow-up rate: 75%). Among young girls in the affected area, 12 out of 65 (18.5%) showed suicidal ideation, which is significantly higher than girls in the unaffected area (4.7%, p for chi-square = 0.036). In the multivariate model adjusted for potential confounders and mediators, the odds ratio for 4 or more trauma experiences related to the earthquake was 5.74 (95% confidence interval: 0.83-39.6, p = 0.076) compared to no trauma experience related to the earthquake. Among young boys, trauma exposure was not associated with suicidal ideation. Our findings showed that young girls who experienced earthquake-related trauma at preschool age had a higher suicidal ideation 3 years after the earthquake.

ID PROGRAM
AB The nonmedical use of medications, including psychotropic drugs, is a growing health problem in Japan. According to a nationwide survey of mental hospitals, the proportion of patients with sedative (mainly benzodiazepine) -related disorders has more than doubled over the last decade. An association between psychotropic drug overdose and suicide risk has also been reported. Furthermore, over-the-counter drug abuse is still a serious problem in Japan. In recent years, pharmacists have been expected to act as gatekeepers, making timely identifications of suicide risk or substance abuse and directing these individuals to appropriate medical care facilities. In August 2012, the revised Comprehensive Suicide Measures Act identified pharmacists as one professional group that should act as gatekeepers. This article begins by reviewing the fundamental terms involved in understanding the nonmedical use of medications, including abuse, dependence, and intoxication. The current situation of substance abuse and dependence is then introduced through a summary of several epidemiological surveys conducted in Japan. Finally, the role of pharmacists as gatekeepers in preventing substance abuse and dependence on medications is discussed.

AB Context. In Japan, suicide by inhaling hydrogen sulfide (H2S) by mixing commercial products escalated into a nationwide trend in April 2008. Objective. We conducted a multicenter retrospective survey on the demographics, clinical features, treatments, and outcomes of patients exposed to H2S suicide attempts. Materials and methods. Subjects included patients transported to emergency facilities in Japan from January 2005 to December 2011 following H2S suicide attempts. Among 277 facilities to which a letter requesting data collection was sent, questionnaires were sent to and filled out by the 47 (18%) facilities that agreed to provide data. Questionnaires were collected and data were extracted at Kitasato University. Results. A total of 156 patients were included in this survey. Patients involved in an H2S suicide attempt increased from 1 in 2007 to 51 in 2008, and gradually decreased from 44 in 2009 to 37 in 2010 and 23 in 2011. Ninety-two patients attempted H2S suicide (primary exposure group), and 64 were secondarily affected by the suicide attempt (secondary exposure group). Patients in the primary exposure group were young (mean, 30.3 years (10.9)), and male patients (n = 62) were approximately two times more likely to attempt H2S suicide than females (n = 30). Forty-eight patients in cardiopulmonary arrest at the scene did not survive. Five non-cardiopulmonary arrest patients died, and five patients who presented with a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) < 8 and lactic acidosis had neurological or cardiac signs or symptoms at discharge. Antidote therapy was performed on 26 of the primary group patients, but with poor outcomes. None of the secondary group patients were in cardiopulmonary arrest at the scene, five received antidotal therapy after arriving at the hospital, and all completely recovered from H2S exposure. Discussion and conclusion. Mortality (58%) among patients who attempted H2S suicide was very high, likely resulting from inhaling high concentrations of H2S after mixing commercial products in a sealed and confined space.

TI Reconsidering the effects of blue-light installation for prevention of

SO JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS

DE Suicide prevention; Blue lights; Railway suicide
AB Background: A recent preliminary communication suggested that the calming effect of blue lights installed at the ends of railway platforms in Japan reduced suicides by 84%. This estimate is potentially misleading from an epidemiological point of view and is reconsidered in the present study.
   Methods: Governmental data listing all railway suicide attempts in Japan from April 2002 to March 2012 were used to investigate the proportion of suicide attempts within station premises, where blue lights are potentially installed, and at night, when they would be lit. For those suicide attempts within station premises, we also estimated the proportion that occurred at the ends of the platforms at night.
   Results: 015841 total reported suicide attempts, 43% occurred within the station premises, 43% occurred at night (from 18:00 to 05:59), and 14% occurred both within the station premises and at night. Of the 2535 attempts within station premises, 32% occurred at night and 28% at most were at the end of a platform at night.
   Limitations: The exact proportion of nighttime suicide attempts at the ends of railway platforms was not calculable. Nonetheless, the proportion of suicide attempts that is potentially preventable by blue lights should be less than our conservative estimate.
   Conclusions: The installation of blue lights on platforms, even were they to have some effect in preventing railway suicides at night, would have a much smaller impact than previously estimated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,

AB AimBurnout is a psychological condition that may occur in all workers after being exposed to excessive work-related stresses. We investigated suicidal ideation and burnout among Japanese psychiatric trainees as a part of the Burnout Syndrome Study (BoSS) International.
   MethodsIn the Japanese branch, 91 trainees fully completed suicide ideation and behaviour questionnaire (SIBQ) and Maslach Burnout InventoryGeneral Survey (MBI-GS).
   ResultsPassive suicidal ideation was reported by 38.5% of Japanese trainees and 22.0% of them had experienced active suicidal ideation. The burnout rate among Japanese subjects was 40.0%. These results were worse compared to the all 1980 trainees who fully completed the main outcome measure in BoSS International, 25.9%, 20.4% and 36.7%, respectively.
   ConclusionsOur results suggest a higher risk of suicide among Japanese residents. Japan has a higher suicide rate than other countries. Early detection of, and appropriate intervention for, suicidal ideation is important in preventing suicide in psychiatry residents.

AB The objective of this case report is to illustrate the influence of socio-psychological background on behavior in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). A comparative analysis was undertaken of two suicide cases with AD in the USA and Japan. Both cases were in the early stages of AD. They succeeded in suicide even with their disturbed executive functions, because they felt deprived of their dignity for different reasons according to their socio-cultural background. Early stage AD patients may retain the behavior and intellectual functions associated with their dignity and desire. Since dignity and desire are very cultural concerns, socio-psychological background should be cautiously considered when dealing with the emotional problems of AD patients.

ID INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INTERVIEW; DIAZEPAM; ABUSE; RISK; MINI
AB In Japan, a national countermeasure has been forwarded since the enactment of the Basic Act on Suicide Countermeasures in 2006 and the Comprehensive Suicide Prevention Initiative in 2007. The distinctive policy of the Japanese countermeasure is expressed as the word, "comprehensive," which means that suicide prevention may not only be carried out only by mental health measures but also by comprehensive measures including chance of administrative practices. This policy is proper, although mental health measures appear to be too simple inclining to psychiatric treatments for the classic type of "depression" by a pharmacotherapy. The authors have insisted that mental health measures including psychiatric treatments are also required to be more comprehensive. This paper describes that benzodiazepine (BZ) -abuse problems including overdosing by suicidal intents have got worse recently as psychiatric clinics have increased and most of BZ abusers obtain the abused drugs form psychiatrists. This current situation indicates that pharmacists need to monitor psychiatrists' prescribing behavior and qualities of psychiatric treatment is required to be refined, suggesting pharmacists may be one of the "Gate Keeper," as supporting resources for suicide prevention. Additionally, this paper explained that basic attitudes and responses acquired by pharmacists as a supporter for suicide prevention.

AB Background
   Although dietary patterns have been linked to depression, a frequently observed precondition for suicide, no study has yet examined the association between dietary patterns and suicide risk.
   Aims
   To prospectively investigate the association between dietary patterns and death from suicide.
   Method
   Participants were 40752 men and 48 285 women who took part in the second survey of the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study (1995-1998). Dietary patterns were derived from principal component analysis of the consumption of 134 food and beverage items ascertained by a food frequency questionnaire. Hazard ratios of suicide from the fourth year of follow-up to December 2005 were calculated.
   Results
   Among both men and women, a 'prudent' dietary pattern characterised by a high intake of vegetables, fruits, potatoes, soy products, mushrooms, seaweed and fish was associated with a decreased risk of suicide. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of suicide for the highest v. lowest quartiles of the dietary pattern score was 0.46 (95% Cl 0.28-0.75) (P for trend, 0.005). Other dietary patterns (Westernised and traditional Japanese) were not associated with suicide risk.
   Conclusions
   Our findings suggest that a prudent dietary pattern may be associated with a decreased risk of death from suicide.

DT Article
DE Suicide; Japan; Religion; Popular religion; Ghosts; Media
AB For an overwhelming majority of commentators, including many anthropologists, 'Japanese culture' is still associated with a positive view of suicide. Western-language writings have contributed by feedback loop to perpetuate this stereotype. Besides the local 'samurai ethic', Japanese Buddhism is also said not to prohibit taking one's life. However, the most popular examples of heroic self-sacrifice, from the Edo period to WWII, are fraught with covert contradictions. From ancient times to the present religious practitioners of all sorts have maintained that suicide creates unhappy, resentful spirits who harm the living. This article discusses many examples of a diverse series of narratives, from spirit medium's s,ances to drama to contemporary films, in which the anguished spirits of suicides are allowed to express themselves directly. After the figures rose alarmingly in the late 1990s various religious organisations have attempted to fight the stigma suffered by bereaved family members and have introduced new interpretations and new rituals.

AB Although the important role of social support in mental health is acknowledged, no prospective study has yet examined the relation of social support to suicide. Here, we investigated the association between social support and suicide in a cohort of Japanese men and women. A total of 26,672 men and 29,865 women aged 40-69 years enrolled in the Japan Public Health Center-based prospective study in 1993-1994 completed a self-administered questionnaire which included four items of social support, and were followed for death through December 2005. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% Cl) of suicidal death by social support index were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. A total of 180 suicidal deaths were recorded during an average of 12 years' follow-up. Men and women with the highest level of social support had a significantly decreased risk of suicide, with HRs (95% Cl) for the highest versus lowest social support group of 0.56 (0.33-0.94) and 0.38 (0.16-0.89) in men and women, respectively. Esteem support and having four or more friends were associated with a lower risk of suicide in women [0.32 (0.13-0.77)] and in both sexes [men: 0.56 (0.36-0.88): women: 0.65 (0.32-1.30)], respectively, whereas confident support was not. These findings suggest that social support may be important for suicide prevention. Avoiding social isolation may decrease the incidence of suicide in men and women, and esteem support can provide additional benefit for women. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A devastating earthquake causes psychological distress, and may increase suicide mortality thereafter, yet previous studies have made inconsistent conclusions regarding this issue. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the 2004 Niigata-Chuetsu earthquake in Japan affected long-term mortality from suicide. We conducted a comparative study of suicide mortality rates during the 5-year period preceding and the 3-year period following the earthquake in the disaster area and a control area in Niigata Prefecture, by analyzing death certificate data from October 1, 1999, to September 30, 2007. In men, baseline suicide mortality rates (5 years preceding the earthquake) were 48.4 per 100,000 person-years in the disaster area and 46.1 in the control area, and suicide mortality rates during the 3-year period following the earthquake were 46.0 and 45.1, respectively. In women, baseline suicide mortality rates were 22.3 in the disaster area and 18.7 in the control area, and post-earthquake suicide mortality rates were 20.2 and 15.3, respectively. In consequence, the decrease in suicide mortality rate during the 3 years post-earthquake was significantly higher in the disaster area (2.5) than in the control area (1.0) (p = 0.0013) in men, whereas the decrease in suicide mortality rate was 2.1 in the disaster area and 3.0 in the control area (p = 0.1246) in women. We have concluded that the long-term mortality from suicide after the earthquake decreases in men and increases in women, suggesting that post-earthquake suicide mortality is sex-dependent. Post-earthquake suicide prevention strategies should more aggressively target women.

AB Objective: Although attempted suicide is one of the strongest predictors of completed suicide, few Japanese studies have described psychiatric differences between those who attempt suicide by overdose (OD) and those who use more violent methods (MV). Methods: A total of 22 consecutively admitted MVs were compared to 78 ODs. All patients were referred for psychiatric evaluation during the same 3-year period. Results: The MV group was predominantly male (68%), whereas the OD group was predominantly female (72%). Using DSM-IV criteria, depressive disorders were most common in both groups, followed by psychotic disorders. The OD group had significantly more borderline patients. Contrary to previous reports, prior psychiatric contact was low in the MV group. MVs were more likely to complain of financial problems and to retain a definite wish to die after the attempt. Conclusions: This study identified meaningful differences between the two groups of patients who attempted suicide. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide attempt is a risk factor for suicide. To investigate trait impulsivity among suicide attempters, 93 attempters admitted to an emergency department and 113 healthy controls were evaluated using the Japanese version of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11J). Impulsivity was analyzed in relation to clinical data in the attempters. Total BIS-11J, attention impulsiveness, and motor impulsiveness scores were significantly higher in the attempters than in the controls. Both total BIS-11J and non-planning impulsiveness scores were significantly higher in attempters with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders among the diagnostic groups. Control of impulsivity should be considered as one of the targets for suicide prevention.

AB The number of suicides in Japan increased from about 22,000 per year during the period 1988 to 1997 to over 30,000 since 1998. The number of suicides has also been increasing in Mie Prefecture. In the present study we examined the incidence and the circumstances for all suicidal cases during the seven-year period, 1996-2002, that were reported to Mie Prefectural Police Headquarters.
   In Mie Prefecture, the number of suicides per year averaged 421 cases: from a minimum of 319 in 1997 to a maximum of 501 in 1998. The most frequent month for suicides was July, while the lowest number occurred in February. Suicide was most common in the 50-59 year age group in men, and in the 70-79 year group in women. Regarding the means of suicide, hanging was the most frequent (61.6%) in both sexes. Psychiatric disorders were the most serious causative factors in all generations, accounting for 23.8% in general but being especially prevalent in the younger generation of people under 39 years. Further reasons for suicide were economic problems for the 40-64 age-group in men and suffering from illness for the elderly age-groups in both sexes. In order to prevent suicide, urgent strategies for effective medical treatments and improved working circumstances are required.

AB Aims: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between inappropriate views on suicide, such as it being a personal choice, inevitable, unpreventable, and permissible, with demographic variables and the feeling of shame in seeking help among the general population.
   Methods: A self-administered questionnaire on mental health and suicide was distributed to all residents aged 40-74 in four areas in Oita Prefecture, Japan, and 4487 responded. The association of seven inappropriate views on suicide with demographic variables was examined by multiple logistic analyses. The association between feeling shame in seeking help with demographic variables and the above views on suicide was similarly analyzed.
   Results: Inappropriate views on suicide were associated with gender (i. e. men). Some of these views also correlated with age, never having been married, and living in rural areas or areas with high suicide mortality rates. Multivariate analysis revealed that feeling shame in seeking help when distressed was associated with being aged 70-74, living in rural areas or areas with high suicide mortality rates, the view on suicide as a matter of self-choice, and a pessimistic view toward life.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that inappropriate views on suicide adversely affect coping strategies and mental health. Suicide prevention programs aimed at improving mental health literacy in a community should take into consideration the characteristics of elderly male residents.

AB Suicide is a major problem worldwide, and suicides in Asian countries account for as much as 60% of all suicides in the world. There are many unique features in suicides within this ethnically-diverse continent, from the methods used, to the putative risk factors. Much research still needs to be done to guide efficacious and culturally relevant interventions in suicide prevention; existing literature suggests a strong focus for programmes that address restricting access to pesticides, increasing crisis counseling activities, improving the accessibility and delivery of mental health services, and promoting responsible media reporting of suicide and related issues. There is a need for coordinated national suicide plans to be developed that are sensitive to the socioeconomic and cultural factors in the local context.

ID JAPAN; FARMERS
AB In recent years, the relationship between occupation and suicide has been extensively investigated, but few definite conclusions regarding the nature of the relationship have been established. In the present study, this relationship was investigated by examining Japanese governmental statistics. First, correlations of suicide rate relative to industry categories were examined individually for primary industry (farmers, fishermen, and forest workers), secondary industry (construction workers, manufacture works, and miners), and tertiary industry (indoor workers) for all of the 47 prefectures of Japan. Second, in the industries that showed a significant correlation with suicide rate, the relationship to other factors was adjusted using possibly confounding factors. As a result, suicide rate was positively correlated with primary industry percentage, but not with secondary or tertiary industry percentages. Multiple regression analysis showed that suicide rate was positively associated with primary industry percentage with significant tendency while it was significantly and negatively associated with annual total sunshine. Limitations are that individual suicide rates according to occupational types were not available and direct correlations with the above variables could not be investigated. The present findings suggest a possibility that occupational factors associated with primary industry may be relevant to suicide, and that, additionally, annual total sunshine may affect suicide independently. Since workers with primary industry are likely to be exposed to sunshine than other workers, they may tend to be more affected by the decrease of annual total sunshine. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB Design, Materials, and Methods: The number of suicides in Japan has increased to over 30,000 per year since 1998. The collapse of the bubble economy occurred in about 1990, and unemployment rates in Japan increased rapidly starting 1998. The present study investigated the suicide rate in Okayama Prefecture in the period between 1990 and 2000 as well as the unemployment rate, ratio of job offers to applicants, and ratio of new job offers to new applicants throughout Japan during the same period. Correlation between annual suicide rates and the annual unemployment rate, the annual ratio of job offers to applicants, and the annual ratio of new job offers to new applicants was calculated.
   Results, and Conclusion: During the study period, the suicide rate by sex was 23.0 males and 10.8 females per 100,000 population. Annual suicide rates in males correlated significantly with the unemployment rate [r(11) = 0.87, p < 0.001 (y = 4.77x (7.49)] while the rates in females did not [r(11) = 0.41, p = 0.20 (y = 0.65x t 8.64)]. Therefore, annual suicide rates overall correlated remarkably with the unemployment rates among males but not with the same rates among females. Annual suicide rates in males displayed a significant reverse correlation with the ratio of job offers to applicants [r(11) = 0.70, p = 0.02 (y = -9.71x ( 34.61)] while the rates in females did not correlate with this ratio [r(11) = 0.17, p = 0.62 (y = -0.53x ( 11.41)]. Annual suicide rates in males displayed a rough reverse correlation with the ratio of new job offers to new applicants [r(11) = 0.67, p = 0.02 (y -6.88x ( 36.14)] while the rates in females did not correlate with this ratio [r(I 1) = 0.13, p = 0.70 (y = -0.31x 11.37)]. Therefore, the families of unemployed men and providers of their medical care should pay close attention for indications of suicidal tendencies, and society must pay attention to the rise in unemployment rates, the decline in the ratio of job offers to applicants, and the decline in the ratio of new job offers to new applicants, particularly among males.

AB Background The factors most strongly associated with suicide are age and gender-more men than women, and, more people over 65 kill themselves. As a number of Governments have targets to reduce suicide levels we compare elderly suicide rates over a 20-year period in England and Wales. And the major Western countries focusing upon age and gender.
   Method WHO mortality data were used to calculate three-year average General Population Suicide Rates (GPSR) for 1979-1981 to 1997-1999 and rates of people aged 65-74 and 75+ suicide by gender to provide ratios of change and a statistical comparison of England and Wales and the Major Western countries over the period.
   Results Male GSPR: '65-74' suicide ratios fell significantly in six countries and in three for the '75+'. Female GSPR: '65-74' suicide ratios fell in every country except Spain. Proportionately, there were more suicides in the over 65s in countries with an 'extended family' tradition, Spain, Italy, Germany, France and Japan, than in the five 'secular' countries. England and Wales male '65-74' suicide fell significantly more than Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Netherlands and the USA, and did significantly better than the other countries for all female senior citizen suicides.
   Conclusion Suicide of the over-65s has improved in seven countries, especially in England and Wales, who had the greatest proportional reduction, which reflects well upon the psycho-geriatric and community services. However, in all countries, male 65-74 rates did not match the female out so extra efforts are needed to improve male rates. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

DE Railway and metro suicide; Prevention; Japan
ID RAILWAY; PREVENTION; INTERVENTIONS; HOTSPOTS; ACCESS
AB Background: Installing physical barriers at suicide hotspots is known as an effective strategy for suicide prevention. However, the effectiveness of physical barriers may be nullified by the substitution phenomenon, i.e., that restricting access to a particular place induces people at risk to look for a nearby place for suicide.
   Methods: This study tests whether the substitution phenomenon exists in the case of railway and metro suicides. We focused on the prevention effort by a Japanese railway company that installed blue light-emitting-diode (LED) lamps on railway platforms to prevent people from diving to a running train. Using panel data of 71 train stations between 2000 and 2013, we compared the number of suicides before and after the installation of the blue lights at 14 stations where the lights were installed and at neighboring five stations on the same railway line, using the number of suicides at all other stations without the intervention as a control group.
   Findings: Our regression analysis shows that the introduction of blue lights decreased the number suicides by 74% (Cl : 48-87%) at stations where the blue lights were installed, while it did not result in a systematic increase in the number of suicides at the neighboring stations.
   Interpretation: The installation of blue lights generated no systematic substitution phenomenon at nearby stations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB It has already been established that severe psychological distress is a major risk factor for completed suicide. However, the impact (population attributable fraction; PAF) of moderate psychological distress on completed suicide has not been clarified. The present study investigated the association between various severities of psychological distress and completed suicide. We analyzed follow-up data covering a 7.3-year period (2006-2014) for 43,473 adults (aged >= 40 years) participating in a community-based, prospective cohort study. Psychological distress was measured using the K6 psychological distress scale at the baseline. Participants were classified into three groups according to their K6 score (low: 0-4; moderate: 5-12; severe: 13-24). Completed suicide was determined from a Japanese national database. The Cox model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for completed suicide. The PAFs of moderate and severe psychological distress for completed suicide were also estimated. The multivariate-adjusted HRs (95% confidence interval) for completed suicide were 2.37 (1.49-3.78) among participants with moderate psychological distress, and 4.16 (2.13-8.15) among those with severe psychological distress, relative to those with low psychological distress (P for trend < 0.001). The PAF of the moderate group for completed suicide was 26.8%, whereas that of the severe group was 10.9%. Not only severe but also moderate psychological distress was significantly associated with an increased risk of completed suicide. The PAF of moderate psychological distress for completed suicide was larger than that of severe psychological distress. Public health actions for suicide prevention should focus on moderate as well as severe psychological distress.

AB Background: A history of psychiatric disorders is a high risk for suicide. The present study compared the clinical features of psychiatric patients in Japan who attempted suicide by jumping from a height and those who attempted suicide by self-stabbing.
   Methods: We compared two groups of suicide attempters who were hospitalized for both physical and psychiatric treatment (n=202). We compared the psychiatric diagnoses and clinical features between those who attempted suicide by jumping from a height (N=147) and those who did so by self-stabbing (N=55).
   Results: The self-stabbing group (mean age 52.3 years) was significantly older compared to the jumping group (mean age 37.9 years). A significantly higher proportion of females were found in the jumping group. Jumping from a height was significantly associated with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, whereas self-stabbing was significantly associated with mood disorders.
   Limitations: The results were drawn from data from a single hospital in a large urban city, and the study population did not include subjects who completed their suicide attempts.
   Conclusions: Our findings show that differences in suicide methods (here, between jumping from a height and self-stabbing) may be related to suicide attempters psychiatric diagnosis, gender and age It is thus important to obtain a more detailed background information about a patients suicide attempt and to create suicide prevention plans in accord with individuals' psychiatric diagnosis, age and gender, especially among those who have attempted suicide by jumping from a height or self-stabbing.

AB This paper contributes to the literature of suicide studies by presenting procedures and its estimates of the number of family members who lose their loved ones to suicide. Using Japanese aggregate level data, three main findings emerge: first, there are approximately five bereaved family members per suicide; second, in 2006, there were about 90,000 children who had lost a parent to suicide; and third, in 2006, there were about three million living family members who had lost a loved one to suicide. The direct production loss of bereaved family members in 2006 alone is estimated at approximately 197 million USD. These results are valuable in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of suicide prevention programs and in designing appropriate policy instruments.

AB Depression is a major cause of suicide among the elderly. Few previous community-based interventions against depression have reduced the suicide rate. This study aims to evaluate outcomes of a community-based program to prevent suicide among the elderly using a quasi-experimental design with a neighboring reference group. The program, including depression screening with follow-up and health education through primary care and public health nursing, was implemented for 10 years in Matsudai town, a rural area of Japan (population 6,015; suicide rate per 10(5) [65-year-olds] for males 290.6, and for females 361.3). Changes in the suicide risk were estimated by the incidence rate ratio (IRR). The female risk of completing suicide in the intervention area was reduced by 70% (age-adjusted IRR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.14-0/67), while there was no change in the risk for males in the intervention area nor males for males or females in the reference area (Kawanishi town: population 9,425; elderly suicide rate for males 212.2, females 151.9). A ratio of the female IRR in the intervention area to that in its prefecture was also estimated at 0.45 (95% CI: 0.19-0.97), showing that the reduction of suicide risk in the intervention area was greater than the historical trend. A community intervention against suicide using management of depression with nonpsychiatric, primary health care would be effective for elderly females, but not males.

Thus it is the psychology and the particular past of the individual than his feeling of belonging to the group which determines the circumstances from which the suicide is motivated. This will always be some kind of breaking of the vital bond uniting the individual to the group (dependence, obligation), which will make life unbearable for him and which will make him seek in voluntary death the most honorable way out.

ID MAJOR PUBLIC HOLIDAYS; PATTERNS; TIME
AB The number of suicide deaths in Japan has continued to be high, and is a pressing social problem. Although the weekly distribution of suicide deaths has been documented, no nationwide analysis has yet been conducted. In the present study, the ratios of the number of suicide deaths per day, by day of the week, and on weekdays relative to holidays were calculated using the data for all suicide deaths recorded in 2003. The suicide deaths recorded on holidays were treated as the reference, and a confidence interval of 95% (95% CI) was used. We calculated the suicide death ratios among men and women of all ages (men: 23,396, women: 8,713, total: 32,109) and also among those of productive age (age: 15-64 years, men: 18,552, women: 5,481, total: 24,033). Among men of all ages, the suicide death ratio on Mondays was found to be significantly high at 1.49 (95% CI: 1.04-2.14), and the ratios were found to decrease over the course of the week from Monday to Friday. On each weekday, the suicide death ratios among men of productive age were found to be higher than those among men of all ages. Among women, the suicide death ratios on any weekday were found to be higher than 1, but there was no significant difference between the days. Among both men and women, the number of suicide deaths on holidays was lower than that on weekdays. This study revealed that the number of suicide deaths recorded per day on Mondays is 1.5 times higher than that on holidays among men. This suggests that the structure of the work week may possibly influence suicide deaths among men. Future discussions regarding the arrangement and distribution of weekly holidays should be conducted in order to reduce the number of suicide deaths.

AB Background: The relation of income and socioeconomic status with suicide rates remains unclear. Most previous studies have focused on the relationship between suicide rates and macroeconomic factors (e.g., economic growth rate). Therefore, we aimed to identify the relationship between individuals' socioeconomic position and suicide risk.
   Methods: We analyzed suicide mortality rates across socioeconomic positions to identify potential trends using observational data on suicide mortality collected between January 2003 and December 2013 from 1,025,340 national health insurance enrollees. We followed the subjects for 123.5 months on average. Socioeconomic position was estimated using insurance premium levels. To examine the hazard ratios of suicide mortality in various socioeconomic positions, we used Cox proportional hazard models.
   Results: We found that the hazard ratios of suicide showed an increasing trend as socioeconomic position decreased. After adjusting for gender, age, geographic location, and disability level, Medicaid recipients had the highest suicide hazard ratio (2.28; 95% CI, 1.87-2.77). Among the Medicaid recipients, men had higher hazard ratios than women (2.79; 95% CI, 2.17-3.59 vs. 1.71; 95% CI, 1.25-2.34). Hazard ratios also varied across age groups. The highest hazard ratio was found in the 40-59-year-old group (3.19; 95% CI, 2.31-4.43), whereas the lowest ratio was found in those 60 years and older (1.44; 95% CI, 1.09-1.87).
   Conclusions: Our results illuminate the relationship between socioeconomic position and suicide rates and can be used to design and implement future policies on suicide prevention. (C) 2017 The Authors. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of The Japan Epidemiological Association.

AB Media reporting can impact negatively or positively on suicidal behaviour. Specific reporting methods such as the use of sensationalism can influence suicidal behaviour. This paper presents the findings from a study that aimed to provide an in-depth examination of New Zealand mainstream news items in which websites played a role in suicide. We used framing analysis to interpret the role online technology plays in the reporting of the suicide event. The findings indicate that news items were primarily framed in such a way so that the role of online technology was often overemphasised at the expense of the suicide events themselves. While websites were characteristically framed as 'enablers' or 'preventers' of suicide, the contribution of mental wellbeing to suicide was largely marginalised in the news media reports. The paper concludes by considering the implications of these framings for existing media studies of suicide and the media's role in suicide prevention.

AB Aim: Suicide is a major public health concern in Japan but little is known about the prevalence of and risk factors for suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts. The aim of the present study was to clarify the prevalence of and risk factors for important suicide-related outcomes.
   Methods: Important suicide-related outcomes and risk factors were assessed in face-to-face interviews with 2436 adult respondents in seven areas as part of the World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health Survey Initiative. Mental disorders were assessed with the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).
   Results: The lifetime prevalence estimates of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts were 10.9%, 2.1%, and 1.9%, respectively. Risk of suicide plans and attempts was highest when suicidal ideation occurred at an early age and within the first year of ideation. In middle-aged individuals, the period after first employment and the presence of mental disorders were risk factors.
   Conclusions: Risk of suicide plans and attempts is highest when suicidal ideation occurred at an earlier age and within the first year of ideation. Mental disorders are as predictive of the suicide-related outcomes examined here, and comorbidity is an important predictor.

ID PREVENTION; DEPRESSION; ADOLESCENT
AB Background: Telephone hotlines are a widely used type of suicide prevention program. Aims: The aim of this study was to clarify the risk factors for suicidal ideation by investigating its association with a number of characteristics among telephone hotline callers. Method: Data were collected over a 10-year period from a total of 246,595 calls to Inochi No Denwa, a telephone crisis hotline in Ibaraki, Japan, and subsequently analyzed. Odds ratios for suicidal compared with nonsuicidal ideation were also calculated. Results: About 6% of the calls to the hotline were suicide related, and about 2% of the callers had attempted suicide in the past. Odds ratios for suicidal ideation increased during winter, but no daily tendencies were evident. Those whose problems were related to their way of life were at the highest risk of suicidal ideation, followed by those with health-related concerns. Conclusion: We were able to identify risk factors for suicidal ideation based on an analysis of enormous amounts of data from a telephone crisis hotline in Japan. Knowledge of these risk factors is expected to lead to improvements in suicide prevention programs.

AB We attempt to identify the population who are vulnerable to emotional shocks by exploiting an unprecedented series of celebrity suicides in South Korea during the last decade, including one of the most famous actresses, as well as a former president. Our conservative estimates show that for 5 out of 11 celebrity suicides observed, 1 celebrity suicide on average yielded to more than 10 excessive suicides per day over a time frame of at least 2 weeks. The results indicate that a significant number of people are very much mentally unstable to end their life by emotional shocks that should be irrelevant to their economic status.

AB Introduction: Major depressive disorder is an important risk factor for suicide in adults. In Japan, few studies examining the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy in patients with this disorder hospitalized after suicide attempts have been reported. This study aimed to obtain preliminary data on the usefulness and safety of tandospirone combination therapy in patients with major depressive disorder, who were admitted to an emergency medical center in Japan following suicide attempts.
   Design: A retrospective study.
   Methods: We reviewed 56 consecutive patients with major depressive disorder who had been treated with antidepressants. The patients were divided into two groups: antidepressants monotherapy group and tandospirone combination therapy group. Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression-17 scores were used to evaluate the efficacy of tandospirone combination therapy.
   Results: Improvement rate in the tandospirone group was significantly higher than that in the antidepressants monotherapy group (P = 0.039). No serious adverse effects were recorded.
   Conclusion: Tandospirone combined with an antidepressant may be effective and safe for treating major depressive disorder patients following suicide attempts.

AB Prior research has indicated that pollen might be linked to suicide mortality although the few studies that have been undertaken to date have produced conflicting findings and been limited to Western settings. This study examined the association between the level of airborne pollen and suicide mortality in Tokyo, Japan in the period from 2001 to 2011. The daily number of suicide deaths was obtained from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, with pollen data being obtained from the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Public Health. A time-stratified case-crossover study was performed to examine the association between different levels of pollen concentration and suicide mortality. During the study period there were 5185 male and 2332 female suicides in the pollen season (February to April). For men there was no association between airborne pollen and suicide mortality. For women, compared to when there was no airborne pollen, the same-day (lag 0) pollen level of 30 to < 100 grains per cm(2) was associated with an approximately 50% increase in the odds for suicide (e.g. 30 to < 50 grains per cm(2): odds ratio 1.574, 95% confidence interval 1.076-2.303, p=0.020). The estimates remained fairly stable after adjusting for air pollutants and after varying the cut-points that defined the pollen levels. Our results indicate that pollen is associated with female suicide mortality in Tokyo.

AB There have been several violence-related deaths in Japan due to family violence by persons with severe mental illness against their caregivers. However, it is not often acknowledged that these violent acts are mainly directed at family members. This study aimed to clarify what acts of violence family caregivers experienced from their relative with schizophrenia, and how frequently these violent incidents occurred in their lifetime. We also examined caregivers' thoughts of death about themselves and their relatives, as well as their consultation efforts and escape from the violence perpetrated by their relative. Of the 277 caregivers, 87.7% had experienced psychological violence and 75.8% had experienced physical violence perpetrated by their relative. Of 210 caregivers who had experienced physical violence, 26.7% had thought of murder-suicide and 31.0% had wished for their relative's death. Family violence by persons with schizophrenia is not rare but a common occurrence in Japan and may have fatal consequences.

AB PURPOSE: To clarify whether cigarette smoking was associated with completed suicide in a cohort of middle-aged Japanese men.
   METHODS: A total of 45,209 out of 57,714 men, aged 40 to 69 years, in nine public health centers across Japan responded to a self-administered questionnaire that included questions regarding their smoking history. The questionnaire was distributed in 1990 (Cohort I) and in 1993 and 1994 (Cohort II). By the end of 2000, 173 suicides were identified by death certificates.
   RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, current smokers had a marginally higher risk of suicide than never smokers. Current smokers with more than 60 pack-years of cigarette smoking had a more than two-fold higher risk of suicide than never smokers (pooled multivariate relative risk = 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1, 4.0), but a significant dose-response relationship between pack-years of smoking and suicide was not found. The risk of suicide increased significantly with increasing numbers of cigarettes smoked per day (p for trend = 0.036). Smoking status, duration of quitting, duration of smoking, and age at the start of smoking were not significantly associated with suicide risk.
   CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that heavy smoking, particularly a large number of cigarettes per day at baseline was associated with an increased risk of suicide independent of several potential confounders. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Infodemiology studies for suicide prevention have become increasingly common in recent years. However, the association between Twitter use and suicide has only been partially clarified. This study examined the association between suicide-related tweets and suicidal behaviour to identify suicidal young people on the Internet.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using Internet survey panels (n=220,848) comprising users in their 205, through a major Japanese Internet survey company. Final analyses included the data of 1000 participants.
   Results: Of the participants (n=1000) used in the final analysis, 61.3% were women and the mean age was 24.9 years (SD=2.9, range=20-29). Logistic regression analyses showed that tweeting "want to die" and "want to commit suicide" was significantly related to suicidal ideation and behaviour. Lifetime suicide attempts, the most powerful predictor of future suicide out of all suicidal behaviours, were more strongly associated with tweeting "want to commit suicide" than tweeting "want to die". Having a Twitter account and tweeting daily were not associated with suicidal behaviour.
   Limitations: An online panel survey has some inherent biases, such as coverage bias. Respondents were already registered as members of a particular Internet survey company in Japan, which limits the possibility of generalization.
   Conclusions: Twitter logs may be used to identify suicidal young Internet users. This study provides a basis for the early identification of individuals at high risk for suicide. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The annual number of suicides in Japan increased sharply in 1998, and since that time it has consistently exceeded 30,000 per year. In this study, we analyze a database of personal and background characteristics of 824 cases (605 men, 219 women) who completed suicide in Okayama Prefecture in 2002 and 2003. The data were obtained with cooperation from the police. Using the methodologies in a previous European study as a model, we classified the suicide methods into 8 categories. To examine the generational and regional differences in the choice of methods, we stratified the sample into 4 age groups (<= 24, 25 similar to 44, 45 similar to 64, and >= 65) and 2 regional groups (Okayama/Kurashiki vs. other areas). Our results on gender differences in 7 of the suicide methods were mostly similar to the European data. However, our data showed a remarkably higher proportionate male-to-female mortality ratio for poisoning by other substances (ICD-10, X65-X69 codes) (1.83, 1.15-2.92). In terms of generational differences in the choice of suicide methods, the Mantel-Haenszel test of homogeneity was significant for most of the categories in our study, suggesting an impact of age on how people commit suicide. There were no remarkable regional differences in our sample. An epidemic curve for suicides via carbon monoxide poisoning using charcoal briquets revealed a trend of time clustering not observed in the other 6 means. The database constructed and used in this study contains richer information than conventional death statistics and is expected to provide helpful knowledge and insights for future epidemiological studies.

AB This study investigated the prevalence of suicidal behavior and psychological distress in university students across 12 nations. A total of 5,572 university students from 12 countries were surveyed about suicide ideation, suicide attempts, and psychological distress by means of a self-administered questionnaire. Almost 29% of the samples reported having contemplated suicide and 7% reported attempting suicide. Of the total sample, 51.1% scored above the General Health Questionnaire-123 cut-off points, 41.6% above the GHQ-124 cut-off points, and 33.8% scored above the GHQ-125 cut-off points. While odds of suicide ideation were elevated in Austria and the UK, reduced ORs were detected for China, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Turkey. Similarly, while odds of suicide attempt were high in Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, and to some extent in Turkey, reduced ORs were observed for Austria, China, Italy, Japan and the United States. Elevated ORs for psychological distress were seen in Japan, Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Turkey but reduced ORs were noted in Austria, China, Iran, Italy, and the United States. Psychological distress was strongly associated with reports of suicide ideation and attempts. Suicide ideation, suicide attempt, and psychological distress are common in university students but their rates vary depending on the sociocultural context. Due attention should be devoted to the mental health needs of young adults enrolled in higher educational institutions and more cross-cultural research is warranted to better understand the etiology of the observed intersocietal variations in suicidal behavior and psychological distress.

AB In many Western countries, the criminalization and stigmatization of suicide has given way to a biomedical approach aimed at destigmatizing suicide and treating underlying mental illness. By contrast, in many East Asian countries, suicide has never historically been criminalized or stigmatized. High rates of suicide in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have recently led policy makers in those countries to pursue innovative suicide-prevention strategies. The intentional denormalization of harmful behaviors has been discussed in the public health and ethics literatures, particularly with regard to smoking cessation, and could represent a novel mechanism for preventing suicides in East Asia. Using examples from the sociocultural, historical, and legal discourses surrounding suicide in Western and East Asian contexts, we suggest that denormalization can be a justified, culturally relevant suicide-prevention strategy, but that care must be taken to avoid shaming or stigmatizing suicidal individuals. Specifically, we propose the term weak denormalization to refer to an ethically permissible strategy at the mildest end of a spectrum of denormalizing approaches-milder than the reintegrative shaming described in the criminal justice literature, and diametrically opposed to outright stigmatization, which is generally considered ethically impermissible. Given the severe stigma of mental illness in East Asia, adopting the dominant Western view of suicide as solely a psychiatric concern would not be justified. Weak denormalization strategies in East Asia should be culturally tailored and rigorously tested on a small scale. They should include social supports, praise for the bravery of those of who seek help, and strategies to reduce shame regarding perceived social failure.

AB Introduction Suicide attempt is the most important risk factor for later suicide. A randomised-controlled, multicentre trial of postsuicide attempt case management for the prevention of further suicide attempts in Japan, named ACTION-J, has established effective interventions for prevention of suicide reattempts. The ACTION-J assertive case management intervention programme was adopted by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in 2016, when medical fees were revised. This nationwide programme is provided to patients who attempt suicide and who are admitted to emergency departments in Japan. The aim of the present study is to examine the current implementation status of the ACTION-J programme. The present study also aims to clarify which patients' and hospitals' factors affect the implementation of the programme.
   Methods and analysis This is a prospective, multicentre, patient registry cohort study. Participants will be suicide attempters admitted to the emergency departments of medical facilities with both psychiatry and emergency departments. The assertive case management programme will be delivered to participants by a case manager for up to 24 weeks, based on psychiatric diagnoses, social risks and patient needs. The core feature of the programme is to encourage patients to participate in psychiatric treatment. The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients still participating in the case management intervention at 24 weeks after registration. The secondary outcomes will include measures of the fidelity of the case management intervention. The fidelity will be evaluated using a fidelity assessment manual developed by the study group.
   Ethics and dissemination This observational study has been approved by the ethics board of Sapporo Medical University. Enrolment began in October 2016 and will continue until December 2018. Dissemination plans include presentations at scientific conferences and scientific publications.
   Trial registration UMIN000024474.

AB Japan has one of the highest suicide rates in the world. Suicides numbered 32 863 in 1998 and have exceeded 30 000 in every subsequent year. Education of those involved in general and psychosocial patient care can contribute greatly to suicide prevention. The authors administered a brief knowledge and attitude assessment questionnaire concerning suicide to students in their first, third, and fifth years at a Japanese medical school. Participants numbered 160 (94 men with a mean age of 21.8 years, SD = 3.01, and 66 women with a mean age of 21.2 years, SD = 2.64); 59 first year, 52 third year, and 49 in their fifth year. The questionnaire consists of eight multiple-choice questions asking knowledge of suicide and one open-ended question asking attitude. In the knowledge part, only about half of the items were answered correctly (mean score was 4.21, SD = 1.28). A significant difference was observed in prevalence of attitudes as categorical variables between student years (P = 0.001). Sympathetic comments increased along with student years, while critical comments decreased. Given the frequent and interventional opportunities of primary-care medical contacts, poor understanding of suicide from the medical viewpoint was of concern. Moreover, judgmental attitudes were common, especially in earlier school years. Better informed, more understanding physicians and other health professionals could contribute greatly to prevention.

TI Relative Age in School and Suicide among Young Individuals in Japan: A
   Regression Discontinuity Approach
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID RISK-FACTORS; PERFORMANCE; ADOLESCENTS; DEPRESSION
AB Objective
   Evidence collected in many parts of the world suggests that, compared to older students, students who are relatively younger at school entry tend to have worse academic performance and lower levels of income. This study examined how relative age in a grade affects suicide rates of adolescents and young adults between 15 and 25 years of age using data from Japan.
   Method
   We examined individual death records in the Vital Statistics of Japan from 1989 to 2010. In contrast to other countries, late entry to primary school is not allowed in Japan. We took advantage of the school entry cutoff date to implement a regression discontinuity (RD) design, assuming that the timing of births around the school entry cutoff date was randomly determined and therefore that individuals who were born just before and after the cutoff date have similar baseline characteristics.
   Results
   We found that those who were born right before the school cutoff day and thus youngest in their cohort have higher mortality rates by suicide, compared to their peers who were born right after the cutoff date and thus older. We also found that those with relative age disadvantage tend to follow a different career path than those with relative age advantage, which may explain their higher suicide mortality rates.
   Conclusion
   Relative age effects have broader consequences than was previously supposed. This study suggests that policy intervention that alleviates the relative age effect can be important.

AB Following the September 11th 2001 atrocity, Western Government policies focused more on 'defense,' which undermines Government's commitment to reducing suicide. Annual US and major Western countries suicides were compared with '9/11' deaths to highlight the extent of mortality associated with mental disorder, homicide and road deaths are reviewed for contrast. The 3,074 fatalities of 9/11 are set against the US three year annual average 29,691 suicides, 17,077 homicides and 47,775 road deaths, thus every two weeks more US citizens died violently than on 9/11. In the majority of countries, there were more suicides than 9/11 victims, with suicides exceeding the 9/11 atrocity 18 times in Russia, nine in Japan and the US and three times in France and Germany. Annual suicides compared with terrorist violence should inform policy.

AB In response to the rise in suicide in Japan since 1998, some suicide prevention measures in local communities have been put into action. However, in the previous suicide prevention measures, sociopsychological factors were not fully taken into consideration. In the present study, the authors surveyed sociopsychological factors relating to suicide and depression (i.e. people's coping behavior and thoughts about depression and suicidal ideation, and their attitudes toward suicide and psychiatric treatment), and their differences in gender and generations. ne present study was conducted in a rural area of Japan (Town A), where the suicide rate is much higher than the national average. The authors randomly selected 10% of the residents (i.e. 532 people) aged between 40 and 79 years on the basis of resident registration. Health promotion volunteers in Town A visited these 532 people individually, distributed questionnaires, and asked them to anonymously answer the questionnaire within 4 weeks. Data from 450 residents (193 men, 257 women) were analyzed in the present study. Although there were few gender differences, some significant differences were found between the younger (40-59 years) and older (60-79 years) residents. Generally, the younger were more pessimistic about their mental health than the elderly. It was also noteworthy that about 10% of the people thought that it was natural for them to have suicidal ideation, and about 18% reported that they had experienced suicidal ideation. Some suggestions were given to provide more effective suicide prevention measures.

AB The risk of suicide is well known to be increased among heavy alcohol drinkers. However, whether the risk is increased or decreased among light drinkers is still under debate. We investigated this association in a population-based sample of men in Japan. The Ohsaki Study was a population-based, prospective cohort study among Japanese adults aged from 40 to 79 years. Between October and December, 1994, 22,804 men in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, completed a questionnaire on various health-related lifestyles, including alcohol drinking. During the subsequent 7 years follow-up, 73 participants committed suicide. We used the Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for suicide mortality according to the quantity of alcohol consumed daily, with adjustment for potential confounders. There was a statistically significant positive and linear association between the amount of alcohol consumed and the risk of suicide: the multivariate HRs in reference to nondrinkers (95% confidence interval) were 1.2 (0.5-2.7), 1.5 (0.7-3.4), and 2.4 (1.2-4.6) in current drinkers who consumed <= 22.7 g, 22.8 g-45.5 g, and >= 45.6 g of alcohol per day, respectively (P-trend = .016). Even after the early death cases were excluded, a significant linear association was observed between alcohol consumption and the risk of suicide, with the risk of suicide also being nonsignificantly higher among the light drinkers than among nondrinkers (multivariate HR = 1.7). This prospective cohort study indicated a positive linear association between alcohol consumption and the risk of suicide, and the suicide risk among the light drinkers was not decreased as compared with that in nondrinkers.

AB In the light of the more than 1.5 million annual suicide deaths worldwide projected for 2020, suicide prevention is clearly a high priority. Moreover, the goal of suicide prevention is achievable (Wasserman, 2004). This chapter describes theoretical aspects such as the familiar primary, secondary, and tertiary model of suicide prevention, and compares it with the US Institute of Medicine model which adopts universal, selective, and indicated approaches. Suicide preventive efforts of inter-governmental bodies, such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and European Union (EU), and area-specific programmes in Sweden, Uganda, Hong Kong, and Japan are also discussed as examples. Systematic inter-governmental collaboration, between policy planners, relevant decision-makers, clinicians, professional organizations, as well as researchers is a prerequisite in the successful prevention of suicides.

TI Suicide of older people in Asian societies: an international comparison
SO AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL ON AGEING
LA English
DT Article
DE Asian; Chinese; older; international; suicide; prevention; ageism
AB Objective: To verify in a systematic study if the Chinese tradition of venerating older people results in lower suicide rates compared to other countries.
   Method: The ratio between suicide rates in the older population and total population were calculated and used to compare 40 countries.
   Results: The highest male suicide ratios in the world were found in Urban China, Singapore, Rural China and Hong Kong. Singapore, Urban China and Hong Kong had the worst female suicide ratios. The highest rate of suicide among females was in Rural China, which also had the highest suicide rate among older people.
   Conclusion: These findings raise questions about the adequacy of support to older Asian people. It is surprising that high suicide rates are found in Hong Kong, Korea, Japan and Singapore, which are affluent societies. The possibility of this being the result of ageism is discussed. Country-specific research is needed to improve suicide prevention measures, especially for older people.

AB There are gaps in our knowledge of the role attitudes toward suicide play in determining people's willingness to participate (WTP) for suicide prevention. We conducted a large nationwide cross-sectional study with the aim of clarifying the relationship between WTP for reducing suicide risk and attitudes toward suicide. Ordinal logistic regression analyses (n=1771) showed that there were significant associations of WTP for suicide prevention with Suicide as a right' (=-.15, 95% CI: -.25 to -.04, p=.006), Preventability/readiness to help' (=.81, 95% CI: .69-.94, p<.001) and Common occurrence' (=.32, 95% CI: .19-.46, p<.001). Incomprehensibility/unpredictability' did not show an association with WTP. Taxpayer acceptance for suicide prevention is more likely to be achieved through provision of information that increases endorsement of preventability/readiness to help' and common occurrence' factors, and decreases suicide as a right' scores.

AB Background: Some evidence suggests an association may exist between the level of air pollution and suicide mortality. However, this relation has been little studied to date. The current study examined the association in Tokyo, Japan.
   Methods: Suicide mortality data for Tokyo for the 11-year period 2001-2011 were obtained together with data on four air pollutants: fine particulate matter (PM2.5), suspended particulate matter (SPM), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). A time-stratified case-crossover study design was used to examine the daily association between the level of air pollution and suicide mortality.
   Results: During the study period there were 29,939 suicide deaths. In stratified analyses an interquartile range (IQR) increase in the same-day concentration of NO2 was linked to increased suicide mortality among those aged under 30 (percentage change: 6.73%, 95% Cl: 0.69-13.12%). An IQR increase in PM25 and SO2 was associated with a 10.55% (95% Cl: 2.05-19.75%) and 11.47% (95% Cl: 3.60-19.93%) increase, respectively, in suicide mortality among widowed individuals for mean exposure on the first four days (average lags 0-3). Positive associations were observed for the air pollutants in the summer although associations were reversed in autumn.
   Limitations: We relied on monitoring data to approximate individual exposure to air pollutants.
   Conclusions: Higher levels of air pollution are associated with increased suicide mortality in some population subgroups in Tokyo. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms linking air pollutants and suicide in this setting. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In both sexes, the frequencies of cases attributed to long working hours and other events differed significantly by industry. Among cases involving compensation for suicide, 71.4% were attributed to long working hours.Conclusions:The frequency distribution of work-related adverse events differed significantly by sex and industry. These differences should be taken into consideration in the development of industry-specific preventive measures for occupational mental disorders.

AB This study examined the relationship between suicide rates among men since 1975 and rates of unemployment and labour force participation in 20 countries. Previous research has found statistically significant correlations between suicide and unemployment rates over time among young people in a number of countries. This study has extended this research to include different age groups of men. The findings for younger workers largely confirm the findings of previous studies. Among older workers, however, unemployment and suicide rates are largely unrelated, notable exceptions including Japan and the USA. The implications of this finding for policy making towards older workers are discussed.

AB Several reports have indicated that grief and mental health outcomes of people bereaved by suicide vary by their relationship to the deceased. Parents who have lost offspring experience higher levels of distress than those with other relationships to the deceased. However, there are limited studies investigating the experience of parental bereavement by suicide, and further research is needed. The present study aimed to clarify the differences in grief reactions between bereaved parents and those with other relationships to the deceased in Japan and explore a statistical model of adaptation to the loss. In total, 105 bereaved participants completed a questionnaire covering grief reaction, meaning reconstruction, mental health, social context, and demographic variables. Parents scored higher on several grief reaction items and lower in sense-making than those with other relationships. In addition, path analysis showed that sense-making acted as a moderator in the experience of loss of offspring and grief reaction.

AB Because suicide is irreversible, prevention is paramount. For the optimal strategy to reduce lethal means, we sought to investigate age- and sex-associated variations in suicide methods. Data on annual causes of death from 1991 to 2015 in the Republic of Korea were used. Major sociodemographic correlates of the five suicide methods were analyzed by multiple multinominal logistic regression analysis. Among a total of 239,565 suicides from 1991 to 2015, hanging was most common. Gas poisoning sharply increased from 2007 to 2015. The gap between hanging and the second most common method of suicide has increased from 659 in 2004 to 4,433 in 2015. Charcoal burning was most commonly used by males younger than 45 years of age, whereas pesticide was commonly used by both sexes ages 55 years and older. Our results suggest that age- and sex-specific suicide prevention strategies are needed, particularly for gas and pesticide poisoning.

AB Although lithium is known to prevent suicide in people with mood disorders, It IS uncertain whether lithium in drinking water could also help lower the risk in the general population. To investigate this, we examined lithium levels in tap water in the 18 municipalities of Oita prefecture in Japan in relation to the Suicide standardised mortality ratio (SMR) in each municipality. We found that lithium levels were significantly and negatively associated with SMR averages for 2002-2006. These findings suggest that even very low levels of lithium in drinking water may play a role in reducing suicide risk within the general population.

AB Certain attitudes toward suicide may be a risk factor for suicide among the bereaved. To explore this possibility, we examined the relationship between attitudes toward suicide and family history of suicide. We focused on two specific attitudes indicating resignation in a survey: #1 "When a person chooses to die by suicide, the suicide is inevitable" (i.e., inevitability belief); and #2 "A suicide cannot be stopped by any person, because suicide is unpreventable" (i.e., unpreventable belief). The data of 5117 fully completed questionnaires were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the two attitudes of resignation were significantly associated with a family history of suicide. The adjusted odds ratio for #1 was 1.39 (95% CI, 1.07-1.79) for individuals having experienced suicide by a family member or relative, while that for #2 was 1.57 (95% CI, 1.27-1.95) for experiencing a suicide by a family member or relative and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.05-1.49) for experiencing a suicide by a friend, business associate, partner or other. These two attitudes of resignation toward suicide were significantly associated with a family history of suicide. These attitudes might increase suicide risk among the bereaved.

AB This study examined whether people have a higher risk of death on and around their birthday using a large national mortality data. We examined 2,073,656 death records of individuals who died in Japan from major external causes between 1974 and 2014. Poisson regression analysis showed that people were more likely to die on their birthday than on any other calendar day by means of suicide, traffic accidents, accidental falls, drowning, and choking. For suicide cases in particular, people are 50% more likely to die on their birthday compared to any other dates. Excess deaths on birthdays were observed regardless of gender, marital status, and age-at-death subgroups. For suicide deaths, our results provided strong support for the "birthday blues" hypothesis that predicts excess deaths on birthdays. With regards to traffic accidents and other unintentional accidents, however, our results suggest that excess deaths on birthdays may be related to birthday celebrations. For the elderly population, our analysis indicates that special activities associated with birthday celebrations, which often involves going out to consume festive food and drinks, may be contributors to a sudden increase in the number of accidental deaths on their birthday. In contrast, a notably sharp increase in the number of motor vehicle accidents was observed for individuals in the 20s on their birthday, which may be attributable to birthday celebrations that involved both driving and drinking.

AB Modern suicidologists have noted a dearth of qualitative research on suicide. The first author conducted 20 in-depth interviews with formerly suicidal adults to understand how they accounted for their experiences contemplating or attempting suicide. According to participants, stigma necessitated impression management, which contributed to the production of silence and misunderstanding. Silence and misunderstanding reinforced stigma. This complex, dialectical, belief system about stigma yields insight into the interpretive culture of surviving suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt. These beliefs about suicide may serve as a barrier to individuals seeking help, recovering from suicidality, and larger social change regarding attitudes toward suicide.

TI Higher Risk of Suicide on Milestone Birthdays: Evidence from Japan
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID BLUES; DEATH; ASSOCIATION; AGE
AB Recent studies suggest that the risk of suicide is higher during and around birthdays. The so-called "birthday blues" might be stronger on birthdays at milestone ages (e.g., 20, 30, 40), as these symbolic ages might represent occasions for existential stock-taking that may highlight failures and underachievement in life. Moreover, in some countries (including Japan), certain symbolic birthdays come with the expectation of celebration with family and friends, and thus such special birthdays may elevate the birthday blues if there is nobody to celebrate the occasion with. This study examines the possibility that there are more suicides on milestone birthdays than on other birthdays or days other than birthdays, using approximately one million individual death records between 1974 and 2014 in Japan. Graphical analysis and Poisson regression analysis showed that suicides occurred more frequently on milestone birthdays when people turn 20, 30, 40, and 60. This pattern was predominately observed in men. Our findings suggest that it is crucial for health professionals and family members to pay close attention to vulnerable individuals as their birthdays approach. In particular, individuals are at a higher risk when birthdays coincide with occasions of social significance, including the ages of adulthood (age 20) and retirement (age 60).

AB It is well known that certain types of media reports about suicide can result in imitative suicides. In the last two decades, Japan has experienced two suicide epidemics and the subsequent excessive media coverage of these events. However, the quality of the media suicide reports has yet to be evaluated in terms of the guidelines for media suicide coverage. Thus, the present study analyzed Japanese newspaper articles (n = 4007) on suicides by charcoal burning or hydrogen sulfide gas between 11 February 2003 and 13 March 2010. The suicide reports were evaluated in terms of the extent to which they conformed to the suicide reporting guidelines. The mean violation scores were 3.06 (+/- 0.7) for all articles, 3.2 (+/- 0.8) for articles about suicide by charcoal burning, and 2.9 (+/- 0.7) for articles about suicide by hydrogen sulfide (p < 0.001). With the exception of not following several recommendations, newspaper articles about suicide have improved in quality, as defined by the recommendations for media suicide coverage. To prevent imitative suicides based on media suicide reports, individuals in the media should try not to report suicide methods and to make attempts to report the poor condition of suicide survivors.

AB IntroductionThe objective of this study was to compare the sociodemographic and clinical variables of suicide attempters and completers and to identify risk and protective factors for suicide completion.
   MethodsSubjects (n=320) visiting to the emergency room were classified into two groups: suicide attempters (n=222) and suicide completers (n=98). Univariate analyses and logistic regression models were used to explore the differences between suicide attempters and completers and to identify risk factors for suicide completion.
   ResultsThe results showed that compared with suicide attempters, suicide completers were older, male, having alcohol use disorders, having comorbid health problems, having severe suicide ideation, and using severe suicide methods such as hanging and jumping from a height. Using multiple logistic regression model, risk factors predicting suicide completion were comorbid medical illness, and intense suicide ideation. Factor that served as protective factors against suicide completion was female.
   DiscussionThis study demonstrated that suicide completers have more severe clinical profile than suicide attempters. Decreasing intensity of suicide ideation and treating comorbid medical illness of suicide attempters might be important in preventing them from suicide completion. It is important that the implementation of suicide preventive programs focused on alcoholism is useful in decreasing suicide rates further. Moreover, suicide completers used highly lethal methods, our results indicate that our country should make greater efforts to decrease hanging and jumping from a height.

AB Suicide is one of the common severe accidents occurring in hospitals. This study aimed to investigate inpatient suicides simultaneously in medical and psychiatric settings in a large number of hospitals and to examine the prevalence of common suicide risk factors, related symptoms in inpatients who had died by suicide and the differences in inpatient suicides between both settings. We conducted a survey of hospitals in Japan that belonged to the nationwide standard-setting and accrediting body. The questionnaire covered the: 1) presence or absence of inpatient suicides in each hospital from 2012 to 2015; 2) number of inpatient suicides; 3) method, location, and timing of inpatient suicides; and 4) characteristics of inpatients who died by suicide. In total, 529 hospitals reported 262 inpatient suicides during the 3-year period: 131 were in medical settings and 131 were in psychiatric settings. The prevalence of common suicide risk factors was frequent in inpatient suicides. Inpatients had characteristics and suicide risk factors specific to those settings such as worsening of physical health in medical settings. Therefore, recognizing common suicide risk factors and understanding differences in inpatient suicides between both settings are important to prevent inpatient suicides.

AB Some people in Japan are still comfortable with the paternalistic role of doctors, but others wish that their own decisions would receive a greater amount of respect. A total of 747 students of universities and colleges and 114 parents of these students participated in a questionnaire survey. Most of the participants thought that autonomy should be respected in situations involving death with dignity and euthanasia, whereas it should not be respected in attempted suicide and involuntary admission of individuals with mental illness. A cluster analysis revealed that the participants could be divided into the following groups: aid in dying advocates (n = 577), complete libertarians (n = 109), protectors of the mentally ill (n = 90), complete paternalists (n = 29), and questionables (n = 27). The assertion of independence score of the Scale for Independent and Interdependent Construal of the Self showed a significant difference among the 5 clusters. These findings suggest that the traditional paternalistic relationship between doctor and patient is undergoing a gradual transformation in Japan.

AB Background: The aim of the present study is to show the causative factors of suicide among the elderly (over 65) in Mie Prefecture, Japan, and to discuss the prevention of the suicidal influences in elderly patients.
   Methods: We investigated all inquest records during the 14-year period 1989-2002 in cooperation with the First Department of Criminal Investigation of Mie Prefectural Police Headquarters. From all cases classified as suicides, we extracted data on age, sex and background, and we focused on suicide in the elderly group.
   Results: During the test period, there were 5048 suicides (3276 male and 1772 female suicides) of which 1513 (691 male and 822 female) were in the elderly group. The rate of suicide in the elderly group was approximately 30% of the total in all age groups. The rate of female suicides in the elderly group was approximately 46.3%. The major causative factors of suicide among the elderly were 'suffering from physical illness', and 'psychiatric disorders'. 'Physical diseases' were not negligible backgrounds in middle and elderly groups. Among physical diseases, the number of malignant neoplasm was clearly less than the other diseases. Notably, 'cardiovascular disease' and 'orthopedic disorders' were most frequent causative factors of suicide other than malignant neoplasm.
   Conclusion: It is consequently concluded that improvements in the system of home nursing and health care should be involved in the suicidal prevention of the elderly who 'suffer from physical illness'. The patients who 'suffer from physical illness' should be given physical and mental support. In order to prevent suicide, not only psychiatrists but also general practitioners as well as medical staff and general public should be provided with education regarding depression among 'psychiatric disorders'.

DT Article
ID BEHAVIOR
AB Hotline callers do not always have suicidal ideation and previous studies have noted that the rate of such callers is limited. Crisis hotline counselors must be able to identify high-risk callers in order to provide appropriate support. This study investigated the characteristics of Japanese crisis hotline callers in 2012 (N=541,694) and is the first to analyze crisis hotline data for all parts of Japan over 1year. About 14% of the callers had suicidal ideation and 6% had a history of attempted suicide. The odds ratio for suicidal ideation among those with a history of attempted suicide was 15.5. The suicidal ideation rate was much smaller compared to previous studies in other countries. There is a psychological barrier that must be broken for high-risk people to use support hotlines. In addition, attempted suicide is a strong exclusive predisposing factor for death due to suicide; therefore, counselors should pay careful attention to callers with a history of attempted suicide. The characteristics of Japanese crisis hotline callers and the features of suicidal ideation revealed in the present study are expected to be useful in developing telephone crisis hotline strategies.

AB AimThe aim of our study was to understand the geographic characteristics of Japanese communities and the impact of these characteristics on suicide rates.
   MethodsWe calculated the standardized mortality ratio from suicide statistics of 3318 municipalities from 1972 to 2002. Correlation analysis, multi-regression analysis and generalized additive model were used to find the relation between topographic and climatic variables and suicide rate. We visualized the relation between geographic characteristics and suicide rate on the map of Wakayama Prefecture, using the Geographic Information System.
   ResultsOur study showed that the geographic characteristics of each community are related with its suicide rate. The strongest factor among the geographic characteristics to increase the suicide rate was the slope of the habitable land.
   ConclusionsIt is necessary to take the characteristics of each community into consideration when we work out measures of suicide prevention. Visualization of the findings on the local map should be helpful to promote understanding of problems and to share the information among various parties in charge of suicide prevention.

AB We aimed to describe the professional characteristics of suicide attempters. One investigator asked 87 consecutive patients, aged 18 to 25 years, who had been hospitalized in a university hospital in Angers after having attempted suicide anytime during a 6.5-month period (November 2008-April 2009) to complete a questionnaire about their working conditions. The working conditions of both sexes were approximatively the same. Many patients described situations where work organization was known to produce given mental disorders. Patients hospitalized for suicide attempts are in professions that leaves them more stressed than the general population of workers (Sumer, Samotrace etc.). This evidence could favour a link between attempted suicide and mental factors of strain at work. The results of this study should be interpreted with caution because of the phenomena of circuitous data and small sample size.

AB Akita Prefecture, Japan, has consistently recorded the highest level of suicide rates in all of Japan. In this study, we attempted to determine whether genetic differences between suicide victims and the normal population in Akita exist. We also researched the geographical differences in polymorphisms of the genes between people living in Akita Prefecture and those living in other prefectures with lower suicide rates as recorded in previously-published studies. Specifically, we investigated two serotonin-related genes including three substitutions connected to human emotional states such as despondency and depression: the tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) gene (A779C and A218C in the intron) and the serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor gene (Pro16Leu in the cording region). 134 suicide victims and 325 healthy volunteers were examined. For this process, we used two analytical procedures: (1) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by single-strand conformational polymorphisms analysis for the A779C of TPH and the 5-HT1A receptor genes and (2) PCR followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis for the A218C of TPH gene. No significant differences of the genotypes and the allele frequencies between the suicide samples and those of the healthy controls were discerned. Moreover, the genotype distributions of the TPH and 5-HT1A receptor genes were compared between Akita Prefecture and other prefectures, but no significant differences were found. In conclusion, no significant relation could be established statistically concerning the serotonin related genes between the suicide samples and control samples in Akita.

AB Objective This study attempts to provide fundamental information to help with the development of health policy and health services by looking at the trends of the gender-specific mortality rates in Korea and Japan.
   Design The death statistics of Korea and Japan over the 21-year period from 1983 to 2003 are analyzed.
   Setting We used the death statistics and estimated population figures published by the Korean National Statistical Office, and the vital statistics published by Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan.
   Method Mortality data are standardized x 100,000 to 2001/ 2003. Specific mortality rates from 12 selected causes are considered: tuberculosis, malignant neoplasms, diabetes mellitus, hypertensive diseases, heart diseases, cerebrovascular disease, pneumonia, diseases of the liver, renal failure, transport accidents, falls and suicide.
   Results In Korea, the mortality rates from malignant neoplasms, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, falls and suicide have increased. The proportion of the mortality rates from chronic diseases is higher than from acute diseases. In Japan, the mortality rate from pneumonia increased more than that from diabetes mellitus. The gap in mortality rates between males and females in Korea is greater, especially in terms of malignant neoplasms, diseases of the liver, transport accidents and suicide.
   Conclusion The mortality rates from these diseases are higher in males than in females. For the recent health promotion policies in Korea such as Health Plan 2010, a more intensive and objective management drawing on the findings of this study concerning gender-specific mortality rates should be implemented.

AB Background: Living alone has been suggested as a risk factor for suicide. However, the effect on suicide risk of living together with spouse, child(ren) and parent(s) is unclear. This study aims to examine the association between living arrangements with spouse, child(ren), and parent(s) and suicide in a Japanese men and women.
   Methods: Altogether 104, 528 participants aged 40-69 years, who completed baseline questionnaire (1990-1994), were followed for death through December 2005. We used Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% Cl) for suicide according to living arrangements.
   Results: During an average 13.2-year follow up, 406 suicidal deaths were recorded. Men living without a spouse and women living with a parent(s) only were at increased risk of suicide than those living with a spouse only. The multivariate HR (95% CI) in men were as follows: "living with a parent(s) only", 1.86 (1.03-3.36); "living with a child(ren) only", 2.20 (1.32-3.66); "living with a parent(s) and child(ren)", 1.95 (1.02-3.72); and "living alone", 1.80 (0.99-3.25); and in women was as follow "living with a parent(s) only", 3.80 (1.90-7.61). Suicide risk was significantly decreased among women living with a spouse and child(ren) as compared with women living with a spouse only (HR 0.58, 95%CI 0.34 to 0.98).
   Conclusions: Men living without a spouse and women living with a parent(s) only were at increased risk of suicide. Women living together with a spouse and child(ren) were at decreased risk of suicide. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Installing physical barriers, such as platform screen doors (PSDs), on train platforms is considered to be one of the most effective measures to prevent railway suicide. However, there is little evidence on the effectiveness of such barriers. In particular, the effectiveness of half-height, as opposed to full-height, PSDs has never been assessed.
   Methods: Using suicide and accident data between 2004 and 2014 provided by a major railway company in the Tokyo metropolitan area, this study examines whether the installation of half-height PSDs has contributed to the reduction of the incidents of fatal and non-fatal railway suicide. In addition, the study tests whether the installation of PSDs has resulted in the reduction of unintentional falls onto railway tracks.
   Results: Our estimation using a Poisson regression model showed that the introduction of PSDs resulted in a decrease in the number of suicides by 76% (CI: 33-93%). Yet, the installation of PSDs has not completely prevented suicide, as there were cases in which passengers climbed them over As for unintentional accidents, no fall accidents occurred at stations with PSDs. Limitations: Our data come only from one train operator, and thus the generalizability of our results may be limited. We do not fully examine potential substitution effects.
   Conclusion: Platform screen doors are effective in reducing the number of railway suicides. However, half height PSDs are less effective than the full height PSDs in preventing intentional entry to the train tracks. Installation of PSDs is an extremely effective method to prevent fall accidents. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,

AB Devastating natural disasters and their aftermath are known to cause psychological distress. However, little information is available regarding suicide rates following tsunami disasters that destroy regional social services and networks. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the tsunami disaster following the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011 has influenced suicide rates. The study period was from March 2009 to February 2014. Tsunami disaster-stricken areas were defined as the 16 municipalities facing the Pacific Ocean in Miyagi Prefecture. Inland areas were defined as other municipalities in Miyagi that were damaged by the earthquake. Suicide rates in the tsunami disaster-stricken areas were compared to national averages, using a time-series analysis and the Poisson distribution test. In tsunami disaster-stricken areas, male suicide rates were significantly lower than the national average during the initial post-disaster period and began to increase after two years. Likewise, male suicide rates in the inland areas decreased for seven months, and then increased to exceed the national average. In contrast, female post-disaster suicide rates did not change in both areas compared to the national average. Importantly, the male suicide rates in the inland areas started to increase earlier compared to the tsunami-stricken areas, which may reflect the relative deficiency of mental healthcare services in the inland areas. Considering the present status that many survivors from the tsunami disaster still live in temporary housing and face various challenges to rebuild their lives, we should continue intensive, long-term mental healthcare services in the tsunami-stricken areas.

AB Background: Previous studies have shown that suicide-related Internet use can have both negative and positive psychological effects. Aims: This study examined the effect of suicide-related Internet use on users' suicidal ideation, depression/anxiety tendency, and loneliness. Method: A two-wave panel study of 850 Internet users was conducted via the Internet. Results: Suicide-related Internet use (e. g., browsing websites about suicide methods) had negative effects on suicidal ideation and depression/anxiety tendency. No forms of suicide-related Internet use, even those that would generally be considered positive, were found to decrease users' suicidal ideation. In addition, our results suggest that the greater the suicidal ideation and feelings of depression and loneliness of Internet users, the more they used the Internet. Conclusion: Since suicide-related Internet use can adversely influence the mental health of young adults, it is necessary to take measures to reduce their exposure to such information.

ID SPATIAL DIFFUSION; MODELS
AB In an effort to explain the spatial patterning of violence, we expanded Sutherland's (1947) concept of differential social organization to include the level of deviance exhibited by neighboring areas. To test the value of this extension, the geographic clustering of Japanese suicide and homicide rates is assessed using 1985 and 1995 data for prefectures. Univariate results show that both types of violence cluster significantly in space. Inconsistent with the proposed expansion of differential social organization, multivariate results show that proximity to homicide does not increase the risk of homicide in Japan. Results for suicide are supportive and suggest that proximity to higher rates of suicide exposes residents to cultural values that support suicide and to role models who have committed suicide.

TI Impact of Macro-Level Socio-Economic Factors on Rising Suicide Rates in
   South Korea: Panel-Data Analysis in East Asia
SO JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH POLICY AND ECONOMICS

AB Background: The rapid increase in suicide rates in South Korea, particularly in the aftermath of the Asian economic crisis in the late 1990s, compares with the declining suicide rates observed in most other OECD countries over the same period.
   Aims of the Study: This study aimed to examine an array of macro-level societal factors that might have contributed to the rising suicide trend in South Korea.
   Methods: We first investigated whether this trend was unique to South Korea, or ubiquitous across five Asian countries/areas that are geographically and culturally similar (South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan), using WHO mortality data and national statistics (1980-2009). Age-standardised suicide rates (per 100,000 population) were calculated for each gender and age group (15-24, 25-44, 45-64, and 65+) for each country. Both panel data and country-specific time-series analyses were employed to investigate the impact of economic change and social integration/regulation on suicide.
   Results: Despite similarities in geography and culture, the rising trend of suicide rates was unique to South Korea. This atypical trend was most apparent for people aged 65 and over, which was in sharp contrast to the decreasing suicide trends observed in the other four Asian countries. The results of the panel data analyses generally pointed to a negative relationship between economic growth and suicide rates, particularly for working-aged people. The results of the time-series analyses further suggested that low levels of social integration, as indicated by rising divorce rates, may also have a role in rising suicide rates in South Korea, particularly for older people. Furthermore, the association between suicide rates and economic adversity (unemployment and economic downturn) was most salient among middle-aged men in South Korea.
   Discussion and Limitations: Compared to four other East Asian countries/areas (Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan), South Korea has uniquely experienced a rising trend of suicide rates over the past three decades, particularly among older people. The findings highlight the differential associations between social changes and suicide rates at various stages over a person's life course. Low levels of social integration and economic adversity may in part explain the atypical suicide trend in South Korea, especially for older people and middle-aged men, respectively. Data constraints, however, limit the scope for explanation in light of the complex and multifactorial causes of suicide.
   Implications for Health and Social Care Policies: Different age groups within the population require different policy interventions to curb the unprecedented rise in suicide rates in South Korea. Particularly for older people, there is a great need to strengthen methods of assisting family support as well as formulating models of social care that are financially-sustainable and culturally sensitive. More investment is also needed to strengthen labour market protection and/or expand social safety net for the unemployed.
   Implications for Further Research: The link between social integration and suicide rates deserves further empirical investigation, so that mediating factors that are amenable to policy actions can be better identified.

TI Morals, suicide, and psychiatry: A view from Japan
SO BIOETHICS
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper, I argue that within the Japanese social context, the act of suicide is a positive moral act because the values underpinning it are directly related to a socially Pervasive moral belief that any act of self-sacrifice is a worthy pursuit. The philosophical basis for this view of the self and its relation to society goes back to the writings of Confucius who advocated a life of propriety in which being dutiful, obedient, and loyal to one's group takes precedence over the desires of the individual selves that make up the group. I argue that this philosophical perspective poses formidable challenges to Japanese psychiatry (which accepts a contrary western perspective) because, as western psychiatry is based on the concept of autonomous individuality, the Japanese conceive of the self as socially embedded. Because suicide in Japan is viewed as a potentially honorable, virtuous, and even beautiful act of self-sacrifice expressing one's duty to one's group, the western perspective is quite foreign to the Japanese self-conceptual framework. Therefore, since Japanese psychiatry and law have embraced the western medical tradition of vie-wing suicide as a non-rational response to mental illness, which runs counter to the cultural view that suicide is a moral (and rational) act, I argue that western explanations of suicide present significant cross-cultural Problems for Japanese psychiatry.

AB To describe the recent filicide features in Japan, data were collected from newspaper databases between 1994 and 2005 and compared with several official statistics. From this dataset, 933 cases and 1084 victims under age 15 were identified. Fatal abuse cases were most prevalent (309 cases, or 33.1%), followed by filicide-suicide cases (303, or 32.5%) and unwanted child cases (225, or 24.1%). Infants under the age of one were most at risk (filicide rate: 2.72 per 100,000 for the same aged infants). Annual filicide numbers showed an upward trend between 1994 and 2001 and the average filicide rate per year was 0.42 per 100,000 for children under age 15. Both the number of cases over the period and the filicide rate per year by prefecture ranged widely. Furthermore, the annual filicide rates over the period were strongly correlated with both suicide rates and unemployment rates for the general population (r = .884 and .926, respectively; p < .001 for both). The measure of filicide per region and the predominating category in a prefecture provides direction for filicide prevention. Result suggests that recent socioeconomic situations have a significant effect on not only filicide-suicide but also the overall filicide rate in Japan.

AB Many patients with mental disorders visit emergency departments (EDs). However, the majority of these patients do not receive psychiatric assessment. In the present study, we investigated the detailed proportion of patients with mental disorders visiting an urban ED in the largest northern city in Japan. A retrospective chart review study was performed at a University Hospital from January 2012 to December 2015. The reasons for psychiatric consultations made by ED staff, and the primary psychiatric diagnoses were investigated. Among all living patients, 20% of them received consultations. The most common reason for consultation was suicide attempt followed by agitation or insomnia. Of all diagnoses, organic mental disorder was the most frequent and the mean age was significantly higher than the other diagnostic groups. Our study indicated that the frequency of psychiatric consultation was high. This indicates the high demand for mental health services at the ED. A thorough psychiatric assessment can provide adequate psychiatric services to acute patients; thereby possibly preventing suicide attempters from later actually dying by suicide.

AB Aim: Suicide prevention is of pressing importance in Japan, and grappling with this problem necessitates clarifying the causes of suicidal ideation. The purpose of the present study was to investigate several factors influencing suicidal ideation. This was done through analyzing factors examined in prior research and accessing suicide sites.
   Methods: A total of 1080 randomly selected adults were asked about stress, stress release, social support sources, depression, access of suicides sites, and suicidal ideation.
   Results: Around 6% of men in their 20s and 30s as well as 7% of people with suicide ideations had accessed suicide sites on the web. Those with suicide ideations were more likely to access suicide sites than those without. There was no sex difference in suicide ideations. The results concerning factors influencing past-year suicide ideations revealed that there were age and sex differences in these factors.
   Conclusion: For men in their 20s through their 50s, accessing suicide sites influenced suicidal ideations through depression, and for women in the same age bracket, emotional support influenced suicidal ideations through depression. For men and women over the age of 60, depression strongly influenced suicidal ideations.

AB Background: Family or friends bereaved by suicide are at risk of experiencing complications because of attitudes regarding suicide. It is important that individuals close to those grieving after a death by suicide demonstrate adequate knowledge and compassionate attitudes. To this end, we examined the factors that contribute to attitudes toward persons bereaved by the suicide of a family member or friend, and perceptions of suicide prevention and the promotion of mental health.
   Methods: A total of 5154 residents of a rural town in northern Japan aged 30-69 years completed a cross-sectional questionnaire. The questionnaire gathered data about demographic variables, depressive symptoms, and issues related to suicide including personal experience of an acquaintance's suicide, attitudes towards those bereaved by suicide, and perceptions regarding suicide prevention. Factors related to these attitudes and perceptions were analysed using logistic regression models.
   Results: Overall, 67.5% of respondents demonstrated appropriate attitudes towards those bereaved by suicide; 30.4% of responses were undetermined, and 2.1% were inappropriate. Undetermined attitudes were associated with male gender ( adjusted OR 1.42, 95% CI = 1.26-1.61), younger age (2.64, 2.12-3.29), lower education level (1.32, 1.07-1.62), greater severity of depression (3.81, 2.80-5.20), and lack of personal experience of an acquaintance's suicide (1.39, 1.22-1.57). Inappropriate attitudes were associated with male gender (adjusted OR 1.98, 95% CI = 1.33-2.94), lower education level (2.55 1.34-4.83), and greater severity of depression (6.93, 3.52-13.67). Overall, 16.0% demonstrated passive thoughts regarding suicide prevention and the promotion of mental health in the community, and were associated with male gender (1.22, 1.04-1.42), younger age (2.72, 2.03-3.65), lower education level (1.32, 1.02-1.71), and greater severity of depression (4.94, 3.58-6.82).
   Conclusion: Factors that contributed to undetermined attitudes included male gender, younger age, lower education level, greater severity of depression, and lack of personal experience of an acquaintance's suicide. Passive thoughts regarding suicide prevention and the promotion of mental health were associated with male gender, younger age, lower education level, and greater severity of depression.

AB Suicide is a significant public health problem worldwide, and several Asian countries including Japan have relatively high suicide rates on a world scale. Twin, family, and adoption studies have suggested high heritability for suicide, but genetics lags behind due to difficulty in obtaining samples from individuals who died by suicide, especially in non-European populations. In this study, we carried out genome-wide association studies combining two independent datasets totaling 746 suicides and 14,049 non-suicide controls in the Japanese population. Although we identified no genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we demonstrated significant SNP-based heritability (35-48%; P < 0.001) for completed suicide by genomic restricted maximum-likelihood analysis and a shared genetic risk between two datasets (P-best = 2.7 x 10(-13)) by polygenic risk score analysis. This study is the first genome-wide association study for suicidal behavior in an East Asian population, and our results provided the evidence of polygenic architecture underlying completed suicide.

AB In the past 20 years bullying has become a serious problem in contemporary Japanese society. Bully-related suicides are on the rise and policymakers have been forced to aggressively pursue the issue. This article suggests that bullying in Japan has been affected by many factors, including the stresses involved in the educational system, Japan's indigenous religion, Shinto, and a national trend of passivity towards power. Japan affords us the opportunity to see bullying as an international concern and to learn from the efforts of the Japanese to combat it.

AB I used the national panel data of Japan to investigate the determinants of suicide. The major findings are twofold. First, the social capital that enhances community integration had a greater effect on the suicide of females than that of males. This is probably because females are less likely to have full-time jobs and thus have more spare time, leading them to seek social involvement in their neighbourhoods and participate in community activities. Second, divorce causes the propensity to commit suicide among males to become about two times higher than that among females because of the compensation costs that males are more likely to pay to females.

AB A community-based intervention study for suicide prevention was conducted in six towns (total population 43,964) in Akita Prefecture of Japan according to a quasi-experimental design to reduce suicide rates in rural towns. Public awareness raising activities using a health promotion approach emphasizing the empowerment of residents and civic participation were conducted. The welfare measures of promoting a sense of purpose among senior citizens and creating a community network were also taken. As a result, the suicide rate per 100,000 in the intervention towns decreased from 70.8 before intervention (1999) to 34.1 after intervention (2004). The suicide rate per 100,000 in the control towns was 47.8 before intervention and 49.1 after intervention.

AB A community survey in 4,426 adults was undertaken as part of the World Mental Health Survey Initiative reporting the prevalence and risk factors for suicide-related outcomes in Colombia. Lifetime prevalence estimates of suicide ideation, plans, attempts, and risk factors for suicide-related outcomes were assessed. Retrospective reports of disorders age-of-onset were used to study associations between primary mental disorders and first onset of suicide-related outcomes. Risks of plans and attempts were highest with ideation early age-of-onset and within the first year. The highest risk for ideation and attempt among ideators occurred in the 18-29 age group. After first employment (defined as the first paid job accepted by the respondent) and presence of mental disorders constituted risk factors. Impulse-control disorders were strongest diagnostic predictors.

AB Background: Despite advances in our understanding of the countercyclical association between economic contraction and suicide, less is known about the levels of and changes in inequalities in suicide. The authors examined social and geographical inequalities in suicide in Japan from 1975 through 2005.
   Methods: Based on quinquennial vital statistics and census data, the authors analyzed the entire population aged 25-64 years. The total number of suicides was 75,840 men and 30,487 women. For each sex, the authors estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% credible intervals (CIs) for suicide using multilevel logistic regression models with "cells'' (cross-tabulated by age and occupation) at level 1, seven different years at level 2, and 47 prefectures at level 3. Prefecture-level variance was used as an estimate of geographical inequalities in suicide.
   Results: Adjusting for age and time-trends, the lowest odds for suicide was observed among production process and related workers (the reference group) in both sexes. The highest OR for men was 2.52 (95% CI: 2.43, 2.61) among service workers, whereas the highest OR for women was 9.24 (95% CI: 7.03, 12.13) among security workers. The degree of occupational inequalities increased among men with a striking change in the pattern. Among women, we observed a steady decline in suicide risk across all occupations, except for administrative and managerial workers and transport and communication workers. After adjusting for individual age, occupation, and time-trends, prefecture-specific ORs ranged from 0.76 (Nara Prefecture) to 1.36 (Akita Prefecture) for men and from 0.79 (Kanagawa Prefecture) to 1.22 (Akita Prefecture) for women. Geographical inequalities have increased primarily among men since 1995.
   Conclusions: The present findings demonstrate a striking temporal change in the pattern of social inequalities in suicide among men. Further, geographical inequalities in suicide have considerably increased across 47 prefectures, primarily among men, since 1995.

DE note-leaving; suicide note; suicide rate
AB Suicide notes (SN) are potentially valuable sources of information about the psychological states of the suicidal person. It was hypothesized that there was a significant relation between suicide rate and note-leaving rate and that the incidence of note-leaving was increased during prolonged economic recession. During 21 years (1981-2001) in Kobe, of a total of 18 558 violent deaths, 5161 were due to suicide (27.8%), with 3417 male cases (66.2%) and 1754 female cases (33.8%). For each year the annual suicide rates and note-leaving rates were calculated, and this represents the percentage of committed suicides in which SN were left, among all suicide victims. In spite of the prolonged economic slump, the note-leaving rate remained almost constant (23.4-36.2%). Pearson's correlation coefficient showed no significant correlation between suicide rate and note-leaving rates (r = 0.27, P = 0.23). The finding that the incidence of note-leaving remains constant despite increasing suicide rates may suggest that the reasons for suicide do not affect note-leaving. There are cross-cultural, ethnic, and racial variations in suicidal behaviors. Although this finding may be specific in Japan, further studies of SN are needed to help clarify the suicidal states of mind.

In order to promote early intervention and prevention in a community, it is important to know where residents seek help if they become depressed or have suicidal ideation. Therefore, in the present study, help-seeking behavior using case vignettes was investigated. Data from 230 residents (82 men, 148 women) in the model area of Town A, aged 65 or over, were analyzed in the present study. If participants were unable to answer by themselves due to physical condition, public health nurses read out each item and wrote in their answers. The relationship between help-seeking behavior and demographic variables, psychosocial variables, depressive symptoms and so forth, were examined. The results show that participation in mental health workshops facilitated consultation with specialists (e.g. primary care doctors and nurses). The expected effects of psychoeducation on the general public and specialists were considered.

AB The current article examines the potential role of topography in suicide. First, I analyzed suicide data from 3,318 municipalities in Japan during the 30-year period of 1973-2002. I found that suicide rate was higher in municipalities with steeper slopes than less steep slopes. Moreover, the association between steep slopes and suicide rate remained significant, controlling for other well-known ecological factors such as population density, daylight hours, and snow. Second, I found that elevation per se was less important in predicting suicide rate than the presence of sharp slopes. That is, even if two municipalities are located in the same elevation (e.g., 600 meters above the water level), a municipality with more steep slopes tends to have a higher suicide rate than a municipality with more flat areas. In a flat community, there are more shops, clinics, and other gathering places easily accessible to its residents than in a sloped community. More generally, I posit that harsh natural environments demand more patience and self-control, which in turn makes residents in harsh environments less likely to seek help from others, which could result in a higher rate of suicide.

AB Background: Because psychiatric disorders are risk factors for suicide, psychiatric consultation should be an essential element of suicide prevention among individuals with a high risk of suicide. The aim of the present study was to compare the characteristics of individuals who had or had not received psychiatric consultation before they attempted suicide in Japan.
   Methods: Clinical records were used to identify 300 consecutive persons who were admitted to the hospital for attempting suicide between April 2006 and March 2013. We divided the patients into two groups. One group consisted of patients who consulted a psychiatrist before their suicidal behaviours (the consultation group), and the other group consisted of patients who had not consulted a psychiatrist before their suicidal behaviours (the non-consultation group). Group differences were analysed with respect to gender, age, method of suicide attempts, psychiatric diagnosis (ICD-10), and duration of hospitalisation in the emergency unit.
   Results: Females tended to be over-represented in the consultation group (73.0%), and males tended to be over-represented in the non-consultation group (59.8%). Poisoning by prescription drugs was used more frequently as a method of suicide in the consultation group than in the non-consultation group. Neuroticism and related disorders were higher in the non-consultation group (33.7%) than in the consultation group (18.9%). Mood disorders (32.6%) were nearly as common as neuroticism in the non-consultation group, and together they accounted for almost two-thirds of all diagnoses. Mood disorders were comparable between the consultation group (30.9%) and the non-consultation group (32.6%). Adult personality disorders (13.3%) and schizophrenia and related disorders (26.0%) were higher in the consultation group than in the non-consultation group.
   Conclusions: Measures have to be taken to encourage people with these diverse characteristics to consult psychiatrists, and psychiatrists have to regularly evaluate patients for suicide risk. Furthermore, we need further research on the relationship between psychiatric consultation and poisoning by prescribed drugs.

AB Objectives This review aimed to quantify suicide risk among agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers and study potential variations of risk within this population.
   Methods We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis from 1995 to 2016 using MEDLINE and following the PRISMA guidelines. A pooled effect size of suicide risk among the population of interest was calculated using meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate whether effect size differed according to population or study characteristics. Meta-regression was used to identify sources of heterogeneity.
   Results The systematic review identified 65 studies, of which 32 were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled effect size was 1.48 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-1.68] representing an excess of suicide risk among the population of interest. Subgroup analysis showed that this effect size varied according to geographic area, with a higher effect size in Japan. The following study characteristics were found to contribute to the between-study variance: reference group, measure of effect size, and study design.
   Conclusions Our findings suggest an excess of suicide risk among agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers and demonstrated that this excess may be even higher for these groups in Japan. This review highlights the need for suicide prevention policies focusing on this specific population of workers. More research is also needed to better understand the underlying factors that may increase suicide risk in this population.

AB In this article, we will discuss the question of self-cremation by monks in Japan, a phenomenon that was similar to that found in China in some respects but also quite different. The Japanese state began trying to modernize its administration and its mode of governance in the middle of the seventh century, and some laws were issued prohibiting Buddhist monks from using fire for self-immolation. However, there is no source to show that Japan experienced a wave of suicides similar to that of China in the fifth and sixth centuries. It was not until the second half of the Heian period (794-1185) that we can observe a phenomenon of urbanization and of the spectacularization of these suicides by fire, which became an important phenomenon of social and religious life, frequently associated with the feast of the Dead, uranbon (sic), on the fifteenth day of the seventh month.

AB With the rapidly increasing number of work-related suicides in Japan (Karojisatsu, in Japanese), both applications for worker's compensation insurance and civil suits are proliferating. The phenomenon of work-related suicide is examined along with the process and related factors. With informed consent from bereaved families, two certified psychiatrists independently reviewed and summarized 22 insurance and legal reports filed by psychiatrists on employee suicides that were related to heavy workloads. A clinical epidemiologist participated in discussions with psychiatrists to reach a consensus concerning the cause of the suicides. Only one case involved a female. Seventeen had experienced personnel changes, such as a promotion or transfer. Low social support was recognized in 18, high psychological demand in 18, low decision latitude in 17, and long working hours in 19 cases (more than 11 hours per day for 3 months or more, and without a day off in 9). The subjects had depressive episodes by the ICD-10 criteria and showed suicidal signs. Ten of them saw a general practitioner because of unspecified somatic complaints, but no effective measures were taken. None of them had a history of psychiatric consultation or had received mental health education dealing with job stress management. Although causality cannot be made from this case series report, we hypothesize that long working hours, heavy workloads, and low social support may cause depression, which can lead to suicide. Appropriate countermeasures are urgently needed and the present findings suggest some of them are possible.

AB Issues pertaining to euthanasia, assisted suicide, and cessation of life support continue to be a subject of worldwide interest. Euthanasia- particularly "active" euthanasia- is not considered legally or socially acceptable in most countries. In Japan, the first judgment of a case involving euthanasia took place in 1949. Since then there have been another five cases that reached the point of sentencing in 1990.
   All six cases were examples of so called "active euthanasia", in which the termination of life was performed by family members. However, the focus of discussion has been changed dramatically in recent years, owing to two prominent cases of mercy killing in 1995 (Yokohama) and 1996 (Kyoto), respectively. Medical doctors were involved in both of these cases, and euthanasia moved from being a theoretical problem to a practical dilemma. These cases also drew attention to the fact that assisted suicide could be distinguished from euthanasia.
   The first part of this paper will summarize the current status of euthanasia and the cessation of life support in Japan, focusing on its historical background and policy. The second part will briefly sketch the characteristics of Japanese law and then will examine the two recent cases of mercy killing mentioned above to try and determine the roles of whistle blowing in the medical practice arena, with particular reference to Japanese culture. This analysis is a challenge to elucidate how ethics and the law interact, and influence medical practice in a specific cultural context. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: This is a systematic review of suicide and homicide-suicide events involving aircraft. In aeromedical literature and in the media, these very different events are both described as pilot suicide, but in psychiatry they are considered separate events with distinct risk factors.
   METHODS: Medical databases, internet search engines, and aviation safety databases were searched in a systematic way to obtain relevant cases. Relevant articles were searched for additional references.
   RESULTS: There were 65 cases of pilot suicide and 6 cases of passengers who jumped from aircraft found. There were also 18 cases of homicide-suicide found involving 732 deaths. Pilots perpetrated 13 homicide-suicide events. Compared to non aviation samples, a large percentage of pilot suicides in this study were homicide-suicides (17%).
   DISCUSSION: Homicide-suicide events occur extremely rarely. However, their, impact in terms of the proportion of deaths is significant when compared to deaths from accidents. There is evidence of clustering where pilot suicides occur after by media reports of suicide or homicide-suicide. Five of six homicide-suicide events by pilots of commercial airliners occurred after they were left alone in the cockpit. This, along with a sixth incident in which active intervention by a Japan Air crew saved 147 lives, suggests that having two flight members in the cockpit is potentially protective. No single factor was associated with the risk for suicide or homicide-suicide. Factors associated with both events included legal and financial crises, occupational conflict, mental illness, and relationship stressors. Drugs and/or alcohol played a role in almost half of suicides, but not in homicide-suicides.

AB Purpose: Cross-sectional studies have shown an association between different coping styles and suicidal behavior. It is unknown whether there is any prospective association between coping behaviors and suicide in the general population.
   Methods: The study population consisted of participants of the Japanese Public Health Center-based Prospective Study. In the 10-year follow-up questionnaire, subjects aged 50-79 years were asked how they handle daily problems. Coping behaviors were used to determine two coping strategies (approach coping and avoidance coping). Of 99,439 subjects that returned the 10-year follow-up questionnaire, 70,213 subjects provided complete answers on coping and were included in our analyses. Cox regression models, adjusted for confounders, were used to determine the risk of committing suicide according to coping style. Mean follow-up time was 8.8 years.
   Results: Two coping behaviors were significantly associated with suicide over time: planning (hazard ratio [HR], 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41-0.98) and self-blame (HR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.29-3.76). Of the coping strategies, only the avoidance coping strategy was significantly associated with suicide (HR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.24-4.85).
   Conclusions: For the first time, two coping behaviors and one coping strategy have been shown to have a significant prospective association with suicide in a general population. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Aims: Suicide is a leading cause of death among Japanese college and university students. Gatekeeper-training programs have been shown to improve detection and referral of individuals who are at risk of suicide by training non-mental-health professional persons. However, no studies have investigated the effectiveness of such programs in university settings in Japan. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of the gatekeeper-training program for administrative staff in Japanese universities.
   Methods: We developed a 2.5-h gatekeeper-training program based on the Mental Health First Aid program, which was originally developed for the general public. Seventy-six administrative staff at Hokkaido University participated in the program. Competence and confidence in managing suicide intervention, behavioral intention as a gatekeeper and attitude while handling suicidal students were measured by a self-reported questionnaire before, immediately after and a month after the program.
   Results: We found a significant improvement in competence in the management of suicidal students. We also found improvements in confidence in management of suicidal students and behavioral intention as a gatekeeper after training, though questionnaires for those secondary outcomes were not validated. These improvements continued for a month. About 95% of the participants rated the program as useful or very useful and one-third of the participants had one or more chances to utilize their skills within a month.
   Conclusions: The current results suggest the positive effects of the training program in university settings in Japan. Future evaluation that includes comparison with standard didactic trainings and an assessment of long-term effectiveness are warranted.

AB To investigate the feasibility of repeated gene transfection in suicide gene therapy against human solid tumors by a combination of 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) and its converting enzyme, cytosine deaminase (CD), we repeatedly transfected the yeast CD gene into the human pancreatic cancer cell line BXPC3 using the hemagglutinating virus of Japan-liposome in a new gene transfer method. The in vivo growth of the s.c. transplanted BXPC3 tumor in nude mice given CD-gene transfection was significantly suppressed by i.p. injection of 5-FC when compared with tumors treated with the control vector. Furthermore, the tumor transfected with the CD gene during a 7-day interval was suppressed much more than that of a single transfection. These results suggest that repeated transfection of the suicide gene together with the combination of 5-FC and the yeast CD gene using the hemagglutinating virus of Japan-liposome gene transfer method may be useful for the treatment of human solid tumors, including pancreatic cancer.

AB Background: Method-specific suicide trends varied across countries, and studies of the trends in different countries can contribute to the understanding of the epidemiology of suicide. The purpose of this study was to examine the changes in suicide trends by sex, age and method in the years 1971 to 2005 in Taiwan.
   Methods: Mortality data files of suicide and undetermined deaths for the years 1971-2005 were obtained for analyses. Age-, sex- and method-specific suicide rates were calculated by four age groups (15-24, 25-44, 45-64 and 65 and above) and five suicide methods (solids/liquids poisoning, other gases poisoning, hanging, jumping, and others).
   Results: Both sexes experienced downward trends from 1971 to 1993, and then an upward trend since 1993. People aged 65 years and above had the highest suicide rates throughout the study periods. However, males aged 25-64 years experienced the steepest increasing trends. As to suicide methods, an annual increase, since 1991, of people jumping from heights to commit suicide, and a marked increase, since 1998, of people completing suicide by poisoning with other gases (mainly charcoal-burning) were observed.
   Conclusion: Suicide by means of charcoal-burning and jumping from heights has become a serious public health problem in Taiwan. Preventive measures to curb these increasing trends are urgently needed.

AB Some studies have reported that a suicide attempt has a cathartic effect. We studied a change of suicidal ideation just before and after a suicide attempt to test whether a cathartic effect exists and, if a cathartic effect does exist, to identify factors that may affect it. Subjects consisted of 88 suicide attempters (29 males, 59 females, mean age = 35.5 years) who attended the emergency medical center of Kobe City General Hospital, Kobe, Japan. Strength of suicidal ideation just before and after a suicide attempt was evaluated by 11 steps from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates no suicidal ideation and 10 indicates the strongest suicidal ideation. Subjects were also interviewed about any clinical backgrounds related to suicide attempts. Diagnoses were made by psychiatrists based on ICD-10. Scores of suicidal ideation decreased significantly after the suicide attempt in comparison with those just before the suicide attempt (P < 0.0001). In suicide attempters of each generation under 60 years of age, there were significant decreases in scores of suicidal ideation after the suicide attempt, but not in those of over 60 years of age. Scores of suicidal ideation after the suicide attempt were significantly higher in the group of F4 classified by ICD-10 than that of F2. Our results indicate that the cathartic effect induced by suicide attempt is different among generations and psychiatric disorders.

AB Many individuals show negative attitudes toward the use of taxes for suicide prevention. Activities that enhance knowledge and awareness of suicide and suicide prevention may increase willingness to pay (WTP) for suicide prevention. WTP is the amount that a consumer will pay for a product or service. The present study examined the influence of educational activities on enhancing knowledge and awareness of suicide and its prevention on WTP. We conducted a quasi-experimental study to examine the influence of lectures on suicide by comparing the amount of change in WTP between two groups over the same period: an intervention group (n=92) comprising students who participated in the lectures and a control group (n=128) comprising general university students recruited through an Internet-based survey. A t-test showed that the amount of change was significantly larger in the intervention group (t (152.31) = 2.25, p=.026). Ordinal logistic regression analysis showed that increased WTP was significantly correlated with an annual household income of JPY 4-6 million or higher. It may be appropriate to conclude that participation in lectures about suicide is effective in increasing WTP for suicide prevention.

AB Objective The aim of this study is to clarify the association between area-based social capital and suicide rate among municipalities of Tokyo.
   Methods The study areas were 20 administrative municipalities of Tokyo. Social capital (i.e., organizational membership, social trust, fairness, helpfulness, and confidence in organizations) was measured based on data from a previous survey (response rate 28 %). Gender-specific age-adjusted suicide rates averaged over 5 years, sociodemographic, and other area characteristics were obtained from relevant national statistics. Multiple linear regression analysis of suicide rates was applied on each social capital variable, adjusting for the other area characteristics.
   Results There was no significant crude Pearson's correlation between any social capital variable and suicide rate. Multiple regression analyses revealed a significant negative association between social trust and suicide rate for men (p = 0.04).
   Conclusions While based on only limited evidence from a cross-sectional ecological study, area-based social trust may be associated with decreased suicide rates for men in Tokyo.

AB Although Japan has a high suicide rate, there is insufficient research on the experiences of suicide-bereaved individuals. We investigated the qualitative aspects of the meaning reconstruction process after a loss to suicide. We conducted a life-story interview using open-ended questions with one middle-aged Japanese woman who lost her son to suicide. We used a narrative approach to transcribe and code the participant's narratives for analysis. The analysis revealed three meaning groups that structured the participant's reactions to the suicide: making sense of her son's death and life, relationships with other people, and reconstruction of a bond with the deceased. The belief that death is not an eternal split and that there is a connection between the living and the deceased reduced the pain felt by our participant. Furthermore, the narratives worked as scaffolds in the meaning reconstruction process. We discuss our results in the light of cross-cultural differences in the grieving process.

ID RISK
AB Suicide is the act of a human being intentionally causing his. or her own death. More than 1 million people commit suicide every year. It is the 13th leading cause of death worldwide, with China, India, and Japan accounting for almost half of all suicides. In less than 50 years, the rate of suicide among Sri Lankans has risen from a modest level to one of the highest in the world (118 per 100000). Suicide is a major preventable cause of premature death. It is influenced by psychosocial, cultural, and environmental risk factors. The impact of suicide can be devastating for all concerned. It is common in people who are living with chronic mental illness. Individuals with severe clinical depression and alcohol use disorders are at highest risk if untreated. On an interpersonal level, friends and families of suicide victims require social support: On a national level, governments need to recognize the causes of suicide and protect those most vulnerable. If governments commit to defining national responses to prevent suicide, significant progress can be made. On a global scale, research and health organizations can identify global trends and encourage the sharing of information in effective prevention activities. In September 2010, World Suicide Prevention Day, with a theme of "Many Faces, Many Places: Suicide Prevention across the World," encouraged public awareness worldwide to unite in commitment and action to promote understanding about suicide and removal of stigmatization.(1) There is compelling evidence that adequate prevention and awareness can reduce suicide rates.

AB 'Undetermined' (UnD) and accidental deaths (AccD) are explored as possible sources of 'under-reported-suicides' (URS) in 20 Western countries.
   WHO mortality rates per million of AccD, UnD and suicides analysed. UnD:suicides ratios of < 1:5 calculated as likely URS versus ratios > 1:10 unlikely URS and all correlated by sex and age.
   Male URS likely in 7 countries and in 11 for females. URS in AccD likely in 5 countries for both sexes only UnD and suicide rates the elderly (75+) significantly correlated.
   Strong indication of URS in the UK, Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany with likely URS in AccD in Greece, Portugal, Switzerland and USA. These findings have important implications, indicating that, with the exception of France and Japan, official reported suicide rates contain a degree of under-reporting, and especially for women yet it is essential to have accurate suicide data to ensure adequate service provision.

AB Objective: There have been very few population-based prospective studies that have investigated the risks of deaths by suicide and other externally caused injuries (ECIs) among cancer patients in an Asian population. This study investigated whether the risk of death by both suicide and ECIs increases during the first year following the initial diagnosis of cancer.
   Methods: Data were analyzed from a population-based cohort of Japanese residents between 1990 and 2010, collected during the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study. Poisson regression models were used to calculate adjusted risk ratios (RRs) for both suicide and ECI deaths. To adjust for unmeasured confounding factors, case-crossover analyses were conducted for all patients with cancer who died by suicide and ECIs.
   Results: A population-based cohort of 102,843 Japanese residents was established. During the follow-up period, there were 34 suicides and 48 ECI deaths among patients with cancer, as compared with 527 suicides and 707 ECI deaths among those who did not have cancer. Analyses revealed that those who were newly diagnosed with cancer were at a greatly increased risk of death by suicide and ECIs within the first year after their diagnosis (suicide RR = 23.9, 95% CI: 13.8-41.6; ECI RR = 18.8, 95% CI: 11.4-31.0). Furthermore, the case-crossover analyses generally confirmed the results of the Poisson regressions.
   Conclusions: The risks of suicide and ECI deaths within the first year after a cancer diagnosis were higher than those among cancer-free populations. A diagnosis of cancer is a critical experience that may increase the risk of fatal outcomes. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Few empirical studies have focused on the associations among suicide proneness, hopelessness, and depression cross-culturally. The current study examined the potential to determine differences in the overall expression of suicide proneness between Japanese (n = 396) as compared with U.S. (n = 417) college students. Depressive symptoms were considered as a potential mediator of the relation between hopelessness and suicide proneness in both samples of students. Preliminary analyses focused on estimates of internal consistency reliability and differential item functioning (DIF) on the measures of hopelessness, depressive symptoms, and suicide proneness. Results of the primary analyses revealed that Japanese students reported more suicide proneness, greater hopelessness, and higher levels of depressive symptoms than did U.S. students. As expected, hopelessness and depressive symptoms were significantly associated with suicide proneness in both cultures. Additionally, the hopelessness-suicide proneness link was significantly mediated by depressive symptoms in both samples. Implications are offered for improved identification and treatment of college students at risk of suicidal behaviors both in the United States and in Japan.

AB This study offers an analysis of the elderly (over 65 years of age) among a general community population in terms of the percentages of: (i) persons with recurring thoughts of death and/or of committing suicide, and (ii) people who have consulted others, including medical professionals, with regard to these problems. Among, 433 elderly over the age of 65 in one community in a town in Aomori Prefecture, 358 agreed to participate in the project. Forty-four participants (12.3%) responded that they had either 'thoughts of death' or 'thoughts of suicide', and these thoughts had continued for more than 2 weeks in 12 participants (3.4%). Only 15 of the 44 suicidal elderly responded that they had consulted someone about their problems. Although there are many elderly people exhibiting a subclinical depressive state with recurring thoughts of death or thoughts of suicide, the number of people who consult family members, professionals, or others is very low. This suggests the importance of community networking through educational activities so that people can more readily talk to and support one another.

AB Background: This study explores differences in characteristics of overdose (OD) and non-overdose (NOD) suicide attempts in Singapore.
   Methods: Four hundred eighty-five medical records of people who attempted suicide were extracted from a local general hospital patient database and classified into OD and NOD groups. Differences in socio-demographic factors, suicide characteristics and hospital admission types between both groups were examined.
   Results: Indians were more likely than the Chinese and Malays to employ OD method in their attempts. More suicide attempts in the OD group than NOD group were self-reported. The most likely place for suicide attempts for both groups was at home, though more NOD suicide attempts were in public areas as compared to the OD group. Analgesics were the most used substance in the OD group. Those who attempted suicide using OD had a higher number of psychiatric ward admissions than the NOD group. Risk and protective factors varied between both groups.
   Conclusion: Differences in socio-demographics, suicide characteristics and admission characteristics between OD and NOD groups were observed. Recommendations for suicide prevention in the community are discussed. Further studies on the mediators and moderators of these trends and characteristics of suicide attempts are necessary to ensure maximal efficacy of prevention and management.

AB Background: The overall suicide rate in China has dropped substantially since the 1990s, with patterns changing significantly. This study aims to further explore the latest changes in suicide rates in China.
   Methods: Data on gender-age-specific suicide rates for rural and urban residents aged 15 years and above were retrieved from official records. Joinpoint regression analyses were applied to analyze time trends of suicide rates.
   Results: Overall, suicide rates in China dropped significantly from 2002 to 2015. However, the national suicide rates have decreased at a slower pace since 2006. Joinpoints on time trends of suicide rates were also observed among rural males, rural females and urban males in 2005, 2006 and 2008, respectively. Declines in suicide rates of a majority of groups aged 25-54 slowed around 2007, and even reversed among males aged 25-34 in both areas and rural males aged 45-54. Male suicide rates were increasingly higher than females' after 2006. Rural suicide rates were about twice those of urban groups in recent years.
   Limitations: Data on suicide is based on a large-sampled surveillance system, which may suffer from some quality flaws. Improvements in the quality of suicide rate data may lead to bias. Information on other potential differences in suicide rates over time is not available.
   Conclusions: Although the suicide rate in China dropped significantly from 2002-2015, a slowdown in the decrease and even a reversing trend was observed in some certain groups, which highlights the urgent need for targeted suicide prevention programs.

AB Sleep loss impairs brain function. As late sleep onset can reduce sleep, this sleep/circadian rhythm disturbance may cause brain impairment. Specific data on the long-term effects of sleep/circadian rhythm disturbance on subsequent brain function are lacking. Japan, a sleep-deprived society from infancy to adulthood, provides an ideal platform to investigate the association of these disturbances in early life with subsequent functioning. In this article, several current problematic behaviors among youth in Japan (dropping out from high school, school absenteeism, early resignation from employment, and suicide) are discussed in relation to early life sleep/circadian rhythm patterns. We hypothesize that daily habits of modern society during early stages of life produce unfavorable effects on brain function resulting in problematic behaviors in subsequent years.

TI Charcoal burning suicides in Hong Kong and urban Taiwan: an illustration
   of the impact of a novel suicide method on overall regional rates
SO JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
LA English
DT Article

AB Objectives: Following the first case in Hong Kong in 1998, the method of committing suicide by charcoal burning has spread to other communities. This aim of this study was to examine the impact of charcoal burning suicides on both overall suicide rates and older-method suicide rates in Hong Kong and urban Taiwan.
   Design: Trend analysis of the overall and method-specific suicide rates between 1997 and 2002. Comparison of age and gender profiles of those who committed suicide by charcoal burning and other methods of suicide.
   Setting: Hong Kong and Urban Taiwan.
   Main results: Suicides by charcoal burning increased rapidly within five years in both Hong Kong and urban Taiwan. This increase was not paralleled by decreases in suicides by older methods and led to an increase of more than 20% in the overall suicide rates. Those in the 24 - 39 age range were more likely to choose charcoal burning than other methods.
   Conclusions: The lack of parallel decreases in the suicides rates of older methods with the rise of charcoal burning suicides suggests limited substitution between the methods. The preponderance of the rise in suicide deaths associated with charcoal burning suggests that its invention, followed by wide media dissemination, may have specifically contributed to the increase in suicides in both regions. As a similar increase was found in urban Taiwan as in Hong Kong, charcoal burning suicide should not be viewed as merely a local health problem and has the potential to become a major public health threat in other countries.

DE suicide; depression; psychosocial factors; standardized mortality ratio
ID MENTAL-DISORDERS; PUBLIC-ATTITUDES; SCALE
AB BACKGROUND: Knowledge of and attitudes toward suicide and depression have not been fully investigated in Japan.
   METHODS: Study areas comprised municipalities in northern Japan where standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) from suicide compared with a Japanese standard ranged from 1.62 to 3.72 in men and from 1.43 to 3.49 in women. We conducted a questionnaire survey on a random sample of 7,136 participants aged 20 to 79 years, and analyzed data of 5,547 (77.7%) subjects. We categorized seven municipalities, from which the subjects were drawn, into three groups according to the SMR from suicide. Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) score was used for evaluation of depressive states.
   RESULTS: The SIDS score was significantly higher in the high SMR group in women, but no significant difference among the three SMR groups was observed in men. The percentage of subjects with nine years or less of education was significantly higher in the high SMR group both in men and in women. The percentage of men who drank alcohol once a week or more was significantly higher in the high SMR group. The percentages of subjects unaware that depressive states are treatable by medication were not significantly different among the three SMR groups both in men and in women, while the percentage of men unwilling to see a psychiatrist when depressed was the lowest in the high SMR group.
   CONCLUSION: Although a significant difference in SIDS score was observed in women, most of the psychosocial factors or knowledge of and attitudes toward suicide and depression were not adversely associated with SMR group.

ID PREVENTION
AB Background: Suicide notes (SN) are one of markers of the severity of a suicide attempt and are said to provide a valuable insight into the thinking of suicide victims before the fatal act [Shah, A., De, T., 1998. Suicide and the elderly. Int. J. Psychiat. Clin Pract. 2, 3-18]. To examine whether suicide victims who wrote notes (note writers: NW) differ from those who did not, we investigated the characteristics of a sample of more than 5000 Japanese suicides using multiple logistic regression analysis.
   Methods: For all suicide victims (5161 cases), we examined the following information: gender, age, suicide method, reason for suicide, marital status, residential status, history of psychiatric disorders, previous suicidal behavior, physical disease, and content of suicide notes.
   Results: Mean incidence of NW was 30.1% (male: 29.7%, female: 30.8%). NW in Japan had the following characteristics; higher proportion in female and living alone, suicide by more lethal methods such as carbon monoxide, hanging or sharp instruments. On the other hand, non-NW had tendencies to commit suicide for reasons of physical illness and psychiatric disorder, and/or history of previous psychiatric disorders.
   Limitations: This study is observational and discusses only completed, not attempted, suicide. Medical and psychiatric comorbidity are judged only by the history of diagnosis and the information about the problems in relationships is based not on valid criteria for inclusion.
   Conclusions: Although these findings show ethnic differences, it is possible that SN may be considered an indicator of a serious suicide attempt. Further studies of SN are needed to confirm this. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide pacts are, a mutual arrangement between more often two people who decide to kill themselves together, usually in the same place. After a presentation of some famous cases (Mayerling tragedy, double suicides of Heinrich Kleist, Stefan Zweig, Max Linder or Paul Lafargue), this article describe the epidemiology, circumstances and motivation, mental health, main differential diagnosis, psychopathology and legal issues in suicide pacts. These pacts are relatively rare, between 0.56 and 2.5% of all suicides in reference occidental studies. They are classically more frequent (4%) in Japan. The common romantic view of pacts between lovers unsuccessful in their marriage project, up to 58% of cases in a study in Japan, characterizes only a minority in Occident (6.4 to 20%). These pacts involve more often married couples (70 to 78%), average age being between 51 and 56 years. Couples of aged husbands, depressive, mutually devoted and socially isolated, suffering from physical debiliting or painful illness, are usually concerned. Parents and children, siblings or sometimes friends can also be implicated in suicide pacts. The threat of dissolution of a close, affectionate and exclusive relationship between both partners, one of them being dominant and becoming the instigator of a double suicide, is emphasized by some authors. Such suicide pacts may also occur between persons unknown to themselves before, sparing their difficulties in life on Internet and searching one or more partners to die together. Couples use preferentially the same non-violent method for death, above all intoxication by carbon monoxide from car exhausts or medicines in recent series in England and Wales (89 to 92%). Different means such as submersion, poisoning by other liquid or solid substances, jumping and suffocation can also be used. Firearms are more commonly in cause in homicide-suicide pacts. Considering psychopathology, major depressive disorder of one or both members of the couple seems the most frequent diagnosis, in a context of anxiety or pain related to illness or handicap, financial difficulties and a possible separation. Suicide pacts have also common characteristics with induced psychosis or "folie a deux", with an exclusive bonding between these persons, social isolation and shared delusive thoughts of financial ruin or disease. In a forensic point of view, differential diagnoses are especially homicides-suicides without the consent of the victim, double or multiple homicides or accidental consequences of a suicide. Most legislations in many countries punish complicity or assistance to suicide and more over homicide. The fact that these suicide pacts are carefully premeditated and frequently lethal must arouse clinicians' attention to patients wishing or having already tried to die together.

AB Both the suicide rate and unemployment rate have showed an upward trend in Taiwan since 1994. This study aimed to explore the association between the suicide rate and the unemployment rate. This information is useful in developing specific suicide prevention strategies related to unemployment.
   All the cases of suicide by those aged 15 years and above during 1978-2006 in Taiwan (n = 74,064) were included in this study. Time series models were used to analyze the monthly age-standardized suicide rate by gender and age-subgroup (15-24, 25-44, 45-64, and 65+).
   With regard to the age range and gender subgroup, the association between age-standardized suicide and the unemployment rate was comparatively high for males and those aged from 45 to 64 years. Among males and those aged from 45 to 64 years, a 1% increase in the absolute unemployment rate was associated with a 4.9% (95% confidence interval: 1.7-8.2) increase in the relative age-standardized suicide rate in the monthly average from 1978 to 2006 in Taiwan.
   Suicide prevention strategy for the unemployed should be more focused especially on males aged from 45 to 64 years in Taiwan.

AB Objective: Age, gender, race, cultural and ethnic structure are important factors in suicide epidemiology. Factors effecting suicide behaviour are important to establish effective prevention programs, so it is important to evaluate them in detail. The aim of this study was to determine the regional differences and to get detailed data for guiding the suicide prevention programs by reviewing all suicides in Samsun. Material and Methods: The judicial files of all suicides were evaluated that occurred in Samsun, between 1999-2003. Some information such as age, gender, marital status, occupation status, suicide place and time and, suicide methods used by the cases were obtained. In addition, the probable risk factors for suicide from the official statements of the parents in the judicial files were determined. Results: In five years period, 169 people committed suicide in Samsun. Most of them were at the age of 10-29 years and 58.6% of were males. They most commonly used a firearm (28.4%) as the suicide method, self poisoning (27.8%) and hanging (26.0%) were following it. While most of the males committed suicide by firearm, females preferred self poisoning. Leading risk factors were unemployment and economic problems followed by family problems, diagnosed psychiatric illnesses, alcohol abuse, emotional problems and undiagnosed psychiatric illnesses. Conclusion: Suicide is a multi-faceted problem that needs both social and individual approaches. This study shows that higher ratio of firearm suicides needs more attention, and detailed studies especially for determination risk groups for prevention programs are necessary.

AB This study aims to evaluate outcomes of a community-based program to prevent suicide among the elderly (>= 65 years old) using a quasi-experimental design with two neighboring references. During 1999-2004, the program including depression screening and group activity was conducted by the public health nurses in the Minami district (population 1685) of Nagawa town, rural Japan. Pre-post changes in the risk of completing suicide were estimated by the incidence rate ratios (IRR). The risk for Minami's elderly females was reduced by 74% (age-adjusted IRR, 0.26; 90% CI, 0.07-0.98) more than the historical trend, while there was no change in the risk of Minami's males and nor in the male or female references. The local intervention using public health nursing would be effective against suicide for elderly females without diffusing to the surroundings.

AB Background: Japanese forensic mental health services for patients with psychiatric disorders under the Medical Treatment and Supervision Act was initiated in 2005; however, the prognosis of those patients is not well-known, particularly regarding mortality and suicide. This study aimed to evaluate the all-cause mortality and suicide rate in forensic psychiatric outpatients who had been discharged from forensic psychiatric wards in Japan.
   Methods: Participants included 966 patients who had been discharged from forensic psychiatric wards. Data were collected from July 15, 2005 to July 15, 2018 at 29 of the 33 forensic psychiatric wards in Japan. Only the patients who provided written informed consent were included. We and collaborators at each forensic psychiatric ward identified demographic data of participants from the medical records for the inpatient treatment period. The reintegration coordinators, who belonged to the Ministry of Justice, investigated the prognosis of the participants during the outpatient treatment order period. We then connected demographic data and participants' prognosis for analysis. The crude rates (CRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated to analyze all-cause mortality and suicide rates. Univariate analysis was performed to examine the factors associated with all-cause mortality and suicide rates using the Cox proportional hazards ratio model.
   Results: The participants included 3.3 times as many men (n= 739) compared to women (n = 227), and their combined mean age was 47.3 (SD = 12.9). The most common primary psychiatric diagnosis was psychotic disorders (81.3%). The mean follow-up period was 790.2 days (SD = 369.6). The total observation period was 2091.2 person-years. The CR for all-cause death was 812.9 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI [426.5, 1199.4]), while the SMR for all-cause death was 2.2 (95% CI [1.3, 3.5]). The CR for completed suicide was 478.2 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI [181.8, 774.6]). The suicide SMR was 17.9 (95% CI [8.6, 32.9]) overall, 7.7 (95% CI [2.5, 18.0]) for men, and 79.4 (95% CI [25.8, 185.2]) for women. Univariate analysis showed that women had higher completed suicide risk than men (hazard ratio = 3.599, 95% CI [1.041, 12.445]).
   Conclusion: The all-cause mortality and completed suicide rates were higher in participants than observed in the general population consistent with the results of previous international studies. (C) 2019 The Author( s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Purpose: This research aimed to identify significantly elevated areas of risk for suicide in Virginia adjusting for risk factors and risk factor uncertainty.
   Methods: We fit three Bayesian hierarchical spatial models for relative risk of suicide adjusting for risk factors and considering different random effects. We compared models with and without incorporating parameter estimates' margin of error (MOE) from the American Community Survey and identified counties with significantly elevated risk and highly significantly elevated risk for suicide.
   Results: Incorporating MOEs and using a mixing parameter between unstructured and spatially structured random effects achieved the best model fit. Fifty-two counties had significantly elevated risk and 18 had highly significantly elevated risk of suicide. Models without MOEs underestimated relative risk and over-identified counties with elevated risk.
   Conclusions: Accounting for uncertainty in parameter estimates achieved better model fit. Efficient allocation of resources for suicide prevention can be attained by targeting clusters of counties with elevated risk. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study is to assess whether the risk or types of suicide change in Fukushima in the aftermath of a series of disaster, including earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident in March 2011.
   The clinical records of all patients visited to the medical centre near the nuclear plant from 1 year before to 1 year after the disaster were reviewed (n = 981). Patients with non-fatal suicide attempt were divided into two categories depending on their method of suicide attempt. Standardised mortality ratios were calculated to adjust for changes in demographic profiles.
   The risk of non-fatal suicide attempts using high-mortality methods was significantly higher for 4 months, by three to four times after the series of disasters, and then decreased. There was no significant increase of non-fatal suicide attempts using low-mortality methods after the disaster.
   After such a disaster, immediate psychiatric support may be required because of the increased risk of non-fatal suicide attempts in the immediate aftermath.

AB Background: Season of birth is associated with several psychiatric disorders and suicidal behavior. We explored the association between the season of birth and suicide among schizophrenic and psychotic suicide victims. Methods: The study sample consisted of all suicides in the province of Oulu in Northern Finland from 1989 to 2010. Causes of death were extracted from death certificates, and psychiatric diagnoses associated with the hospital treatments were obtained from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register. The seasons were defined as follows: winter (from November to January), spring (from February to April), summer (from May to July), and autumn (from August to October). Suicide victims (n = 1,902) were categorized as having either schizophrenia (n = 228) or psychosis other than schizophrenia (n = 240). Suicide victims without any hospital-treated mental disorder (n = 1,434) were used as a comparison group. Results: The distribution of births among suicide victims with schizophrenia differed statistically significantly from that observed in the general population, with a peak in summer (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.5). Conclusions: Birth during summer may predispose schizophrenic persons to suicide. The putative roles of serotonin, dopamine, and vitamin D status in the season of birth of psychotic suicide victims are discussed. (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI Understanding the contribution of suicide to life expectancy in South
   Korea
SO DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID ECONOMIC-CRISIS; GENDER RATIO; JAPAN; RATES; MORTALITY; AGE
AB BACKGROUND
   South Korea has the highest rate and highest rate of increase in suicide among developed countries. The suicide epidemic in Korea is an anomaly, and suicide rates are high for both men and women, with no signs of decreasing. Yet we do not know the extent to which suicide has reduced life expectancy in Korea.
   OBJECTIVE
   We investigated whether and to what extent the rapid increase in suicide has contributed to changes in Korean life expectancy, a key indicator of population health.
   METHODS
   We used a recently developed decomposition method that separates the contribution of suicide's effect on change in life expectancy into two parts: that due to change in the overall suicide incidence rate and that due to change in the mean age of suicide victims.
   RESULTS
   From 1995 to 2010, life expectancy increased by 6.5 years in Korea, with change in most causes of death contributing to its growth. We nonetheless find, as expected, that the rise in suicides reduced the increase in life expectancy from 1995 to 2010, so life expectancy in Korea is about 0.21 years lower than it would have been without the increase in suicides. Moreover, had the age of suicide victims remained stable, we project that Korea's life expectancy would be fully 0.70 years lower than it is.
   CONCLUSION
   Although the growth in suicide was the largest single factor slowing the rise in Korean life expectancy, the effect would have been even larger had the age of suicide victims not increased.

DT Article
ID TESTS
AB Objective
   The number of suicides in Japan has remained high for many years. To effectively resolve this problem, firm understanding of the statistical data is required. Using a large quantity of wide-ranging data on Japanese citizens, the purpose of this study was to analyze the geographical clustering properties of suicides and how suicide rates have evolved over time, and to observe detailed patterns and trends in a variety of geographic regions.
   Methods
   Using adjacency data from 2008, the spatial and temporal/spatial clustering structure of geographic statistics on suicides were clarified. Echelon scans were performed to identify regions with the highest-likelihood ratio of suicide as the most likely suicide clusters.
   Results
   In contrast to results obtained using temporal/spatial analysis, the results of a period-by-period breakdown of evolving suicide rates demonstrated that suicides among men increased particularly rapidly during 1988-1992, 1993-1997, and 1998-2002 in certain cluster regions located near major metropolitan areas. For women, results identified cluster regions near major metropolitan areas in 1993-1997, 1998-2002, and 2003-2007.
   Conclusions
   For both men and women, the cluster regions identified are located primarily near major metropolitan areas, such as greater Tokyo and Osaka.

AB Major depressive disorder (MDD) is defined as a state of depressed mood, loss of volition and interest, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, sleep problems, poor appetite, loss of energy, and poor concentration, which causes disability in personal and social activities. Lifetime prevalence of MDD is 6.7% (4.8% in men and 9.1% in women), and has increased by 0.2% annually for the last decade. The risk factors for suicide are MDD, severity of the MDD episode, psychotic symptoms, first episode, and being male. The suicide rate was 31.2 per 100,000 persons in the 2010 report on Death and Causes of Death in Korea, which is the seventh highest incidence in men and first in women among 105 nations from the WHO report. The lifetime rate of suicide attempts in Korea is 3.2% according to the Epidemiological Survey of Mental Disorders in Korea 2011, which is higher than the rate of China, Japan, and Western countries. It is estimated that 1,200,000 persons in Korea have attempted suicide at some point within their lifetime. Seasonal variations in suicide indicate the association between suicide and MDD. Both rates of suicide and suicide attempts are the highest in May, when a total of 52.8% of those attempting suicide were diagnosed with MDD. Forty percent of recent suicide attempts are associated with MDD, and 73.7% with MDD or alcohol use disorder in the general population. In conclusion, suicide and suicide attempts are closely associated with MDD. Suicide is a medical condition that is treatable and preventable, and suicide rates can be reduced through early diagnosis and treatment for MDD and alcohol use disorder in Korea.

SO COMPREHENSIVE PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID TEMPS-A; IDEATION; JAPAN; DEPRESSION
AB Objective: Suicide has been reported to be associated with cyclothymic, irritable, depressive and anxious temperaments. In contrast, hyperthymic temperament has been reported to be protective against suicide. In the present study, we hypothesized that Japanese patients with suicide attempt may have higher scores of cyclothymic, irritable, depressive, and anxious temperaments but lower scores of hyperthymic temperament than non-suicidal patients. In order to examine this hypothesis, we investigated Japanese patients of a university emergency center.
   Methods: The association of temperament and suicide attempt was investigated in 116 patients referred to a university emergency center for intoxication or injury. Of them, 35 patients of suspected suicide attempt were categorized as 18 patients who intended to die with attempted suicide and suffered from self-inflicted but not fatal injury (Suicide Attempt II), 4 patients whose intention to die were undetermined although they suffered from self-inflicted injury (Undetermined Suicide-Related Behavior II), and 13 patients who had no intention to die although they suffered from self-inflicted injury (Self-Harm II). Logistic regression analyses and multiple regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with the present suicide attempt and the number of suicide attempts, respectively.
   Results: Anxious temperament scores were significantly and directly associated with Suicide Attempt II group whereas irritable temperament scores were associated with Self-Harm II group.
   Conclusion: The present findings suggest that those with anxious temperament may have more suicide attempts than those with other temperaments, indicating anxious temperament as a risk factor of suicide attempt. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: This study aims to comprehensively investigate the causal relationship between suicide and its risk factors in a longitudinal design.
   Methods: A model was derived in which suicide rate in 2008 was longitudinally and comprehensively predicted by potential risk factors recorded one year before (2007) which included personal and interpersonal factors, medical factors, economic factors, climate factors, alcoholic factors, and omega-3 fatty-acid factors.
   Results: In males, elderly population rate and complete unemployment rate predicted SMR of suicide significantly and positively whereas marriage rate and annual postal savings per person predicted SMR of suicide significantly and negatively. Also in females, complete unemployment rate predicted SMR of suicide significantly and positively whereas annual mean temperature predicted SMR of suicide significantly and negatively.
   Limitations: The limitations of this study are that predictions are based on the data of only the recent two years, that these epidemiological data cannot be always extrapolated to individuals, and that other factors should be taken into consideration to female suicide.
   Conclusions: The present findings suggest that male suicide may be accounted for by older age, more complete employment rate, less marriage rate and less annual postal savings whereas female suicide may be accounted for by more complete employment rate and lower annual mean temperature.

AB Previous studies have shown a positive relationship between geomagnetic disturbances and an increased incidence of suicide. The Japanese suicide rate is the ninth highest in the world, but there have been no reports examining the relationship between geomagnetic disturbance and the number of suicides, and, therefore, this paper examines this relationship.
   The number of Japanese suicides per month from January 1999 to December 2010 was obtained, and it was found that a total of 262,596 males and 102,539 females committed suicide during this period. To adjust the other factors which affect the number of suicides, a multiple linear regression analysis with backward elimination was carried out, with the monthly number of suicides as the response variable and the monthly mean K index value, monthly mean number of sunspots, monthly mean unemployment rate, proportion of elderly people (%), monthly mean air pressure (hPa), monthly mean air temperature (A degrees C), monthly mean humidity (%), and monthly mean day length (h) as the explanatory variables.
   In the multiple linear regression analysis for males, the monthly mean K index value was associated with the monthly number of suicides, but in females, the monthly mean K index value was not associated with the monthly number of suicides.
   In this study, we generated a hypothesis that geomagnetic disturbances may trigger male suicides.

AB A suicide prevention strategy was launched in Japan in 2006 to address the high suicide rate, which had increased considerably since 1998. The national strategy from 2007 involved the enhancement of psychiatric treatment services at emergency medical facilities and supportive observation by individuals close to patients. The national suicide rate has decreased gradually since 2008; however, national information regarding the number of patients who had engaged in deliberate self-harm was absent. Therefore, the present study examined the longitudinal trend in hospital admissions due to deliberate self-harm in Japan. Data from the National Patient Survey between 1996 and 2014-a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of inpatient care every 3 years-were used. Data for 13,014 patients were included in the estimation of the number of hospital admissions due to deliberate self-harm. The results show that the estimated number of admissions due to deliberate self-harm increased from 2078 in September 1996 to 3189 in September 2008, when the national number of suicide cases peaked, and decreased to 1783 in 2014. Approximately half of the patients were admitted to hospital because of self-harm via means other than drug poisoning, which had a high mortality rate (5.6%). The proportion of patients receiving public assistance was higher in those who had engaged in deliberate self-harm (8.5%) relative to that observed in the general population. Overall, the trend in deliberate self-harm was synchronous with the number of suicide cases over time. As economic poverty has been associated with suicidal ideation and behavior and some recipients of public assistance tend to abuse psychotropic medication, the public assistance program should provide mental health support for recipients of social benefit schemes.

AB Suicide prevention is an increasingly important issue, especially among older people. Recent work on improving its effectiveness has focused on developing a framework aligning interventions with key risk factors and stages of the suicide process. We have developed this further, by integrating psycho-behavioral components associated with suicide, existing guidelines for identifying critical points of intervention, and the previous preventive strategies framework. Our schematic diagram shows the relationship between the suicide process and prevention strategies, combined with initiatives for linking different types of strategies, from universal strategies at population level, through selective strategies focusing on groups at risk, to indicated strategies, aimed at specific high-risk individuals. We tested our framework using previous studies assessing the impact of suicide prevention interventions on suicide rates in older adults. It was possible to place all identified interventions within the framework. Examining effectiveness within the framework suggests that some interventions may be more successful in reducing suicide rates because they developed systematic linkages between universal, selective, and indicated prevention interventions. Other studies, however, show that interventions can be successful without these linkages, so other factors may also be important. The main weakness of our framework is a lack of evidence about critical intervention points within the suicide process, which may limit its practical application. However, the framework may help to improve the linkages between types of interventions, and support practitioners in developing a wide range of strategies across different areas and stages of the suicide process.

   War; Qing Dynasty; bushido; surrender
AB What can be learned from the now largely forgotten first Sino-Japanese War (1894-95) about concepts like the heroism of surrender? I show that Japanese depictions, far from being universally contemptuous, treated their main opponent, the commander of the Chinese Beiyang fleet, Admiral Ding Buchan& with great respect before, during, and even after the war despite his surrender. Why? I use accounts by observers and Ding's own letters to scrutinize the enduring popularity of his posthumous image in Japan versus China. I argue that Ding showed neither strategic brilliance nor formidability as an opponent. This means he does not fit the "nobility of failure" concept, remaining an anomalous outlier for provoking such hero-worship in Japan despite his mediocre wartime performance. Overall, how Ding and the Beiyang Fleet were treated in popular Japanese accounts suggests that Japanese attitudes towards concepts such as "bravery," "surrender," and "suicide" were in flux in the 1890s.

AB Suicide explains the largest number of death tolls among Japanese adolescents in their twenties and thirties. Suicide is also a major cause of death for adolescents in many other countries. Although social isolation has been implicated to influence the tendency to suicidal behavior, the impact of social isolation on suicide in the context of explicit social networks of individuals is scarcely explored. To address this question, we examined a large data set obtained from a social networking service dominant in Japan. The social network is composed of a set of friendship ties between pairs of users created by mutual endorsement. We carried out the logistic regression to identify users' characteristics, both related and unrelated to social networks, which contribute to suicide ideation. We defined suicide ideation of a user as the membership to at least one active user-defined community related to suicide. We found that the number of communities to which a user belongs to, the intransitivity (i.e., paucity of triangles including the user), and the fraction of suicidal neighbors in the social network, contributed the most to suicide ideation in this order. Other characteristics including the age and gender contributed little to suicide ideation. We also found qualitatively the same results for depressive symptoms.

AB Suicides are generally the consequence of overchallenged coping strategies of individual for psychological, social or internal and external biological strain factors. Timing of the suicide, too, may be influenced by external factors. Studies so far have yielded in part inconsistent results concerning the association of suicides with particular days or periods of the year. Even less is known regarding a potential effect of the time of birth on suicide risk.
   The Tyrol Suicide Register (TSR) provides data on suicides occurring in the Austrian State of Tyrol including birthday of the suicide victim and day of the suicide. In the present study the frequency of suicides was analyzed with regard to birthday, day of the week, major holidays and season over a period of 17 years. Further, a potential association with month of birth and zodiac signs was studied.
   We found a significant variation in suicide frequency concerning day of the week with a peak on Mondays and Tuesdays and seasonality with increased numbers in spring and summer months.
   The increase of suicide numbers at the beginning of the week may be explained by the "broken-promise effect" which has been described as the consequence of frustrated expectations concerning the weekend. Possible explanations for the suicide peaks in spring and summer may be biological, specifically serotonergic alterations as well as the experience of depressed patients perceiving the social and emotional contrast to people who are able to enjoy these periods of pleasure and outdoor activities.

AB Objective: Japan experienced a nationwide outbreak of hydrogen sulfide suicides (HSS) between April and May 2008. The annual number of HSS skyrocketed from 19 in 2007 to 1,056 in 2008. However, the factors affecting this enormous increase remain unknown. The present study aimed to examine the effect of media coverage of the incidents on the subsequent epidemic of HSS. Method: We collected time series data from the 1st week of February to the last week of September 2008 (34 weeks), including the number of HSS (S-t), the number of articles on HSS published in the five major newspapers (N-t), and the number of Internet searches with the keyword "hydrogen sulfide suicide" (G(t)). The generalized method of moments was applied to model the concurrent effects of N-t and G(t) on S-t. Results: The increase in the number of newspaper articles significantly induced the increase in HSS (coefficient, 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.28-5.3), while the number of Internet searches did not significantly affect the number of HSS (coefficient, -0.75; 95%CI, -19.3-0.45). Conclusions: Exposure to information on HSS from newspaper articles could have directly affected the subsequent increase in the number of suicides. On the other hand, the number of the Internet searches did not have a direct influence on HSS. (Int'l. J. Psychiatry in Medicine 2012;44:133-140)

AB Background
   Premature death in individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) in countries without nationally collected data, including Japan, is structurally underreported.
   Aims
   To elucidate excess mortality among individuals with SMI in Japan.
   Method
   We retrospectively investigated all deaths among users of a non-clinical community-based mental health service provider in suburban Tokyo from 1992 to 2015.
   Results
   During the study period, 45 individuals died among 254 qualified registrants. Deaths were by natural causes in 33 cases (73.3%). The mean years of life lost was 22.2 years and the overall standard mortality ratio (SMR) was 3.28 (95% CI 2.40-4.39). The cause-specific SMR was 5.09 (95% CI 2.33-9.66) for cardiovascular disease and 7.38 (95% CI 2.40-17.22) for suicide.
   Conclusions
   Although Japan leads the world in longevity, individuals with SMI suffer premature death and excess mortality due to physical conditions as well as suicide. Revealing this underreported disparity of life is the first step to improving physical care for individuals with SMI.

AB PurposeDistinctive and dramatic changes in the history of China with a rapid suicide decline in recent years present an opportunity to investigate the risk of suicide. In this study, we investigated suicide risk with a historical perspective with archived data to inform suicide research and prevention policies and strategies.MethodDocumented age-specific suicide mortality rates in 1987-2012 were decomposed into age, period, and cohort effect using APC-modeling method and intrinsic estimator (IE) technique. The estimated effects were further analyzed by numerical differentiation.ResultsThe data satisfactorily fit the constructed APC models. Cohort effect indicated that suicide risk in China fluctuated at very high levels during 1903-1967, followed by a sharp decline during 1968-1977, and reached the lowest level in 1983-1987 before increased again. Period effect confirmed the declining trend since 1987. Three sunny cohorts with reduced suicide risk and four cloudy cohorts with increased risk were, respectively, associated with significant cultural, social, political, and economic events in China since the 1900s.ConclusionsThe mega trends in the suicide risk at the population level are closely related to significant historical events in China. Suicide is anticipated to increase because of the growing risk for the young cohorts (particularly young females) as the country further develops. Study findings suggest the significance of national strategies for suicide prevention and control, including maintenance of social harmony and stability, provision of more opportunities for development, enhancement of social integration, and restriction of suicide facilitating factors.

AB Aim. - This study looked at whether a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with a higher risk of externally caused death (by suicide and accident), using data for a large population-based prospective cohort from an Asian population.
   Methods. Data collected between 1990 and 2012 from the Japan Public Health Centre-based Prospective Study were analyzed, and Poisson regression models were used to calculate adjusted risk ratios (RR) for external causes of death. Results. The population-based cohort comprised 105,408 Japanese residents (49,484 men and 55,924 women; mean age: 51.2 [SD 7.9] years). At baseline, 3250 (6.6%) men and 1648 (3.0%) women had a history of DM. During the follow-up period, 113 external deaths (41 suicides and 72 accidents) were noted among those with a history of DM, with 1304 external deaths (577 suicides and 727 accidents) among those without such a history. A higher risk of external death (men, RR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.2-1.8; women, RR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.01-2.4) was observed in those with a history of DM. Also, among those aged 40-49 years (RR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.7) and 50-59 years (RR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.05-1.9) at baseline, the risk of external death was significantly higher in those with a history of DM.
   Conclusion. Compared with people with no history of DM, those with such a history had a significantly greater risk of externally caused death (particularly accidental deaths) in both genders and in those aged <= 59 years at baseline. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

ID INTERNET SUICIDE; JAPAN; MEDIA
AB Objectives: To examine how Twitter is used as a place where people seek others to make suicide pacts.
   Study design: This is an exploratory quantitative study.
   Methods: We used Twitter application programming interfaces to collect all Korean tweets containing the term 'suicide pact' between October 16, 2017 and November 30, 2017. A Python program and human coders were employed to further identify tweets that aimed to seek others to make a suicide pact and analyze the content of each tweet. Poisson regression analysis was used to examine the characteristics of the tweets that attracted more replies.
   Results: During the data collection period comprising 43 days, 1702 tweets posted by 551 users were aimed to find others to make suicide pacts. Many of the tweets contained detailed information such as the name of city, gender and age of the user, preferred contact method, and preferred gender of a partner. The number of replies to a tweet seeking a suicide pact varied according to the types of the information contained in the tweet.
   Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that Twitter might be an attractive place where people try to meet others to make a suicide pact. Thus, the government should try to prevent cases of suicides caused by suicide pacts made via Twitter. (C) 2018 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: In addition to implementing a depression screening program, conducting a survey beforehand might contribute to suicide risk reduction for the elderly. Aims: This study evaluates outcomes of a community-based program to prevent suicide among individuals aged 60 and over, using a quasiexperimental design with an intervention region (41,337 residents, 35.1% aged 60 and over) and a neighboring reference region. Methods: Our 2-year intervention program included an anonymous survey by random sample in the entire intervention region and, in the second year, a depression screening with follow-up by a psychiatrist in the higher-risk districts. Changes in the risk of completed suicide were estimated by the incidence-rate ratio (IRR). Results: The risk for men in the intervention region was reduced by 61% (age-adjusted IRR = 0.39; 90% CI = 0.18-0.87), whereas there was a (statistically insignificant) 51% risk reduction for women in the intervention region, and no risk reduction for either men or women in the reference region. The ratio of the crude IRR for elderly men in the intervention region to that for all elderly men in Japan was estimated at 0.42 (90% CI = 0.18-0.92), showing that the risk reduction was greater than the national change. Conclusions: The management of depression through a combination of an initial survey and subsequent screening holds clear promise for prompt effectiveness in the prevention of suicide for elderly men, and potentially for women.

AB To clarify changes in mental disorder distribution in suicide attempters, a comparison was made between the period when an economic recession started (1992, 1993) and the period when the recession became serious (2000). The subjects were 212 suicide attempters admitted to the Emergency Medical Center of Tokai University Hospital during a 2-year period between 1992 and 1993 (group A) and 255 suicide attempters admitted during a 1-year period between January and December 2000 (group B). Mental disorders were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases (10th revision; ICD-10). Distribution was compared between groups A and B and significant differences were observed in mental disorder distribution (P < 0.001). The percentages of subjects with depression, those with neurotic disorders, and those with other disorders were higher in group B than in group A. Conversely, the percentage of subjects with schizophrenia was lower in group B than in group A. Mental disorder distribution in suicide attempters significantly changed. However, it was not certain that this change was related to the economic recession and increased unemployment in Japan.

AB Introduction Very few studies have explored the adverse effect of psychotropic drugs worldwide.
   Methods This study analyzed 1 813 suicide-related drug reports involving 553 patients collected from the Japanese National Adverse Drug Report Database between October 2001 and January 2012 to investigate psychotropic drugs associated with completed suicide vs. other suicide-related behaviors, including ideation and self-injury. The drugs investigated included antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agents, noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and other drugs.
   Results These reports referenced 300 (54.2 %) individuals who completed suicide. Adjusting for age, sex, and drugs used, the multivariate model revealed that participants who took antipsychotics were 1.70 times (95 % CI, 1.11-2.61) more likely to complete suicide compared with those who did not. All other drugs became non-significant. Compared with those who took only one medication, those prescribed more than 4 drugs were more likely to complete suicide (OR 4.44, 95 % CI, 2.40-8.20).
   Discussion Antipsychotic drugs and polypharmacy may be regarded as predictors of completed suicide.

ID INTOXICATION
AB Sources of information abound in articles and studies more and less scientific on the correlation of blood types with certain diseases. In some countries like Japan, blood types have become a criterion for employment, and they are convinced of the importance of personality traits specific to each blood type. In this paper, we have tried to establish whether there is a correlation between blood types and suicidal predisposition. In a number of 677 suicide deaths from Iasi Institute of Forensic Medicine casuistry between 1996 and 2016, we found that there is a concordance between the proportion of blood types in the general population and their frequency in the cases of achieved suicide. Consequently, we can conclude that there are no objective elements to be able to assert that a certain blood type predisposes the individual to a suicidal act.

ID DEATH
AB This presentation will address the recent rise of suicide deaths resulting from the asphyxiation by hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas.
   Hydrogen sulfide poisoning has been an infrequently encountered cause of death in medical examiner practice. Most H2S deaths that have been reported occurred in association with industrial exposure.
   More recently, H2S has been seen in the commission of suicide, particularly in Japan. Scattered reports of this phenomenon have also appeared in the United States.
   We have recently observed 2 intentional asphyxial deaths in association with H2S. In both cases, the decedents committed suicide in their automobiles. They generated H2S by combining a sulfide-containing tree spray with toilet bowl cleaner (with an active ingredient of hydrogen chloride acid). Both death scenes prompted hazardous materials team responses because of notes attached to the victims' car windows indicating the presence of toxic gas. Autopsy findings included discoloration of lividity and an accentuation of the gray matter of the brain. Toxicology testing confirmed H2S exposure with the demonstration Of high levels of thiosulfate in blood.
   In summary, suicide with H2S appears to be increasing in the United States.

AB In 1932, three Japanese soldiers died in the line of duty during the Shanghai Incident. Battlefield gossip blamed their deaths on incompetence. Sensational newspaper reports lauded them as suicide bombers who crippled the defences of an enemy stronghold with only a Bangalore torpedo and 'pieces of torn flesh.' Hero worship and commercialization followed shortly thereafter. Their alleged exploits inspired books, movies, theatrical performances, political speeches, radio dramas, and popular music. This article is about the Nikudan-san'yushi (Three Heroic Human Bullets) phenomenon, a cultural sensation that penetrated into nearly every corner of Japanese society and which groomed the nation for military extremism.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the sociodemographic characteristics of cancer patients who died by suicide in comparison with cancer-free cases. Suicide data from the Tokyo Medical Examiner's Office from 2009 to 2013 were extracted retrospectively. A total of 503 (5.1%) out of 9841 people who committed suicide had cancer; age ranged from 26 to 97 years. The cancer patients were significantly older than the cancer-free cases. There were significantly more cancer patients with cohabiters than cancer-free cases with cohabiters. Only half of young to middle-aged subjects had a job in both groups. There were significantly more cancer patients who lived on pensions and welfare assistance, and less cancer patients who drink or smoke than those without cancer. Given the high incidence of suicide in elderly cancer patients, healthcare professionals should pay attention for risk even in cancer patients who have cohabiters, benefit from a pension, and do not drink or smoke.

AB BackgroundAlthough a substantial increase in the number of female offenders has drawn interest towards understanding their unique characteristics, few studies have investigated the characteristics of female mentally disordered offenders in Japan and none since the legislation enacted in 2005 in Japan, which provided for special services for them.
   AimsThe aim of this study is to identify those characteristics of people detained under this legislation, which distinguish the women from the men and may indicate special needs among the women.
   MethodsA retrospective records-based study of all patients admitted to one secure unit in the 8years since its opening in July 2005 until a census date of 31 October 2013.
   ResultsThirty-six (15%) of the patients were women. Marriage, mood disorders, past suicide attempts and homicide were more common among the women than the men. Six of the female offender-patients had committed filicides, of which four were infanticides.
   ConclusionThere appears to be a particularly vulnerable sub-group of women with severe mood disorders, a history of serious suicide attempts and young children at risk of harming those children. Our sample was small and from a single unit so, given the potential importance of improving understanding of who is at risk in such circumstances, extending our study nationally seems indicated.

AB IntroductionThis study attempts to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of online broadcasts of suicidality in China.
   MethodsA total of 193 incidents were identified by systematically searching for relevant news reports on the internet. A content analysis on these news reports was conducted to obtain information on the characteristics of each individual incident.
   ResultsOf these incidents, the ratio of males to females was 1:1.7 (age: 24.66.1years old). Approximately 45.4% and 70.8% of incidents were located in the region of Eastern China and Southern China, respectively, and 15.7% of incidents were unemployed. The most common suicide method was wrist cutting (57.5%), and the most common suicide location was at home (35.2%). Instant messaging apps (52.8%) were most frequently used for broadcasting suicidal thoughts and actions. Relationship breakup (61.1%) was reported as the leading cause of suicide. Furthermore, of the 193 incidents, 19 indicated that they suffered from a mental disorder, and 12 revealed that they had a history of suicide attempts. There were significant gender, age, regional, and occupational differences across the categories.
   DiscussionThis study indicates that in China, suicide prevention programmes need to target internet users.

AB Objective: To analyse trends in mortality from suicide over the period 1965 - 99.
   Method: Data were derived from the WHO database, including data for 47 countries.
   Results: In the European Union (EU), all age suicide mortality peaked at 16.1/100 000 in men in 1980 - 84, and declined thereafter to 14.4/ 100 000 in 1995 - 98. In females, the fall was 29% to reach 4.6/100 000. A similar pattern of trends was observed in several eastern European countries. In contrast, mortality from suicide rose substantially in the Russian Federation, from 37.7/100 000 in males in 1985 - 89 to 58.3/ 100 000 in 1995 - 98 (+ 55%), and to 9.5/100 000 (+ 12%) in females. In the USA and most other American countries providing data, no consistent pattern was evident for males, but falls were observed in females. Steady declines were registered for Japan, starting from the highest suicide rates worldwide in the late 1950s. Suicide rates were upwards in Ireland, Italy, Spain, the UK, Cuba, Australia and New Zealand. Substantial rises were observed in a few countries ( Ireland, Cuba, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand) for young males.
   Conclusion: In spite of mixed trends, suicide remains a significant public health problem worldwide.

ID SHARP FORCE; THROAT
AB In the past, self-infliction of sharp force was a classic form of suicide, while in modern times it is quite rare, constituting only 2% to 3% of all self-inflicted deaths. In Japan, the jigai (自害) ritual is a traditional method of female suicide, carried out by cutting the jugular vein using a knife called a tanto. The jigai ritual is the feminine counterpart of seppuku (well-known as harakiri), the ritual suicide of samurai warriors, which was carried out by a deep slash into the abdomen. In contrast to seppuku, jigai can be performed without assistance, which was fundamental for seppuku.
   The case we describe here involves an unusual case of suicide in which the victim was a male devotee of Japanese culture and weapons. He was found dead in his bathtub with a deep slash in the right lateral-cervical area, having cut only the internal jugular vein with a tanto knife, exactly as specified by the jigai ritual.

AB Background: Older adults usually have a higher suicide rate than the general population. There are helpline services provided to older adults but limited studies have examined the suicidal risks among the users, and how those services could be used as a platform to engage older adults in suicide prevention.
   Methods: In regard to elderly suicide prevention, this study explored the potential usefulness and relevance of a telephone helpline service in Hong Kong, which had 106,583 users during 2012-2015. An estimation on the suicide rates of the users was made and compared with the general older adult population in Hong Kong. The users' suicide risks and their associated factors were assessed by survival analyses and an estimation system on the users' suicide mortality likelihood was also tested.
   Results: The suicide rates of both male and female users were more than two times higher than the general older adult population in Hong Kong. The users' risks of suicides were greater at the early period of using the service; men, living alone, and having a history of mental illnesses were also associated with increased risks. Based on the identified factors, an estimation system was developed with a sensitivity of 0.73 and specificity of 0.54.
   Limitations: A secondary data analysis.
   Conclusions: By identifying a suicide risk profile and distinct telephone calling pattern among the users, early detection and a warning system should be implemented to allow timely intervention to reduce the number of older adult suicides in the community.

AB Background: Suicide attempts are frequently encountered by emergency department nurses. Such encounters can potentially provide a foundation for secondary suicide prevention. Aims: The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of a 7-hr training program for emergency room nursing personnel in Japan. Method: In all, 52 nurses completed the questionnaires before the workshop and 1 month after the workshop. The nurses' understanding of and willingness to care for suicidal patients positively changed. Results: It is feasible to provide a 7-hr, relatively short, workshop on suicidal prevention aimed at emergency medical staff and to improve attitudes during a follow-up of 1 month. Conclusion: It is uncertain whether the positive attitudes of emergency nurses toward suicide and/or educational interventions could impact the outcomes of these interventions. Further studies are needed to address these important questions in this field.

AB The association between many psychosocial factors and risk of suicide was examined. A cohort was conducted over 14 years of follow up among the general population (15,597 people) in Japan. A baseline survey of psychosocial characteristics was conducted by self-administrated questionnaire. The relative risks of occasional emotional stress, difficulty maintaining sleep, and reporting unhealthy as their self-rated health are 3.2 (95% CI: 1.3, 7.6), 2.4 (95% CI: 1.3, 4.3) and 2.6 (95% CI: 1.1, 6.2), respectively. The importance of these observations lie in its potential for improving physician and public awareness of psychosocial factors as an early indication of mental health morbidity.

AB Background: Previous studies in Eastern as well as Western countries have shown a relationship between marital status and suicide mortality. However, to date, no Korean study has calculated national suicide rates by marital status for specific genders, ages, and education levels. This study investigated whether the relationship between marital status and suicide differs by age, gender, and educational attainment, and analyzed the effect of marital status on suicide risk after controlling for these socio-demographic variables.
   Methods: Using national mortality data from 2015, and aggregated census data from 2010 in South Korea, we created a virtually individualized dataset with multiple weighting algorithms, including individual socio-demographic characteristics and suicide rates across the entire population.
   Results: The findings show that the following groups faced the highest relative suicide risks: 1) divorced men of all ages and men aged more than 75 years, particularly divorced men aged more than 75; and 2) never-married men aged 55-64 years, and never-married women of lower education status.
   Limitations: We did not account for important variables such as mental health, substance abuse, employment insecurity, social integration, perceived loneness, and family income which we were unable to access.
   Conclusions: This current research extends prior theoretical and methodological work on suicide, aiding efforts to reduce suicide mortality in South Korea.

AB Suicidality in patients with schizophrenia is high. To clarify the characteristics of suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia, we investigated suicide attempters with schizophrenia spectrum disorders in comparison with patients with mood disorders. One hundred patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and 155 patients with mood disorders admitted to an emergency department after a suicide attempt were interviewed in detail on items concerning 1) demographic characteristics, 2) previous suicidal behavior, and 3) index suicidal behavior. Differences between the two groups were subsequently analyzed. Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders showed a lower incidence of previous deliberate self-harm, and a higher incidence of a subsequent suicide attempt more than 1 year after the previous suicide attempt as well as a higher lethality of index suicide attempt compared to patients with mood disorders. Furthermore, the most common motive for making a suicide attempt in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders was having a mental problem. This study revealed the factors associated with suicide attempts among Japanese patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and the nature of these factors makes it difficult to predict future attempts. This makes clear the importance of continuous long-term follow-up with careful attention to the mental symptoms and psychological burden for such patients. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background
   Suicide has been a leading cause of death among young adult populations in Japan. The aim of this study was to predict major depressive episodes (MDEs) and suicide-related ideation among university students using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI).
   Methods
   The subjects were 2194 university students who completed the PHQ-9 and TCI in the 1st year (T1) and the PHQ-9 in the 4th year (T2) of university. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to predict MDEs and suicide-related ideation at T2. Moreover, recursive partitioning analyses were conducted to reveal the future risk of MDEs and suicide-related ideation.
   Results
   The multiple logistic regression analyses of MDEs and suicide-related ideation at T2 revealed that depressive episodes, suicide-related ideation, and low self-directedness(SD) scores at T1 were significant predictors. The area under the curve of the model for MDEs was 0.858 and that for suicide-related ideation was 0.741. The recursive partitioning analyses revealed that a PHQ-9 summary score >= 15 at T1 predicted a high risk of MDEs at T2 and that both a PHQ-9 summary score >= 5 and a PHQ-9 #9 score >= 1 predicted a high risk of suicide-related ideation at T2.
   Conclusions
   MDEs, suicide-related ideation, and low SD scores are significant predictors of future MDEs and suicide-related ideation.

AB Objective: Despite the wealth of research investigating the association of unemployment with suicide in the West, few studies have investigated the association in non-Western countries. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between secular trends in unemployment and suicide in Taiwan.
   Study design: Time-series analysis.
   Methods: Overall and age-specific suicide rates (1959-2007) for Taiwanese men and women aged 15 years or above were calculated from national population and mortality statistics. The association of secular trends in unemployment with suicide was investigated graphically and using time-series modelling (Prais-Winsten regression).
   Results: Rises in unemployment were associated with an increase in male suicide rates, but evidence for an association in females was limited. In the model controlling for changes in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, GDP growth, divorce and female labour force participation, for every 1% rise in unemployment, male suicide rates increased by 3.1 (95% confidence interval 1.4-4.8) per 100,000. There is no evidence for a difference in the strength of association between men of different ages.
   Conclusion: Trends in suicide, particularly for adult males, appear to be influenced by unemployment. The results have implications for suicide prevention, in particular for societies facing acute rises in unemployment during recessions. (C) 2009 The Royal Society for Public Health.

AB BackgroundNational Health Insurance (NHI), launched in 1995 in Taiwan, lightens patient's financial burdens but its effect on the suicide risk in cancer patients is unclear. We aimed to investigate the impacts of the NHI on the suicide in newly diagnosed cancer patients.
   MethodsWe identified patients with newly diagnosed cancer from the nationwide Taiwan Cancer Registration from 1985 to 2007, and ascertained suicide deaths from the national database of registered deaths between 1985 and 2009. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of suicide risk among patients with cancer was calculated, and the suicide risk ratios were examined by gender, age group, and prognosis.
   ResultsFor the 916337 registered cancer patients with 4300953 person-years, 2543 died by suicide, with a suicide rate of 59.1 per 100000 person-years. Compared to the general population, cancer patients had an SMR of 2.47 for suicide, with a higher figure for males (2.73), age 45 to 64 (2.89), and cancer of poor prognosis (3.19). The suicide risk was highest in the first 2years after the initial diagnosis. Comparing the cohorts of the period before (1985 to 1992) and after (1996 to 2007) the launch of NHI, we saw a reduction in the SMR within the first 2years after cancer diagnosis (20%), with more prominent reduction for females (29%), age under 45 (69%), and cancer of good prognosis (33%).
   ConclusionsA universal health coverage relieving both physical and psychological distress may account for the post-NHI reduction of immediate suicide risk in patients of newly diagnosed cancer.

AB Japan's homicide rate dropped 70% in the last 50 years, and the nation now has one of the lowest homicide rates in the world. A decline of this magnitude has been documented in few other contemporary social settings. One key feature of the fall is young Japanese males, who now commit one tenth as many homicides as their counterparts did in 1955. At present, Japan's homicide rate is higher among men in their 50s than among males aged 20 to 24. This article describes Japan's postwar homicide decline and the vanishing young killer in particular. More is known about who is responsible for the decline than about what has caused it. The search for a more satisfying explanation of Japan's homicide drop should be a high priority in homicide studies.

AB Background:
   The loss of social support is one of the major risk factors for suicide. However, there are few empirical studies that have examined how a person's suicide ideation relates to their social support.
   Aims:
   To examine the relationship between social support and suicidal ideation.
   Methods:
   Self-report questionnaires were sent to 2,200 randomly selected adults in Japan. The questionnaire inquired the participants about the severity of suicidal ideation, the details of current perceived social support and their degree of satisfaction with this social support. Social support and related indicators were compared among three groups of participants that varied in severity of suicidal ideation.
   Results:
   People in the group that had suicide ideation during their lives reported receiving significantly less support from their family and had greater feelings of dissatisfaction with that support than those in the other groups. Furthermore, people who had suicide ideation during the month immediately preceding the survey reported providing less support to their family, relatives or friends, as well as receiving less support from family than other groups, and having stronger feelings of dissatisfaction with social support.
   Conclusion:
   Our study identified a strong relationship between the severity of suicidal ideation and perceived social support.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine whether there were any differences in responses to patients with suicidal ideation among specialties in general hospitals.
   Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire study was conducted in 2007. The subjects of the Study were chief physicians at 75 emergency departments, 69 internal medicine departments and 154 psychiatry departments in 161 general hospitals with psychiatric beds in Japan.
   Results: The physicians in internal and emergency medicine reported making arrangements for needed counseling services and recommending to patients that they talk to the people around them, whereas those in psychiatric departments reported asking patients to promise not to commit suicide (no-suicide contract) and making a next appointment for them.
   Conclusions: Internists and emergency physicians are likely to take different approaches when responding 10 patients With suicidal ideation than psychiatrists. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Aim Some previous studies have shown a positive relation between geomagnetic disturbances and an increased incidence of suicide. If such a relation exists, stronger geomagnetic fields may affect the number of suicides, because stronger geomagnetic fields generally cause larger geomagnetic field disturbances. Therefore, we here investigated the relation between local geomagnetic field magnetic flux density and the standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) for suicide by each prefecture in Japan. Methods Monthly suicide data for each prefecture in the period January 1999 to December 2008 was obtained, and it was found that a total of 216171 male individuals and 85154 female individuals committed suicide during this period. A multiple linear regression analysis was carried out with a backward elimination procedure. The SMR for suicide by each prefecture was taken as the response variable and the explanatory variables were each prefecture's local geomagnetic field magnetic flux density (nT), north latitude (degrees), monthly mean unemployment rate (%), monthly mean air pressure (hPa), monthly mean air temperature (degrees C), monthly mean humidity (%), and monthly total day length (hours). Analyses were carried out separately for each sex. Results In the multiple linear regression analysis for male subjects, the local geomagnetic field magnetic flux density (nT), monthly mean unemployment rate (%), and monthly mean humidity (%) were associated with the incidence of suicide, but in the multiple linear regression analysis of female subjects, only north latitude was associated with that. Conclusion In this study, we generated a hypothesis that stronger geomagnetic fields affect the number of cases of male suicide.

AB We performed detailed analysis of nickel suicide discontinuities induced by agglomeration, which causes the increased electric resistance in high-performance complementary metal oxide semiconductor devices, by using advanced physical analysis techniques: transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (S EM) electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis, and three-dimensional atom-probe (AP) analysis. We confirmed that the agglomeration of the nickel suicide is related to elongated-triangular-shaped splits, which cause discontinuities that occur at low-angle grain boundaries pinned by boron clusters even with small stress. We successfully determined the formation mechanism of these nickel suicide discontinuities in detail. (C) 2014 The Japan Society of Applied Physics

AB The authors report a case of suicide by hydrogen sulfide in Australia. A young woman was located in a car wearing protective eye-wear. A tub of foamy yellow substance and a quantity of hydrochloric acid and lime sulfur were also located in the rear of the vehicle. Morphological findings at autopsy were nonspecific. Toxicologic analysis of a specimen of leg blood detected elevated levels of methemoglobin.
   If Australia follows a similar trend to Japan and the United States, it is possible that incidences of such cases will rise, probably because of Internet dissemination. From a public health perspective, emergency service providers and forensic case workers should be aware of the potential hazards to themselves and others when dealing with such cases.

AB To explore whether the 'hikikomori' syndrome (social withdrawal) described in Japan exists in other countries, and if so, how patients with the syndrome are diagnosed and treated.
   Two hikikomori case vignettes were sent to psychiatrists in Australia, Bangladesh, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the USA. Participants rated the syndrome's prevalence in their country, etiology, diagnosis, suicide risk, and treatment.
   Out of 247 responses to the questionnaire (123 from Japan and 124 from other countries), 239 were enrolled in the analysis. Respondents' felt the hikikomori syndrome is seen in all countries examined and especially in urban areas. Biopsychosocial, cultural, and environmental factors were all listed as probable causes of hikikomori, and differences among countries were not significant. Japanese psychiatrists suggested treatment in outpatient wards and some did not think that psychiatric treatment is necessary. Psychiatrists in other countries opted for more active treatment such as hospitalization.
   Patients with the hikikomori syndrome are perceived as occurring across a variety of cultures by psychiatrists in multiple countries. Our results provide a rational basis for study of the existence and epidemiology of hikikomori in clinical or community populations in international settings.

AB Objective: It is important to prevent patients with suicidal ideation from actually attempting suicide. A school based cohort study suggested that auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) might play an important role in driving young people with mental health problems to attempt suicide. However, no clinical study to date has specifically investigated the association between AVHs and suicide attempts among young patients with suicidal ideation.
   Method: We conducted a cross-sectional study of first-visit psychiatric referrals aged 10-15 years at two general child and adolescent mental health hospitals in Japan. We administered self-reported questionnaires to measure suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, AVHs, and depression in the two weeks prior to the date of first-visit.
   Results: Among 188 patients with suicidal ideation, the presence of AVHs was associated with increased odds of suicide attempts (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.7-6.9; p < 0.05); however, depression was not associated with a significant change of odds (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.4-1.3; p = 0.29).
   Conclusions: AVHs may increase the risk of suicide attempts made by adolescents with suicidal ideation. Clinicians should consider AVHs when adolescent patients present with suicidal ideation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Over the past 20 years the WHO has considerably improved world mortality data. There are still shortcomings but more countries now report data and world-wide estimates are regularly made. Methods: Data about mortality have been retrieved from the WHO world database. Worldwide injury mortality estimates for 2008 as well as trends of the suicide rate from 1950 to 2009 were analysed. Results: Suicides in the world amount to 782 thousand in 2008 according to the WHO estimate, which is 1.4% of total mortality and 15% of injury mortality. The suicide rate for the world as a whole is estimated at 11.6 per 100,000 inhabitants. The male-female rate ratio of suicide is estimated to be highest in the European Region (4.0) and the lowest in the Eastern Mediterranean region (1.1). Among males the highest suicide rate in the 15-29 age group is in the SE Asian region, in the 45-59 age group in European males and for ages above 60 in the Western Pacific region. Females from SE Asia have a remarkably high suicide rate among 15-29-year-olds and from age 45 in the Western Pacific region. The leading country is currently Lithuania, with a suicide rate of 34.1 per 100,000 inhabitants. Also among males the suicide rate is the highest in Lithuania at 61.2. Among females South Korea with 22.1 is at the top of world suicide rates. Conclusions: During the past six decades, according to the WHO Japan, Hungary, and Lithuania have topped the list of world countries by suicide rate, but if the current trends continue South Korea will overtake all others in a few years. The heart of the problem of suicide mortality has shifted from Western Europe to Eastern Europe and now seems to be shifting to Asia. China and India are the biggest contributors to the absolute number of suicides in the world.

AB Objective: Asian culture venerates elderly people. It was hypothesized that elderly suicides would be proportionately lower in Asian societies than in English-speaking countries (ESC).
   Method: Elderly (i.e. aged 75 years or more) to general population suicide ratios were compared for six Asian societies and six ESC. based upon the latest 5-year suicide rates.
   Results: Males: The general population suicide rate was highest in rural China (227 per million) and third highest in Japan (217 per million), but other countries with high rates were all ESC (ranging from 224 to 198 per million). Asian countries had the six highest elderly suicide rates, 1327-1373 per million, whilst the highest ESC elderly rate was in the United States (507 per million). Asian societies had the widest range of elderly/general ratios, ranging from 6.62 to 2.6. Females: The overall suicide rates were higher in Asian countries (5795 per million) than in ESC (40-56 per million). Asian elderly suicide rates differed (932 per million in rural China to 154 per million in Korea) but the highest ESC rate was in Australia (76 per million). The Asian countries elderly/general ratios ranged from 5.82 : 1 to 2.70 : 1, but the widest ESC ratio was 1.71 : 1, in the United Kingdom.
   Conclusion: There is a need for country-specific prevention measures in elderly people, and particularly for older women in Asian countries.

DE Seppuku; Suicide; Self-stabbing abdominal wounds; Psychiatric disorders
ID HARA-KIRI; CLINICAL-FEATURES; STAB WOUNDS
AB Seppuku is a traditional suicide method practiced by honorable Japanese samurai. Today this method of suicide is rarely used in Japan or worldwide and may be exceptionally encountered in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders, the majority of them being older men. It is well known that clinical and cultural factors also play a role in practicing this method of suicide. The mortality rate is significantly higher in cases of abdominal wounds suggesting seppuku, compared to the mortality rate caused by simple stab wounds. Death can occur immediately through massive external or/and internal hemorrhage as well as later on through complications, often septic. In the Romanian forensic literature files, suicide by abdominal stabbing suggesting seppuku is rarely encountered and documented. When investigating violent deaths owing to sharp force, the role of the forensic pathologist is not only to establish the cause of death and the mechanism used for creating the lesions, but also to identify the object used for inflicting the injuries, the type of the injuries, allowing thus to formulate a conclusion from legal perspective upon the act itself: suicide or homicide? The present paper reviews the international literature and presents three cases of suicide by self- inflected abdominal stab wounds suggesting seppuku, autopsied at the Bihor County Forensic Service, Romania, during 2013-2017.

AB Recent reports suggest a lifetime suicide risk for schizophrenia patients of approximately 5%. This figure is significantly higher than the general population suicide risk consequently, detection of those at risk is clinically important. This study was undertaken to define the characteristics of suicide attempts by schizophrenia patients compared with attempts by patients with mood disorders. All patients were diagnosed using the ICD-10 criteria. The study population comprised 65 patients with F2 disorders (schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders), i.e., "the F2 group'', and 94 patients with F3 disorders (mood disorders), i.e., "the F3 group'', who presented in the clinical setting of consultation-liaison psychiatry. The F2 group had a significantly younger mean age and significantly higher ratios of 'past/present psychiatric treatment' and 'more than 3 months interruption of psychiatric treatment'. In contrast, the ratios of 'physical disorder comorbidity', 'alcohol intake at suicide attempt' and 'suicide note left behind' were significantly higher in the F3 group. The F2 group attempted suicide by significantly more serious methods. Furthermore, 'hallucination-delusion' was the most prevalent motive in the F2 group and was the only factor that showed a significant association with the seriousness of the method of suicide attempt (OR = 3.36, 95% CI: 1.05-11.33).

AB Background: Associations between nuclear disasters and suicide have been examined to a limited extent. Aim: To clarify the suicide rates in evacuation areas after the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, which occurred in March 2011. Method: This descriptive study used monthly data from vital statistics between March 2009 and December 2015. Suicide rates in areas to which evacuation orders had been issued. requiring across-the-board, compulsory evacuation of residents from the entire or part of municipalities, were obtained and compared with the national average. Results: Male suicide rates in evacuation areas increased significantly immediately after the disaster, and then began to increase again 4 years after the disaster. Female suicide rates declined slightly during the first year and then increased significantly over the subsequent 3-year period. Moreover, male rates in areas where evacuation orders were issued for the total area declined over the course of approximately 2 years, but then began to increase thereafter. Analysis by age revealed postdisaster male rates in evacuation areas decreased for those aged 50-69 years and increased for those aged <= 29 years and >= 70 years. Limitations: The number of suicides among females and the female population in the evacuation area was small. Conclusion: Our findings suggest the need to keep in mind that, when providing post-disaster mental health services, suicide rates can eventually increase even if they initially decrease.

AB Objectives This study aims at designing and piloting a convenient Chinese webpage suicide information mining system (SIMS) to help search and filter required data from the internet and discover potential features and trends of suicide.
   Methods SIMS utilizes Microsoft Visual Studio2008, SQL2008 and C# as development tools. It collects webpage data via popular search engines; cleans the data using trained models plus minimum manual help; translates the cleaned texts into quantitative data through models and supervised fuzzy recognition; analyzes and visualizes related variables by self-programmed algorithms.
   Results The SIMS developed comprises such functions as suicide news and blogs collection, data filtering, cleaning, extraction and translation, data analysis and presentation. SIMS-mediated mining of one-year webpage revealed that: peak months and hours of web-reported suicide events were June-July and 10-11 am respectively, and the lowest months and hours, September-October and 1-7 am; suicide reports came mostly from Soho, Tecent, Sina etc.; male suicide victims over counted female victims in most sub-regions but southwest China; homes, public places and rented houses were the top three places to commit suicide; poisoning, cutting vein and jumping from building were the most commonly used methods to commit suicide; love disputes, family disputes and mental diseases were the leading causes.
   Conclusions SIMS provides a preliminary and supplementary means for monitoring and understanding suicide. It proposes useful aspects as well as tools for analyzing the features and trends of suicide using data derived from Chinese webpages. Yet given the intrinsic "dual nature" of internet-based suicide information and the tremendous difficulties experienced by ourselves and other researchers, there is still a long way to go for us to expand, refine and evaluate the system.

TI Negotiating the "good death": Japanese ambivalence about new ways to die
SO ETHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID EUTHANASIA; AMERICAN; SUICIDE
AB New technologies and new interpretations of the relation between the individual and society in postindustrial countries have led to an expanded set of options for how to die, including hospice, euthanasia, and physician-assisted suicide. This study claims that the ambivalence among ordinary people toward these new ways to die is best understood through the thick description of in-depth ethnographic research. In Japan, inconsistencies in policies, mixed cultural messages, and personal experience all contribute to ambivalence about what constitutes a good death. While bioethics attempts to label such ambivalence as confusion or cultural tag, this article argues that it must be seen in the context of the negotiation of social roles and relationships. Data are drawn from a qualitative study, based on observation and interviews, of end-of-life decision-making conducted in urban Japan in 1996.

   mortality ratio
ID DIAGNOSIS; RISK; MEN; DEPRESSION; MORTALITY; JAPAN; DEATH
AB Objective: We conducted this study to examine the rate of suicide in patients with gastric cancer and to identify factors associated with increased risk of suicide using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database.
   Methods: The database was queried for patients who were diagnosed with gastric cancer from 1998 to 2011. The rate of suicide and standardized mortality ratio were calculated. Multivariable analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with increased risk of suicide.
   Results: A total of 65 535 patients with 109 597 person-years of follow-up were included. A total of 68 patients died of suicide. The age-adjusted rate of suicide was 34.6 per 100 000 person-years (standardized mortality ratios, 4.07; 95% confidence interval, 3.18-5.13). The rate of suicide was highest within the first 3 months after cancer diagnosis (standardized mortality ratios, 67.67; 95% confidence interval, 40.74-106.15). Results of multivariable analyses showed that male sex (incidence rate ratio, 7.15; 95% confidence interval, 3.05-16.78; P < 0.0001), White race (incidence rate ratio, 3.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-10.35; P = 0.0491), unmarried status (incidence rate ratio, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-3.30; P = 0.0060) and distant stage disease (incidence rate ratio, 2.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.72-4.92; P < 0.0001) were significantly associated with increased risk of suicide.
   Conclusions: Patients with gastric cancer have an similar to 4-fold higher risk of suicide compared with the general US population. The suicide risk is highest within the first 3 months after diagnosis. Male sex, White race, unmarried status and distant stage disease are significantly associated with increased risk of suicide.

ID ALCOHOL; HEALTH; JOB; CONSUMPTION; DISORDERS; STRESS
AB To improve the management of depression and the prevention of suicide, we investigated associations between lifestyle, working environment, depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. Variables measured included job stressors, working hours, overtime work, smoking status, alcohol consumption, sleep, exercise, meals, and family factors. Original items were used to measure working on holidays, number of confidants, use of stress reduction techniques, and suicidal ideation. A total of 4,118 employees (2,834 men, 1,284 women) in eleven cities and districts across Japan were analyzed. On stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis, variables associated with depressive symptoms were exposure to high job stress, problem drinking, a feeling of insufficient sleep, absence of confidants, and no use of stress reduction techniques in both sexes. Further, problem drinking and absence of confidants were associated with suicidal ideation in both sexes. The prevalence of workers who had no confidants and who did not use stress reduction techniques was unexpectedly high. Given their clear association with depressive symptoms, greater attention to these factors should improve measures aimed at the prevention of suicide.

TI TOKYO'S COMMUTER TRAIN SUICIDES AND THE SOCIETY OF EMERGENCE
SO CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE [Japan; suicide; technology; trains; artificial life; cybernetics;
   emergence; biopolitics; chaos theory; infrastructure; smart systems]
AB This article considers the treatment of commuter train suicides in Tokyo's commuter train network in an effort to think critically about the lived experience mediated by theories of emergence materialized through smart infrastructures. In so doing, it embarks from the question of how the commuter train network thinks the disorder of the commuter suicide in relation to how the network has been restructured in recent decades to handle irregularity as regular. This restructuring, I demonstrate, works to corporealize the network in accordance with an understanding of the body as a paradigm of decentralized complex emergence, which is a concept with roots in cybernetics and artificial life but which has also been adopted in recent political theory to rationalize social, economic, and environmental instability. Materialized in the commuter train network, this concept asks us to think the system as a kind of machinic life that,while generating the potential for new forms of value creation, potentiallyencourages the experience of commuter suicides as a necessary and recursive process of metabolic renewal within a totalizing system.

AB Objective: To investigate the association between serum total cholesterol (TC) and suicide using a large general population cohort with long follow-up times.
   Method: Analyses included 16 341 men and 28 905 women aged 40-69 from the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study followed from 1990 to 2012. TC levels were defined per clinical guidelines: low (< 4.66 mmol/l [180 mg/dl]), normal (4.66-5.70 mmol/l [180-220 mg/dl]), and high (>= 5.70 mmol/l [220 mg/dl]). Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to determine hazard ratios (HR) and confidence intervals (CI) for suicide according to TC level. Mean follow-up time was 19 years for men and 20 years for women.
   Results: There were 185 suicides (men: 107; women: 78) during followup. Compared to women with normal TC, women with high TC had a significantly increased risk of suicide (HR = 1.90, 95% CI, 1.13-3.19). Incremental increases (0.26 mmol/l [10 mg/dl]) of low-density lipoprotein (HR = 1.11, 95% CI, 1.02-1.21) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HR = 1.09, 95% CI, 1.01-1.18) were also associated with increased risk of suicide in women. There was no association between TC levels, or lipid fractions, and suicide in men.
   Conclusion: High TC levels may be associated with an increased risk of suicide in women.

AB To clarify the prevalence of depression in a rural community in Japan and to evaluate the social and familial risk factors for depression, with the goal of suicide prevention, a questionnaire survey was conducted on a total of 2,763 elderly persons. The determined prevalence of depressive symptoms (Zung's self-rated depression scale score of 50 points or more) was 10.4%. Logistic regression analysis showed associations between depressive symptoms and age, absence of a friendly companion, irritation with one's family, frequent loneliness, the opinion that stress has a large impact on one's life, suicide ideation, and poor subjective physical and mental health.

AB Background: Suicide is a crucial global health concern and effective suicide prevention has long been warranted. Mental illness, especially depression is the highest risk factor of suicide. Suicidal risk is increased in people not only with mental illness but also with physical illnesses, thus medical staff caring for physically-ill patients are also required to manage people with suicidal risk. In the present study, we evaluated our newly developed suicide intervention program among medical staff.
   Methods: We developed a 2-h suicide intervention program for medical staff, based on the Mental Health First Aid (MHFA), which had originally been developed for the general population. We conducted this program for 74 medical staff members from 2 hospitals. Changes in knowledge, perceived skills, and confidence in early intervention of depression and suicide-prevention were evaluated using self-reported questionnaires at 3 points; pre-program, immediately after the program, and 1 month after program.
   Results: This suicide prevention program had significant effects on improving perceived skills and confidence especially among nurses and medical residents. These significant effects lasted even 1 month after the program.
   Limitations: Design was a single-arm study with relatively small sample size and short-term follow up.
   Conclusions: The present study suggests that the major target of this effective program is nurses and medical residents. Future research is required to validate the effects of the program with control groups, and also to assess long-term effectiveness and actual reduction in suicide rates.

AB This paper reports the results of a comparative investigation of attitudes to suicide and suicidal persons in 5,572 university students from 12 countries. Participants filled out two scales measuring attitudes towards suicide and suicidal persons, a measure of psychological distress together with the questions about suicidal behavior. Results showed that the highest suicide acceptance scores were observed in Austrian, UK, Japanese and Saudi Arabian samples and the lowest scores were noted in Tunisian, Turkish, Iranian and Palestinian samples. While the highest social acceptance scores for a suicidal friend were noted in Turkish, US, Italian and Tunisian samples, the lowest scores were seen in Japanese, Saudi Arabian, Palestinian and Jordanian samples. Compared to participants with a suicidal past, those who were never suicidal displayed more internal barriers against suicidal behavior. Men were more accepting of suicide than women but women were more willing to help an imagined suicidal peer. Participants with accepting attitudes towards suicide but rejecting attitudes towards suicidal persons reported more suicidal behavior and psychological distress, and were more often from high suicide rate countries and samples than their counterparts. They are considered to be caught in a fatal trap in which most predominant feelings of suicidality such as hopelessness or helplessness are likely to occur. We conclude that in some societies such as Japan and Saudi Arabia it might be difficult for suicidal individuals to activate and make use of social support systems.

AB Objective: The aim of the study was to analyze the properties of 2334 cases who applied to North Cyprus Nicosia Burhan Nalbantoglu State Hospital with suicide attempts by drug intoxication in 11 years. Methods: This study has been conducted by analyzing age, gender and suicide attempts dates of the files of 2334 cases retrospectively, who applied to Cyprus Nicosia Burhan Nalbantoglu State Hospital with suicide attempts by drug intoxication between years 2012-2012. Results: 64.1% (n=1497) of patients were female and 35.9% (n=837) were male. The female/male ratio was 1.79. The mean age of women and male patients were 25.80 +/- 11.36 and 27.94 +/- 12.44 respectively. The mean age of women compared with men was statistically significant low. Women attempted suicide more often between ages 16-22, this range was 18-24 for men and 18-22 for whole subjects. When we analyze all subjects together age range was 12-92, mean age was 26.57 +/-+/- 11.80. The numbers of suicide attempts were 183 in 2002, 158 in 2003 and started to increase by 2004. Conclusion: The female/male ratio was 1.79 of suicide attempts similar to Japan data. The difference of Cypriot sample may be related with higher employment ratios in women and less stressful life events in a small island. The lower mean age of this sample compared with the literature might be related with low coping styles, hopelessness and despair of young people in negative life events. One of the possible causes of the beginning of increase in suicide numbers in 2004 can be the results of the referendum.

AB Background: Since the mid-1990s concerns have been raised regarding the possible links between suicide and the Internet, especially among adolescents and young adults. Aims: To identify the nature and extent of the scientific publications, especially original research studies, on suicide and the Internet, and to investigate how the field has developed over time. In particular, this mapping study looks at types of publications, topic areas, focus of original research papers, and suicide-related variables of interest in publications. Method: A search of three major databases (PubMED, PsycINFO, and Sociological Abstracts) was conducted to identify papers published until the end of January 2015. Results: The study identified 237 publications on suicide and the Internet published from 1997 to the end of January 2015. These included 122 original research papers. The three most frequent topic areas covered in publications were searching for information on suicide, online interventions, and online suicide-related behaviors. The online mediums most frequently studied were online forums/message boards, search engines, intervention and information websites, and social media. Limitations: The mapping study did not include an analysis of results of research studies and did not assess their quality. Conclusion: The field is rapidly evolving, as seen in the recent increase in the number of publications. However, there are gaps in terms of the countries where research is conducted and the coverage of topics.

AB Objective. Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for one-third of suicides worldwide, but few studies have investigated the national epidemiology of pesticide suicide in countries where it is a commonly used method. We investigated trends in pesticide suicide, and factors associated with such trends, in Taiwan, a rapidly developing East Asian country. Methods. We conducted an ecological study using graphical approaches and Spearman's correlation coefficients to examine trends in pesticide suicide (1987-2010) in Taiwan in relation to pesticide sales, bans on selected pesticides, the proportion of the workforce involved in agriculture and unemployment. We compared pesticide products banned by the Taiwanese government with products that remained on the market and pesticides that accounted for the most poisoning deaths in Taiwan. Results. Age-standardised rates of pesticide suicide showed a 67% reduction from 7.7 per 100,000 (42% of all suicides) in 1987 to 2.5 per 100,000 (12% of all suicides) in 2010, in contrast to a 69% increase in suicide rates by other methods. Pesticide poisoning was the most commonly used method of suicide in 1987 but had become the third most common method by 2010. The reduction was paralleled by a 66% fall in the workforce involved in agriculture but there was no strong evidence for its association with trends in pesticide sales, bans on selected pesticide products or unemployment. The bans mostly post-dated the decline in pesticide suicides; furthermore, they did not include products (e.g. paraquat) that accounted for most deaths and were mainly restricted to selected high-strength formulated products whilst their equivalent low-strength products were not banned. Conclusions. Access to pesticides, indicated by the size of agricultural workforce, appears to influence trends in pesticide suicide in Taiwan. Targeted bans on pesticides should focus on those products that account for most deaths.

AB Background Socioeconomic inequality in health has been a major concern in public health. This study examined socioeconomic inequality in regional mortality and the impact on inequality by cause of deaths in 1973-1977 and 1993-1998 using municipal statistics in Japan.
   Methods The municipalities across the country (N = 3244 in 1973-1977 and 3334 in 1993-1998) were classified into quintiles according to the index of socioeconomic position (SEP) obtained by principal component analysis of municipal indicators related to income and education. Mortality gradient by SEP for selected major causes of death in the population aged 0-74 years was examined using standardized mortality ratio by quintile and rate ratio of mortality across quintiles. As a measure of cause-specific impact on inequality, the number of excess deaths from each cause in the lower four SEP quintiles compared with the highest quintile was calculated.
   Results Mortality gradient by SEP and excess deaths in the lower SEP quintiles due to injury and suicide markedly increased from 1973-1977 to 1993-1998 for both males and females. In contrast, stroke, especially cerebral haemorrhage, showed a decrease in mortality gradient and excess deaths. For females in 1993-1998, a negative gradient of mortality by SEP was found, and cancer contributed the higher all-cause mortality in the higher SEP quintile.
   Conclusions The relative importance of socioeconomic inequality in regional mortality of stroke decreased, while that of injury and suicide increased. The prevention of injury and suicide, in addition to stroke, in socioeconomically disadvantaged regions, and cancer in urban areas with higher SEP should be given priority.

AB To evaluate how the suddenness and unnaturalness of death affect general health, depression, and grief, a total of 215 responses to a questionnaire from the bereaved were analyzed. The respondents were divided into five groups: bereaved by suicide, accident, acute illness (<1 day from onset), shorter illness (< 1 year from onset), and longer illness. Every sudden-death group indicated averages higher than the clinical threshold on general health scale and depression scale. After statistically controlling for respondents' age, the deceased's age at death, and the months spent with the deceased, differences among groups appeared on all but the subscales of somatic symptoms and of anxiety and insomnia. The difference seemed more apparent on emotional reaction than on physical distress. On pairwise tests suicide was found to be the most distinctive bereavement.

DE human development; suicide; public health; holistic medicine; Denmark;
   Israel
AB Suicide has been honoured and respected in the Eastern culture, especially in Japan, with the famous tradition of Hara-kiri, or seppuku, while in most western societies suicide has been seen negatively. Many contemporary physicians tend to consider suicide the most self-destructive and evil thing a human being can do and something that should be avoided at all cost. Religions also have different viewpoints on suicide, but from a philosophical point of view we believe that considering the choice of life and death to be extremely relevant for a good living. The choice of life and dead is real, since responsibility for life is necessary in order to live life. Even the best physician cannot keep a patient alive who deep inside wants to die. In this chapter, we present parts of a story of a young girl who had experienced childhood sexual abuse. In holistic existential therapy, it is our experience that when the patient is well supported in the confrontation of the fundamental questions related to assuming responsibility for the coherence, that this confrontation will then almost always lead to a big YES to life. Without confronting the fundamental question of "to be or not to be", life can never be chosen 100% and thus never be lived fully.

AB This paper attempts to examine how social trust influences human capital formation using prefectural level data in Japan. To this end, I constructed a proxy for social trust, based on the Japanese General Social Surveys. After controlling for socioeconomic factors, I found that social trust plays an important role in reducing the rate of long-term truancy in primary and junior high school. Results suggest that social trust improves educational quality. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Assertive case management versus enhanced usual care for people with

AB Background Non-fatal suicide attempt is the most important risk factor for later suicide. Emergency department visits for attempted suicide are increasingly recognised as opportunities for intervention. However, no strong evidence exists that any intervention is effective at preventing repeated suicide attempts. We aimed to investigate whether assertive case management can reduce repetition of suicide attempts in people with mental health problems who had attempted suicide and were admitted to emergency departments.
   Methods In this multicentre, randomised controlled trial in 17 hospital emergency departments in Japan, we randomly assigned people aged 20 years and older with mental health problems who had attempted suicide to receive either assertive case management (based on psychiatric diagnoses, social risks, and needs of the patients) or enhanced usual care (control), using an internet-based randomisation system. Interventions were provided until the end of the follow-up period (ie, at least 18 months and up to 5 years). Outcome assessors were masked to group allocation, but patients and case managers who provided the interventions were not. The primary outcome was the incidence of first recurrent suicidal behaviour (attempted suicide or completed suicide); secondary outcomes included completed suicide and all-cause mortality. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00736918) and UMIN-CTR (C000000444).
   Findings Between July 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2009, 914 eligible participants were randomly assigned, 460 to the assertive case management group and 456 to the enhanced usual care group. We noted no significant difference in incidence of first recurrent suicidal behaviour between the assertive case management group and the enhanced usual care group over the full study period (log-rank p=0.258). Because the proportional hazards assumption did not hold, we did ad-hoc analyses for cumulative incidence of the primary outcome at months 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 after randomisation, adjusting for multiplicity with the Bonferroni method. Assertive case management significantly reduced the incidence of first recurrent suicidal behaviour up to the 6-month timepoint (6-month risk ratio 0.50, 95% CI 0.32-0. 80; 13=0.003), but not at the later timepoints. Prespecified subgroup analyses showed that the intervention had a greater effect in women (up to 18 months), and in participants younger than 40 years and those with a history of previous suicide attempts (up to 6 months). We did not identify any differences between the intervention and control groups for completed suicide (27 [6%] of 460 vs 30 [7%] of 454, log-rank p=0.660) or all-cause mortality (46 [10%] of 460 vs 42 [9%] of 454, log-rank p=0.698).
   Interpretation Our results suggest that assertive case management is feasible in real-world clinical settings. Although it was not effective at reducing the incidence of repetition of suicide attempts in the long term, the results of our ad-hoc analyses suggested that it was effective for up to 6 months. This finding should be investigated in future research.

AB A case of suicide, a male shot in the abdomen using a homemade weapon, is described herein. Postmortem examination revealed bleeding into the thoracic and abdominal cavities, a collapsed liver and other organs with numerous pellets. The contact-shot wound was not noticed during the initial investigation at the scene, but it was elucidated during autopsy. A simple launcher had been assembled from pipes of a clothes rack frame made for home use. The deceased had once owned a shotgun, but his firearm license had been relinquished 5 years prior. A shotgun shell that he had kept was used. Presumably, the injuries from the homemade weapon were not noticed initially because of strict gun control rules in Japan.

AB As a result of unprecedented increase in suicides over the last decade, Korea now ranks at the top of OECD countries in suicide statistics (26.1 deaths per 100,000 population in 2005). Our study sought to document socioeconomic inequalities in self-destructive behaviors including suicidal ideation, parasuicide, and completed suicide. For prevalence of suicidal ideation and parasuicide, we used four waves of data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1995, 1998, 2001, and 2005). For suicide mortality, we abstracted suicide cases from the National Death Registration records, and linked them with population denominators from the national census in 1995, 2000, and 2005. We examined variation in self-destructive behaviors according to level of educational attainment (at the individual level), as well as area-level characteristics including level of deprivation and degree of urbanicity. Age-standardized rates were calculated through direct standardization using the 2005 census population as the standard. Inequalities were measured by the relative index of inequality and the slope index of inequality. The age-standardized prevalence of suicidal ideation decreased across consecutive surveys in both genders (18.0-13.5% for men, 27.5-22.9% for women). Parasuicides similarly decreased over time. By contrast, completed suicides increased over time (20.9-42.8 per 100,000 for men and 8.9-20.9 for women). The most prominent increases in completed suicides were observed among the elderly in both genders. Lower education, rural residence, and area deprivation was each associated with higher suicide rates. Both absolute as well as relative inequalities in suicide by socioeconomic position widened over time. Our findings suggest that the current suicide epidemic in Korea has social origins. In addition to clinical approaches targeted to the prevention of suicides in high risk individuals, social policies are needed to protect disadvantaged populations at risk of self-destructive behaviors.

AB BACKGROUND: A limited number of studies suggest that ambient temperature contributes to suicide; these studies typically focus on a single nation and use temporally and spatially aggregated data.
   OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the association between ambient temperature and suicide in multiple cities in three East Asian countries.
   METHODS: A time-stratified case-crossover method was used to explore the relationship between temperature and suicide, adjusting for potential time-varying confounders and time-invariant individual characteristics. Sex-and age-specific associations of temperature with suicide were estimated, as were interactions between temperature and these variables. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate country-specific pooled associations of temperature with suicide.
   RESULTS: An increase in temperature corresponding to half of the city-specific standard deviation was positively associated with suicide in most cities, although average suicide rates varied substantially. Pooled country-level effect estimates were 7.8% (95% CI: 5.0, 10.8%) for a 2.3 degrees C increase in ambient temperature in Taiwan, 6.8% (95% CI: 5.4, 8.2%) for a 4.7 degrees C increase in Korea, and 4.5% (95% CI: 3.3, 5.7%) for a 4.2 degrees C increase in Japan. The association between temperature and suicide was significant even after adjusting for sunshine duration; the association between sunshine and suicide was not significant. The associations were greater among men than women in 12 of the 15 cities although not significantly so. There was little evidence of a consistent pattern of associations with age. In general, associations were strongest with temperature on the same day or the previous day, with little evidence of associations with temperature over longer lags (up to 5 days).
   CONCLUSIONS: We estimated consistent positive associations between suicide and elevated ambient temperature in three East Asian countries, regardless of country, sex, and age.

AB Background. It has been suggested that screening interventions may be effective for suicide prevention. Few studies, however, have reported their effects on outcome measures, including death by suicide among middle-aged adults.
   Method. We used a quasi-experimental parallel cluster design with matched community-based intervention and control municipalities (total eligible population: 90 000) in Japan. At-risk residents within the intervention area were invited for universal depression screening and subsequent care/support. We compared changes in suicide incidence of adults aged 40-64 years for the 4-year pre- and post-implementation periods in the intervention group with the control group and the whole country. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of the outcomes were adjusted for age group, gender and interaction terms, using mixed-effects negative binomial regression models. Suicide rates among intervention and control subgroups were compared.
   Results. The screening procedure was offered to 52% of the intervention group, and 61% of those contacted responded over the implementation period. Suicide rates decreased more in the intervention group [IRR 0.57, 95% (CI) 0.41-0.78; F-1,F-36 = 12.52, p = 0.001] than the control group (IRR proportion 1.63, 95% CI 1.06-2.48; F-1,F-82 = 5.20, p = 0.025) or the whole country (IRR proportion 1.64, 95% CI 1.16-2.34; F-1,F-42 = 8.21, p = 0.006). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the results from the primary analysis. There were lower suicide rates among both respondents and non-respondents to the screening than in the control group during the implementation period.
   Conclusions. Prevention efforts involved in the depression screening intervention were probably successful in reducing suicide rates.

AB We analyzed suicide mortality by occupation using administrative data from 1993 to 2016. Methods: National death records from 1993 to 2016 of the Korea National Statistical Office (KNSO) were used. Suicidal death was taken from Korean Classification of Disease codes as intentional self-harm (X60-X84) and sequelae of intentional self-harm (Y870). Occupational groups were categorized into Manager, Officer, Service-Trade, Agricultural-Fishery-Forestry (AFF), Skilled Manual, and Unskilled Manual. Direct standardized mortality (DSM) and standardized mortality ratio (SMR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated. Overall, suicide rates increased during economic downturns, especially among lower socio-economic occupation classes. Both DSM and SMR were highest in AFF, followed by Unskilled Manual, Service-Trade, Officer, Skilled Manual, and Manager categories among men, whereas women showed the highest DSM and SMR in AFF, followed by Service-Trade, Officer, Unskilled Manual, Manager, and Skilled Manual categories. The age-stratified analysis showed that age groups with increasing trends in suicide differed according to occupation and gender. In certain occupational groups, the time-point prevalence fluctuated with socio-economic background in suicidal mortality and differed by age and gender.

TI Low Risk of Male Suicide and Lithium in Drinking Water

DT Article

AB Objective: Recently, several epidemiologic studies reported that lithium in drinking water may be associated with lower rates of suicide mortality at the population level, but other studies failed to confirm the association. The objective of the present study is to determine whether lithium in drinking water is associated with lower suicide rate after adjustment of potential confounding factors.
   Method: From 2010 to 2013, 274 mean lithium levels of 434 lithium samples in drinking water were examined in relation to suicide standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) in 274 municipalities of Kyushu Island in Japan. Weighted least squares regression analysis adjusted for the size of each population was used to investigate the association of lithium levels with suicide SMRs. The associations of lithium levels in drinking water with suicide SMRs (total, male, and female) were investigated adjusting for proportion of elderly people, proportion of 1-person households, proportion of people with college education or more, and proportion of people engaging in primary industry (adjusted model 1), and further adjustment was performed with overall unemployment rate, annual marriage rate, annual mean temperature, and annual postal savings per person (adjusted model 2).
   Results: Lithium levels in drinking water were significantly (beta = -.169, P = .019) and inversely associated with male suicide SMRs but not total or female SMRs in the adjusted model 2.
   Conclusions: The present findings suggest that lithium in drinking water may be associated with the low risk of male suicide in the general population. Further studies are required to confirm these findings and investigate gender differences. (C) Copyright 2015 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB The purpose of the study was to investigate the association between suicide and demographic and socioeconomic measures in Tuscany. Data on standardized rates of suicide from 1997 to 2005 in addition to census-derived variables, income and abstention were derived from the Mortality register, the 2001 Census, the Tax Agency and the Regional Electoral Office databases. Pearson's correlation and stepwise multiple regression analyses (unweighted and weighted by population) were used to analyze the association between suicide rates and demographic and socio-economic measures for the 34 health districts for both males and females. The correlation analyses showed that suicide was significantly associated with many variables in men, but only with old age in women. The multiple regression analyses showed that the best predictors in men were education, single person households and isolated houses (only education and single person households in the weighted model). For women, the best predictors were-the proportion of elderly people and income (this was also true for the weighted model, but in the opposite order). An ecological correlation between suicide and measures of economic deprivation and social fragmentation was found in both men and women. Among the best predictors, isolated houses may act as a marker for remoteness and isolation on a small scale. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

   EXPERIENCE
AB Objectives: Patient suicide is a tragic occurrence, and it can be a demoralizing experience for medical residents. Few studies, however, have assessed suicide management skills among these front-line healthcare professionals. This study evaluated the self-assessed competence and confidence of medical residents with regard to the management of potentially suicidal patients and assessed the correlation with the residents' background characteristics.
   Method: The authors conducted a multicenter, cross-sectional survey of 114 medical residents in Japan, using a modified version of the Suicide Intervention Response Inventory (SIRI-2), the Medical Outcomes Study 8-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-8), and a 5-point Likert scale to assess confidence in suicide management.
   Results: A majority (89.5%) of the residents rated their confidence in managing suicidal patients as Not At All Confident or Rather Not Confident, although most were close to completing their psychiatric rotation. Results on the SIRI-2 suggested intermediate competence in managing suicidal behavior, as compared with that of other healthcare professionals. Competence as indicated by the SIRI-2 score was weakly and negatively correlated with the score for self-perceived Vitality on the SF-8 scale.
   Conclusion: Insufficient skills and lack of confidence in the management of suicidal patients was observed in this sample of Japanese medical residents, thus highlighting the need for improved suicide-management programs for junior medical residents in Japanese hospitals.

AB This study aimed to develop a conceptual framework of the experience of persons who have lost a family member to suicide in Japan. The authors conducted in-depth interviews with 24 such family members. They conceptualized their experience as a process of regaining my new life. Initially, their lives were out of their hands, but gradually they learned striving skills and recuperative conditioning, and integrated the skills to regain their lives. Some participants eventually reached a state of living a redefined life. How individuals underwent this process varied. The authors identified two types of people dealing with this issue: dialoguers and mood changers.

AB Objective: Patients attempted suicide by psychotropic drug overdose and require medical care have increased, becoming a serious problem in Japan. This study investigated the characteristics of patients who attempted suicide by overdose and required emergency care, with a focus on quantity of drugs taken.
   Methods: We conducted a clinical survey of 98 patients examined at the emergency centre of the psychiatric department of Jichi Medical University Hospital and hospitalized for attempted suicide by drug overdose from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014. Data were collected by chart review and subjected to statistical analysis.
   Results: Diagnoses were mainly mood disorder and neurosis in both genders. Also, 23.5% of the cases had multiple hospitalizations at the centre, and past overdose was significantly higher in these patients. The average total number of pills/sachets ingested was 84.4 +/- 95.5, but no significant difference was noted in dosage according to psychiatric clinic visit history (P = 0.63). Of these patients, 45.1% returned to their previous hospital, and 12.2% were hospitalized in the psychiatric ward.
   Conclusion: These results are consistent with reports in the literature. Psychiatric outpatient history does not seem to be a risk factor for attempted suicide by ingesting higher drug doses.

AB Suicide in later life is a global public health problem. The aim of this review was to conduct a systematic analysis of studies with comparison groups that examined the associations between social factors and suicidal behavior (including ideation, non-fatal suicidal behavior, or deaths) among individuals aged 65 and older. Our search identified only 16 articles (across 14 independent samples) that met inclusion criteria. The limited number of studies points to the need for further research. Included studies were conducted in Canada (n = 2), Germany (n = 1), Hong Kong (n = 1), Japan (n = 1), Singapore (n = 1), Sweden (n = 2), Taiwan (n = 1), the U. K. (n = 2), and the U.S. (n = 3). The majority of the social factors examined in this review can be conceptualized as indices of positive social connectedness-the degree of positive involvement with family, friends, and social groups. Findings indicated that at least in industrialized countries, limited social connectedness is associated with suicidal ideation, non-fatal suicidal behavior, and suicide in later life. Primary prevention programs designed to enhance social connections as well as a sense of community could potentially decrease suicide risk, especially among men.

   deaths
SO JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY RESEARCH

DT Article
ID POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE
AB Perinatal care in Japan has progressed rapidly in recent decades, remarkably reducing maternal, perinatal and neonatal mortality rates. This is attributable not only to the sustained efforts and dedication of past obstetricians and midwives, but also to the collective results achieved by the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology and healthcare administration, including research on advanced medical care, education, medical care improvements and establishing perinatal care centers. Although the maternal mortality rate was in steady decline until 2007 (3.1/100000 births), it repeatedly fluctuated thereafter, plateauing at 3.4 per 100000 births in 2013 and 2.7 per 100000 births in 2014. Thus, the Perinatology Committee has analyzed the current situation of maternal deaths and has proposed countermeasures to reduce such death. The items deliberated upon by related subcommittees in 2015 are presented herein. The addition of indications for fibrinogen concentrate', eptacog alfa' and approval of the PGE2 vaginal tablet for cervical ripening were discussed in the subcommittee for unapproved drug review. Thus, a request for approval for health insurance coverage was submitted to the Evaluation committee on unapproved or off-label drugs with high medical needs' of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Maternal and late-maternal deaths from suicide during the 10 years from 2005 to 2014 in Tokyo's 23 wards were jointly examined with the Tokyo Medical Examiner's Office. The suicide rate in the 23 wards is very high, at 8.7 per 100 000 births. Thus, the subcommittee for the reduction of maternal death discussed countermeasures for the eradication of maternal death and maternal suicide and the revision of death certificates.

AB Background: Natural disasters are associated with a variety of negative health consequences, including enhanced suicide risk. Factors that moderate the relationship between disaster exposure and enhanced suicide risk are unknown. The aim of the current study was to determine whether pre-disaster PTSD moderates the association between change over time in thoughts of death, suicidal ideation (SI), suicide plans, and suicide attempts (SA) from pre-to post-disaster.
   Methods: Participants (n = 2832) were recruited from Chile as part of the larger PREDICT study and completed a measure of lifetime PTSD and panic disorder at baseline and a lifetime death/suicide measure at baseline in 2003 and again 6, 12, and 24 months later (i.e. "pre-disaster"). One year following a major earthquake and tsunami in 2010 (i.e., "post-disaster"), participants completed another death/suicide measure.
   Results: Both those with and without pre-disaster PTSD experienced significant increases in SI from pre-to postdisaster. However, pre-disaster PTSD was associated with significantly accelerated increases in thoughts of death and SI from pre-to post-disaster. At nearly all time-points, pre-disaster PTSD was associated with higher thoughts of death and SI, suicide planning, and SA. In contrast, panic disorder did not moderate the association between time and changes in SI.
   Limitations: There was a long time-gap between pre-disaster and post-disaster, with limited data about what occurred during this time.
   Conclusion: Pre-disaster PTSD is an important predictor of increased SI following a natural disaster, and groups with pre-disaster PTSD should be prioritized for receipt of mental health resources following a natural disaster.

AB AimWe aimed to examine the association between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and suicidal behavior in psychiatric outpatients and whether this association differs among patients with different psychiatric disorders.
   MethodsCross-sectional data came from the Japan Prevalence Study of Adult ADHD at Psychiatric Outpatient Care, which included psychiatric outpatients aged 18-65 years recruited from one university hospital and three general psychiatric outpatient clinics in Kitakyushu City, Fukuoka, Japan from April 2014 to January 2015 (N = 864). The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) Screener was used to collect information on ADHD symptoms. Reports of current and lifetime suicidal behavior were also obtained. A multivariable Poisson regression analysis was used to examine the association between ADHD symptoms and suicidal behavior.
   ResultsAfter adjusting for covariates there was a strong association between possible ADHD (ASRS 14) and suicidal behavior with prevalence ratios ranging from 1.17 (lifetime suicidal ideation) to 1.59 (lifetime suicide attempt) and 2.36 (current suicidal ideation). When ASRS strata were used, there was a dose-response association between increasing ADHD symptoms and suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Analyses of individual ICD-10 psychiatric disorders showed that associations varied across disorders and that for anxiety disorder, ADHD symptoms were significantly linked to all forms of suicidal behavior.
   ConclusionADHD symptom severity is associated with an increased risk for suicidal behavior in general psychiatric outpatients. As ADHD symptoms are common among adult psychiatric outpatients, detecting and treating ADHD in this population may be important for preventing suicidal behavior.

AB Objective: Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been implicated as protective against suicide. However, it is uncertain whether a higher intake of EPA and DHA or of fish, a major source of these nutrients, lowers suicidal risk among Japanese, whose fish consumption and suicide rate are both high. This study prospectively examined the relation between fish. EPA, or DHA intake and suicide among Japanese men and women.
   Method: Subjects were 47,351 men and 54,156 women aged 40-69 years who participated in the JPHC Study, completed a food frequency questionnaire in 1995-1999, and were followed for death through December 2005. We used the Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for suicide by quintile of intake.
   Results: A total of 213 and 85 deaths from suicide were recorded during 403,019 and 473,351 person-years of follow-up for men and women, respectively. Higher intakes of fish, EPA, or DHA were not associated with a lower risk of suicide. Multivariate HRs (95% CI) of suicide death for the highest versus lowest quintile of fish consumption were 0.95 (0.60-1.49) and 1.20 (0.58-2.47) for men and women, respectively. A significantly increased risk of suicidal death was observed among women with very low intake of fish, with HRs (95% CI) for those in 0-5th percentile versus middle quintile of 3.41 (1.36-8.51).
   Conclusions: Our overall result does not support a protective role of higher intake of fish, EPA, or DHA against suicide in Japanese men and women. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   RATES; MORTALITY; SMOKING; DEATH; POPULATION; COMPONENTS
AB Over the course of the 20th century the sex differential in life expectancy at birth in the industrialized countries has widened considerably in favour of women. Starting in the early 1970s, the beginning of a reversal in the long-term pattern of this differential has been noted in some high-income countries. This study documents a sustained pattern of narrowing of this measure into the later part of the 1990s for six of the populations that comprise the G7 countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, England and Wales (as representative of the United Kingdom) and USA. For Japan, a persistence of widening sex differences in survival is noted. The sex differences in life expectancy are decomposed over roughly three decades (early 1970s to late 1990s) from the point of view of four major cause-of-death categories: circulatory diseases, cancers, accidents/violence/suicide, and,other' (residual) causes. In the six countries where the sex gap has narrowed, this has resulted primarily from reduced sex differences in circulatory disease mortality, and secondarily from reduced differences in male and female death rates due to accidents, violence and suicide combined. In some of the countries sex differentials in cancer mortality have been converging lately, and this has also contributed to a narrowing of the difference in life expectancy. In Japan, males have been less successful in reducing their survival disadvantage in relation to Japanese women with regard to circulatory disease and cancer; and in the case of accidents/violence/suicide, male death rates increased during the 1990s. These trends explain the divergent pattern of the sex difference in life expectation in Japan as compared with the other G7 nations.

AB In Japan, perinatal mental disorders are recognized as significant complications of pregnancy and the postpartum period. Left untreated, maternal mental disorders can lead to serious social and physical problems in mothers, including suicide, child abuse, and child neglect. A number of steps in perinatal mental health care can be taken to help mothers remain emotionally balanced during pregnancy and after childbirth. Active interventions mediated by cooperation among professionals from multiple fields will decrease the incidence of serious problems associated with maternal mental disorders.

AB Background: There has been increasing interest in the formal review of child deaths in Japan. In this study we examined the causes and scene information regarding child deaths from injury in Tokyo, the capital of Japan, as preparation for implementation of a full-scale review of child deaths.
   Methods: Documents on deaths from injury (excluding homicides) investigated by the Tokyo Medical Examiner's Office during the period from 2006 through 2010 were reviewed. Deaths of children younger than 18 years (N = 217) were selected as the study sample. We examined the cause of and information on the death and were particularly interested in whether a case had preventable factors.
   Results: Overall, 67% of the cases were deaths from unintentional injury. The main cause of death among children younger than 1 year was asphyxia, and the proportions of deaths from traffic accidents were higher in older age groups. Thirty percent of deaths from injury were due to suicide, and all cases of suicide were among children older than 10 years. Although analysis of preventable factors was difficult in some cases, owing to limited information on the death scene, 87% of deaths from unintentional injury, excluding those involving traffic accidents, had preventable factors.
   Conclusions: Most unintentional child deaths from injury appear to be preventable. Development of a system to collect detailed information on the scene at the time of death will help decrease child deaths in Japan.

AB Aims.
   To evaluate the effectiveness of a brief suicide management training programme for Japanese medical residents compared with the usual lecture on suicidality.
   Methods.
   In this multi-center, clustered randomized controlled trial, the intervention group attended a structured suicide management programme and the control group, the usual lecture on depression and suicidality. The primary outcome was the difference in residents' cumulative competency score to manage suicidal persons from baseline (T0) to 1 month after the intervention (T2), determined using the Suicide Intervention Response Inventory (SIRI-1) score, at individual level.
   Results.
   Analysis of 114 residents (intervention group n=65, control group n=49) assigned to two clusters in each group revealed no change in SIRI-1 score from T0 to T2 or immediately after the intervention (T1) between the two groups. As a secondary analysis, discrepancy in judgement between the participants and Japanese suicidologists was examined immediately after the intervention in the adjusted model, with a mean difference in score of 9.98 (95% confidence interval: 4.39-15.56; p=0.001).
   Conclusions.
   The structured programme was not proven to improve competency in suicide management when measured by the SIRI-1 score. Further elaboration of the programme and valid measurement of its outcome would be needed to show the program's effectiveness.

TI Japanese experience of hydrogen sulfide: the suicide craze in 2008
SO JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE AND TOXICOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Most of hydrogen sulfide poisoning has been reported as industrial accidents in Japan. However, since January 2008, a burgeoning of suicide attempts using homemade hydrogen sulfide gas has become evident. By April 2008, the fad escalated into a chain reaction nationwide. Mortality of the poisoning was very high. There were 220 cases of attempted gas suicides during the period of March 27 to June 15, killing 208. An introduction of new method of making the gas, transmitted through message boards on the internet, was blamed for this "outbreak". The new method entailed mixing bath additive and toilet detergent. The National Police Agency instructed internet providers to remove information that could be harmful. Of the victims of the fad in 2008, several cases were serious enough that family members were involved and died. Paramedics and caregivers were also injured secondarily by the gas. This fad has rapidly spread by internet communication, and can happen anywhere in the world.

AB Unrelieved pain is a major factor that influences suicide risk among terminally ill patients but, little is known about the relationship between pain and the risk of completed suicide in the general population. We prospectively examined the association between self-reports of pain and subsequent risk of completed suicide in 26,481 men aged 40 to 79 years from the Ohsaki National Health Insurance Cohort study, a population-based, prospective cohort study initiated in 1994. On the basis of a five-item. questionnaire on pain, individuals were classified as having no pain, very mild pain, mild pain, or moderate or severe., Pain. Completed suicide cases were documented from 1995 to 2001. During 131,027 person-years, 64 completed suicides were documented. After adjustment for covariates, the risk for completed suicide was significant, higher in the subjects with more pain. Multivariate hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) relative to the subjects who bad no pain were 1.36 (0.67-2.75), 2.11 (1.02-4.33) and 2.93 (1.34-642) in the subjects who had who had very mild pain, mild pain, and moderate or severe Pain, respectively (P for trend = 0.004). Stratified analysis showed that the positive association between pain and suicide risk was robust M the subjects with good health, low stress, adequate steep, good physical activity, and no history of chronic diseases. Our results suggest that pain is associated with an increased risk of completed suicide among-Japanese men. The association was consistently observed among healthy subjects.

AB Background: A growing body of evidence has demonstrated the associations between social capital and health. In residential or geographical areas, social capital has attracted attention for its protective effects against suicide. However, to this date, the relationship between social capital and suicidal ideation is not fully elaborated in the occupational setting. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the association between workplace social capital and suicidal ideation in the past year among employees in Japan.
   Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted in February/March 2017 via an anonymous self-administered questionnaire distributed to workers in Tsukuba Science City, Japan. Binomial logistic regressions were used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for suicidal ideation in the past year, controlling for age group, marital status, educational attainment, and annual household income. The results were shown stratified by sex and occupation.
   Results: In total, 7255 of 19,481 workers responded, out of which we could analyze 6325 responses (4030 men, 2295 women). The prevalence of suicidal ideation in the past year was 5.9% for men and 7.8% for women. Low workplace social capital was statistically significantly associated with suicidal ideation both for men (OR=2.57, 95% CI=1.72-3.83) and for women (OR=1.75, 95% CI=1.15-2.66), compared with high workplace social capital after controlling for socioeconomic factors.
   Conclusion: Higher workplace social capital was associated with a reduced risk of suicidal ideation in the past year. Promoting workplace social capital could contribute to preventing suicide among employees in Japan.

AB Background: Both male gender and low socioeconomic status have been related to depression and suicide, but their possible relationship to mental health literacy remains uncertain. The objectives of this study were to assess the level of mental health literacy in rural communities in Japan and to examine related factors.
   Methods: A population-based cross-sectional study using a questionnaire was conducted. Response rate was 88.2% from 8163 residents aged 30-69 years. The relationships between mental health literacy (including cognition of depression, attitude toward depression, and acceptance of suicide) and demographics, socioeconomic status, and the severity of depression were assessed by logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Of the respondents, 25.2% showed an inadequate cognition of depression, 12.5% showed an inadequate attitude toward depression, and 13.1% showed an acceptance of suicide. Of the complete respondents (65.5%), an inadequate cognition of depression was associated with being male (adjusted odds ratio=1.93, 95% confidence interval: 1.68-2.22), advanced age (2.18, 1.58-3.00), and a lower level of education (1.95, 1.34-2.86); an inadequate attitude toward depression was associated with being male (2.18, 1.82-2.61), a lower education (2.34, 1.38-3.97), and the severity of depression (2.26, 1.54-3.32); and an acceptance of suicide was associated with being male (1.33, 1.13-1.58) and the severity of depression (5.77, 4.20-7.93).
   Conclusions: Poor menial health literacy related strongly to male gender and a low level of education. According to our results, poor mental health literacy may possibly be a factor contributing to male vulnerability to suicide.

AB The prognosis of patients with metastatic gastric cancer, particularly peritoneal carcinomatosis, remains poor despite intensive interventions. Gene therapy and hyperthermia can be promising strategies for such advanced disease. The study was conducted to explore the possible effective therapeutic approach of suicide gene therapy with herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) in combination with hyperthermia for advanced gastric cancer. The heat shock protein (hsp) 70B gene promoter-oriented HSV-tk (HSP-tk)/ganciclovir (GCV) system directed by heat shock was developed. Hsp promoter activity under the control of heating was assessed by dual luciferase assay in gastric cancer cell lines and implanted tumors of nude mice. In vitro cytotoxic assay was performed using the HSP-tk/GCV delivered by the hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ) liposome, with or without heating. Mice with subcutaneously xenografted tumors and peritoneal carcinomatosis were treated with hyperthermia and gene therapy using the HVJliposome-carrying HSP-tk. Assessment by luciferase assay demonstrated highly inducible and tumor-specific promoter activity in vitro and in vivo. Cytotoxic assays showed that cells transfected with HSP-tk became more sensitive to GCV with heating. A synergistic effect was also observed when treated with a non-heat-inducible cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-mediated HSV-tk/GCV and heating, indicating bystander killing. The HVJ-liposome-carrying HSP-tk/GCV combined with hyperthermia significantly inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumors and prolonged survival of mice with peritoneal carcinomatosis. We conclude that the combination of suicide gene therapy with hyperthermia can provide a promising treatment modality for advanced gastric cancer.

AB For the prevention of suicides, the early detection of depression symptoms and the implementation of suicide prevention measures based on the local community's conditions are critical. In rural or remote communities with poor access to urban areas, the medical care is often insufficient. We conducted the present study to investigate the relationship between depressive state and social-environmental factors in a depopulated inland rural area in central Japan, where the suicide rate is high and specialized psychiatric care is not available. Using a correspondence analysis, logistic regression analysis, and structural equation modeling (SEM), we examined the questionnaire responses of 912 residents (average 60.5 years old). Total Health Index-Depression (THI-D) scale scores were used to measure depressive state. The lifestyle-related factor with the strongest link to depressive state was 'concerns about interpersonal relationships' (OR = 2.7, 95% CI: 2.06-3.53, p < 0.0001), whereas financial concerns, number of friends, exercise habits, and perceived amount of sleep were also useful for predicting depressive state. The SEM showed that one's job and private life, particularly concerns about interpersonal relationships, are correlated with higher THI-D scores. Thus, social and lifestyle factors (e.g., concerns about interpersonal relationships and financial situation) can be used to predict depressive state in a depopulated rural area, and the newly revealed order in which depressive symptoms manifest is important. Our findings can be used to advance assessments of depressive symptoms and will be useful for mental health and suicide prevention.

AB We worked on characterizing suicide attempts in patients with schizophrenia in comparison with mood disorders. This study population comprised 260 patients with F2 disorders (ICD-10), i.e., "schizophrenic group" and 705 patients with F3 disorders, i.e., "depressive group" who presented at the psychiatric emergency department of our hospital for 8 years. They were compared in three age groups: young (<= 24 years), middle-aged (25-44 years), and elderly (>= 45 years). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified factors associated with the seriousness of the suicide attempt method. The schizophrenic group (>= 25 years) had a younger mean age and higher prevalences of "within-1-year suicide attempts" and "past suicide attempts" than the depressive group. The Schizophrenic group tended to use serious methods, such as "jumping from high places," "throwing oneself in front of an oncoming train," and "burning oneself," in their suicide attempts, with "hallucination-delusion" accounting for an overwhelmingly large percentage of suicide attempt motives, irrespective of the age group. In the elderly group, the ratio of "no-housemate" patients was high. In all age groups, jobless individuals were prevalent, and the schizophrenic group had lower LCU (Life Change Unit) scores than did the depressive group. The middle-aged cases of schizophrenic group had higher BPRS (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) scores and lower GAS (Global Assessment Scale) scores. Regarding factors influencing the seriousness of the methods, a history of within-1-year suicide attempts increased the method seriousness in the schizophrenic group. Years of education correlated with the method seriousness in the schizophrenic group. Low scores of overall health on the GAS increased the method seriousness in both groups. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Although suicide rates among Japanese men of working-age have steadily increased over the past two decades, the distribution by occupation and industry is not uniform. Little is known regarding occupation and industry differences in relation to suicide risk. This study examined differences in suicide risk among Japanese men of working age (25-59 years) during 2010.
   Methods: We analysed the Japanese government's 2010 national survey data regarding occupation and industry-specific death rates. Poisson regression models were formulated for each occupation and industry to estimate the relative risk of death by suicide. Potential interactions between age and occupation/industry were also examined.
   Results: Suicide incidence was highest among workers in the fields of agriculture and mining. When compared with referent groups (sales for occupation and wholesale and retail for industry), the age-adjusted relative risk of suicide was highest for administrative and managerial workers (Incident Relative Risk [IRR]: 3.91, 95% Confidence Interval [95%CI]: 3.16-4.85), service industries (IRR: 3.63, 95%C1: 2.93-4.51) and agriculture (IRR: 3.53, 95%C1: 2.84-4.38) occupations, and for mining (IRR: 23.9, 95%C1: 19.429.4), fisheries (IRR: 6.26, 95%C1: 5.03-7.80), electricity and gas (IRR: 5.86, 95%C1: 4.71-7.30) and agricultural industries (IRR: 4.73, 95%C1: 3.78-5.91).
   Limitations: Bias resulting from misclassification of deceased individuals' occupation or industry was a potential limitation of this study. Furthermore, detailed information regarding occupation-related factors, such as employment status, had not been recorded in the initial survey.
   Conclusions: These findings help elucidate Japanese occupations and industries with a higher suicide risk, most likely due to economic changes or workplace factors relating to stress and depression. (C) 2015 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.

AB 388 Japanese religious groups-143 Shinto, 157 Buddhist, 58 Christian and 30 others-were asked to answer questions regarding several forms of euthanasia and extraordinary treatment during the dying process. Passive euthanasia and indirect euthanasia were accepted by around 70% of the respondents, Active euthanasia was favored by less than 20% of them. Christians were less supportive of euthanasia than practitioners of other religions. Shinto and Buddhist corporations advocated "being natural," when medical treatment became futile at the terminal stage. Religionists' views may deepen the discussion of end-of-life issues.

AB A systematic review was undertaken to quantify the effect of community-based depression screening (CDS) with follow-up on the completed suicide risk for residents aged 65 and over. Five quasi-experimental studies in Japanese regions with high suicide rates were included in the meta-analysis. Combined incidence rate ratios (95% confidence intervals) by the Mantel-Haenszel method and by the DerSimonian-Laird method in two homogenous studies implementing the follow-up conducted by psychiatrists were 0.30 (0.13-0.68) and 0.33 (0.14-0.80) in men, and 0.33 (0.19-0.58) and 0.33 (0.19-0.60) in women, respectively; and those in three homogenous studies implementing the follow-up conducted by general practitioners were 0.73 (0.45-1.18) and 0.74 (0.45-1.23) in men, and 0.36 (0.21-0.60) and 0.39 (0.22-0.66) in women, respectively. There are very few studies included, however, to demonstrate an association between CDS and the reduced risk, suggesting gender difference in the effectiveness.

AB Background: Self-harm is an important risk factor for subsequent suicide and repetition of self-harm, and a common cause of emergency department presentations. However, there still remains limited evidence on intervention in emergency department settings for individuals who self-harm.
   Methods: This multicentre, randomised controlled trial was conducted at 17 general hospitals in Japan. In total, 914 adult patients admitted to emergency departments for a suicide attempt and had a DSM-IV-TR axis I disorder were randomly assigned to two groups, to receive either assertive case management (intervention) or enhanced usual care (control). Assertive case management was introduced by the case manager during emergency department admissions for suicide attempts, and continued after discharge. Interventions were provided until the end of the study period (for at least 18 months and up to 5 years).
   Results: The number of overall self-harm episodes per person-year was significantly lower in the intervention group (adjusted incidence risk ratio (IRR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.96, p=0.0031). Subgroup analysis showed a greater reduction of overall self-harm episodes among patients with no previous suicide attempt at baseline (adjusted IRR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53-0.98, p=0.037). Limitations: Patients younger than 20 years and patients who self-harmed but were not admitted to an emergency department were excluded.
   Conclusions: The present study showed that assertive case management following emergency admission for a suicide attempt reduced the incident rate of repeat overall self-harm.

AB Genome-wide gene expression analysis using DNA microarray has a great advantage to identify the genes or specific molecular cascades involved in mental diseases, including major depression and suicide. In the present study, we conducted DNA microarray analysis of major depression using postmortem prefrontal cortices. The gene expression patterns were compared between the controls and subjects with major depression. As a result, 99 genes were listed as the differentially expressed genes in major depression, of which several genes such as FGFR1, NCAM1, and CAMK2A were of interest. Gene ontology analysis suggested an overrepresentation of genes implicated in the downregulation or inhibition of cell proliferation. The present results may support the hypothesis that major depression is associated with impaired cellular proliferation and plasticity. Comparison between the controls and suicide victims with major depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia was also conducted in the present study. Two genes, CAD and ATP1A3, were differentially expressed in the three comparisons in the same direction. Interestingly, these two genes were also included in the differentially expressed 99 genes in major depression. It may be worth investigating the genes in relation to suicide or major depression.

Results indicate that intimate partner violence (IPV) is experienced physically, sexually, and psychologically in all sexual minority groups. Participants perceived the violence to be: a) very similar to heterosexual IPV against women; b) more likely perpetrated and experienced by lesbians, bisexual women, and transgender persons compared to gay and bisexual men and intersex persons; c) the cause of several negative physical and mental health outcomes; and d) largely unrecognized in both sexual minority communities and broader Japanese society.

TI An examination of specific types of <i>Ijime</i> within Japanese schools
SO SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Multiple suicides among Japanese students due to bullying have resulted in the initiation of various mechanisms to prevent, manage and measure the prevalence of bullying (ijime). Ijime is now a problem of epidemic proportions in Japan. Due to the historical roots of collectivism, combined with the rapid industrialization of Japan, the manifestation of bullying is very different from that seen in Western cultures. The Japanese government, through Mombusho (Japanese Ministry of Education, Sport and Culture), and the Japan Center for Family and Child Research, has attempted to respond to the ever increasing incidence of ijime among Japanese students. In an effort to both augment the level of response, as well as increase the scope of understanding, a fellowship was established to facilitate the ability of a foreign professor to research the issue of ijime. This manuscript informs the prevalence and types of ijime-related behaviours, and presents the findings of related interviews and focus groups conducted in Japan. Differences in behaviours at the elementary, junior high anti high school, educational levels are discussed.

AB Although empirical data suggest a possible link between female reproductive events and risk of nonfatal accidents and suicidal behaviors, evidence to determine these effects on mortality is scarce. This study investigated the association between female reproductive factors and the risk of external causes of death among middle-aged Japanese women. We used a population-based cohort study consisting of 71 698 women residing in 11 public health center areas across Japan between 1990 and 1994. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of the risk of all external causes, suicide, and accidents according to female reproductive factors at the baseline survey. During 1 028 583 person-years of follow-up for 49 279 eligible subjects (average 20.9 years), we identified 328 deaths by all injuries. Among parous women, ever versus never breastfeeding [0.67 (95%CI: 0.49-0.92)] was associated with a decreased risk of all injuries. Risk of suicide was inversely associated with ever versus never parity [0.53 (95% CI: 0.32-0.88)]. A lower risk of death by accidents was seen in ever breastfeeding [0.63 (95% CI: 0.40-0.97)] compared to never breastfeeding. This study suggests that parity and breastfeeding are associated with reduced risk of death by all external causes, suicide and/or accidents among Japanese women.

AB Backgrounds: Suicide is a leading cause of death in adolescence. Effective strategies are required to prevent suicide. We aimed to assess the prevalence of suicidal ideation in early teens and the relationship between family mental health and suicidal ideation of their child.
   Methods: A population-based survey in a rural town included 185 junior high school students and their caregivers. Suicidal ideation and mental states were assessed with General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and Profile of Mood States (POMS) form.
   Results: Nineteen (10.3 %) students experienced suicidal ideation in the preceding weeks and had more mental health problems than students without suicidal ideation. Caregivers of students with suicidal ideation demonstrated significantly higher suicidal depression scores in GHQ. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that suicidal depression of caregivers was the most important factor for suicidal ideation of students.
   Conclusions: Suicidal ideation of children is associated with suicidal depression of their caregivers. For the prevention of suicide in adolescents, not only their own mental status but also that of caregivers should be taken into consideration.

ID SUICIDE
AB The non-medical use or abuse of prescription drugs, including benzodiazepines, is a growing health problem in Japan. An association between prescription drug overdose and suicide risk has also been reported. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has expected pharmacists to act as "gatekeepers", facilitating early identification of individuals at high risk of prescription drug abuse including overdose, supplying medication counseling to patients, and helping to introduce these patients to appropriate medical care. Prescription drugs such as benzodiazepines are widely used in psychiatry. However, these drugs are prescribed not only by psychiatrists but also by other healthcare professionals including primary care physicians. Moreover, in recent years, the dispensing of prescriptions has moved rapidly from inside to outside hospitals, with prescription drugs being dispensed mainly at community pharmacies. Although all healthcare professionals including hospital pharmacists can play a role in preventing prescription drug abuse, the role of the community pharmacist is vital in addressing this problem. Formerly, community pharmacists were recognized as "community scientists", low-threshold accessible healthcare advisors. Now, community pharmacists should return to the role of community scientists to prevent prescription drug abuse. This article begins by reviewing the current situation of prescription drug abuse and dependence in Japan. The role of pharmacists as gatekeepers in preventing prescription drug abuse is then examined. Finally, this article discusses the effect of intervention in the form of gatekeeper training for community pharmacists.

AB Although "repertoire of contention" is a ubiquitous term in the literature, the concept remains undertheorized and untested. The crucial implication, I argue, is that instances of a tactic belong to one or a few lineages, each radiating from a single invention and comprising a series of adoptions and repetitions. This implication is tested by examining suicide protest: killing oneself, without harming others, for a collective cause. The decline in cruel public punishment and the growth of news media increased the potential utility of this tactic. There were multiple inventions of suicide protest, but only in Japan was there a recognizable lineage in the early twentieth century. The sacrifice of a Vietnamese monk in 1963 created a model, which was adopted in many different countries for varied collective causes. Almost all subsequent acts can be traced-directly or indirectly-back to this origin.

AB Background: Previous epidemiological studies have indicated that the risk of suicide in cancer patients is higher than that of the general population. In addition, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) have recently become controversial medical, ethical and legal issues all over the world. Although suicide in cancer patients and appropriate management of cancer patients with suicidality are critical issues in clinical oncology practice, there have been very few studies to understand suicidality in cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to explore the clinical factors associated with suicidality in Japanese patients with cancer.
   Methods: We investigated the clinical factors associated with suicidality in cancer patients by analyzing the consultation data of patients referred to the Psychiatry Division, National Cancer Centre Hospital and Hospital East, Japan.
   Results: Of 1713 psychiatric referrals, 62 (3.6%) were related to suicidality, including 44 cases with suicidal ideation, 10 suicide attempts and eight cases who had requested euthanasia and/or continuous sedation. Most of the patients suffered from physical distress and/or psychiatric disorders. The results of a multivariate analysis comparing cancer patients with a psychiatric referral related to suicidality and those referred for other reasons indicated that impaired physical functioning and major depression were significant associated factors.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that early detection and appropriate management of major depression and comprehensive care improving physical functioning may help to prevent suicide and manage suicidality in Japanese cancer patients.

AB Objectives: To explore the long-term impact of a universal screening intervention for depression on suicide rates among older community-dwelling adults, with gender as an effect modifier. Design: Controlled cohort study reporting long-term follow-up of previous research. Setting: Two sets of three municipalities in Japan were assigned as intervention and control regions and compared with the surrounding zone and prefecture. Participants: Intervention area residents aged 60 years and older (14,291) were invited to participate in a 2-year intervention (2005-2006). Four population-based dynamic cohorts of residents aged 65 years and older (1999-2010) were included as subjects, 6 years before and after the intervention started. Intervention: At-risk residents within the intervention region (4,918) were invited for a two-step screening program; 2,552 participated in the program linked with care/support services for 2 years. An education program open to the public was held. Measurements: Changes in suicide from a 6-year baseline to the 2-year intervention and a 4-year follow-up in the intervention region (11,700 adults >= 65 years) were compared with a matched control and two comparison areas using mixed-effects negative binomial regression models. Suicide rates among older adults exposed to screening were compared with those of the control region. Results: Suicide rates in the intervention region decreased by 48%, which was significantly greater than in the three comparison areas. The program's benefits lasted longer for women than men. Screening exposure may be associated with decreased suicide risk over the 4-year follow-up. Conclusions: Universal screening may decrease suicide rates among older adults, with potential gender differences in treatment response.

AB Aim: This study analyzed the trend of gender gaps in life expectancy (GGLE) in Japan between 1947 and 2010, and explored the correlations of GGLE with gender mortality ratio and social development indices.
   Methods: Using GGLE and social indices data collected from the official websites, we carried out trends analysis of GGLE by calculating segmented average growth rates for different periods. We explored the association between GGLE and all-cause mortality; and between GGLE and Human Development Index (HDI) while controlling for time trend, by computing the generalized additive models based on the software R (version 2.15).
   Results: Japan's GGLE increased in a fluctuating fashion. Across 53 years, the average growth rates varied widely: 0.14% (1947-1956), 1.43% (1956-1974), 1.06% (1974-2004) and -0.60% (2004-2010) (overall average 0.87%). The value of GGLE peaked to 7.00 years in 2004, and then has slowly declined (6.75 years in 2010). Age-adjusted all-cause gender mortality ratio had a statistically positive association with GGLE (P < 0.01), whereas HDI was found to have no such association.
   Conclusion: The increased trend of GGLE in Japan could be partly explained by increased disease-specific mortality ratios (male/female), especially those involving chronic bronchitis and emphysema, diseases of the liver, suicide and cancer. The recent decline of GGLE might imply that Japanese women have been catching up with the lifestyle of men, resulting in similar mortality patterns. This calls for gender-sensitive approaches to developing policies and programs that will help sustain healthy lifestyles to combat smoking and alcohol intake, and social support to prevent suicide.

AB Background: In a classical study, Durkheim noted a direct relation between suicide rates and wealth in the XIX century France. Since that time, several studies have verified this relationship. It is known that suicide rates are associated with income, although the direction of this association varies worldwide. Brazil presents a heterogeneous distribution of income and suicide across its territory; however, evaluation for an association between these variables has shown mixed results. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between suicide rates and income in Brazil, State of Sao Paulo (SP), and City of SP, considering geographical area and temporal trends.
   Methods: Data were extracted from the National and State official statistics departments. Three socioeconomic areas were considered according to income, from the wealthiest (area 1) to the poorest (area 3). We also considered three regions: country-wide (27 Brazilian States and 558 Brazilian micro-regions), state-wide (645 counties of SP State), and city-wide (96 districts of SP city). Relative risks (RR) were calculated among areas 1, 2, and 3 for all regions, in a cross-sectional approach. Then, we used Joinpoint analysis to explore the temporal trends of suicide rates and SaTScan to investigate geographical clusters of high/low suicide rates across the territory.
   Results: Suicide rates in Brazil, the State of SP, and the city of SP were 6.2, 6.6, and 5.4 per 100,000, respectively. Taking suicide rates of the poorest area (3) as reference, the RR for the wealthiest area was 1.64, 0.88, and 1.65 for Brazil, State of SP, and city of SP, respectively (p for trend <0.05 for all analyses). Spatial cluster of high suicide rates were identified at Brazilian southern (RR = 2.37), state of SP western (RR = 1.32), and city of SP central (RR = 1.65) regions. A direct association between income and suicide were found for Brazil (OR = 2.59) and the city of SP (OR = 1.07), and an inverse association for the state of SP (OR = 0.49).
   Conclusions: Temporospatial analyses revealed higher suicide rates in wealthier areas in Brazil and the city of SP and in poorer areas in the State of SP. We further discuss the role of socioeconomic characteristics for explaining these discrepancies and the importance of our findings in public health policies. Similar studies in other Brazilian States and developing countries are warranted.

TI Suicide and Ambient Temperature: A Multi-Country Multi-City Study
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
LA English
DT Article
ID SOUTH-AFRICA; MORTALITY; SEASONALITY; RATES; ASSOCIATION; ENGLAND
AB BACKGROUND: Previous literature suggests that higher ambient temperature may play a role in increasing the risk of suicide. However, no multicountry study has explored the shape of the association and the role of moderate and extreme heat across different locations.
   OBJECTIVES: We examined the short-term temperature suicide relationship using daily time-series data collected for 341 locations in 12 countries for periods ranging from 4 to 40 y.
   METHODS: We conducted a two-stage meta-analysis. First, we performed location-specific time-stratified case-crossover analyses to examine the temperature suicide association for each location. Then, we used a multivariate meta-regression to combine the location-specific lag-cumulative nonlinear associations across all locations and by country.
   RESULTS: A total of 1,320,148 suicides were included in this study. Higher ambient temperature was associated with an increased risk of suicide in general, and we observed a nonlinear association (inverted J-shaped curve) with the highest risk at 27 degrees C. The relative risk (RR) for the highest risk was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.30, 1.36) compared with the risk at the first percentile. Country-specific results showed that the nonlinear associations were more obvious in northeast Asia (Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan). The temperature with the highest risk of suicide ranged from the 87th to 88th percentiles in the northeast Asian countries, whereas this value was the 99th percentile in Western countries (Canada, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the United Slates) and South Africa, where nearly linear associations were estimated. The country-specific RRs ranged from 1.31 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.44) in the United States to 1.65 (95% CI: 1.40, 1.93) in Taiwan, excluding countries where the results were substantially uncertain.
   DISCUSSION: Our findings showed that the risk of suicide increased with increasing ambient temperature in many countries, but to varying extents and not necessarily linearly. This temperature suicide association should be interpreted cautiously, and further evidence of the relationship and modifying factors is needed.

AB Background
   Suicide rates are vastly higher in Japan than in many other countries, although the associations between affective temperaments and suicide-related ideations in the general adult population remain unclear. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate these associations in the present study.
   Methods
   We analyzed data from 638 Japanese volunteers who completed both the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego Auto-questionnaire (TEMPS-A). Participants were then divided into three groups based on PHQ-9 summary scores and responses to the suicide-related ideation item: non-depressive control group (NC; N = 469), depressive symptoms without suicide-related ideations group (non-SI; N = 135), and depressive symptoms with suicide-related ideations group (SI; N = 34). The depressive symptoms were defined for PHQ-9 summary scores >= 5, and the suicide-related ideations were defined for PHQ-9 #9 score >= 1. We then compared TEMPS-A scores among the groups using Kruskal-Wallis tests. Then the 95% confidence intervals of differences in TEMPS-A subscale scores between the NC and non-SI groups, or between NC and SI groups, were calculated.
   Results
   Participants of the SI group exhibited significantly higher scores on the depressive, irritable, and anxious temperament subscales than those of the non-SI group. Similarly, women of the SI group exhibited significantly higher scores of the depressive and irritable temperament subscales than women of the non-SI group, while men of the SI group exhibited significantly higher depressive temperament scores than those of the non-SI group. Among all participants and only men, cyclothymic subscale scores were higher in those of the SI group than the non-SI group (not significant), although the 95% confidence intervals did not overlap.
   Limitations
   The cross-sectional study design was the main limitation.
   Conclusions
   Depressive, irritable, and anxious temperaments are significant risk factors for suicide-related ideations in the Japanese general adult population. Furthermore, irritable temperament in women and depressive temperament in men are associated with suicide-related ideations.

TI The New Individualism and Contemporary Japan: Theoretical Avenues and
   the Japanese New Individualist Path
SO JOURNAL FOR THE THEORY OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
DE New individualism; reinvention; social theory; Japan; discourses of the
   self
AB Recent social theory has identified various institutional forces operating at a global level promoting novel trends towards individualization, reflexive self-identity and new individualism (Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 2001; Giddens, 1991, 1992; Elliott and Lemert, 2009, 2009a). This article develops an exploratory overview of the theory of new individualism with reference to Japanese sociologies of self specifically and contemporary Japanese society more generally. Detailing the large-scale societal shift in Japan from traditional forms of identity-construction (based on a citizenship model of social order) to post-traditional forms of identity-construction (promoted by globalization and neoliberal policies), the article distinguishes between four discourses of the self in post-war Japanese society: the age of the ideal; the age of the dream; the age of fiction; and, the age of fragmentation. Moreover, the article examines the Japanese employment system and the emergence of new individualist employment, as well as considering the emotional impacts of a rise in suicides in contemporary Japan. The argument is that the new individualist thesis can contribute to a sociological understanding of recent social transformations in Japan. However, situating new individualism in the context of Japan also highlights significant tensions in processes of new individualism, tensions between individual initiatives and institutional pressures.

AB There has been a debate in appropriateness of legalization of death with dignity and euthanasia in Japan. To clarify views about these issues, we conducted a large nationwide study of the bereaved whose family member died at palliative care units. The percentages of 429 bereaved family members (response rate 65%) who affirmed legal authorization were 52 for death with dignity and 45 for euthanasia and who affirmed assignment at the discretion of the physician involved were 37 for death with dignity and 38 for euthanasia. In conclusion, views about legalization of death with dignity and euthanasia among the bereaved are inconsistent. No consensus is reached as to legislation of these issues.

TI The Reading Cultures and Ethical Codes of Germany and Japan in the
   Eighteenth Century
SO INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES OF LITERATURE
LA English
DT Article
DE Reading culture; Ethics; Goethe; Chikamatsu Monzaemon; Forbidden books;
   Suicide
AB Texts whose themes are contrary to the social norms and ethical codes of their era, or which disseminate what are seen as unwholesome ideas, have been in many societies prohibited from being published or sold, or even from being read. This paper will examine such cases in Germany and Japan in the 18th century. These texts challenged the ethical norms of their societies, which were based on the authority of the Enlightenment and Christianity and of the Shogunate, respectively. In particular, Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther and Chikamatsu Monzaemon's Sonezaki Shinju, iconic works of the two countries in the 18th century, led to an increase in cases of the social phenomenon of suicide. Criticism of the role these texts played in inspiring these acts and of what was viewed as their unethical contents helped rather than hindered their success, and this demonstrates that the officially-sanctioned ethics of the day and the desire of ordinary readers were in a relationship of mutual tension, and that the differentiation of the two countries' reading cultures from ethical codes was progressing. The study of the widespread social phenomena related to reading books which were seen as illegitimate in Germany and Japan is an important basis for research into the relationship between the reading culture of the 18th century and the ethical codes of the day, specifically as this evolution relates to social modernization.

AB Objective: To determine the timing of development of suicidal ideation and factors associated therewith in suicide attempters who required psychiatric emergency treatment.
   Methods: Of a total of 2818 suicide attempters in Japan who presented to the primary or secondary emergency department of Iwate Medical University Hospital (hereinafter, referred to as our hospital) or Iwate Prefecture Advanced Emergency and Critical Care Center (hereinafter, referred to as the emergency center), an affiliated institution to our hospital, during the 12-year period from April 1, 2002-March 31, 2014, 2274 patients for whom the timing of development of suicidal ideation was identified were included in the study. The study subjects were classified into three groups according to the timing of development of suicide ideation: the "same-day" group, those who developed suicidal ideation and attempted suicide on the same day; the "short-term" group, those who developed suicidal ideation 2-7 days before attempting suicide; and the "long-term" group, those who developed suicidal ideation more than 7 days before attempting suicide. Factors associated with the development of suicidal ideation in each group were analyzed by a multiple logistic regression analysis with background factors, the diagnosis according to the ICD and the situations before and after the suicide attempt as explanatory variables.
   Results: The same-day group was characterized by a high female ratio, high global functioning, low stress level, non-depressed status and a lack of seeking consultation. In contrast, the long-term group was characterized by low global functioning and a high stress level, suggesting that these patients exhibit consultation behavior, but have not received psychiatric services. In the short-term group, only male gender was identified as a significant factor.
   Discussion: For those patients who developed suicidal ideation and attempted suicide on the same day, treatment strategies focusing on the acquisition of coping skills and stress management are recommended. For those with suicidal ideation lasting for more than a week or recurrent ideation, early detection and subsequent early treatment of such ideation are essential. In intermediate cases, treatment strategies that make the full use of mental health management in the workplace and gate-keeping are likely to be effective.

AB To evaluate the mortality of patients certified to be suffering from vibration syndrome in the Kyushu region of Japan, the cohort consisting of 838 vibration syndrome patients who had worked at local forestry offices was followed up, A total of 15,208 person-yrs of follow-up data from 1966 to 1996 was analyzed. The mortality of the population of Kumamoto Prefecture, a central part of Kyushu region, was used to estimate the expected number. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% Cls) for specific causes were calculated. 208 deaths were observed. The mortality from all causes was similar between in the cohort studied and in the general population. The remarkable differences were seen in leukemia (SMR 370, 95% CI 227-1000) and suffocation (SMR 269, 95% CI 140 to 518). The excess mortality from leukemia in the cohort studied is likely due to exposure to wood dust or gasoline during forestry work and Human T-cell Leukemia Virus type I infection. The increased mortality from suffocation is possibly attributable to suicide.

AB Objectives: To investigate the trends and correlations of gross domestic product (GDP) adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita on suicide rates in 10 WHO regions during the past 30 years.
   Design: Analyses of databases of PPP-adjusted GDP per capita and suicide rates. Countries were grouped according to the Global Burden of Disease regional classification system.
   Data sources: World Bank's official website and WHO's mortality database.
   Statistical analyses: After graphically displaying PPP-adjusted GDP per capita and suicide rates, mixed effect models were used for representing and analysing clustered data.
   Results: Three different groups of countries, based on the correlation between the PPP-adjusted GDP per capita and suicide rates, are reported: (1) positive correlation: developing (lower middle and upper middle income) Latin-American and Caribbean countries, developing countries in the South East Asian Region including India, some countries in the Western Pacific Region (such as China and South Korea) and high-income Asian countries, including Japan; (2) negative correlation: high-income and developing European countries, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and (3) no correlation was found in an African country.
   Conclusions: PPP-adjusted GDP per capita may offer a simple measure for designing the type of preventive interventions aimed at lowering suicide rates that can be used across countries. Public health interventions might be more suitable for developing countries. In high-income countries, however, preventive measures based on the medical model might prove more useful.

AB Examining the opening passage of Sonezaki shinju (Love suicides at Sonezaki, 1703), Chikamatsu Monzaemon's first "contemporary-life play" (sewamono) for the puppet theater (joruri), MICHAEL BROWNSTEIN explores issues related to the development of and historical context for joruri. The passage describes the heroine, Ohatsu, making a pilgrimage, commonly referred to as the Kannon-meguri, to thirty-three temples of Kannon in Osaka. The Kannon-meguri was characteristic of many urban pilgrimage routes that appeared in the larger cities of Japan during the early modern period, routes that also came to be called "women's pilgrimages." Brownstein discusses the pilgrimage itself and how the Kannon-meguri in Chikamatsu's play was performed. He thus reveals the importance of the passage for understanding the play as a whole.

AB The mortality rate for Japanese males aged 30-59 years in managerial and professional spiked in 2000 and remains worse than that of other occupations possibly associated with the economic downturn of the 1990s and the global economic stagnation after 2008. The present study aimed to assess temporal occupation-specific mortality trends from 1980 to 2010 for Japanese males aged 30-59 years for major causes of death. We obtained data from the Occupation-specificVital Statistics. We calculated age-standardized mortality rates for the four leading causes of death (all cancers, suicide, ischaemic heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease). We used a generalized estimating equation model to determine specific effects of the economic downturn after 2000. The age-standardized mortality rate for the total working-age population steadily declined up to 2010 in all major causes of death except suicide. Managers had a higher risk of mortality in all leading causes of death compared with before 1995. Mortality rates among unemployed people steadily decreased for all cancers and ischaemic heart disease. Economic downturn may have caused the prolonged increase in suicide mortality. Unemployed people did not experience any change in mortality due to suicide and cerebrovascular disease and saw a decline in cancer and ischemic heart disease mortality, perhaps because the basic properties of Japan's social welfare system were maintained even during economic recession.

TI 'Coalition-In-Iraq' countries 'internal' civil violent deaths compared
   to the USA 'external' violence of September 11th 2001
SO MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR

DT Article

ID SUICIDE; FEAR
AB Background: The atrocity of 9/11 exemplified 'external' caused civil violent deaths, which have major policy implications for the countries contributing armed forces to the 'Coalition-In-Iraq' [C.I.I]. C.I.I Government's resources for perennial 'internal' violent deaths (suicide, homicide and road), are likely to be threatened by alternative priorities. C.I.I 'internal' deaths are compared with those of 9/11 to provide information to determine relative risks.
   Material/Methods: To uniformly compare mortality between countries we utilise the most recent WHO mortality data, taking the latest three years 1997-1999 and calculating an average annual number and rate of 'internal' deaths in each country, these are compared with the 9/11 fatalities, calculating a proportional ratio, as an indicator of differential damage to families and society.
   Results: USA 'external' deaths were 3,074 people and annual average suicides were 30,966. Total 'internal' deaths exceeded 'external' more than 30 times. Every fortnight there are more USA 'internal' violent deaths than on 9/11. Except Australia and Bulgaria, every country had more suicides than died on 9/11. Apart from Bulgaria, total 'internal' deaths exceeded the 'external' toll in all other CAI countries- by 14 times in Japan; 6 in Republic of Korea, 4 in Italy, 3 in Spain and the UK, twice in Canada and 1.5 times in Australia.
   Conclusions: The extent of 'internal' civil violent deaths, such as suicide, highlight the perennial pressures upon psychiatric services and the need to defend resources at a time of competing priorities.

AB Objective This study evaluated the current state of patients with Wilson disease in central Japan.
   Patients and Methods Between 1999 and 2007, 30 patients were diagnosed as having Wilson disease with an International Diagnostic Score of 4 or more. The phenotypes, genotypes and post-diagnostic courses of these patients were analyzed.
   Results Twenty-six patients had ATP7B mutations responsible for Wilson disease. Four patients had a single mutant chromosome. There were 2 major mutations of 2333 G>T and 2871 delC (40%), and 6 novel mutations (13%) in our patients. The first clinical manifestation was the hepatic form in 22, neurological form in 5, and hemolysis in 3 patients. The hepatic form was diagnosed around the age of 13 years, followed by neurological complication with a time lag of 9 years. Thus, some patients, especially patients with the neurological form, did not undergo early diagnostic tests including ATP7B analysis. During the post- diagnosis period, 3 patients were hospitalized for recurrent liver disease, and 2 patients committed suicide. One female patient died from acute hepatic failure associated with encephalopathy after fertilization therapy, while 2 male patients recovered from encephalopathy-free, prolonged hepatic failure after noncompliance with drug therapy. The King's Scores for liver transplantation were below the cut-off in both cases.
   Conclusion To minimize delayed diagnosis, ceruloplasmin determination and ATP7B analysis may be recommended to patients showing hepatic damage of unknown etiology. At gene diagnosis, appropriate management of patients including compliance education and emotional care to prevent suicide might be important.

SO NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE milnacipran; depression; suicide attempt; tricyclic antidepressant
ID TREATING SUICIDALITY; ILLNESS
AB Suicide is a serious social problem in many countries, including Japan. The majority of people who commit suicide suffer from depression. Suicide attempt patients suffering from serious physical injuries are initially treated in hospital emergency departments. The present post hoc analysis examined data from patients admitted to an emergency hospital for treatment of physical injuries, resulting from a suicide attempt, and initial psychiatric treatment for depression and prevention of future suicide attempts. The effects on depressive symptoms were studied in two groups of patients using the 17-item Hamilton depression scale (HAMD). One group (n = 6) had received intravenous tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) (amitriptyline or clomipramine) while the other group (n = 7) had been treated orally with milnacipran, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressant. Prior to treatment the four highest scoring items on the HAMD scale were the same in both groups namely, item 1 (depressed mood), item 3 (suicidality), item 7 (interest in work and activities), and item 10 (psychic anxiety). After 1 week of treatment, mean global HAMD scores were significantly reduced in both groups. Treatment resulted in a significant reduction of five HAMD items in the TCA group, whereas in the milnacipran group 12 HAMD items were significantly reduced. Suicidality (item 3) was significantly improved by 1 week treatment with milnacipran, but not by TCAs. Milnacipran rapidly improved a wide range of depressive symptoms, including suicidality within the first week. The improvement with milnacipran would appear to be, at least, equivalent to that achieved with TCAs, possibly affecting a wider range of symptoms. Since milnacipran has been shown in comparative studies to be better tolerated than TCAs, this antidepressant offers an interesting option for the treatment of suicidal patients in an emergency setting.

TI Taking leave from work: the impact of culture on Japanese female nurses
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING
LA English
DT Article
DE culture; family; history; Japan; leave; nurses; nursing
AB Aims and objectives. This paper provides an overview of nurses' working conditions in Japan, exploring tensions between nurses' rights to take leave from work to fulfil family and personal needs and their actual ability to take such leave. It also considers possible effects of being restricted from taking such leave.
   Background. Little has been written on the specific needs of nurses who are mothers in the Japanese work environment. Research has focussed on the effects of heavy, stressful workloads and long working hours leading to burnout, death from overwork and suicides in Japanese culture. However, research that considers unique cultural and female issues in Japan affecting nursing work has not been published.
   Method. Discursive.
   Conclusion. The paper shows that there are many overlapping, complex issues affecting nurses working in Japan and their needs need to be considered and addressed in order to promote a healthier work environment, as well as a more humanistic environment.
   Relevance to clinical practice. Workplace issues are relevant to recruitment and retention and better conditions are likely to improve hospital functioning.

DE rework program; depression; medical staff; family; Japan
ID SUICIDE
AB Objective: Recently there have been frequent reports regarding the mental health problems of workers and the necessity of providing support to individuals resuming work after long-term leaves of absence. However, there have been few reports of actual rework programs. Therefore, medical staff should understand the need for and begin to implement rework programs, and be prepared to discuss these programs with individuals returning from long-term leaves of absence due to mental disorders.
   Material and Methods: We mainly focused on and reviewed practical and concrete rework programs for individuals returning from long-term leaves of absence due to mental disorders in Japan, as reported by the Japanese Center Review Medicine (Ichushi), medical journals, and related journals, and we discuss herein the reported rework programs across various types of medical institutions and workplaces.
   Review and Conclusion: We observed that very few institutions in Japan have rework programs. Occupational and comprehensive centers for mental health and welfare form the core of the programs in Japan. Therefore, rework programs should he implemented by many more hospitals, clinics, and organizations in,Japan. We believe it is important to establish organizations that facilitate interactions between medical institutions, industrial physicians, and workers' families to understand the changes observed in workers at an early, stage and hence prevent the onset of mental disorders.

ID PREVALENCE; DISORDERS; WORKERS
AB Aim: Major depression is expected to become the leading contributor to disease burden worldwide by 2020. Previous studies have shown that the societal cost of depression is not less than that of other major illnesses, such as cardiovascular diseases or AIDS. Nevertheless, the cost of depression in Japan has never been examined. The goal of the present study was to estimate the total cost of depression in Japan and to clarify the characteristics of this burden.
   Methods: A prevalence-based approach was adopted to measure the total cost of depression. The total cost of depression was regarded as being comprised of the direct cost, morbidity cost and mortality cost. Diagnoses included in this study were depressive episodes and recurrent depressive disorder according to the ICD-10 or major depressive disorder according to the DSM-IV. Data were collected from publicly available statistics and the World Mental Health Japan Survey database.
   Results: The total cost of depression among adults in Japan in 2005 was estimated to be (sic)2.0 trillion. The direct cost was (sic)0.18 trillion. The morbidity cost was (sic)0.92 trillion, while the mortality cost was (sic)0.88 trillion.
   Conclusion: The societal costs caused by depression in Japan are enormous, as in other developed countries. Low morbidity costs and extremely high mortality costs are characteristic in Japan. Effective interventions for preventing suicide could reduce the societal costs of depression.

AB Aim: The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for suicide in Japanese substance use disorder (SUD) patients, adjusting for age and sex, and to examine sex differences in suicide risk among these patients. Methods: A self-reporting questionnaire on age, sex, types of abused substances, current depression, and suicidality was administered to 1420 SUD patients who consecutively visited seven hospitals specializing in SUD treatment during the month of December 2009. Unadjusted/adjusted odds ratios of factors associated with suicidality were calculated for each sex. Results: The multivariate analysis using the total sample identified younger age, female sex, and current depression as risk factors for severe suicidality in SUD patients. The multivariate analysis by each sex demonstrated that younger age and current depression were associated with severe suicidality in male SUD patients. Only current depression was associated with severe suicidality in female patients. Conclusion: Current depression is a risk factor for suicide in SUD patients common in both Western countries and Japan, although in Japanese SUD patients both younger age and female sex were more closely associated with severe suicidality than aspects of SUD. Additionally, young male SUD patients are speculated to have psychosocial features associated with suicidality in common with female SUD patients.

AB Workplace health promotion (WHP) in Japan has a relatively long history of over 30 years as the Silver Health Plan and the Total Health Promotion Plan, which intend to promote workers' physical and mental health. Recently, karoshi (death brought on by overwork or job-related exhaustion) and karo-jisatsu (work-related suicide) brought on by long working hours have necessitated the implementation of WHP. Japan is unique in that WHP is stipulated in the Industrial Safety and Health Law as employer's obligations, and several concrete guidelines have been issued by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Financial assistance for enterprises implementing WHP is also a characteristic of Japanese WHP. WHP in Japan has emphasized intervention in personal lifestyles. Six types of specialists in charge of WHP have been developed. Despite numerous WHP programs being conducted in Japan, few evaluations of WHP programs have been reported in professional journals. WHP should be conducted under the guidance of occupational safety and health management systems. Those in charge of WHP should ask workers the meaning of work and life before starting intervention in their personal lifestyles. Mechanisms to support the development of appropriate WHP models and methods to increase health and well-being in small-scale enterprises should be established. WHP should be considered as an important element of corporate responsibility.

AB Introduction: Because Japan has high suicide rates and low violent crime rates, it is likely that most abdominal stab wounds (ASWs) in Japan are self-inflicted. Although physical examination is one of the most important factors in surgical decision making, such evaluations can be difficult in patients with self-inflicted ASWs due to patient agitation and uncooperative behavior. Therefore, the self-inflicted nature of an injury may strongly affect clinical practice, particularly in Japan, but its influence remains uncertain. We hypothesized that the rates of exploratory laparotomy and nontherapeutic laparotomy (NTL) would be higher in self-inflicted patients.
   Methods: We reviewed ASW patients from 2004 to 2014 in the Japan Trauma Data Bank. The rates of exploratory laparotomy and NTL were compared between self-inflicted and non-self-inflicted ASWs.
   Results: Of the 1705 eligible patients, 1302 patients (76.4%) had self-inflicted ASWs, and 403 patients (23.6%) had non-self-inflicted ASWs. Self-inflicted patients had a significantly higher rate of psychiatric history, but lower injury severity. The in-hospital mortality rate was similar between the two groups (4.5% vs. 5.2%, p = 0.576). Self-inflicted patients had significantly higher rates of exploratory laparotomy and NTL (69.1% vs. 56.7%, p <0.001, 22.5% vs. 13.6%, p = 0.03, respectively). Self-inflicted patients were also associated with significantly longer hospital stays (10.0 [5.0-21.0] vs. 9.0 [4.0-18.0] days, P = 0.045). In a multivariable analysis, self-inflicted patients were independently associated with exploratory laparotomy (odds ratio [OR], 2.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.55-2.72) and NTL (OR, 1.61; 95% Cl: 1.01-2.56).
   Conclusion: ASWs in Japan were predominantly self-inflicted. The clinical patterns of self-inflicted ASWs had some unique features. Patients with self-inflicted ASWs had higher rates of laparotomy and NTL. Further studies are needed to develop a useful protocol specific to self-inflicted ASWs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The study investigates the impact of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita on cause-specific injury mortality, distinguishing between organization for economic cooperation and development (OECD) and non-OECD countries. Four cause-specific injuries are considered: motor vehicle traffic crash (MTC), accidental falls, suicide and self-inflicted injury, and homicide and injury purposely inflicted by other persons. Mortality per 100,000 members of the population aged 2564 years is computed for males and females separately (period 1996-1997). A year dummy is used to take into account unobserved events between 1996 and 1997. In the non-OECD countries, there is a negative relation between GDP per capita and both MTC and homicide mortality for both males and females. In the OECD countries, GDP per capita is associated positively with suicide for both sexes. The cause MTC is positively while that of accidental falls is negatively correlated among males among the OECD countries. In sum, the relation between GDP per capita and injury mortality tends to be diagnosis-specific, and is not exactly the same in the OECD and non-OECD countries. Relations, when found, are mostly for both genders. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID NEW-YORK-STATE; SECLUSION
AB Few analyses have been carried out in Japan concerning factors contributing to physical restraint of patients. We compared demographic data for 241 inpatients who were restrained during a 4-year period with data for 1093 inpatients who were not restrained in a general hospital psychiatric unit in Japan. Increased likelihood of restraint use was associated with older age, male gender, off-hours admission, involuntary hospitalization, transfer from other departments of the hospital, frequent hospitalization, absence of previous treatment, physical complications, history of suicide attempts, organic mental disorders, mental and behavioral disorders from psychoactive substance use, schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders. Importantly, physical complications not only were more prevalent among restrained than unrestrained patients, but additionally in restrained patients physical complications were associated with more prolonged hospitalization and periods under restraint than were associated with assaultive behavior or periods of unconsciousness. In conclusion, general hospital psychiatric units in Japan often treat patients with psychiatric disorders or symptoms that were associated with physical problems. Particular caution is needed in deciding whether such patients should be restrained since hospitalization may be prolonged or functional status compromised.

ID WORKAHOLISM
AB Since the collapse of Japan's bubble economy in the early 1990's, the Japanese economy has only recovered slightly. This has direct implications for employment. Both the seniority wage system and the lifetime employment system, which were popular during the period of economic growth in Japan, unavoidably changed to an outcome-wage system. Now there is greater mobility in employment, increased use of non-regular employees, and diversed working patterns. The problem of karoshi - a potentially fatal syndrome resulting from long work hours - has been known since the early 1980s. This problem has become more serious in recent years. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the economic and employment conditions in Japan, as well as to examine the working lifestyle of Japanese men and its connection to "karoshi." It is argued that (1) the long work hours are not the preference of individuals, but rather the result of the adaptation to the work environment, and; (2) solving this problem requires re-conceptualization of workers' human rights on the part of both companies and the society as a whole.

Latitudes correlate with height, IQ and skin color at r = 0.70, 0.44, 0.47, respectively. IQ also correlates with height (0.52), skin color (0.42), income (0.51) after correction, less homicide rate (-0.60), and less divorce (-0.69) but not with fertility infant mortality. The lower IQ in southern Japanese islands could be attributable to warmer climates with less cognitive demand for more than fifteen hundred years. (C) 2013 The Author. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Introduction To date no study has compared the treatment patterns for schizophrenia specifically between China and Japan. This study examined the cross-national differences in the use of psychotropic drugs and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in schizophrenia.
   Method Data on 3248 schizophrenia inpatients (n = 1524 in China and n = 1724 in Japan) were collected by either chart review or interviews during the designated 3 study periods between 2001 and 2009. Patients' socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, prescriptions of psychotropic drugs, and ECT use were recorded using a standardized protocol and data collection procedure.
   Results Multivariate analyses revealed that compared to their Japanese counterparts, Chinese inpatients had a shorter length of current hospitalization, were significantly less frequently prescribed second-generation antipsychotics (except clozapine), antipsychotic polypharmacy, benzodiazepines, and mood stabilizers, and more likely to receive clozapine, antidepressants, and ECT.
   Discussion Substantial variations in inpatient treatment patterns for schizophrenia were found between China and Japan. The common use of ECT and clozapine in Chinese inpatients and the frequent use of antipsychotic polypharmacy and high antipsychotic doses in Japanese inpatients need to be addressed.

AB A high disease burden of mental disorders has been noted worldwide, including Japan. It is important to monitor mental disorder prevalence trends and the use of mental health services over time using epidemiological data and to plan appropriate policies and measures that consider mental health in each country. This review outlines the prevalence trends of common mental disorders (CMD) and the use of mental health services in Japan from the 2000s to the 2010s and compares them with those in other countries. This review clarifies that the prevalence of CMD in Japan has been relatively stable in the past decade. The 12-month prevalence of mental health service use has increased about 1.2 times to 1.6 times in the past 10-15 years. Thus, it is very likely that the rise in mental health service use contributes to increased patient numbers. Regarding cross-national comparison, the prevalence rate of CMD in Japan is much lower compared to rates in the USA and Europe. The 12-month prevalence of mental health service use was also lower in Japan compared to prevalence rates in other high-income countries. Mental health epidemiology has clarified that the prevalence of CMD worldwide has remained unchanged, even though mental health service use has increased in high-income countries. Thus, the gap in treatment quality and prevention should be addressed in the future.

AB Suicidal behaviours are one of the most important contributors to the global burden of disease among women, but little is known about prevalence and modifiable risk factors in low and middle income countries. We use data from the WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence against women to examine the prevalence of suicidal thoughts and attempts, and relationships between suicide attempts and mental health status, child sexual abuse, partner violence and other variables. Population representative cross-sectional household surveys were conducted from 2000-2003 in 13 provincial (more rural) and city (urban) sites in Brazil, Ethiopia, japan, Namibia, Peru, Samoa, Serbia, Thailand and Tanzania. 20967 women aged 15-49 years participated. Prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts, lifetime suicidal thoughts, and suicidal thoughts in the past four weeks were calculated, and multivariate logistic regression models were fit to examine factors associated with suicide attempts in each site. Prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts ranged from 0.8% (Tanzania) to 12.0% (Peru city): lifetime thoughts of suicide from 7.2% (Tanzania province) to 29.0% (Peru province), and thoughts in the past four weeks from 1.9% (Serbia) to 13.6% (Peru province). 25-50% of women with suicidal thoughts in the past four weeks had also visited a health worker in that time. The most consistent risk factors for suicide attempts after adjusting for probable common mental health disorders were: intimate partner violence, non-partner physical violence, ever being divorced, separated or widowed, childhood sexual abuse and having a mother who had experienced intimate partner violence. Mental health policies and services must recognise the consistent relationship between violence and suicidality in women in low and middle income countries. Training health sector workers to recognize and respond to the consequences of violence may substantially reduce the health burden associated with suicidal behaviour. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Depression is a major risk factor for suicide, but few studies have examined psychosocial risk factors for suicide in clinical patients with depression. The purpose of this study was to investigate psychosocial factors which could be associated with suicidal ideation in clinical patients with depression including: sick-leave, help-seeking behavior, and reluctance to admit mental health problems.
   Methods: A multi-center cross-sectional survey using self-report questionnaire was conducted at 54 outpatient psychiatric clinics in Tokyo in 2012. Adult outpatients who were diagnosed by psychiatrists as mood disorders (F30-F39) in the International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) were included in the study. Those who met the criteria for current hypomanic or manic episode were excluded from the study.
   Results: A total of 189 patients with depression participated in the survey. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that taking sick-leave and having sought help from family were associated with decreased odds of current suicidal ideation. Moderate or more severe depression was associated with increased odds of suicidal ideation, and reluctance to admit own mental health problem tended to increase odds of suicidal ideation.
   Limitations: Living status and suicidal ideation before consultation with psychiatrist were not investigated. Severity of suicidal ideation and comorbid psychiatric disorders were not assessed.
   Conclusions: Importance of treatment of more severe depression for suicide prevention was confirmed. Industrial health staffs should consider the possibility of positive effect of taking sick-leave when they see employees with depression. Promoting help-seeking for family and reducing stigma of mental illness may be effective for suicide prevention. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Lithium and Other Elements in Scalp Hair of Residents of Tokyo
   Prefecture as Investigational Predictors of Suicide Risk
SO BIOLOGICAL TRACE ELEMENT RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Tokyo Prefecture; Suicide risk; Hair trace elements; Lithium; Mercury;
   Selenium; Vitamin B-12
AB The high suicide rates in Japan and several reports of inverse associations of suicide rates with the levels of lithium (Li) in drinking water prompted determinations of Li along with other elements in samples of scalp hair of 100 male and 100 female residents of Tokyo Prefecture. In more than half of the samples of both genders, Li levels were below the instrumental detection limit or below or the lower limit of the laboratory reference ranges. Among other elements, the concentrations namely of cobalt were also frequently below the laboratory reference range, suggesting that low circulating levels of vitamin B-12 were common in this study population. As vitamin B-12 deficiency is associated with depression and other psychiatric conditions, and there is evidence of interactions between Li and vitamin B-12, Li deficiency as well as suboptimal vitamin B-12 status must be considered as potential suicide risk factors. In view of its established positive effects on mood and brain function, an adequate supply of selenium (Se) is important as well. Although the analytical results suggested that the Se status of the subjects was generally adequate, as seafood was a major dietary source of Se, much of it was actually sequestered by mercury and only a fraction was bio-available. In addition, the hair samples were found to contain not insignificant levels of As, Cd, Ni, and Pb, arising from the adventitious presence of these elements in foods and the environment. As these elements also interact with Se in vivo and are known to adversely affect mood and behavior, in investigational studies, subjects at risk need to be evaluated also with respect to these elements.

TI Prevention of suicide with regulations aimed at restricting access to
   highly hazardous pesticides: a systematic review of the international
   evidence

AB Background Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for 14-20% of suicides worldwide. Regulation aimed at restricting access to pesticides or banning highly hazardous pesticides is one approach to reducing these deaths. We systematically reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness of pesticide regulation in reducing the incidence of pesticide suicides and overall suicides.
   Methods We did a systematic review of the international evidence. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase for studies published between Jan 1, 1960, and Dec 31, 2016, which investigated the effect of national or regional bans, and sales or import restrictions, on the availability of one or more pesticides and the incidence of suicide in different countries. We excluded other interventions aimed at limiting community access to pesticides. We extracted data from studies presenting pesticide suicide data and overall suicide data from before and after national sales restrictions. Two reviewers independently assessed papers for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We undertook a narrative synthesis of the data in each report, and where data were available for the years before and after a ban, we pooled data for the 3 years before and the 3 years after to obtain a crude estimate of the effect of the ban. This study is registered through PROSPERO, number CRD42017053329.
   Findings We identified 27 studies undertaken in 16 countries-five low-income or middle-income countries (Bangladesh, Colombia, India, Jordan and Sri Lanka), and 11 high-income countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, UK, and USA). Assessments largely focused on national bans of specific pesticides (12 studies of bans in six countries-Jordan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Greece [ Crete], South Korea, and Taiwan) or sales restrictions (eight studies of restrictions in five countries-India, Denmark, Ireland, the UK and the USA). Only five studies used optimum analytical methods. National bans on commonly ingested pesticides in five of the six countries studied, including four studies using optimum analytical methods, were followed by reductions in pesticide suicides and, in three of these countries, falls in overall suicide mortality. Greece was the only country studied that did not show a decrease in pesticide suicide following a ban. There were no high-quality studies of restricting sales to people for occupational uses; four of the seven studies (in three of the five countries studied-India, Denmark, and the USA) showed sales restrictions were followed by decreases in pesticide suicides; one of the two studies investigating trends in overall suicide mortality reported a fall in deaths in Denmark, but there were also decreases in suicide deaths from other methods.
   Interpretation National bans on highly hazardous pesticides, which are commonly ingested in acts of self-poisoning, seem to be effective in reducing pesticide-specific and overall suicide rates. Evidence is less consistent for sales restrictions. A worldwide ban on the use of highly hazardous pesticides is likely to prevent tens of thousands of deaths every year. Copyright (C) The Author(s).

   Time-Stratified Case-Crossover Analysis
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
LA English
DT Article
ID TEMPERATURE; EXPOSURE; RISK
AB BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence suggesting an association between air pollution and suicide. However, previous findings varied depending on the type of air pollutant and study location.
   OBJECTIVES: We examined the association between air pollutants and suicide in 10 large cities in South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan.
   METHODS: We used a two-stage meta-analysis. First, we conducted a time-stratified case-crossover analysis to estimate the short-term association between nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter [aerodynamic diameter <= 10 mu m (PM10), aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), and PM10-2.5] and suicide, adjusted for weather factors, day-of-week, long-term time trends, and season. Then, we conducted a meta-analysis to combine the city-specific effect estimates for NO2, SO2, and PM10 across 10 cities and for PM2.5 and PM10-2.5 across 3 cities. We first fitted single-pollutant models, followed by two-pollutant models to examine the robustness of the associations.
   RESULTS: Higher risk of suicide was associated with higher levels of NO2, SO2, PM10, and PM10-2.5 over multiple days. The combined relative risks (RRs) were 1.019 for NO2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.999, 1.039), 1.020 for SO2 (95% CI: 1.005, 1.036), 1.016 for PM10 (95% CI: 1.004, 1.029), and 1.019 for PM10-2.5 (95% CI: 1.005, 1.033) per interquartile range (IQR) increase in the 0-1 d average level of each pollutant. We found no evidence of an association for PM2.5. Some of the associations, particularly for SO2 and NO2, were attenuated after adjusting for a second pollutant.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that higher levels of air pollution may be associated with suicide, and further research is merited to understand the underlying mechanisms.

AB BACKGROUND: Although schizophrenic patients have higher mortality than the general nonschizophrenic population, few studies have investigated acute care hospital mortality of schizophrenic patients.
   METHODS: To assess acute care hospital mortality of schizophrenic patients, we analyzed hospital mortality, the risk factors for hospital mortality, and the causes of death of schizophrenic patients admitted to an acute care hospital in Japan over an 18-year period.
   RESULTS: We identified 55 deaths among 1108 schizophrenic patients, for a mortality rate of 5.0%. The overall standardized mortality ratio was 1.29 (95% CI, 0.98-1.68) compared with nonschizophrenic hospitalized patients. Significant risk factors for mortality were malignant neoplasm, cardiovascular disease, and admission through the emergency department. The leading causes of death in acute care hospitalizations were suicide (14.5%), malignant lymphoma or leukemia (10.9%), stroke (9.0%), and sepsis (7.3%).
   CONCLUSIONS: There was a nearly significant trend toward increased mortality of schizophrenic patients receiving acute hospital care compared with that of nonschizophrenic patients. Because suicide was the most frequent cause of death, a focus on suicide prevention is needed in this population.

AB Is cultural evolution needed to explain altruistic selfsacrifice? Some contend that cultural traits (e.g. beliefs, behaviors, and for some "memes") replicate according to selection processes that have " floated free" from biology. One test case is the example of suicide kamikaze attacks in wartime Japan. Standard biological mechanisms-such as reciprocal altruism and kin selectiondmight not seem to apply here: The suicide pilots did not act on the expectation that others would reciprocate, and they were supposedly sacrificing themselves for country and emperor, not close relatives. Yet an examination of both the historical record and the demands of evolutionary theory suggest the kamikaze phenomenon does not cry out for explanation in terms of a special non-biological selection process. This weakens the case for cultural evolution, and has interesting implications for our understanding of altruistic self-sacrifice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: to assess physicians' and patients' views in Saudi Arabia (KSA) towards involving the patient versus the family in the process of diagnosis disclosure and decision-making, and to compare them with views from the USA and Japan.
   Design: A self-completion questionnaire (used previously to study these issues in Japan and the USA) was translated to Arabic and validated.
   Participants: Physicians (n = 321) from different specialties and ranks and patients (n = 264) in a hospital or attending outpatient clinics from 6 different regions in KSA.
   Results: In the case of a patient with incurable cancer, 67% of doctors and 51% of patients indicated that they would inform the patient in preference to the family of the diagnosis (p = 0.001). Assuming the family already knew, 56% of doctors and 49% of patients would tell the patient even if family objected (p NS). However, in the case of HIV infection, 59% of physicians and 81% of patients would inform the family about HIV status without the patient's consent (p = 0.001). With regards to withholding ventilatory support, about 50% of doctors and over 60% of patients supported the use of mechanical ventilation in a patient with advanced cancer, regardless of the wishes of the patient or the family. Finally, the majority of doctors and patients (>85%) were against assisted suicide.
   Conclusions: Although there was more recognition for a patient's autonomy amongst physicians, most patients preferred a family centred model of care. Views towards information disclosure were midway between those of the USA and Japan. Distinctively, however, decisions regarding life prolonging therapy and assisted suicide were not influenced to a great extent by wishes of the patient or family, but more likely by religious beliefs.

AB Objective To assess the temporal trends in occupation specific all causes and cause specific mortality in Japan between 1980 and 2005.
   Design Longitudinal analysis of individual death certificates by last occupation before death. Data on population by age and occupation were derived from the population census.
   Setting Government records, Japan.
   Participants Men aged 30-59.
   Main outcome measures Age standardised mortality rate for all causes, all cancers, cerebrovascular disease, ischaemic heart disease, unintentional injuries, and suicide.
   Results Age standardised mortality rates for all causes and for the four leading causes of death (cancers, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and unintentional injuries) steadily decreased from 1980 to 2005 among all occupations except for management and professional workers, for whom rates began to rise in the late 1990s (P<0.001). During the study period, the mortality rate was lowest in other occupations such as production/labour, clerical, and sales workers, although overall variability of the age standardised mortality rate across occupations widened. The rate for suicide rapidly increased since the late 1990s, with the greatest increase being among management and professional workers.
   Conclusions Occupational patterns in cause specific mortality changed dramatically in Japan during the period of its economic stagnation and resulted in the reversal of occupational patterns in mortality that have been well established in western countries. A significant negative effect on the health of management and professional workers rather than clerks and blue collar workers could be because of increased job demands and more stressful work environments and could have eliminated or even reversed the health inequality across occupations that had existed previously.

AB The subjects consisted of 84 female SLE outpatients who were all over 20 years of age. These patients were able to maintain relatively stable physical conditions and lead normal daily lives, and they were regularly treated at the outpatient clinic. All subjects were Japanese. Psychological features (trait anxiety, state anxiety, depression and suicide ideation) were evaluated using psychological tests, and the relationships between the respective psychological features and background factors were statistically evaluated using stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses. In this study, we found that 'the self-evaluation of not having understood SLE at the time of starting SLE treatment' was the background factor significantly affecting depression or trait anxiety. 'No spouse' had a statistically significant effect on depression, and 'self-awareness as problems of side-effects due to steroids' had a statistically significant effect on state anxiety. We also found 'human relations among family members' and 'high daily steroid dosage' to be significantly correlated with suicide ideation. However, there were no correlations between the psychological features and 'disease activity at the time of investigation' or 'history of neuropsychiatric diseases'. In female SLE outpatients, performing psychological approaches focusing on,understanding SLE at the beginning of treatment", the human relationships among family members', or 'issues related to steroid therapy' may be useful for the early treatment or prevention of various major mental problems.

AB Background: A number of Delphi expert consensus studies have been carried out with different countries and cultural groups to develop guidelines on how a member of the public should provide assistance to a person who is suicidal. The present study aimed to determine whether cross-culturally generalizable suicide first aid actions are possible by comparing agreement across these Delphi studies.
   Methods: Data on endorsement rates for items were compared across six Delphi studies. These studies involved panels of professionals and consumer advocates from English-speaking countries, professionals from Sri Lanka, professionals from Japan, professionals from India, professionals from the Philippines, and professionals and consumer advocates in refugee and immigrant mental health. Correlations were calculated between item endorsement rates across panels.
   Results: There were 18 items that were highly endorsed across all eight of the Delphi panels and an additional 15 items highly endorsed across the panels from the three lower middle-income countries (India, Philippines and Sri Lanka). Correlations across panels in item endorsement rates were all 0.60 or above, but were higher between panels from countries that are socioeconomically similar.
   Conclusions: There is broad agreement across the diverse expert panels about what are appropriate suicide first aid actions for members of the public, indicating that cross-cultural generalizability is possible. However, there is also some cultural specificity, indicating the need for local tailoring.

AB For most of the 20th century the sex gap in life expectancy in the industrialized countries has widened in favor of women. By the early 1980s a reversal in the long-term pattern of this differential had occurred in some countries, where it reached a maximum and thereafter followed a declining trend. Of particular interest to the present investigation is the anomalous experience of Japan, where unlike other high-income countries the female advantage in life expectancy has been expanding. We contrast the case of Japan with that of Sweden, where, like many other high-income nations, the sex differential in longevity has been narrowing in recent years. We observe that in Sweden, until the early 1980s, the sex gap in life expectancy (female-male) exceeded that of Japan; but this situation reversed in subsequent periods, when the Swedish differential narrowed and that of Japan widened. A decomposition analysis indicates that these divergent patterns since 1980 have resulted mainly from larger than expected reductions in male mortality in Sweden due to heart disease and from accidents and violence, lung cancer and "other" cancers. In Japan, death rates for men and women from heart disease-which is a leading cause of death-have tended to decline more or less at the same pace since the early 1980s; and with regard to lung cancer, and "other" neoplasms, male death rates in Japan have been rising while those of women have either declined or risen more slowly. Moreover, during the 1990s, male and female suicide rates rose in Japan, but the rates for men went up faster. Altogether, the net effect of these divergent mortality trends for men and women in Japan underlie much of the observed widening of its sex differential in longevity in recent years.

AB It is well known that childhood adversities (CAs) are a significant risk factor for mental disorders in later life. However, it is uncertain whether a similar association between CAs and mental disorders can be found in Japan. Few studies have employed an appropriate statistical model that takes into account the high comorbidity of CAs. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the association between CAs and the onset of mental disorders in Japan. We used the data from the World Mental Health Japan, 2002-2004 (n = 1722). Respondents completed diagnostic interviews (the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview) that assessed lifetime prevalence of 15 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) disorders. Associations of 12 retrospectively reported CAs with the lifetime prevalence of mental disorders were estimated using discrete-time survival analysis. Of the study sample, 32% reported as having experienced at least 1 CA during childhood. The studied CAs were highly comorbid. Parental mental illness showed significant sub-additive effects. The presence of 3 CAs showed a significant interactive effect on any mental health disorder. The number of CAs had a strong interactive effect on the onset of anxiety disorders. Predictive effects of CAs were found only among childhood onset mental disorders. It was confirmed that CAs are one of predictors of the onset of DSM-IV mental disorders, especially during childhood, in Japan. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Clinical characteristics of suicidal behavior in an intensive care unit

AB Background: Suicidal behavior accounts for at least 40,000 admissions per year to emergency departments in Japan; however, little is known about emergency admissions owing to suicidal behavior in metropolitan areas. Therefore, we examined the clinical characteristics of suicidal behavior using psychosocial assessments performed by experienced psychiatrists in an intensive care unit.
   Methods: Participants were 971 patients admitted to a university hospital's intensive care unit for suicidal behavior between July 2006 and June 2013. Physicians and psychiatrists regularly assessed the participants using a standard data extraction form while the participants were in the intensive care unit. As suicidal behavior involving drug overdose is generally less fatal than other methods, we predicted that clinical characteristics would differ between patients with and without overdose. We classified participants into drug overdose or other method groups (ns = 732 and 239, respectively) to compare suicide methods.
   Results: In the overdose group, participants' median age was approximately 5 years lower, and the following proportions were larger: female participants (77%) and participants with borderline personality disorders (21% vs. 10%), no clear suicidal ideation (30% vs. 15%), impulsively attempted self-harm (86% vs. 62%), and interpersonal problems (26% vs. 16%).
   Conclusion: Ameliorating interpersonal problems and improving stress coping skills would benefit people who attempt suicide via overdose.

ID INJURY; CARE
AB This study analyzes patient demographics and injury data of 342 patients transported by ambulance to emergency facilities in Akita Prefecture, Japan, between 1996 and 2000, Significant findings include the following. Fire was the most frequent cause of burn injury, and winter was the season with the highest incidence (40.6%) of cases. The suicide rate in Akita Prefecture is high, the percentage of burn patients due to suicide attempts was 7.9%. The mean time from burn injury to hospital arrival was significantly longer for patients who later died (44.6+/-35.3 min) than for those survived (33.0+/-22.5 min). Severely burned patients were not always transported directly to a core emergency facility and an unacceptable number (5.8%) of patients died at tertiary hospitals. This relatively high death rate is attributable to the limited facilities for treating burns in the tertiary hospitals and the long distance to core facilities, which sometimes precludes transport system for the prefecture will reduce transport time to the regional trauma center and thus enable more patients to undergo specialized treatment at an earlier injury stage. Additionally, tertiary facilities should improve their level of burn care (e.g., creating a burn unit and skin bank). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE thymos (desire for recognition); seppuku (ritual suicide); aesthetics;

AB This study attempts to explore the possible motivations, both obvious and problematic, behind the ritual suicide (seppuku) committed by the Japanese writer in the name of the Emperor at the Eastern Headquarters of Japan's Self-Defense Forces in 1970. History does not seem to be a coherent or intelligible process, as man's struggle for nourishment is most often replaced by thymos, the desire for others to recognize his value or the value system of the ideals or noble purposes he is ready to sacrifice for, ignoring the basic instinct of self-conservation. Yukio Mishima was extremely pessimistic about pragmatic and materialistic contemporary Japan. History brought along increasing consumerism, thus disturbing the harmony of traditional Japanese spirituality. The technological ability to improve human existence seemed to alter inevitably the moral evolution of contemporary Japanese. Against this background of ruling "costs" and "benefits", the Japanese writer seems to believe that it is only the thymotic man, the "man of anger", who can fight for the recognition and salvation of the Japanese soul (yamato damashii). Believed for centuries to be the true art of dying, Yukio Mishima's seppuku turned from a "beautiful" gesture into one of protest and accusation: the Japanese society had begun the transition from a closed society to an open one, governed by anxiety, in which individuals faced personal decisions.

AB Objective: Recent studies showed that reducing the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) could cause negative health outcomes among youth. This evidence was drawn primarily from a limited set of geographical regions. This study seeks to widen available evidence by using data from Japan, where the government started considering reducing the MLDA from 20 to 18. Method: Using a regression discontinuity design, we compared emergency service event rates related to alcohol intoxication and mortality rates through external causes between those who were slightly younger and older than the age of 20. Results: We showed that granting legal access to alcohol at age 20 doubled the use of emergency services used for alcohol intoxication but had little impact on mortality as measured by traffic fatalities, suicide, and other accidents. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that lowering the MLDA in Japan will increase (potentially reckless and excessive) drinking behavior among young adults ages 18 and 19 but will not increase their mortality from accidents.

AB Cholecystokinin (CCK), a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS), co-exists in a large portion of A10 dopamine neurons to exert some effect on dopamine behavior. The aim of this study was to determine whether any association exists between the genotype of CCK gene promoter regions (-45C/T and -196G/A) and suicidal behavior. Genotypes and allele frequencies of CCK -45C/T and -196G/A were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis on the genomic DNA from selected suicide victims (N = 154) and from control subjects (N=328). Statistical analysis was performed using the Mantel-Haesnzel chi(2)-test and multiple logistic regression analysis with distinction of gender. An association between CCK -196G/A polymorphism and suicidal behavior in Japanese males was confirmed by statistical analysis (Odds ratio: 3.462, 95% CI: 1.128-10.626, P = 0.038 by multiple logistic regression analysis). However, a significant association between CCK -196G/A polymorphism and suicidal behavior was not discovered in females. The polymorphism of the CCK gene promoter region was found to represent a susceptibility factor for suicidal behavior in Japanese males. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Injury to lumbar arteries is a relatively uncommon finding. Nevertheless, once damaged, they can become a significant source of hemorrhage, especially because such injuries can be easily overlooked. Also, their exposure is difficult during surgery.(1) These lesions have been more often reported in association with blunt(1-5) and penetrating trauma (6.7) and as a complication of spinal surgery and other interventions. (8-14) There are no reports of lumbar arterial damage associated with self-inflicted penetrating trauma.
   The so-called hara-kiri was an ancient Japanese form of suicide. It is exceptionally rare nowadays, representing only an insignificant fraction of total suicides in Japan.(15,16) This unusual method involves disembowelment by slashing the abdomen from side to side. Because of the nature of the offensive mechanism, multiple abdominal organs can be severely wounded. In fact, most of them necessitate surgical repair.(17)
   We describe the management of a patient who failed to conclude hara-kiri. In this case, he was not able to shift the blade further, which allowed prompt emergency treatment without much damage. Surgical evaluation and repair were warranted, but uncontrollable intraoperative hemorrhage demanded an interventional radiologic approach.

AB Background: It is well recognized that the season of the year exerts an influence on some diseases and causes of death such as coronary heart diseases, stroke, infectious diseases and so on. Methods: We evaluated the influence of seasonal changes on diseases and causes of death in Japan using the Japan Vital Statistics from 1970 to 1999 and recorded weather data (mean temperature), by a Fourier decomposition in a log linear regression model. Results: Major influences of seasonal change with the highest rates in winter were seen on the following: the overall causes of death; infectious and parasitic diseases including tuberculosis; respiratory disease, including pneumonia and influenza; heart and cerebrovascular diseases; diabetes; and digestive diseases and accidents. Two peaks were seen in suicides, a large peak in April and a small peak in autumn. Cancer and homicides were little or not at all influenced by seasonality. There was no major difference in changes between the years studied, except for respiratory disease and tuberculosis, which showed a clear reduction in the seasonality effect from 1970 to 1999. Conclusions: To reduce the overall mortality rate and to prolong life expectancy in Japan, measures must be taken to reduce those mortality rates associated with seasonal differences, especially those causes of death which show a strong correlation with seasonal change: respiratory, heart, cerebrovascular, diabetes and infectious diseases.

ID RISK-FACTORS; ADOLESCENT SUICIDE; SCALE; YOUNG
AB Background: The rate of suicides markedly increased in 1998 and leveled off at approximately 30,000 per year thereafter. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the link between the different dimensions of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation among the middle-aged population in Japan.
   Method: A sample of 6848 middle-aged (40-60 years of age) working individuals completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and a questionnaire measuring suicidal ideation. The responses on the four dimensions of depressive symptoms on the CES-D (depressed affect, lack of positive affect, somatic symptoms, and interpersonal problems) were entered into regression analyses that predicted the presence of suicidal ideation among the participants with probable depression (n=1704).
   Results: The factor score of depressed affect was significantly higher in females than in males, whereas that of interpersonal problems was significantly higher in males than in females. Among both males and females, depressed affect was a significant predictor of suicidal ideation. Among males, interpersonal problems also significantly predicted suicidal ideation. Contrary to the results of a previous study among adolescents, we did not find a relationship between lack of positive affect and suicidal ideation.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate that the dimensions of depressive symptoms measured with the CES-D make different contributions to suicidal ideation. Although our results could not be generalizable to a clinical setting due to lacking clinical samples, the depressed affect dimension of CES-D might be useful for screening of suicide risk among community population. Furthermore, gender differences in the relationships between the dimensions of depressive symptoms in a middle-aged population were identified. Additional studies are needed to examine gender-specific relationships between the dimensions of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Descriptive epidemiology of traumatic spinal injury in Japan
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID CORD-INJURY; FALLS
AB Background: Spine injury epidemiology in Japan has not been studied since the 1990s when its incidence was 39.4e40.2 per million and the major cause of injury was motor vehicle crashes. We elucidate the current epidemiological state of spinal injury and spinal injury patients in Japan for the clinicians and public health prevention programs.
   Methods: Spine injury patients were retrospectively selected from the Japan Trauma Data Bank (JTDB) from 2004 to 2013 for all ages and all spinal injuries. The Abbreviated Injury Scale codes (AIS98) were translated into injuries. The dataset was contributed by 241 hospitals nationwide. The data was analysed for the causes of spinal injury, injury severity, age, gender differences, injury types, survival, anatomic location, circumstances of injury and medical history.
   Results: A total of 25,792 (M, 70.1%, F, 29.9%, mean age: 53.4 years) spinal injury patients were recorded in the JTDB from 2004 to 2013, when multiple injuries were included the number of cases swelled to 33,892 (M, 70.4%, F, 29.6%). The number of patients with spinal injuries as a percentage of all traumatic patients in the JTDB was observed to increase from 2004 (15.4%) to 2013 (17.6%). The aetiology of the injuries was mostly falls (52.4%) and motor vehicle crashes (39.8%). Most injuries occurred at the cervical spine level (49.7%). Medical histories of cardiovascular diseases were found, due mostly to hypertension (19.6%). In total, most of the injuries were associated with fractures (64.8%) and others (30.7%) involved the spinal cord. Suicides (12.0%) and industrial accidents (9.0%) caused spine injury were uniquely prevalent in the population.
   Conclusion: The number of spine injuries has increased in the JTDB between 2004 and 2013. Motor vehicle crashes have been replaced by falls due to various causes as the leading cause of spine injury. Suicides and industrial accidents are becoming a burden. More studies are needed to verify the actual incidence. (C) 2017 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Data concerning clinical cases of pesticide poisoning from 1998 to 2002 from the hospitals affiliated with the Japanese Association of Rural Medicine were analyzed. 346 cases of poisoning by agricultural chemicals were reported from 65 hospitals. Suicides accounted for 70% of pesticide poisoning cases, followed by accidental exposures during spraying work (16%) and accidental ingestion (8%). The majority of cases were acute or subacute systemic poisonings (90%), followed by acute dermatitis (5%) and chemical burns (3%). Organophosphate insecticide was the most frequent inducer of clinical cases (36%), followed by bipyridylium herbicide (20%) and carbamate insecticide (6%). The death rate from poisoning by the herbicide paraquat was more than 70% of clinical cases, even though it is a low-concentration product, whereas those from the alternative herbicides, glufosinate and glyphosate, were less than 10%.

ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; EXPERIENCE
AB Background: Major depression is a well-documented risk factor for suicide in cancer patients as well as in the general population. However, there are no data explaining why some cancer patients suffering from major depression have suicidal ideation whereas others with the same disorder do not.
   Methods: We investigated the background differences between cancer patients suffering from major depression with and without suicidal ideation by analyzing consultation data on patients referred to the Psychiatry Division, National Cancer Center Hospital, Japan.
   Results: Univariate analysis showed that poor performance status, advanced stage and severe depression were the risk factors for suicidal ideation in these depressive cancer patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that older age and severe depression are the final significant risk factors.
   Conclusion: These preliminary findings suggest that severe major depression may be an important indicator of suicidal ideation among cancer patients, that patients' age should be given greater attention and that closer monitoring and more intensive intervention against major depression may be needed.

ID SUICIDE
AB This is a case report of suicidal ingestion of chlorfenapyr, presenting with neurological complications after a latent period of more than a week, and rapidly progressing to death within days of symptoms. Chlorfenapyr is a moderately hazardous pesticide according to World Health Organization toxicity classification, and kills target organism by depriving it of energy through interference with oxidative phosphorylation at mitochondrial level. A pro-pesticide, chlorfenapyr takes time to convert to its active form and either this active form or a toxic metabolite causes delayed neurological symptoms. It causes significant neurotoxicity in rat models. This case report provides for the first time from India (second worldwide), clinical and "radiological evidence" (magnetic resonance imaging showing demyelinating/oedematous changes) of "chlorfenapyr neurotoxicity in humans." It also highlights the "latent period" between ingestion and onset of fatal manifestations. Earlier, similar case reports of human deaths with delayed onset neurological symptoms, due to chlorfenapyr poisoning have been reported, from Japan, Columbia, and Korea.

AB Palliative sedation (PS) is the use of medications to induce decreased or absent awareness in order to relieve otherwise Intractable suffering at the end of life. Although uncommon, some patients undergoing aggressive symptom control measures still have severe suffering from underlying disease or therapy-related adverse effects. In these circumstances, use of PS is considered. Although the goal is to provide relief In an ethically acceptable way to the patient, family, and health care team, health care professionals often voice concerns whether such treatment Is necessary or whether such treatment equates to physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia. In this review, we frame clinical scenarios in which PS may be considered, summarize the ethical underpinnings of the practice, and further differentiate PS from other forms of end-of-life care, Including withholding and/or withdrawing life-sustaining therapy and physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia.

ID DRINKING-WATER
AB The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association between lithium levels in the public water supply and prefecture-based suicide rates in Greece. Analyses were conducted with respect to lithium levels in 149 samples from 34 prefectures of Greece. The average lithium level was 11.10 mu g/l (range 0.1 to 121 mu g/l). The results indicate that there is a tendency for lower suicide rates in the prefectures with high levels of lithium in drinking water. Ecological studies explained by researchers Schrauzer and Shrestha have revealed the existence of statistically significant inverse associations between the lithium levels in drinking water and the incidence of suicides, homicides, rapes, possession of narcotic drugs, and in juveniles, the rates of runaway from home. Such a result of inverse relationship was not proven by Kabacs et al., most likely because the differences of the lithium levels in the selection of their case-control samples were not large enough. In addition, probably the selection of random regions in Japan and East England might have been biased. Thus, the addition of small amounts of lithium to the drinking water could provide an effective means to lower the incidence of these conditions in the general population. Furthermore, the nutritional importance of lithium in the form of the carbonate named lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) is currently still viewed primarily as a pharmacological agent. The study by Al-Chalabi et al. state that the therapeutic activity of lithium in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is worth investigating. Any drug that can be shown to slow the course of ALS in a clinically significant way and to be safe and well tolerated will be an important advance for patients with this disease.

AB Completed suicide (CS) is a leading cause of death worldwide and its rates are available for most developed countries. On the other hand, attempted suicide (AS) is a risk factor for CS but there are limited data on its rates in various countries. In constructing a ratio for AS/CS rates, most would agree that for CS, the denominator should be the annual suicide rate ( per 100 000). As for the ratio's numerator (AS) per 100 000, there are three possible calculations: (1) annual prevalence from population surveys, (2) annual prevalence from national clinical registers or (3) lifetime prevalence from population surveys. We think that the first possibility would probably be the best choice but, unfortunately, surveys providing the annual prevalence of AS are lacking for most countries. Annual prevalence from national registers is also lacking for most countries and is contaminated by under-reporting. Therefore, in this editorial, we are left with only the last option, a ratio for lifetime prevalence of AS (per 100 000) divided by annual rate of CS (per 100 000). This ratio for AS/CS rates appears to differ substantially across countries worldwide but presents no big regional differences other than two remarkable exceptions, one per continent. In Europe, Spain and France had greater ratios (174.4 and 152.5, respectively) than Italy (64.1). In Asia/Pacific, New Zealand has a higher ratio (345.9) compared with China (75.8) and Japan (76.9). The ratio for AS/CS rates could be a good index for implementing evidence-informed decision-making regarding suicidal behaviour (SB) among health service managers, and for helping them in the allocation of health resources for the prevention of SB.

   RECESSIONS; DEATH; HEART; HYPOTHESIS; EXPERIENCE; INCREASE
AB Recent research has shown that after long-term declining trends are excluded, mortality rates in industrial countries tend to rise in economic expansions and fall in economic recessions. In the present work, co-movements between economic fluctuations and mortality changes in postwar Japan are investigated by analyzing time series of mortality rates and eight economic indicators. To eliminate spurious associations attributable to trends, series are detrended either via Hodrick-Prescott filtering or through differencing. As previously found in other industrial economies, general mortality and age-specific death rates in Japan tend to increase in expansions and drop in recessions, for both males and females. The effect, which is slightly stronger for males, is particularly noticeable in those aged 45-64. Deaths attributed to heart disease, pneumonia, accidents, liver disease, and senility-making up about 41% of total mortality-tend to fluctuate procyclically, increasing in expansions. Suicides, as well as deaths attributable to diabetes and hypertensive disease, make up about 4% of total mortality and fluctuate countercyclically, increasing in recessions. Deaths attributed to other causes, making up about half of total deaths, don't show a clearly defined relationship with the fluctuations of the economy.

AB To date, only few reports are available regarding the long-term outcome of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in Japan. We conducted a retrospective follow-up study on the long-term outcome and predictive factors of BPD in Japan. Of 72 patients who received treatment at Fukuoka University Hospital between 1973 and 1989 and met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria for BPD retrospectively, 19 patients (26.4%) were followed up. We evaluated global outcome at follow-up using the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale scored from a completed self-reported questionnaire. The mean Global Assessment of Functioning score was 60.7, which meant fair to good functioning. The suicide rate was 6.9% (5/72). Using a logistic regression model, overinvolvement in family relationships and the number of medical facilities where patient was previously treated predicted poor outcome. These results are similar to those reported in the United States and Canada, except for the result that Japanese patients with BPD are more likely to live with their original family at follow-up than American patients.

AB The early detection of depression and suicidal ideation is essential for the prevention of suicide in the community. This study therefore aimed to develop a brief screen for depression and suicidal ideation that can be easily administered in primary-care settings. The Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and a modified version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) were administered by 353 residents of a single community aged 64 years and over. A five-item screen was derived from SDS and HADS, using CIDI as the external criterion (study 1). The scale was modified so that it was more appropriate for our use, and was labeled the Depression and Suicide Screen (DSS). Its validity and reliability were examined among a further 382 residents of the same community aged 64 years and over, using the Short-Form Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-S) as the external criterion (study 2). The DSS was internally consistent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.62). Its reliability in detecting depression (defined as >= 6 in GDS-S) and suicidal ideation (screened out by the inquiry by our trained staff) was 0.768 and 0.721, respectively. For depression, the sensitivity was 0.705; specificity, 0.729; positive predictive value (PPV), 0.446; negative predictive value (NPV), 0.888; and the overall diagnostic power, 0.723. For suicidal ideation, its sensitivity was 0.698; specificity, 0.693; PPV, 0.317; NPV, 0.926; and overall diagnostic power, 0.694. The DSS demonstrated a reasonable level of sensitivity and specificity in identifying both depression and suicidal ideation among the elderly within a community.

AB Background: A significant proportion of suicidal persons do not seek help for their psychological problems. Psychological help-seeking is assumed to be a protective factor for suicide. However, different studies showed that negative attitudes and stigma related to help-seeking are major barriers to psychological help-seeking. These attitudes and stigma are not merely individual characteristics but they are also developed by and within society. The aim of this study is twofold. First, we investigate if persons with a suicidal past differ from people without a suicidal past with respect to help-seeking intentions, attitudes toward help-seeking, stigma and attitudes toward suicide. The second aim is to investigate if these attitudinal factors differ between people living in two regions with similar socioeconomic characteristics but deviating suicide rates.
   Method: We defined high (Flemish Community of Belgium) and low (The Netherlands) suicide regions and drew a representative sample of the general Flemish and Dutch population between 18 and 65 years. Data were gathered by means of a postal questionnaire. Descriptive statistics are presented to compare people with and without suicidal past. Multiple logistic regressions were used to compare Flemish and Dutch participants with a suicidal past.
   Results: Compared to people without a suicidal past, people with a suicidal past are less likely to seek professional and informal help, perceive more stigma, experience more sell stigma (only men) and shame (only women) when seeking help and have more accepting attitudes toward suicide. In comparison to their Dutch counterparts, Flemish people with a suicidal past have less often positive attitudes toward help seeking, less intentions to seek professional and informal (only women) help and have less often received help for psychological problems (only men).
   Limitations: The main limitations are: the relatively low response rate; suicidal ideation was measured by retrospective self report, and the research sample includes only participants between 18 and 65 years old.
   Conclusions: Having a suicidal past is associated with attitudinal and stigmatizing barriers toward help seeking and accepting attitudes toward suicide. Prevention strategies should therefore target people with a suicidal history with special attention for attitudes, self stigma and feelings of shame related to help seeking. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

ID MEXICO
AB From the epidemic perspective, suicide appears as an international public health problem due to the remarkable increase of its incidence. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in the year 2000, suicide had the greater percentage (49%) in the statistics of "deaths by intentional injuries"; followed by violence (32%) and war (19%).
   This source also notifies that in countries with population over 100 millions, Mexico is the country that shows the higher increase of "changes in age-standardized groups in specific intervals of time" (+61, 9% in period 81-83/93-95). Followed in descendent order by: India (+54%, period 80-93), Brazil (+13.2%, period 79-81/93-93), and the Russian Federation (+5.3%, period 80-82/96-98). The United States of America (-5.3%, period 80-82/93-97) and Japan (-14.3%, period 80-82/95-97) have shown decreasing rates.
   The increase in the rates of suicide in Mexico has been registered by various studies, which also have proved that the States where those rates were the highest are: Veracruz, Mexico City and, in third place, Guanajuato.
   Some specific sectors of Guanajuato State show an association of two phenomena: suicide and migration, basically migrants travelling to the United States of America and Canada, both countries with a high frequency of suicides. The information on suicide in Mexico come from sources such as local or international studies, and also from reports obtained through public institutions, the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, Geografia e Informatica (INEGI), the Secreteria de Salud (SS) and the Procuraduria General de Justicia (PGJ). Nevertheless, the data given by these institutions show discrepancies in statistics, a fact due perhaps to differences in the classification criteria for deaths, and to registration and filing mistakes.
   The aim of the present research was to collect and report epidemiological data on suicides and the characteristics of the suicidal events, in the State of Guanajuato, during the period between 1995 and 2001. To this purpose the files of the PGJ in Guanajuato State were analyzed; these files contain detailed information about suicides and the suicidal act, as well as the transcription of suicidal notes, in case they be left. They also contain declarations and testimonies from people who are close (relatives, friends, acquaintances) to the suicidal victim.
   The data gathered included socio-demographical information, migrant condition, variables related to the Suicidal act, alcohol and drug use at the moment of the event, and the transcription of the suicidal note. The declarations and testimonies from the suicide acquaintances were kept for further studies.
   The data-gathering lasted six months and was made by last semester students of the Faculty of Psychology.
   Data were analyzed according to the State distribution Of the PGJ that divides it into 4 zones: Leon, Irapuato, Celaya and San Miguel de Allende. Frequency analysis were made and for some variables, chi square statistical tests.
   Of the 747 cases of death caused by suicide registered by the PGJ in Guanajuato, during the 1995 - 2001 period, 733 were analyzed because the lacking 13 files Could not be located. From the total of cases 80.1% were men and 19.9%, women. The rank of age goes from 8 to 9 1 years. The average for men was 30 years and the mode 20 years; for women the average was 28 wars and the mode 18 years old. This shows that Suicide was committed at,an earlier age by women than by men.
   Only 10% of the whole had no schooling; almost half of the total had completed elementary Studies and 21% had attained high school level. Besides, 30% of the people who committed suicide were employees and only 1.6% were professionals.
   Regarding the characteristics of the suicidal act, the place more used to committ it, was the suicide's house (78%), mainly in the case of women (with significant difference) (p=.001). The suicide method used in most cases was different for both sexes: men preferred hanging (p=.001), and women poisoning (p=.001).
   Forty one per cent of the men had ingested alcohol before committing suicide and only 7.8% of the women. In addition, alcohol use was more frequent in the group of 35 to 44 years of age, and by those who were married. The use of other drugs was present in 13% of the total (no significant differences between sexes).
   As to the migration phenomenon, most of migrant suicides were between 20 and 34 years old. The rate of non-migrant suicides was 4:1 (4 men committed suicide for every suicidal women) and it changed in the migrant group to 3:2. This migration phenomenon is data included: returning migrants, people who were going to leave Mexico in the near future (one day or week later) and also people who had one or more close relatives living as migrant laborers in the northern countries.
   Finally, other differences found when comparing the migrant group with the non-migrants Suicidal group are: the greater use of firearms registered as suicidal method (p=.001) and the higher percentage of psychiatric medication.
   On the other hand, the higher frequency Of Suicides was registered in the month of May (13%), and the lower percentage in October (5.7%).
   State regionalization, showed the higher percentage of suicides in Celaya (254 cases), and the lower corresponded to San Miguel de Allende (103 cases).
   It may be concluded that in the State Of Guanajuato the phenomenon of suicide presents alarming peculiarities: more risked groups include children, adolescents and Young people (this sample found 42 suicidal children under 14 years old).
   Also, considering that migration is the most important social phenomenon in Guanajuato State, we may observe that it has contributed to modify the patterns Of Suicide of some population groups. This is shown by the increasing suicidal women percentage and the most frequent use of firearms, drug and alcohol usage, and psychiatric medication; a possible explanation to this has to do with the Cultural shock of the migration process.
   Although it is difficult to consider the suicidal phenomenon as a consequence of drug abuse and vice versa, from the current frequency of suicide cases involved with drugs, at least at the moment of death, we may observe that this circumstance increases the complexity and difficulty, of the suicide problem.
   Finally, we may stress that obtaining information through the files of the PGJ demonstrated to be fruitful, because they have important elements to consider in the suicide research. Data as the transcription Of suicide notes, the declaration of relatives or close friends of the suicide, and the detailed description of the suicidal event, aren't registered by Other instances. Nevertheless, it is urgent to combine the efforts of the institutions related to the study of the suicidal behaviors, in order to systematize and to unify, the official statistics. This will optimize the registration forms and add some variables aimed to favor research purposes.

AB Background: Patients with psychiatric disorders have a high rate of suicide. The present study investigated factors influencing hospital stays for Japanese patients with psychiatric disorders attempting suicide by jumping.
   Methods: We diagnosed all suicide attempts (n = 113) by jumping based on the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) and investigated the mean hospital stays of patients with each diagnosis based on the ICD-10 code. We then analyzed differences in the demographic and clinical characteristics between the diagnostic groups to identify factors influencing the duration of hospital stay.
   Results: Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (F2 code) were the most frequent (32.7%) of all diagnoses; therefore, we divided the diagnostic groups into schizophrenia group (n = 37) and other psychiatric diagnoses group (n = 76). The patients with schizophrenia showed a significantly longer hospital stay (125.7 +/- 63.9 days) compared with the patients with other psychiatric diagnoses (83.6 +/- 63.2) (beta +/- SE = 42.1 +/- 12.7, p = 0.0013), whereas there was no difference in the jump height between the two groups (the average was the 3rd to 4th floor; p > 0.05). The number of injured parts, particularly lower- limb fractures, was significantly higher (p = 0.017) in patients with schizophrenia than in patients with other psychiatric diagnoses. The duration of psychiatric treatment in patients with schizophrenia were significantly longer (z = 3.4, p = 0.001) than in patients with other psychiatric diagnoses.
   Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the number of injuries and the body parts injured in patients with schizophrenia are associated with a longer duration of hospital stay following a suicide attempt by jumping. The current use of antipsychotics and a longer duration of taking antipsychotics might contribute to the risk of bone fracture via hyperprolactinemia. Further cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia might prevent rehabilitation for the management of lower- limb fractures. From these results, we suggest that clinicians should monitor the level of prolactin and cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia in future studies on managing of lower- limb fractures.

AB The purpose of this study was to assess middle-aged Japanese workers for possible gender differences in the risk factors associated with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. 5,878 workers (40-60 yr of age) (3,631 males and 2,247 females) were recruited from randomly selected companies in northern Japan. Demographic and lifestyle factors, suicidal ideation rate, and the data for the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJSQ) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies for Depression scale (CES-D) were obtained from the self-report questionnaires. After adjusting for possible confounding variables, marital status, absent of stress reduction technique and low job compatibility were significant independent risk factors for suicidal ideation among males. In females, marital status, feeling of insufficient sleep and absence of stress reduction techniques were significant independent risk factors after adjusting for all variables. Under the same adjustments, temporary employment also showed a protective effect against female suicidal ideation. In conclusion, our results suggest that factors related to suicidal ideation differed by gender. Different approaches for each gender might be useful in the development of suicide prevention programs. However, interpretation of work-related effects, such as temporary employment, interpersonal conflict and transportation industry, was hampered by lack of data concerning personal income, working hours and organizational commitment. Additional studies are needed to examine the longitudinal relationships between the risk factors associated with suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms.

AB Psychiatric nursing is a stressful area of nursing practice. The purpose of this study was to examine occupational stress among psychiatric nurses in Japan. In this cross-sectional study, 238 psychiatric nurses were recruited from 7 hospitals. Data regarding the Generic Job Stress Questionnaire (GJSQ), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies for Depression Scale (CES-D), and the Health Practice Index (HPI) were obtained via self-report questionnaires. After adjusting for all the variables, CES-D scores were associated with job stress, but social support reduced the effect of stress on depression among psychiatric nurses. However, the interpretation of these results was hampered by the lack of data concerning important occupational factors, such as working position, personal income, and working hours. Further longitudinal investigation into the factors associated with depression may yield useful information for administrative and psychological interventions.

AB There have been few population studies of hikikomori (that is, prolonged social withdrawal and isolation), and the basic correlating factors of hikikomori are yet to be identified. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the associated basic characteristics and psychiatric factors of hikikomori. Data were obtained from the Survey of Young People's Attitudes of 5,000 residents (aged 15-39 years) who were randomly selected from 200 urban and suburban municipalities in Japan in February 2010. The chi-square test and multiple logistic regression were used in the analysis. The data contained 3,262 participants (response rate: 65.4%); 47.7% were men (n = 1,555) and 52.3% were women (n = 1,707). Its prevalence was 1.8% (n = 58), and 41% had been in the hikikomori state for more than 3 years. There were fewer hikikomori people in neighborhoods filled with business and service industries. Significantly more men were in the hikikomori group (65.5%) than in the non-hikikomori group (47.3%). The hikikomori group was more likely to drop out of education (p < .001) and to have a psychiatric treatment history compared with non-hikikomori (37.9% vs 5%, p < .001). The multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that interpersonal relationships were significantly associated with hikikomori across three models (Model 1 adjusting for all basic characteristics, OR = 2.30, 95% CI = 1.92-2.76; Model 2 further adjusting for mental health-related factors, OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.64-2.68; Model 3 further adjusting for a previous psychiatric treatment history, OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.52-2.51). Additionally, the hikikomori group was more likely to have suicide risk factors (Model 1: OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.56-2.20; Model 2: OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.05-1.67), obsessive-compulsive behaviors (Model 1: OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.20-2.05), and addictive behaviors (Model 1: OR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.37-2.70). This is the first study to show that hikikomori is associated with interpersonal relationships, followed by suicide risks. Hikikomori people are more likely to be male, have a history of dropping out from education, and have a previous psychiatric treatment history.

AB Viral-mediated transfer of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene has been demonstrated by several investigators to confer sensitivity to nucleoside analogs such as ganciclovir (GCV) in a variety of tumor cells including brain, prostate, bladder, kidney, ovary, head and neck, lung, pancreas, and liver cancers. Fourteen suicide gene clinical protocols using adenovirus vectors have been conducted, including four in prostate cancer. Two additional protocols for prostate cancer are in preparation in Japan and the Netherlands. A study conducted at Baylor College of Medicine was the first to demonstrate the safety of HSV-tk plus GCV therapy for human prostate cancer and the anticancer activity of gene therapy in this disease. However, it is still in the early stage of its development, with a number of problems to be overcome. Systemic delivery, specific introduction, and specific expression of the target gene are the major issues to be managed in order to establish a clinically relevant treatment strategy.

AB Maternal mortality rates in Japan declined steadily until around 2007, after which they plateaued, with current numbers residing at 2.7-4.8/100,000 total births. A more accurate grasp on the number of maternal deaths and suicide cases among pregnant women and those within 1 year postpartum is needed. These data must be analyzed in order to provide countermeasures and knowledge on emergency life-saving measures. To this end, the entire medical team should attend training so that the various problems may be resolved among multidisciplinary professionals and better treatment and management may be provided, facilitating a proper response to any situation. Establishing cooperative relationships with higher level medical institutions to which patients may need to be transferred is also important. Sharing case histories and courses in regular case conferences and debriefing sessions would also be beneficial.

AB Nurses play a critical role in delivering care to elderly people at primary health care level but there is no synthesis of research knowledge to guide community nursing practice in Japan. This review aims to identify nurse-led interventions that have been found to improve elder health at village level; the barriers and constraints that service providers face when delivering care to the elderly; and the experiences of elderly people and their caregivers. The electronic databases such as MEDLINE, CINAHL and Google Scholar were searched to retrieve peer-reviewed primary research literature. A narrative synthesis of the findings sections of the papers was applied to identify key themes. These themes are: socioculturally appropriate care; health improvements; barriers and constraints to care delivery and; experience of the elderly and families. Seven papers were included in the review. The synthesis identified that nurse-led health care for the elderly in rural Japan can be effective when it is targeted and culturally sensitive. The studies highlight a number of barriers to the provision of care. There is a need for further research to examine the issues affecting access to rural nursing care including health system factors, as well as the needs of the elderly and families themselves. Such studies will better inform the delivery of programs, reduce inequity and provide socio-culturally appropriate care to improve the well-being of the elderly.

AB Objective Changes in mortality inequalities across socioeconomic groups have been a substantial public health concern worldwide. We investigated changes in absolute/relative mortality inequalities across occupations, and the contribution of different diseases to inequalities in tandem with the restructuring of the Japanese economy.
   Methods Using complete Japanese national death registries from 5 year intervals (1980-2010), all cause and cause specific age standardised mortality rates (ASMR per 100 000 people standardised using the Japanese standard population in 1985, aged 30-59 years) across 12 occupations were computed. Absolute and relative inequalities were measured in ASMR differences (RDs) and ASMR ratios (RRs) among occupations in comparison with manufacturing workers (reference). We also estimated the changing contribution of different diseases by calculating the differences in ASMR change between 1995 and 2010 for occupations and reference.
   Results All cause ASMRs tended to decrease in both sexes over the three decades except for male managers (increased by 71% points, 1995-2010). RDs across occupations were reduced for both sexes (civil servants 233.5 to -1.9 for men; sales workers 63.3 to 4.5 for women) but RRs increased for some occupations (professional workers 1.38 to 1.70; service workers 2.35 to 3.73) for men and decreased for women from 1980 to 2010. Male relative inequalities widened among farmer, fishery and service workers, because the percentage declines were smaller in these occupations. Cerebrovascular disease and cancer were the main causes of the decrease in mortality inequalities among sexes but the incidence of suicide increased among men, thereby increasing sex related inequalities.
   Conclusions Absolute inequality trends in mortality across occupations decreased in both sexes, while relative inequality trends were heterogeneous in Japan. The main drivers of narrowing and widening mortality inequalities were cerebrovascular disease and suicide, respectively. Future public health efforts will benefit from eliminating residual inequalities in mortality by considering the contribution of the causes of death and socioeconomic status stratification.

AB Aim: Japanese psychiatrists have increasingly reported patients with depression that does not seem to fit the criteria of the ICD-10 and the DSM-IV, and which has recently been called modern type depression (MTD). We explored whether MTD is frequently seen in Japan and also in other countries, and if so, how patients with MTD are diagnosed and treated.
   Methods: The questionnaires, with two case vignettes (traditional type depression (TTD) and MTD), were sent to psychiatrists in Australia, Bangladesh, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the USA. Participants rated their opinions about each case's prevalence in their country, etiology, diagnosis, suicide risk, and treatment using Likert scales.
   Results: Out of 247 responses (123 from Japan and 124 from other countries), two hundred thirty-nine valid responses were received. MTD was recognized in all participating countries, and especially in urban areas. Generally, the factor of personality was regarded as the most probable cause of MTD. Whereas about 90% of Japanese psychiatrists applied the ICD/DSM criteria to TTD, only about 60% applied the criteria to MID.
   Conclusion: Our results indicate that Japan's MID seems to be occurring in many other countries, and that the present ICD/DSM criteria may not be sufficient to diagnose MID. Therefore, it could be an important candidate for a new international diagnostic criterion as a subtype of depression. A clear diagnostic framework and consensus on the interventions to treat MID would be valuable. Further clinical, psychopathological and international epidemiological studies are needed to confirm our preliminary findings of MID. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The number of foreign workers in Japan, especially temporary workers, has been increasing recently. However, little is known about the mental health status of the foreign workers working temporarily in Japan. We examined the depressive symptoms in 81 Chinese factory workers and attempted to identify the determining factors. The subjects were requested to complete individual questionnaires on sociodemographic variables (sex, age group, and residence period in Japan), working condition variables (number of working days per week and working hours per day), health administration variables (health checkups and health education), a social support variable (interpreters at workplace), and health behavior variables (alcohol consumption, current smoking, and regular exercise). The 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) was used to measure the depressive symptoms. Of all the subjects, 95% and 84% received health checkups and health education, respectively, at their workplaces. The results of multiple linear regression analysis showed that long working hours per day were significantly associated with high CES-D score. Further, we found that older age (30-49 yr) was marginally associated with high CES-D score. Health administration considering working time and age would be important for decreasing depressive symptoms among foreign workers.

TI All ready to die - Kamikazefication and Japan's wartime ideology
SO CRITICAL ASIAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article; Proceedings Paper
CT AAS Annual Meeting 2004

CL San Diego, CA
SP AAS
AB A number of recent works have focused on the personal experiences of kamikaze pilots, but very little has been published in English on the Japanese government's effort to "kamikazefy" the civilian population in the final year of the Asian Pacific War (1937-45). To illustrate this effort, this article employs images taken from the author's personal collection of over 2,500 Japanese wartime publications (predominantly periodicals). In early 1945, the Japanese government announced a "fight to the death for the home islands," in which civilian "home-front warriors" would fight alongside troops in the event of an Allied invasion. Civilian combatants were expected to follow the "no surrender" policy hammered into Japanese servicemen and to emulate the kamikaze pilots' spirit of supreme sacrifice. The article begins with a brief discussion of the ideology behind kamikazefication, inviting comparisons with suicide missions in other times and places. Historical context is further established by an overview of media accounts of Japanese suicide missions in the Asian Pacific War, beginning with the mission carried out at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. An analysis of media reportage shows how members of suicide missions were glorified and made into role models for all Japanese, even women and children. Servicemen who died for their country were enshrined at the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo. The article concludes by suggesting reasons why civilians, even those who died fighting in the war, have not been similarly honored.

AB Aim: This study aimed to investigate factors associated with depression in a sample of elderly Japanese individuals in a rural community and to examine differences among factors associated with individuals living alone or living with others. Methods: Using a population-based sample from rural Japan, we assessed a total of 1552 participants aged 65 years or older by mailing a survey and evaluating responses based on the Geriatric Depression Scale. Factors associated with depression were also examined. Results: We received 964 valid responses. Depressed subjects comprised 20.5% of the sample. Living alone was significantly related to depression. In individuals living alone, depression was associated with loss of appetite, suicidal ideation, financial strain, and worries in life. However, multiple linear regression analyses revealed that the influence of living alone was negated by having a good social support system. Conclusion: These findings confirm that living alone is an important factor in depression among the elderly in a rural part of Japan. Results also confirm what others have found in Western cultures: high levels of social support, awareness of receiving social support, and willingness to receive assistance may reduce the risk of depression.

AB Background We compared mortality inequalities by occupational class in Japan and South Korea with those in European countries, in order to determine whether patterns are similar. Methods National register-based data from Japan, South Korea and eight European countries (Finland, Denmark, England/Wales, France, Switzerland, Italy (Turin), Estonia, Lithuania) covering the period between 1990 and 2015 were collected and harmonised. We calculated age-standardised all-cause and cause-specific mortality among men aged 35-64 by occupational class and measured the magnitude of inequality with rate differences, rate ratios and the average inter-group difference. Results Clear gradients in mortality were found in all European countries throughout the study period: manual workers had 1.6-2.5 times higher mortality than upper non-manual workers. However, in the most recent time-period, upper non-manual workers had higher mortality than manual workers in Japan and South Korea. This pattern emerged as a result of a rise in mortality among the upper non-manual group in Japan during the late 1990s, and in South Korea during the late 2000s, due to rising mortality from cancer and external causes (including suicide), in addition to strong mortality declines among lower non-manual and manual workers. Conclusion Patterns of mortality by occupational class are remarkably different between European countries and Japan and South Korea. The recently observed patterns in the latter two countries may be related to a larger impact on the higher occupational classes of the economic crisis of the late 1990s and the late 2000s, respectively, and show that a high socioeconomic position does not guarantee better health.

AB Recent figures show that more than 30 000 people suicide each year in Japan, and that many of them are considered to suffer from depression. In addition, the suicide rate among Japanese women has been shown to be higher than in other countries. However, it is not clear whether the psychiatric symptoms leading to suicide differ by gender. The authors examined gender differences in psychiatric symptoms related to suicidal ideation (SI) in Japanese patients with depression. Study subjects were 199 new patients (66 men and 133 women) who were diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. SI and psychiatric symptoms were assessed by several psychological tests using questionnaires. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) with an adjustment for all relevant factors simultaneously. The stepwise method was also used for selecting variables. In univariate analysis, several psychosocial factors such as self-reproach, derealization, depressive moods, depersonalization, and anxiety traits were statistically significantly associated with SI in both men and women. However, multivariate analysis using the stepwise method distinguished gender differences. Low social/family support and depersonalization were statistically significantly associated with SI in men, while depressive moods and an anxiety state were significantly associated with SI in women. The relation between derealization and SI was statistically significant in women but not significant in men.

AB AimTo examine the association between the types of involvement in bullying and the time perspective among Japanese adolescents.
   MethodsA questionnaire was conducted among Japanese junior high school students at eight public schools that were located in two cities in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. Shirai's Experiential Time Perspective Scale was used, which comprises four subscales: goal-directedness, hopefulness, self-fulfillment, and acceptance of the past. An analysis of covariance was applied, with the time-perspective subscales as the objective variable, type of involvement in bullying as a fixed factor, and grade, family structure, and economic status as the covariates.
   ResultsThe analysis sample included 2630 adolescents (valid response rate: 88.6%). The bullying rate of the boys was 10.8% and 4.1% for the girls, for the male victims it was 10.1% and 14.5% for the female victims, and for both the bully and the victim, it was 8.5% and 5.4%, respectively. The students who were not involved in bullying had the highest scores of hopefulness, self-fulfillment, and acceptance of the past. For both sexes, bullying was significantly associated with hopefulness, self-fulfillment, and acceptance of the past. Goal-directedness was not associated with the type of involvement in bullying.
   ConclusionsThe victims of bullying had low time perspectives of hopefulness, self-fulfillment, and acceptance of the past. Providing support that increases hopefulness, self-fulfillment, and acceptance of the past might help to prevent pessimistic decision-making, such as that seen in cases of suicide.

AB Long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics (LAI-APs) have several advantages over oral medications, but deaths reported in Japan during the early post-marketing phase vigilance period have raised safety concerns. We conducted a series of meta-analyses to assess whether LAI-APs affect the mortality of patients with schizophrenia. Three categorical meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were performed to compare all-cause death (primary outcome) and death due to suicide: individual and pooled LAI-APs vs placebo, individual and pooled LAI-APs vs oral antipsychotics (OAPs), and head-to-head comparisons of LAI-APs. The risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were calculated. We identified 52 RCTs (53 comparisons; total participants = 17 416, LAI-APs = 11 360, OAP = 3910, and placebo = 2146; mean study duration [wk]: LAI-APs vs placebo = 28.9, LAI-APs vs OAPs = 64.5). Neither pooled nor individual LAI-APs (aripiprazole, fluphenazine, olanzapine, paliperidone, and risperidone) differed from the placebo regarding the incidences of all-cause death (pooled LAI-APs: RR = 0.64, P = .37) and death due to suicide (pooled LAI-APs: RR = 0.98, P = .98). However, in a subgroup meta-analysis of only short-duration RCTs (a parts per thousand currency sign13wk), pooled LAI-APs exhibited a trend toward lower incidence of all-cause death than placebo (RR = 0.29, P = .08). Pooled LAI-APs (aripiprazole, fluphenazine, haloperidol, olanzapine, paliperidone, risperidone, and zuclopenthixol) did not differ from pooled OAPs regarding all-cause death (pooled LAI-APs: RR = 0.71, P = .30) and death due to suicide (pooled LAI-APs: RR = 0.94, P = .91). Individual LAI-APs and OAPs were associated with similar risks of death. Data for head-to-head comparisons of individual LAI-APs were insufficient. In conclusion, there was no significant difference between LAI-APs and placebo or OAPs regarding all-cause death and death due to suicide.

Tohoku J. Exp. Med., 2005, 206 (4), 283-290 - To know the therapeutic level at one's own institute is important and contributes to improving the treatment of patients. We compared the outcomes of extensively burned patients between a Chinese hospital and a Japanese hospital in order to identify the differences in the clinical treatment of severe burn patients. Thirty-four burn patients who were admitted to the National Defense Medical College Hospital (NDMC) in Japan and 95 burn patients who were admitted to the Changhai Hospital of the Second Military Medical University (SMMU) in China from January 1999 to December 2003 were studied. All patients were transported to the respective hospitals within 3 days after suffering burns and their total body surface area of burns was greater than 20%. Fourteen of the 34 patients (41.2%) at NDMC hospital and 1 of the 95 patients (1.1%) at SMMU hospital were injured by attempted suicide; namely, the suicide rate was significantly higher in the patients at NDMC hospital (p < 0.001). Moreover, the age (p = 0.005) and inhalation rate (p = 0.013) were significantly higher at NDMC hospital than those at SMMU hospital. Consequently, the survival rate at SMMU was higher than at NDMC in the patients with a burn surface area of greater than 80% or with a burn index of greater than 60. The excellent outcomes of the extensively burned patients at SMMU were in part due to the fact that Chinese doctors tend to perform an immediate tracheostomy and a traditional Chinese operation with alloskin, called microskin grafting or intermingled skin grafting. - burn; outcome; suicide-rate; tracheostomy; 17 C alloskin.

AB Early onset of psychiatric disorders has been reported to be associated with increased familial risk or more severe clinical symptoms. In this study, we specifically examine the association between clinical severity and early versus late onset in panic disorder. We hypothesize the existence of differences in rates of axis II disorders in these two groups that will relate to clinical severity. Subjects were a consecutive clinical case series of 105 panic disorder patients (age, 18.3 to 70.9 years). Thirty-one panic disorder patients were classified as early onset (age of onset less than or equal to 25 years) and 74 as late onset (age of onset >25). We compared symptomatology and rates of comorbid axis II disorders (diagnosed by structured clinical interview) between the early- and the late-onset groups. We found a statistically significant increase in the number of suicide attempts and likelihood of comorbid axis II disorders in the early-onset group compared to the late-onset group. In logistic regression analyses, cluster B personality disorders (PDs), especially borderline and histrionic, were statistically significantly associated with the presence of suicide attempts. The following limitations are present: first, we have not taken into consideration comorbidity of other axis I disorders, especially major depression. Second, there is imprecision associated with efforts to date the onset of panic disorder retrospectively. We conclude that comorbid axis II disorders are more likely to occur in early-onset panic disorder patients. Cluster B PDs, especially borderline or histrionic, may be associated with a high frequency of suicide attempts in this group. In clinical practice, efforts to aggressively detect and treat axis II disorders in early-onset panic disorder patients are warranted. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Hydrogen Sulfide Suicide: A New Trend and Threat to Healthcare Providers
SO JOURNAL OF BURN CARE & RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB First popularized in Japan, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas suicide is an underreported form of suicide with known risk for secondary disaster. Mortality rate commonly exceeds 90% because of the gas's lethal, noncontained nature. Instances in the United States are increasing, up from 2 cases in 2008 to 18 in 2010. Because H2S poisonings remain rare, there exists a lack of knowledge regarding the residual effects of gas venting after victim extrication. Identifying instances of the efficacious use of personal protection equipment (PPE) is critical in the effort to alleviate risks faced by hospital and rescue personnel. The current case demonstrates the effective use of PPEs after prolonged H2S exposure. In 2011, a 20-year-old man threatened suicide using H2S gas inside a vehicle on a remote rural highway. First responders identified a rotten egg smell and subsequently experienced low poisoning symptoms. After prolonged Hazmat-assisted extrication (4 hours) the patient was unconscious and experiencing seizures. He was decontaminated on-scene (20 minutes) and transported to the closest hospital (22 minutes). Ambulance personnel who wore PPE and used the ambulance's reverse ventilation system (RVS)reported no adverse effects. The patient was transferred to the authors' burn facility by helicopter (38 minutes). Life-flight personnel, who did not wear PPE (no ventilatory system available), complained of watery eyes, headache, and dizziness. Hospital personnel, who did not use PPE (or RVS), complained of watery eyes or headache. Exposed personnel demonstrated no deficits or residual effects. In spite of spontaneous movement, the patient began to seize and died. This case is unique given the multiple primary and secondary H2S gas exposures involved. Exposed personnel without RVS and not using PPE demonstrated moderate H2S symptoms. PPE (self-contained breathing apparatuses) and RVS were shown to be effective during an H2S emergency; however, there are currently limited data supporting their appropriate use. Until data demonstrating duration of H2S venting for small enclosed spaces are made available, PPEs should be required.

AB In this study, we investigated (1) Japanese university students' actual "difficulty in living" and (2) its association with suicidal ideation. The Difficulty in Living Questionnaire was administered to 547 Japanese university students. Results revealed that 37.5% of the students felt difficulty in living, and 21.0% had ongoing suicidal ideation. An exploratory factor analysis resulted in a three-factor model, and multiple regression analysis showed that factors "external self-insufficiency" and "feeling of emptiness" significantly predicted suicidal ideation. To prevent young Japanese adults from committing suicide, increasing their self-affirmation and feelings of value among other people is crucial.

Beyond mere display, however, it dispenses information, allows for participation and sharing of content, and constitutes a virtual interactive forum. The Internet may ultimately shape society's approach to perceiving and dealing with death. Thus, psychiatrists may wish to be aware of these matters so that they may be considered in assessments and clinical care.

TI Political ideology and health in Japan: a disaggregated analysis
SO JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID MORTALITY; SUICIDE; WALES
AB Background Recent studies from the USA and Europe suggest an association between an individual's political ideology and their health status, with those claiming to be conservatives reporting better health. The presence of this association is examined in Japan.
   Methods Individual-level data from the 2000-3, 2005 and 2006 Japan General Social Survey were analysed. The outcomes of interest were self-rated poor health and smoking status. The independent variable of interest was reported political beliefs on a 5-point 'left'-to-'right' scale. Covariates included age, sex, education, income, occupational status and fixed effects for survey periods. Logistic regression models were estimated.
   Results There was an inverse association between political ideology (left to right) and self-rated poor health as well as between ideology and smoking status even after adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status and fixed effects for survey periods. Compared with those who identified as 'left', the OR for reporting poor health and smoking among those who identified as 'right' was 0.86 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.99) and 0.80 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.91), respectively.
   Conclusions Health differences by political ideology have typically been interpreted as reflecting socioeconomic differences. The results from Japan corroborate the previous findings from the USA and Europe that socioeconomic differences do not account for health differences by political ideologies. Political ideology is likely to be a marker of several latent values and attitudes (eg, religiosity, individual responsibility and/or community participation) that might be beneficial for health at the individual level.

AB Both a higher suicide rate and widespread sleep problems are serious health concerns in Japan when compared with those of other countries. We investigated the relationship between suicidal ideation and sleep problems in Japanese day workers using the 3-dimensional sleep scale (3DSS), which measures three sleep elements (phase, quality, and quantity). Data from 635 Japanese day workers (461 mens and 174 womens) were included. The 3DSS was used to assess participants' sleep condition. Participants were classified into eight sleep types based on scores of phase, quality, and quantity: All Good Sleep, Owl (poor phase), Inefficient (poor quality), Short (poor quantity), Owl + Inefficient (poor phase and quality), Owl + Short (poor phase and quantity), Inefficient + Short (poor quality and quantity), and All Poor Sleep. We assessed participants' suicidal ideation using question 19 of the self-rating depression scale (SDS); 119 cases (18.7 %) had ratings of 2-4 for this question and were considered to have suicidal ideation. The higher the number of sleep problems, the higher the risk of suicidal ideation compared to sleep types not indicative of problems. All Poor Sleep had the highest risk of the eight sleep types. Individuals with Owl + Short, Inefficient + Short, or All Poor Sleep had a significant risk of suicidal ideation even after adjusting for hopelessness and nightmares. Our findings suggested that sleep problems assessed by the 3DSS were related to suicidal ideation. Analysis of various aspects of sleep could be helpful for suicide prevention.

AB We examined the effect of a community-based screening program on depression in middle-aged individuals. Ten subdistricts constituting a rural township (2400 inhabitants aged 40-64 years) in northern Japan with a high suicide rate were randomly assigned to intervention (four) and control (six) groups. A 2-year depression-screening program entailing identification and subsequent care support was offered to adults aged 40 to 64 years in the intervention group, accompanied by 4-year ongoing dissemination of educational information in both groups. Change in depressive symptom prevalence was assessed through before-and-after cross-sectional surveys using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale. Of the 900 targeted individuals, 49.2% participated in the screening. Comparison of data from these surveys after controlling for district-level clustering indicated a greater difference in prevalence between baseline and 5-year follow-up in the intervention group than that in the control. Universal screening and subsequent support seem effective to decrease depressive symptom prevalence among middle-aged individuals in a community setting.

AB Objective To investigate the prevalence and characteristics of depressed patients living in a Japanese leprosarium who have been isolated by national law and are now becoming very elderly.
   Methods We surveyed the prevalence of depressed patients living in the National Tamazenshouen Sanatorium, a major leprosarium in Japan. We also investigated the characteristics of patients who had suffered a depressive episode during the last 5 years (2000-2004). The characteristics of residents who committed suicide were also studied.
   Results At the time of the investigation, 48 out of 385 (12.5%) patients were depressed or had experienced a depressive episode. Forty-one residents had committed suicide since the leprosarium was established in 1907. Somatic symptoms and depressive moods were the predominant symptoms and were not limited to symptoms unique to leprosy. The period of isolation was not statistically correlated with the GDS-SF or PGC morale scale scores.
   Conclusion The findings of this study emphasize the importance of consultation psychiatric for elderly leprosy residents and could be used as a reference for treatment in countries with ageing leprosy residents.

AB The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the prevalence of intermittent explosive disorder (IED) as well as its comorbidity with other mental disorders in a Japanese community sample. Subjects were 4,134 residents in selected sites in Japan. Diagnoses of mental disorders are based on the World Mental Health Survey Initiative Version of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Lifetime and 12-month prevalence of IED were 2.1% and 0.7%, respectively, whereas those of narrow IED were 1.2% and 0.6%, respectively. Male gender and young age were positively associated with an increased prevalence of IED. Mood and anxiety disorders as well as suicidal ideation were shown to be associated with IED in both genders. The overall association between anxiety disorders and IED was stronger in women than in men. Positive association of substance use problems with IED was also observed. Similar findings were observed between those psychosocial factors and narrow IED. These results suggest that people having those mixed complications might have a high suicidal risk. Further research using psychological measures for anger suppression will lead to more thorough understanding of the effects of IED on psychosocial comorbidity and suicidal risk.

AB Introduction Loneliness among people diagnosed with schizophrenia living in communities can decrease quality of life and may contribute to suicide.
   Aim The aim of this study was to examine the levels of loneliness among Japanese people diagnosed with schizophrenia and to identify individual and environmental factors related to their loneliness.
   Method A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 264 people diagnosed with schizophrenia who use local activity support centres in urban areas. The self-administered questionnaires included questions on loneliness, demographic characteristics, individual factors including self-efficacy for community life and self-esteem, and environmental factors including social isolation, community integration and service use.
   Results The study results indicated that people diagnosed with schizophrenia in Japan experience higher levels of loneliness, corroborating results from other countries. Multiple regression analysis showed that a lower level of self-efficacy for community life, self-esteem, community integration and social isolation predicted a higher level of loneliness, accounting for 55.3% of variance.
   Implications for Practice Public health nurses in mental health care in Japan can work with individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and communities using the technique to assist them with continuous activity and cooperating with community resources and educational institutions in order to decrease and prevent loneliness.

AB The ICD-10 is widely used in Japanese clinical and other mental health services settings. Since the publication of the Japanese translation, the most significant event was the renaming of the term schizophrenia in Japanese in 2002. In addition, the Japanese term equivalent to dementia was changed to a supposedly less stigmatizing term in 2006. The renamed versions are now widely accepted by both clinicians and patients and their families.
   In addition to the renaming movement, what is notable as part of psychiatry in Japan is the clinical research projects that are being performed, including neuroimaging and molecular studies. Situations about suicide in Japan, which is one of the biggest problems in the mental health field with the number of victims exceeding 30,000 since 1998, are also discussed.
   Concerning contributions to the ICD revision process, the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology (JSPN) organized the ICD committee under the Committee of International Affairs, and the committee has held a meeting every 4 months. In addition, the JSPN organized the ICD-11 committee which collaborates with the Japanese Society for Psychiatric Diagnosis, consisting of subgroups for F1 - F9 category and a comprehensive group. The ICD-11 committee is reviewing all proposals, and will submit particularly relevant opinions for the revision process of the ICD-10.
   Finally, concerning use of the ICD-10 and DSM-IV in Asian countries, the survey showed that psychiatrists in China and Japan routinely use the ICD-10, while the DSM-IV was dominant in Korea and Taiwan. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB This publication presents the first translation into Russian of the essay "On the [Favorable] Moment [to Display] Reasonableness" ("Shinkiron") written by a famous Japanese artist and intellectual, an adherent of Dutch studies Watanabe Kazan (1793-1841). This essay was written in 1838 as a response to the shooting attack on the United States trade ship "Morrison", which delivered shipwrecked Japanese sailors, by Japanese government in the previous year (even though the author didn't know all details concerning the incident). The main appeal of the author is to display reasonableness, that is to stop shying away from the changing world and to realize Japan's situation in it, and for this end to turn to Western learning whose adherent the author was, and to reconsider the policy toward foreign vessels. In his essay, Watanabe Kazan pays great attention to Great Britain and Russia by presenting these two countries as greatest world powers but comparing them on several characteristics. In general, the author shows deep knowledge of the global situation and world history, making comparisons between Japan and other countries of the world, while his essay is indicative of the development of Western studies in 1830s' Japan. The preface represents the details of the attack on the "Morrison" and the creation of the essay. The spread of "The Tale of a Dream in Bojutsu Year" written by Kazan's friend and like-minded person Takano Choei led to punitive measures by the government against advocates of Western learning. The manuscript of "Shinkiron" was discovered during the search at Kazan's house and the author was sentenced to home arrest and committed suicide two years later.

AB Objectives: Cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases (CCVDs) and mental disorders, including suicide, are prevalent among overworked individuals in Japan. The 2014 legislation regarding the prevention of overwork-related deaths and disorders has accelerated the research in this field and ultimately the implementation of preventive actions.
   Methods: To understand the current problematic situations, the Research Center for Overwork-Related Disorders of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, Japan, conducted analyses of compensated claims for overwork-related CCVDs and mental disorders that were recognized from January 2010 to March 2015.
   Results: The majority of CCVD cases were the men in their 50s. Transport and postal activities was the highest risk industry. Cerebrovascular cases were higher than cardiovascular ones. Long working hours was the principal factor for CCVDs. The mental disorder cases comprised approximately 70% men and affected younger age groups (peak in the third decade) with various industries at risk. In men, there was an almost equal number of F3 (Mood [affective] disorders) and F4 (Neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders) diagnoses according to the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems. A larger number of women were diagnosed to have F4. The mental disorder cases were associated not only with long working hours, but also with injuries and disasters as well as interpersonal conflict at work.
   Conclusions: Multiple, simultaneous actions need to be made by employees, employers, researchers, and the authorities to achieve the goal of reducing the number of workers suffering from the overwork-related CCVDs and mental disorders.

AB Background: Patient-centered decision making, which in the United States is typically considered to be appropriate, may not be universally endorsed, thereby harboring the potential to complicate the care of patients from other cultural backgrounds in potentially unrecognized ways. This study compares the attitudes toward ethical decision making and autonomy issues among academic and community physicians and patients of medical center outpatient clinics in Japan and the United States.
   Methods: A questionnaire requesting judgments about seven clinical vignettes was distributed (in English or Japanese) to sample groups of Japanese physicians (n = 400) and patients (n = 65) as well as US physicians (n = 120) and patients (n = 60) that were selected randomly from academic institutions and community settings in Japan (Tokyo and the surrounding area) and the United States (the Stanford/Palo Alto, CA, area). Responses were obtained from 273 Japanese physicians (68%), 58 Japanese patients (89%), 98 US physicians (82%), and 55 US patients (92%). Physician and patient sample groups were compared on individual items, and composite scores were derived from subsets of items relevant to patient autonomy, family authority, and physician authority.
   Results: A majority of both US physicians and patients, but only a minority of Japanese physicians and patients, agreed that a patient should be informed of an incurable cancer diagnosis before their family is informed and that a terminally ill patient wishing to die immediately should not be ventilated, even if both the doctor and the patient's family want the patient ventilated (Japanese physicians and patients vs US physicians and patients, p < 0.001). A majority of respondents in both Japanese sample groups, but only a minority in both US sample groups, agreed that a patient's family should be informed of an incurable cancer diagnosis before the patient is informed and that the family of an HIV-positive patient should be informed of this disease status despite the patient's opposition to such disclosure (Japanese physicians and patients vs US physicians and patients, p < 0.001). Physicians in both Japan and the United States were less likely than patients in their respective countries to agree with physician assistance in the suicide of a terminally ill patient (Japanese physicians and patients vs US physicians and patients, p < 0.05). Across various clinical scenarios, all four respondent groups accorded greatest authority to the patient, less to the family, and still less to the physician when the views of these persons conflicted. Japanese physicians and patients, however, relied more on family and physician authority and placed less emphasis on patient autonomy than the US physicians and patients sampled. Younger respondents placed less emphasis on family and physician authority.
   Conclusions: Family and physician opinions are accorded a larger role in clinical decision making by the Japanese physicians and patients sampled than by those in the United States, although both cultures place a greater emphasis on patient preferences than on the preferences of the family or physician. Our results are consistent with the view that cultural context shapes the relationship of the patient, the physician, and the patient's family in medical decision making. The results emphasize the need for clinicians to be aware of these issues that may affect patient and family responses in different clinical situations, potentially affecting patient satisfaction and compliance with therapy.

AB Aging populations present serious challenges to societies for the provision of care and support for their eldest members. These include increased demands on families for care at home, shortages of professional care workers and facilities, and financial strains on governmental budgets. However, these conditions also provide space for the elderly to adapt institutions to secure care and support. This essay examines the ways the elderly work through Min-Iren, a federation of medical institutions in Japan, to meet their needs. Premised on a "democratic" model of solidarity, Min-Iren institutional structure provides participating elderly substantial power to modify ostensibly medical institutions. Drawing from 18 months of fieldwork, this essay ethnographically explores how the elderly refashion Min-Iren clinics and hospitals to offer venues for socializing, community building, and political action as well as conventional medical care. On the medical side, Min-Iren institutions enact a form of coproduction of health. However, interpreted from the perspective of social capital, Min-Iren institutions' forays into local social milieus resemble activities of civic organizations and foster social engagement, collective action, and social support. In the hands of the elderly, Min-Iren medical institutions, thus, endeavor to improve individual and neighborhood wellbeing in ways beyond medical care. Min-Iren's model that centers participation and local ownership is general and can be applied to other contexts.

AB Purpose: To determine the prevalence of burnout and psychiatric morbidity among physicians engaged in end-of-life care for cancer patients in Japan and to explore associated factors related to end-of-fife care.
   Methods: Questionnaires were mailed to 1436 Japanese clinical oncologists and palliative care physicians with a request to complete the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and to report on individual factors, including confidence in patient care. High levels of burnout and psychiatric morbidity were identified using cut-off scores of the MBI and GHQ-12.
   Results: A total of 697 physicians returned the questionnaires (response rate, 49.6%). Twenty-two percent of the respondents had a high level of emotional exhaustion, 11% had a high level of depersonalization, 62% had a low level of personal accomplishment, and 20% had psychiatric morbidity. Clinical oncologists showed a significantly higher psychiatric morbidity than palliative care physicians. Confidence in having sufficient time to communicate with patients was significantly associated with all the burnout subscales.
   Conclusions: A low level of personal accomplishment was relatively high among Japanese physicians compared with previous studies. Insufficient confidence in the psychological care of patients was associated with physician burnout rather than involvement in end-of-life care. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Objective: In Europe and the US, primary care has been anticipated in identifying untreated depression. Findings show a high prevalence of depression in such settings. However, the prevalence of depression in an internal medicine clinic in a rural area of Japan, which has a role in primary care, is unclear.
   Method: The prevalence of depression and comorbid psychiatric disorders among outpatients of an internal medicine clinic in a rural general hospital was measured by a structured interview using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Outpatients were recruited consecutively and stratified by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores. Among 598 outpatients, we interviewed 75 randomly selected patients and 29 whose results of the PHQ-9 were positive. We estimated prevalence of depressive episode using age, sex, physical findings by internal medical doctors and PHQ-9 scores as covariates.
   Results: The estimated prevalence of major and minor depressive episodes were 7.4% [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.4%-11.4%] and 6.8% (95% CI: 2.6%-10.9%), respectively. Among major depressed patients, 71.4% had current suicidal ideation.
   Conclusion: Given the high rate of depression and suicidality, identification of depression and collaboration between internal medical doctors in a rural area of Japan and mental health professionals are needed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Physician-assisted suicide (PAS) is an important subject of the public debate. So far, legal regulations exist in the Netherlands, Belgium and in Oregon (USA). This review reports results of nine empirical studies from Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the U.S. which examine attitudes of psychiatrists toward PAS. Results: The approval of PAS by psychiatrists varies between the four countries (40-69%). Comparisons with the attitudes of other physicians show a greater agreement among the psychiatrists. A psychiatric examination in order to evaluate competence even in patients with severe somatic illness was advocated by the majority of psychiatrists. Conclusion: Psychiatrists' attitudes toward PAS vary and are compared with other medical specialities, as well as in different legal and cultural contexts. Therefore, and because of missing empirical studies, results can not be transferred into the context of German speaking countries easily. So far, no acknowledged criteria for the assessment of competence exist. Further empirical research is needed on German psychiatrists' attitudes towards PAS and on competence assessment at the end of life. It remains an open question how legal changes and future developments of palliative care will influence attitudes toward PAS.

DT Review
AB What did people from la Sarthe think of all the countries located between India and the extreme east of the Asian continent between 1860 and 1914? Is Asian culture really part of their lives?
   We can find the answers to these two questions by studying local newspapers.
   The country written about the most is China followed by Indonesia; with Japan and India far behind them.
   The image given of these countries is rather contradictory: on the one hand they were portrayed as the land of plenty with an abundance of wealth of all kinds, but on the other hand they were described as lands of death and catastrophe. They were also ruthless societies where torture and ritual suicides were said to be commonplace and where Hindu and Chinese women were physically and morally abused Chinese people are viewed with both despise and admiration. Japan was entering the Meiji era and was highly praised, mostly for her military victories over China and then Russia. Even if Asian objects were rarely to be seen in the home of Sarthe inhabitants, the Catholics from La Sarthe supported them vigorously.

AB Background: The proportion of suicide attempts by infliction of abdominal stab wounds (ASWs) is higher in Japan than in other counties. There are few clinical reports on these wounds, especially hara-kiri wounds, which involve transversely cutting the abdomen. This study aimed to investigate Japanese patients with self-inflicted hara-kiri wounds and determine their characteristics and clinical features.
   Methods: We investigated 84 patients with self-inflicted ASWs who had been transferred to our hospital between April 1994 and March 2004. We recorded their characteristics and clinical features. They were then divided into two groups depending on their wound type, namely, simple stab wounds (SSWs) and hara-kiri wounds. The characteristics and clinical features of each group were then compared.
   Results: SSWs were frequently observed in the periumbilical and epigastric regions, whereas most hara-kiri wounds were observed in the middle abdomen. The rate of organ injury was 58.7% (44 of 75) for SSWs and 66.7% (6 of 9) for harakiri wounds; no significant difference was observed in this regard. SSWs resulted in injury to various organs, whereas hara-kiri wounds typically caused small bowel, mesenterium, omentum, and major vascular injuries. Small bowel and major vascular injuries had a significantly high incidence in hara-kiri wounds. The mortality rate caused by hara-kiri wounds was significantly higher than that caused by SSWs (1.3% vs. 22.2%).
   Conclusion: The mortality rate caused by ASWs is relatively low. However, hara-kiri wounds might be a risk factor for death. Further, because harakiri wounds transversely cut the abdomen, they might be a risk factor for major vascular injury.

TI The identity formation of the victim of 'shunning'
SO SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB This study investigates the concept of shunning, which can be differentiated from other types of bullying through focusing on the victimizing process, Shunning represents the collective exclusion of an individual by being ignored by their peers and it is the typical type of Ijime (bullying) in Japan. I present two brief cases that describe experiences of classmates being shunned. I examine the cases and then introduce four different positions of the victim's reaction to the experience of being shunned which correspond to four different identity statuses. Papadopoulos (1999) put forward the idea of 'storied community' through his clinical work with refugees, which provides victims with coherent narratives and transitional space as a secure base. This concept seems to have useful applicability in the phenomenon of shunning. However, the devastating dilemma for shunned victims in Japan is that the most available storied community, which could offer them refuge, is the one of 'suicide as revenge on the tormentors'. In this way, the choice is impossible between finding refuge in that story or losing the sense of identity. The implications for the clinician to relate to the victim of shunning are discussed, within the context of this approach.

AB Aims: This study aimed to establish the screening performance and optimal cut-off points for the Japanese version of Kessler (K) 6, K10 and the Depression and Suicide Screen (DSS).
   Methods: A self-report questionnaire including K6, K10 and DSS, as well as the Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D), was administered to a random sample of community residents in Japan (non-cases, n = 147) and psychiatric outpatients diagnosed with mood or anxiety disorders according to DSM-IV (cases, n = 17). A receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) curve was drawn to estimate the area under the curve (AUC), the sensitivity, and specificity with the optimal cut-off points for K6, K10, and DSS, which were then compared with those of CES-D. The community sample was also asked to rate each measure on a scale from 'very easy' to 'very hard' to use.
   Results: K6 and K10 showed a high AUC (0.93-0.94), which was comparable to that of CES-D(0.95), but DSS showed a significantly smaller AUC (0.89) than CES-D (P < 0.05). The optimal cut-off points were estimated as 4/5 for K6, 9/10 for K10, and 1/2 for DSS. The sensitivity of these three scales was similar, but the specificity was lower for DSS than for the other two. K6, K10 and DSS were rated as being 'very easy' or 'easy to use' significantly more than CES-D (P < 0.01).
   Conclusion: The screening performance of the Japanese versions of K6 and K10 was comparable with that of CES-D, and better than that of DDS. K6/K10, particularly K6, might have an advantage, even over the CES-D, because of its similar screening performance and better acceptability.

Here, we report the successful revival of a patient suffering from a severe disturbance of consciousness and respiratory failure caused by hydrogen sulfide poisoning; further, his condition was complicated by myocardial infarction. This is an important case where we examined the tendency toward improvement in myocardial damage in a patient in the acute phase of severe hydrogen sulfide poisoning who was treated for approximately 6 months.

AB Background: A significant number of emergency department (ED) patients in Japan may be affected by mental health problems leading to attempted suicide. This retrospective descriptive study aimed to explore mental health service needs in a Japanese medical centre ED.
   Methods: Data on all inpatients were collected within 24 h of admission to the ED of a medical centre in Tokyo from 1st February 2004 to the 31st of January 2005.
   Results: A total of 14.4% (95% CI 13.0 to 16.0) of ED visits required psychiatric services and 23.4% ( 95% CI 21.7 to 25.3) of inpatients had experienced psychologically traumatic events.
   Conclusions: Approximately 38% ( 95% CI 35.8 to 39.9) of patients presenting to an ED could be affected by mental health problems.

AB Background: Suicide among postpartum women is a new and emerging issue in developed countries. However, little is known about the combined effect of risk factors on self-harm ideation, although various risk factors have been found. The aim of this study is to examine the combined effect of maternal adverse childhood experiences and maternal age on self-harm ideation among postpartum women.
   Methods: The study comprised a cross-sectional study of 8074 mothers participating in a 3-month health checkup between September 2013 and August 2014 in City A, Prefecture A, Japan. Main outcome was self-harm ideation assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), item 10. Possible risk factors were maternal adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), maternal characteristics, relationship with husband/partner (e.g., feelings when pregnancy was confirmed), household characteristics, child characteristics (e.g., age, sex, birth weight), and postpartum characteristics, and postpartum depression status other than self-harm ideation.
   Results: Postpartum women with 3 or more ACEs and younger age ( < 25 years old) were 10.3 times more likely than those with no ACEs and older age to have self-harm ideation (95%CI = 5.3-20.2). This combined effect was also found in first-time mothers (OR = 7.6, 95%CI = 3.2-17.9).
   Limitations: Study limitations are excluding an item on sexual abuse which is one of the ACEs, recall bias and information bias.
   Conclusions: Postpartum women with 3 or more ACEs and who were younger than 25 years old were at a high risk for self-harm ideation. Providing prevention strategies aimed at mothers with multiple risk factors, especially younger age and ACEs, is warranted.

AB Background: Heparinoid is a medication prescribed in Japan for skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and dry skin. Heparinoid prescription has increased with instances of internet blogs recommending its use as a cosmetic.
   Objective: This study aimed to examine the prescription trends in moisturizer use and analyze their association with internet searches.
   Methods: We used a claims database to identify pharmacy claims of heparinoid-only prescriptions in Japan. Additionally, we used Google Trends to obtain internet search data for the period between October 1, 2007, and September 31, 2017. To analyze the association between heparinoid prescriptions and internet searches, we performed an autoregressive integrated moving average approach for each time series.
   Results: We identified 155,733 patients who had been prescribed heparinoid. The number of prescriptions increased from 2011 onward, and related internet searches increased from 2012 onward. Internet searches were significantly correlated with total heparinoid prescription (correlation coefficient=.25, P=.005). In addition, internet searches were significantly correlated with heparinoid prescription in those aged 20-59 years at -1-month lag in Google Trends (correlation coefficient=.30, P=.001).
   Conclusions: Google searches related to heparinoid prescriptions showed a seasonal pattern and increased gradually over the preceding several years. Google searches were positively correlated with prescription trends. In addition, in a particular age group (20-59 years), prescriptions increased with the increase in internet searches. These results suggest that people obtained health-related information on the internet and that this affected their behavior and prescription requests.

DE A well-rounded education; a liberal arts education; a Zenjin education;
   Kuniyoshi Obara; the Japanese education system
AB The idea of a well-rounded education is widely recognized, and as IB programs and the concept of an IB education are gradually yet steadily infiltrating the Japanese education system, Japan can no longer ignore the existence of a Zenjin (<< whole person >>) education, which was first practiced in 1921 by a Japanese philosopher of education named Kuniyoshi Obara. This paper compares the philosophical and theoretical foundations of Obara's Zenjin education and a so-called << well-rounded >> education, revealing the similarities between them and using these as a rationale for educational reform in Japan. In the literature review, the recent debate between well-rounded and angular education proponents is addressed, and it is concluded that a well-rounded education still has a role to play, even though there are a certain number of competitive and prestigious universities/colleges that question its merits and give priority to high school graduates who have specialized solely in one area, such as sports, arts, or a standard-deviation-value-oriented, angular education. Regardless of the fact that attaining good scores on academic tests is often thought to be a reasonable way for children to meet their aspirations and expectations and receive benefits from a meritocracy and an academic hierarchy, especially in Japan, this paper insists that a true form of education should be concerned with each individual's whole personality, and therefore a Zenjin, or well-rounded, education must play a core role in the education system. Indeed, the current Japanese education system is collapsing and deteriorating, exposing children to serious problems such as bullying, school-related suicides, etc. so preventative measures urgently need to be put in place, and it is time to think carefully about what a Zenjin education has to teach us.

AB In the early hours of November 30, 1905, Min Yonghwan took his own life in protest against the Japan-Korea Protectorate Treaty that had been forced on the Korean cabinet in the wake of Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) thus ended the career of an elite member of Korea's Confucian ruling class, who had unique experience in dealing with foreign diplomatic officials due to his two visits to the West in 1896 and 1897. Four years later An Chunggun, a convert to Roman Catholicism, was hung for the assassination of Ito Hirobumi, the Japanese statesman responsible for the protectorate treaty This article examines the ideas of these two men as expressed in their writings, namely, Min's policy essay Ch'onilch'aek (One policy out of one thousand) and other pieces from his collected works Min Ch'ungjonggong yugo (Posthumous works of Min Yonghwan), which were not inherently antagonistic to the Western powers other than Russia and focused primarily on exposing the aggressive intentions of Japan, and An's treatise, Tongyang p'yonghwaron (A treatise on peace in the East), which viewed the West as posing a common threat to China, Japan and Korea that required a collective response based on racial solidarity and the mutual recognition of each state's sovereignty and independence. The article will also examine their ideas in the context of Western views of the region as well as the responses of Western commentators to their final acts of protest.'

AB BackgroundThis study retrospectively examined the association between personal values in adolescence and suicidality in a community-representative adult sample in Japan.MethodsData were used from wave 1 (2010) and wave 3 (2017) of a Japanese Study on Stratification, Health, Income, and Neighborhood (J-SHINE) survey. Personal values at age 15 were retrospectively measured in 2017 in two ways: the original value priorities we made were based on the Schwartz theory of basic values; and the Japanese version of the Personal Values Questionnaire II (PVQ-II) was used to assess the degree of commitment to the values. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association of personal values in adolescence with self-reported suicidal ideation, suicidal planning, and suicide attempt (both during a lifetime and in the most recent year), adjusting for socio-demographics, smoking, alcohol consumption, and economic status among 15year olds.ResultsCherishing family and friends was significantly and negatively associated with suicidal ideation over a lifetime and in the most recent year. Commitment to values was also significantly and negatively associated with suicidal ideation in the most recent year.ConclusionsInvestigating the association between personal values and suicidality could make a significant contribution to the literature by offering a new approach to understanding and preventing suicide.

DT Article
DE meditation; mindfulness; Naikan
ID BUDDHIST; THERAPY; SUICIDE
AB Mindfulness in the Buddhist tradition involves a variety of practices, and contemporary secular forms of mindfulness practices, therapies, and interventions can similarly be broadened to include more of these forms. The Japanese practice of Naikan takes one mindfulness practice from the Buddhist tradition-that of recollecting the kindness of others-and asks clients to engage in this practice for 1 solid week, 15 hours per day. Difficult interpersonal relationships and a perceived lack of social support are chief sources of stress, and Japanese self-hood in particular has been described as interdependent and highly social in nature. It is unsurprising therefore that Japanese would be drawn to relational forms of practice like Naikan, and that they would find particular benefit from such practices. Recent ethnographic and survey work I have conducted at 2 Naikan centers suggests that Naikan significantly improves positive mental health, perceived connection with others, and perceived meaning in life, even up to 6 months later, thereby potentially undercutting factors contributing to depression and suicide. Naikan practice is not entirely limited to Japan, however, and its use in Europe and North America prompts us to ask about the culturally specific and universal aspects of mindfulness practices, and how we may construct mindfulness interventions that are best suited for addressing the mental health problems that face our communities.

AB Hanging is a devastating method of suicide and unfortunately is common in Japan. Although several CT findings of the head have been reported, there have not been any reports about magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in hanging. We report here interesting MRI findings in a patient after hanging. A 39-year-otd woman was transferred to our department after attempting suicide by hanging. Respiration had probably ceased for about three minutes but heart had not stopped when she was pulled down by her father. After her father performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, she started to breathe immediately. She was treated conservatively in our intensive care unit for 14 days, her condition became stable. Ten days after admission, MRI demonstrated symmetrical hyperintensity on T1-weighted images and relative hyperintensity on T2 weighted images in bilateral lentiform nuclei and medial thalami. There have been several reports about characteristic MRI findings in the case of acute global cerebral ischaemia caused by severe hypoglycaemia or longstanding cardiopulmonary arrest. It was postulated that these specific findings reflected tissue degeneration, deposition of mineral substances, or lipid accumulation. These MRI findings suggest that severe acute global cerebral hypoperfusion also occurs in hanging in the same way as in tong-standing cardiopulmonary arrest and that hanging has devastating sequelae.

ID SCALE
AB These days suicides are being committed by students at all three levels of schooling. This serious problem is one that we should respond to as quickly as possible. Pediatric depression is a potential source of this problem. Previously, we have reported a simple diagnosis of the depressed state using facial expression cognition in the case of adults. There we implemented a self-diagnostic inspection that can be carried out easily in a short time for the screening of depression. In this report, we examine whether the method we developed for adults may be applied to children as a fast and effective response to the big problem of pediatric depression. Through this examination, we hope that we can respond quickly to the problem of suicides by students in schools at all three levels caused by depression. Moreover, we can respond to a situation in which the school and parents do not understand the children's mental state that contributes heavily to these acts. From this response, we can evolve a better support system. Furthermore, we examine an application that uses a hand phone to improve the early stages of detection and evolve a support system through the increased number of users.

AB We examined all unnatural and unexpected natural deaths of homeless people between 2,000 and 2,004 in Osaka, based on the reports of the Osaka Medical Examiners' Office and the data of Osaka Prefectural Police. Homeless people in this study were defined as those who slept rough or stayed in flophouse.
   A total of 1,052 deaths of homeless people (1,026 men and 26 women) was identified, 769 of those who slept rough, and 283 of those who stayed in flophouse. The autopsy rate amounted to 43.8%. The average age of death is 57.8 +/- 8.9 years. About 13.6% of homeless people died unexpectedly or unnaturally in five years. Of the total deaths, 69% died of disease, 12% of suicide, 3% of homicide, and 10% of accidents, including 4% from starvation and 7% from cold.

SO JOURNAL OF MORAL EDUCATION

DT Article
DE Bullying; moral education; everyday experience; teacher
AB Two influential tragic incidents in 2011 are discussed in connection with the cultivation of morality in Japan. One is the suicide of a junior high school student due to bullying in his schoola scandal which eventually led to the country's redefinition of the status of moral education in the school curriculum. The other is the huge earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku. Observing the affected area, foreign media reporters wondered why there was no looting in Japan. In order to shed light on this question small-scale research was conducted on perceptions of the practice of unattended vegetable stands (UVSs), as an index of the moral level of some Japanese people. Responses of various groups involved in this study suggested that the well-disciplined behaviour of Japanese people, indicated by this practice, is not necessarily only a product of school moral education. Rather, they considered that conduct in daily life, social solidarity, and education at home are the major components of the moral upbringing of Japanese people. In order to improve moral education in schools, the importance of focusing on children's experiences in daily life and making good use of them from the perspective of children's moral growth are emphasized.

DT Article
DE Marguerite Yourcenar; Yukio Mishima; East-West Relations; France; Japan
AB Marguerite Yourcenar may well be best known for her prize-winning novels that accent the trope of homosexuality, but there is another, equally engaging aspect to her work that highlights her originality: her deeply syncretic cultural perspective. Regarding her strong interest in Japanese culture, she was intrigued by the polemical and ostentatious Japanese writer, Yukio Mishima, and her 1980 text, Mishima ou la vision du vide, stands as an important milestone in the longstanding dialogue of East-West cultural relations. Mishima fascinated Yourcenar, above and beyond his interest in homosexual themes, and she identified in him a uniquely powerful exemplar of rebellion. After forming his own militia, barricading himself in the Tokyo headquarters of Japan's Self-Defense Forces, holding the commandant hostage, and committing suicide publicly on a balcony of the building through the ritual act of seppuku, Mishima became for Yourcenar a figure of almost hagiographic dimensions. Describing him dramatically as "le martyr [ horizontal ellipsis ] du Japon heroique," Yourcenar presents Mishima as a figure whose art serves as inspiration both for Eastern and Western writers, while she explores his violent ideology, portraying his work as a compelling and paradoxical example of the potential of aesthetics to alter directly human culture.

AB Japan has one of the world's highest rates of psychiatric institutionalization, and popular images of mental health care and public attitudes toward mental illness there have been stigmatized for decades. However, there are transitions underway that are reshaping the mental health care landscape as well as affecting public representations of mental illness. Those transitions include attempts to promote community-based care, move away from long-term hospitalization, reduce stigma, increase utilization of services, and bring clinical psychological services under the national health insurance umbrella. This article discusses one cultural representation in which those transitions are brought into relief: a 2002 television series entitled PsychoDoctor that portrayed the clinical practice of a psychiatrist. The article analyzes the messages inherent in the series about the nature of mental illness, the everyday-ness of sufferers, and the expanded repertoire of treatments now available. In so doing, the article suggests that the efforts of progressive clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, and mental health activists to put forth new images of mental illness and mental health care are now having a degree of success in the arena of popular culture.

AB Little is known about accurate prevalence and associated factors of deliberate self-harm (DSH) among adolescents in Asian countries. In this study, the prevalence and associated factors of DSH among adolescents in Japan were examined. Data were derived from a cross-sectional survey using an anonymous self-report questionnaire and enrolling 8,620 adolescents aged 1215 and 9,484 aged 1518. DSH in the previous 12 months was reported by 3.3% (95% CI, 2.93.7) of junior and 4.3% (3.9%4.7%) of senior high school respondents. The prevalence was more than four times as high among girls as among boys for both age groups. DSH was further strongly associated with having suicidal thoughts, having depression/anxiety symptoms, and having used recreational drugs. These associated factors were similar for both sexes and for both older and younger teenagers. A substantial minority of adolescents present with DSH, even among those aged 1215. The prevalence of DSH in Japan was in the lower ranges of those reported for Western countries. The identified associated factors were not dissimilar from those reported in the West.

AB The Great East Japan Earthquake and subsequent nuclear power plant accident caused multidimensional and long-term effects on the mental health condition of people living in Fukushima. In this article, focusing on the influence of the nuclear disaster, we present an overview of studies regarding the psychosocial consequences of people in Fukushima. Studies revealed that the experiences of the explosions at the plant as well as the tsunami are deeply embedded in their memory, leading to posttraumatic responses. Chronic physical diseases, worries about livelihood, lost jobs, lost social ties, and concerns about compensation were also associated with posttraumatic responses. Furthermore, the radioactive fallout brought chronic anxiety regarding physical risks of radiation exposure to people, especially young mothers. People often have different opinions about the radiation risk and their own future plans, resulting in a reduction in the resilience that communities and families had before the disaster. In addition, such weakened community resilience may produce a significant increase in disaster-related in Fukushima. Specific social issues, such as "radiation stigma" among the public and self-stigma among evacuees, that are never seen with other natural disasters also increased in Fukushima.

AB Recently in Japan, there have been scattered cases of suicide by inhalation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), produced by mixing domestic chemicals containing sulfur and hydrochloric acid. We report four cases of such fatalities with regard to the pathological and toxicological findings. Two cases were male and female suicide victims (cases 1 and 2; about 2 days and 30 h postmortem, respectively), and the other two were a female suicide victim and her husband (cases 3 and 4; about 3 days postmortem). Partial greenish discoloration was observed on the skin in three cases (cases 1, 3, and 4), and also in the airways and lungs and on the brain surface in one case (case 3). The most evident pathology was marked pulmonary and cerebral edema in all cases. Concentrations of H2S and the metabolite thiosulfate (TS) in the blood varied by case (0.66-85.0 and 0.00-369 mu g/ml, respectively), and similar distributions were seen in the viscera; these concentrations were markedly high in a case of visceral discoloration (case 3). Both H2S and TS contents in the skin and muscle were higher at the sites of discoloration in individual cases. A control study demonstrated an unexpected increase of TS contents along with H2S production due to putrefaction as well as higher TS content than H2S. It was difficult to discriminate putrefaction using H2S and TS measurements, especially in gastric contents, bone marrow, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas, and intestine. However, vitreous body, pericardial fluid, and lung tissue showed different findings compared with putrefactive changes, and may be used as supplementary or alternative samples. These findings suggest the significant contribution of postmortem exposure to H2S gas to the pathological and toxicological findings, depending on the circumstances, and the importance of systemic toxicological analysis for determining death due to H2S intoxication.

AB Objective
   In the workplace depression and suicide are serious mental health problems. A lack of knowledge and mental health skills along with the stigma toward mental health problems often results in delays in seeking professional help. Interventions targeting not only persons with mental health problems but also people around the individual are warranted in order to encourage supporting behavior within entire workplace. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of our newly developed educational training program in the management with depression and suicidal risk in the workplace as a single-arm pilot trial.
   Methods
   The program is a two-hour (2-h) training course for employees based on the Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) program which aims to increase public mental health literacy. We conducted this program at a company workplace among 91 employees, and ultimately 83 participants completed the self-rated questionnaires. Changes in confidence and practical skills in early intervention of depression and suicide-prevention, and stigma toward mental health problems were evaluated using self-rated questionnaires at 3 time-points; pre-program, immediately post-program, and 1 month after the program.
   Results
   Confidence and practical skills were significantly improved even 1 month after the program, and stigma reduced just after the program.
   Conclusions
   Our pilot study suggests that the program has a positive impact on encouraging employees to support their co-workers with mental health problems, and is applicable for busy workers due to its short duration. A single-arm design, evaluation using self-rated questionnaire and short-term follow up period are the main limitations of the present study. Hence, future research is required to validate the effects of this program with control groups, and also to assess long-term effectiveness and objective changes such as absenteeism and sick leave.

AB Background The Japanese archipelago stretches over 4000 km from north to south and has four large islands: Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. Previously, using the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-auto questionnaire version (TEMPS-A), we compared the hyperthymic scores of residents in Sapporo, Obihiro, Takaoka, Koshigaya, and Oita cities (which are located at latitudes of 43 degrees N, 42 degrees N, 36 degrees N, 36 degrees N and 33 degrees N with various combinations of ambient temperament and sunshine in Japan, respectively). We found that latitude predicted significant variance in hyperthymic temperament, and that ambient temperature, but not sunshine, significantly affected hyperthymic temperament scores. However, the analysis failed to consider the effects of naturally occurring low-dose lithium on temperament.
   Methods: In addition to the TEMPS-A data previously collected, we measured lithium levels of the five cities. The effect of temperature, sunshine, and lithium levels on hyperthymic temperament was analyzed for the five cities.
   Results: A stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that lithium levels as well as latitude, but not temperature or sunshine, predicted significant variance in hyperthymic temperament scores. Hyperthymic temperament scores were significantly and positively associated with lithium levels whereas they were significantly and negatively associated with latitude.
   Limitations: The light, temperature, lithium exposure that residents actually received was not measured. The number of regions studied was limited. The findings might not be generalized to residents across Japan or other countries.
   Conclusions: The present findings suggest that lithium in drinking water may positively maintain hyperthymic temperament, and that latitude may negatively maintain it.

AB This study aims to investigate factors that contribute to the differences in incidence of hypertension between different regions in Japan, by accounting for not only individual lifestyles, but also their living environments. The target participants of this survey were individuals who received medical treatment for hypertension, as well as hypertension patients who have not received any treatment. The objective variable for analysis was the incidence of hypertension as data aggregated per prefecture. We used data (in men) including obesity, salt intake, vegetable intake, habitual alcohol consumption, habitual smoking, and number of steps walked per day. The variables within living environment included number of rail stations, standard/light vehicle usage, and slope of habitable land. In addition, we analyzed data for the variables related to medical environment including, participation rate in medical check-ups and number of hospitals. We performed multiple stepwise regression analyses to elucidate the correlation of these variables by using hypertension incidence as the objective variable. Hypertension incidence showed a significant negative correlation with walking and medical check-ups, and a significant positive correlation with light-vehicle usage and slope. Between the number of steps and variables related to the living environment, number of rail stations showed a significant positive correlation, while, standard-and light-vehicle usage showed significant negative correlation. Moreover, with stepwise multiple regression analysis, walking showed the strongest effect. The differences in daily walking based on living environment were associated with the disparities in the hypertension incidence in Japan.

AB The study investigates the existing smart mental healthcare technologies and analyses the views of potential users in order to devise a comprehensive mental healthcare stepped-care model (CMHCSM) for managing individual preventive care or treatment. The development of various SmartMentalTech solutions may meet the growing demands in mental healthcare intervention and also overcome the limitations of traditional mental healthcare system regarding accessibility. South Korea and Japan have had a relatively high suicide rate and a rising prevalence of mental illness, with the prospect of using a category of products referred to as smart technologies in mental healthcare, hence SmartMentalTech. To investigate the application feasibility of a SmartMentalTech prototype for mental healthcare in South Korea and Japan, this comparative research examined various associated parameters. However, the rapid growth of mental healthcare technology may cause confusion among users regarding the best options to choose. To resolve this, a Health Psychological Approach was adopted and the comprehensive mental healthcare stepped-care model (CMHCSM) was applied. The findings of this study have thus classified 12 types of SmartMentalTech that have been applied to CMHCSM. In the choice of technology types, there were some differences between South Korean and Japanese users. The study concludes that SmartMentalTech should be promoted as an accompanying solution that is readily accessible for the users and describes the four steps of the stepped-care approach for comprehensive management. Further research in the form of an evidencebased analysis of the 12 types of smart technologies use in mental healthcare is recommended. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS

DT Article
ID AUTONOMY; SUICIDE; JAPAN
AB This paper argues that the concept of paternalism is currently overextended to include a variety of actions that, while resembling paternalistic actions, are importantly different. I use the example of Japanese physicians' non-disclosures of cancer diagnoses directly to patients, arguing that the concept of maternalism better captures these actions. To act paternalistically is to substitute one's own judgement for that of another person and decide in place of that person for his/her best interest. By contrast, to act maternalistically is to decide for another person based on a reasonable understanding of that person's own preferences. The concept of maternalism allows for a more thorough assessment of the moral justification of these types of actions. I conclude that it is possible, at least in principle, to justify Japanese physicians' non-disclosures, and that this justification must be based on an understanding of these actions as maternalistic.

AB A desire for death and requests to hasten death are major topics in recent medical literature. The aim of this study was to clarify the bereaved family-reported incidence and reasons for desiring death and requests to hasten death during the whole course of terminally ill cancer patients receiving specialized palliative care in Japan. A nationwide questionnaire survey of 500 primary caregivers yielded a total of 290 responses (effective response rate, 62%). Sixty-two (21%) families reported that the patients had expressed a desire to die, and 29 (10%) families reported that the patients had requested that death be hastened. The major reasons for desiring death and requests to hasten death were: burden on others, dependency, meaninglessness, unable to pursue pleasurable activities, general malaise, pain, dyspnea, concerns about future distress, and wish to control the time Of death. No intolerable physical symptoms were reported in 32% and 28% of the patients who desired death and those who requested to hasten death, respectively. Concerns about future distress and wishes to control the time of death were significantly more likely to be listed as major reasons for desiring death in patients who requested that death be hastened than those who did not. A desire for death and requests to hasten death are not uncommon in terminally ill cancer patients receiving specialized inpatient palliative care in Japan. More intensive strategies for general malaise, pain, and dyspnea near the end of life, and for feelings of being a burden, meaninglessness, and concerns about future distress would alleviate the serious suffering of patients with a desire for death. However, some patients with a strong wish to control the time of death might not receive benefit from conventional palliative care. J Pain Symptom Manage 2004;27:44-52.

AB Nanocomposite SiOx-Ti powders have been produced by plasma spray physical vapor deposition of SiO and Ti powders. Crystalline Si was formed after the reduction of SiO by an addition of Ti but the battery capacity was increased slightly. With an increase in the Ti amount, the formation of titanium suicides becomes significant compared with the oxidation of Ti, which readily resulted in a decrease in the active Si amount, and thus an apparent decrease in the capacity. These suggest that the secondary element has to be selected such that the active SiO forms first before other alloy phases in the system during co-condensation of vapor mixtures to make the best of the SiO composite structure.

AB We conducted a retrospective chart-review study, examining predictors of the repetition of short-term self-harm (< 1 month and < 6 months) among the patients who were admitted to an emergency department in Japan following self-harm. A total of 405 patients were enrolled and were followed-up for a subsequent one year. The incidence of repeated self-harm within one-and six-months were 6.4% and 13.1%, respectively. Cox's proportional hazards model analyses demonstrated that history of self-harm and comorbid physical illness were associated with repeated self-harm within one month. The patients who lived alone and who were directly discharged from the emergency room after referral to a psychiatrist were at higher risk for repeated self-harm within both one and six months. Living on public assistance and having been discharged from psychiatric wards within the past 12 months were associated with repetition within six months. These risk factors should be incorporated into routine assessment at an emergency room, and elaborate follow-up plan should be provided to the patients with these risk factors upon discharge from the emergency room. Further prospective studies are warranted, addressing more comprehensive factors that are associated with short-term risk for self-harm and suicide.

AB Objective It is necessary to develop new guidelines to delineate the best ways of providing psychosocial care to ensure mental health following a disaster.
   Methods This study applied the scoping review method as a means of establishing evidence-based guidelines for disaster mental health services. A total of 440 literatures were selected through a scoping review of 20,864 documents. Twenty-three recognized experts were invited to participate in the survey and a two-round online Delphi survey was conducted.
   Results The concordance rate in the Delphi Round 1 was 95.1%. Six items were excluded and new items were formulated with experts' suggestions. A total of 23 statements were slightly modified to clarify their meaning. In the Delphi Round 2, all items were met with consensus. The three items with the highest consensus among the experts were related to the protection of personal information and privacy. The item with the lowest consensus among experts was related to debriefing. Other items were related to establishing mental health support centers and suicide prevention activities.
   Conclusion 140 items were developed through scoping reviews based on evidence-based methodology. These items were used to describe the disaster mental health support identified in Delphi. The guideline will provide a foundation for effective preparation and response in disaster situations.

AB Discussions on the Ainu have been extremely marginalized in analyses of prewar Japanese colonial literature. This paper thus on Osami Gizou's only Karafuto Ainu novel "What the Japanese Taught Me," especially on how the novel responds to Japan's education program for assimilating the Ainu. It attempts to shed light on the historical significance of the novel, analyze the nature of Ainu literature, and explore the equivocality of Japanese colonial literature.
   This research concludes that Osami imputes the death of the mixed Japanese-Ainu protagonist to several reasons. It includes the egoism of the modern East Asian countries, Japanese education, space for allowing the Japanese and the Ainu to develop intimacy, and the formation of hostility to Russia. All of these reasons result in the protagonist's "revolt" against Russia and suicide. Osami by focusing on the protagonist's tragedy intends to manifest the success of the Japanese assimilation program and accuse Japan of oppressing the Ainu. The novel is concerned about the colonial society and full of humanitarianism. It, however, takes it for granted that the Ainu wanted to "become Japanese." Such conservative argument leads the piece of work to fail to transcend the framework of nationalism or stay away from its cooperation with national policy.

AB Objectives: This study aimed to describe the clinical and procedural characteristics of drug poisoning, to examine procedural differences between drug poisoning repeaters and non-repeaters, and to estimate the costs of drug poisoning.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study of a nationally representative sample of 6585 inpatients with drug poisoning was conducted, using the administrative database of the Diagnosis Procedure Combination/Per-Diem Payment System in 2008.
   Results: Although only 3% of patients required surgery and 65% were discharged from the hospitals within 3 days, greater than 30% were admitted to tertiary emergency care (i.e., high-level emergency care) centers that provide care to severely ill and trauma patients who require intensive care. Only 30% of patients received psychiatric consultation during hospitalization. In addition, repeaters were less likely to be admitted to hospitals by ambulance (67% vs. 76%) and more likely to be discharged within 3 days (77% vs. 65%) than non-repeaters. The annual economic burden of drug poisoning in Japan was $66 million (sic7.7 billion), with the population aged 20-39 years accounting for 50% of these costs.
   Conclusion: This study highlights the need for optimally allocating resources and improving prevention strategies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Correlates of Depressive Symptoms among Workers in Small- and Medium-scale Manufacturing Enterprises in Japan:Tomoko IKEDA, et al. Department of Nursing, School of Health Sciences, Ibaraki Prefectural University of Health Sciences-Background: Although the relationship between job stress and depressive symptoms has been well documented among workers in large scale enterprises, the situation in small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) is not fully understood. Objectives: To clarify the factors associated with depressive symptoms in SMEs in Japan. Methods: 1,516 male and 738 female Japanese workers at SMEs were surveyed using a self-administered questionnaire. We applied hierarchical multiple linear regression with depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depressive Symptoms Scale) as the dependent variable, and (1) Individual, (2) Lifestyle, (3) Job stressors, and (4) SME unique factors as independent variables entered in 4 steps. Analyses were stratified by sex due to large differences in stress scores and demographic variables. Results: Perceived lack of understanding from others with regard to health was the strongest factor associated with increased depressive symptoms (BETA=0.29 in males and 0.28 in females). Higher intragroup conflict (BETA=0.15 in males and 0.09 in females), perceived job future ambiguity (BETA=0.09 in males and 0.11 in females), higher quantitative workload (BETA=0.06 in males and 0.10 in females), and being an employer or a member of the employer's family (BETA=0.06 in males and 0.10 in females) were additional factors associated with high depressive symptoms. Economic concern, being single, cigarette smoking, shorter sleep duration, and skill underutilization were male specific, while younger age and lower social support at work were female specific factors significantly associated with increased depressive symptoms. Conclusions: These data suggest that poor mental health may be prevented by creating a workplace climate which focuses on the high value of the health of fellow workers.

AB Suicide gene therapy using ganciclovir (GCV) with transfection of the herpes thymidine kinase (HSVtk) gene has been studied for cancer therapy. The present study demonstrates an efficient method of suicide gene therapy for multiple hepatic tumors, involving repetitive transfection of the HSVtk gene driven by the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) promoter using hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-liposomes. AFP-producing cells (HUH7) and AFP-nonproducing cells (LS180) were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) to establish tumors in nude mice. Two plasmid constructs, bacterial LacZ gene driven by the AFP promoter (AFPLacZ), and HSVtk gene driven by the AFP promoter (AFPTK1) were encapsulated into the HVJ-liposome and used. When AFPLacZ was injected into the s.c. tumors, expression of LacZ gene was confined to HUH7 tumors. Repeated transfection of AFPTK1 followed by GCV treatment markedly suppressed growth of HUH7 tumors, and apoptosis of HUH7 cells was recognized in the tumor. Next, HUH7 cells were injected into the portal vein in severe combined immunodeficiency mice to establish a hepatic tumor model. After inoculation with the tumor, HVJ-liposomes containing the AFPTK1 plasmid vector were injected into the portal vein via the splenic hilum, followed by GCV treatment. This gene therapy significantly inhibited the growth of tumors in the liver and markedly improved survival. Three injections of the AFPTK1 plasmid vector completely inhibited tumor growth. This procedure seems to have great potential for the treatment of multiple hepatic tumors.

AB Little is known about the association between depression and the buffering effects of social support in mid-life crisis. The aim of this study is to determine the buffering effects of social support on depression concerning middle-aged individuals, while also taking reciprocity and gender differences into careful consideration. A cross-sectional survey of all middle-aged individuals (4069 years of age) using a large sample (n = 4558) from a community-living population, who resided in Rokunohe town, Aomori prefecture in northern Japan (response rate = 69.8%), was undertaken. This town recently had a lot of suicides. Two-way ANOVA was used to analyze the effects of stressor and social support on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale scores. The authors found a stress buffering effect of social support on the depressive symptoms occurring in middle age, however, a significant difference in the stress buffer effect was only observed in male subjects. Moreover, when the authors take reciprocity into account, the effect of the buffer on depression was found not only in males receiving support but in males providing support as well. In conclusion, pertaining to males, social support reduces depressive symptoms under stressful circumstances in middle age, not only when they receive such support but also when they provide it. Therefore, these findings suggest that reciprocal social support is important for males in relation to community mental health.

ID BALLOON DILATATION; STRICTURES; CHILDREN; INGESTION
AB Introduction: Corrosive esophagitis is often caused by the intake of alkaline or acidic substances. Esophageal stenosis is the most important late complication of corrosive esophagitis. In Laos, where Western medical care is available in few locations, treatment for esophageal stenosis is challenging. We report on a patient who was treated in Laos.
   Case Presentation: In Laos, an 18-year-old woman attempted to commit suicide by drinking an acidic detergent. Sixteen months later, she consulted a district hospital in Laos, which is supported by a Japanese nonprofit organization, with a chief complaint of dysphagia. An upper gastrointestinal series demonstrated severe stenosis of her thoracic esophagus. She underwent open laparotomy for gastrostomy with a urinary catheter to improve her nutritionally poor condition; the operation was performed by a Japanese surgeon with Lao medical staff. Through the gastrostomy, she injected liquid food by herself. Gradually she became unable even to drink water. Because we could not obtain any devices for esophageal dilatation in Laos, balloon dilatation catheters were donated from Japan. Twenty-three months after the injury, the endoscopic balloon dilatation for esophageal stenosis was performed by a Japanese physician, who also taught local physicians how to use the device. The patient's esophagus was as narrow as a pinhole at 20 cm from the incisors. Repeated balloon dilatation by local physicians enabled her to consume solid food orally.
   Conclusion: Corrosive esophagitis combined with stenosis is often difficult to treat. The Lao patient was successfully treated by a combination of local and foreign medical staff.

ID MORTALITY
AB Aims: Although somatic diseases in psychiatric patients are increasing with the increase of the aged population, psychiatric wards in general hospitals in Japan have progressively been decreasing. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to clarify whether psychiatric beds in general hospitals play sufficient roles in medical comorbidities of psychiatric patients or not.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study performed all over Tokyo during the 2-month period from April to May 2007. The total number of patients who require admission due to both somatic and psychiatric diseases was investigated with their demographic and clinical characteristics.
   Results: The total number of patients admitted to psychiatric beds in general hospitals for the above-mentioned reason was 326, while the number of patients who could not be admitted to them despite the same reason was 88. The rate of surgical diseases in the latter group was higher than that in the former group. In the latter group, diseases requiring orthopedic surgery (22%) and abdominal surgery (22%) were the most frequent, followed by gastrointestinal and hepatic diseases (8%), and gynecological diseases (7%). Patients who had attempted suicide were included more in the latter group than in the former group. Even in the former group, general hospitals could not respond to 34% of requests for emergency admission.
   Conclusion: Psychiatric beds in general hospitals do not necessarily function for medical comorbidities in psychiatric patients, especially in severe and emergency cases. Not only the quantity but also the quality of psychiatric wards in general hospitals should be reconsidered.

AB On 12 March 2011 an earthquake devastated the Matsunoyama and Matsudai districts of Tokamachi City, Niigata, Japan. These areas had high pre-existing suicide rates, especially among the elderly. We investigated whether mental health status became worse among the sufferers 5 months after the earthquake, and what kind of factors were implicated in any changes. A 15-item questionnaire that tapped earthquake-related variables and the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale to measure psychological distress were distributed to 1923 residents aged over 40 years. The mean age (S.D.) of the total 1731 respondents (male, 805; female, 926) was 68.2 (13.1) years. Of these, we assessed K10 scores from 1346 respondents. The mean scores (S.D.) for K10 and K6 (six selected items from the K10) were 5.8 (6.3) and 3.4 (3.9), respectively. Among the respondents, 9.1% and 3.2% obtained a score of K10 >= 15 and K6 >= 13, respectively. These scores showed slightly higher psychological distress, especially among the elderly, in comparison with existing community-based data. Categorical regression analysis revealed significant and relatively strong effects of initial psychological impact, decrease in sleep hours, advanced age, and decrease in interpersonal relationships within the community on the 1(10 score. The last item suggests the importance of socio-environmental factors in post-disaster mental health. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Japanese method of inquest, which depends mostly on external examinations, may misdiagnose a considerable number of accidental deaths and suicides as death by disease. We conducted computed tomography (CT) scans of 80 cases for which police concluded death by disease or natural causes based on police investigations into the circumstances and results from external examinations. The cause of death was clearly determined by CT scan in 17 of 80 cases. Ten cases underwent autopsy after the police suspected criminality based on results of the CT examinations. The results suggest CT scan may be a tool for preventing a number of overlooked crimes and accidents in Japan. However, it cannot be a perfect tool for discerning between death by disease and other causes of death without cooperation from the investigative agencies and subsequent forensic examinations such as autopsy and toxicological tests.

AB Background: The aim of the present study was to investigate the differences in the prevalence of and risk factors for elderly depression between urban and rural areas in Japan and to further understanding of the features of elderly depression.
   Methods: A multistage, random sampling procedure and mailing method were used in urban and rural areas in Kumamoto Prefecture. A total of 2,152 participants aged 65 years and older were evaluated for depression using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Factors associated with depression were also examined. In order to assess the relationship between risk factors and subjective happiness, the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale (PGC-MS) was used.
   Results: Depressive symptoms were associated with living alone, being unemployed, chronic illness, sleep disturbance, suicidal ideation, financial strain, and poor social support; the risk factors for elderly depression were almost the same in the two areas. Although three factors (financial strain, work status, and PGC-MS) were significantly associated with depression in both areas on logistic regression analysis, sleep disturbance was significant only for the urban area, and poor social support was significant only for the rural area.
   Conclusions: Although factors related to depression did not differ markedly between urban and rural elderly people, some risk factors differed between the two areas. Effective intervention programs for elderly depression should pay more attention to regional differences.

AB In Japan, Saipan' refers both to a nearby tropical holiday, and to the site of a battle that annihilated Japanese troops, embroiled the large population of Japanese residents on the island and ultimately spelled the end of the Japanese empire, now within the reach of bombers. In other places, and particularly amongst the Allies, Saipan conjures up images of civilians jumping to their death rather than facing capture, leading to simplistic assessments about fanaticism being rife across all sections of Japanese society; to a focus on suicide that overshadows the true extent of the battle's collateral damage; and to largely unexamined statements about military exploitation of civilians and the murder of civilians in extremis. This article uses the memoirs of civilian survivors of the battle to reflect on the civilian experience of the battle of Saipan, relationships between Japanese combatants and non-combatants during the fighting, and the complexities of surrender.

AB Child poverty leads to various negative consequences, including low self-esteem, which is a risk factor for mental illness, suicide, or poor academic achievement. However, little is known about why child poverty leads to low self-esteem. We aimed to elucidate the association of child poverty and low self-esteem based on the ecological model, which includes family-level, school-level, and community-level factors. Data were obtained from the Adachi Child Health Impact of Living Difficulty (A-CHILD) study in 2016, and participants included 1,652 children in fourth grade (534 pairs), sixth grade (530 pairs), and eighth grade (588 pairs) living in Adachi City, Tokyo, Japan. A questionnaire survey was implemented to assess child poverty, parental mental health, parental involvement with children, parental social capital by caregivers, and self-esteem and school social capital by children. The structural equation model was applied to elucidate the association between child poverty and low self-esteem, using family-level (parental mental health and parental involvement with children), school-level (school social capital), and community-level (parental social capital) factors. Child poverty was associated with low self-esteem. Child poverty leads to poor parental involvement, which can be indirectly associated with poor parental mental health and poor parental social capital, and poor parental involvement was directly or indirectly associated with low self-esteem through poor school social capital. To mitigate the impact of child poverty on low self-esteem, comprehensive health policies targeting family-level (parental mental health and parental involvement with children), school-level (school social capital), and community-level (parental social capital) factors may be effective.

AB Objective: Little is known about whether economic crises widen health inequalities. Japan experienced more than 10 years of economic recession beginning in the 1990s. The question of whether socioeconomic-based inequality in self-rated health widened after the economic crisis was examined.
   Design, setting and participants: Repeated cross-sectional survey design. Two pooled datasets from 1986 and 1989 and from 1998 and 2001 were analysed separately, and temporal change was examined. The study took place in Japan among the working-age population (20-60 years old). The two surveys consisted of 168 801 and 150 016 people, respectively, with about an 80% response rate.
   Results: The absolute percentages of people reporting poor health declined across all socioeconomic statuses following the crisis. However, after controlling for confounding factors, the odds ratio ( OR) for poor self-rated health (95% confidence intervals) among middle-class non-manual workers (clerical/sales/service workers) compared with the highest class workers (managers/administrators) was 1.02 ( 0.92 to 1.14) before the crisis but increased to 1.14 ( 1.02 to 1.29) after the crisis ( p for temporal change = 0.02). The association was stronger among males. The adjusted ORs among professional workers and young female homemakers also marginally increased over time. Unemployed people were twice as likely to report poor health compared with the highest class workers throughout the period. Self-rated health of people with middle to higher incomes deteriorated in relative terms following the crisis compared with that of lower income people.
   Conclusions: Self-rated health improved in absolute terms for all occupational groups even after the economic recession. However, the relative disparity increased between the top and middle occupational groups in men.

TI The effects of emotion on tip-of-the-tongue states
SO PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID EVENT-RELATED FMRI; RETRIEVAL; RECALL
AB Tip-of-the-tongue states (TOTs) are judgments of the likelihood of imminent retrieval for items currently not recalled. In the present study, the relation of emotion to the experience of TOTs is explored. Emotion-inducing questions (e.g., "What is the term for ritual suicide in Japan?") were embedded among neutral questions (e.g., "What is the capital of Denmark?"). Participants attempted to recall the answers and, if unsuccessful, were asked if they were in a TOT and given a recognition test. For turecalled items, there were significantly more TOTs for the emotional items than for the neutral items, even though the recognition performance was identical. There were more TOTs for questions that followed emotional questions than TOTs for questions that followed neutral questions, suggesting the emotional arousal lasts beyond the specific question. These findings suggest that emotional cues increase the likelihood of TOTs. These data are consistent with a metacognitive view of TOTs.

AB Objective Stress has major socioeconomic implications for all spheres of employment. It is a trigger for depression, and affects absenteeism, turnover, productivity, morale and suicide. Positive or negative cognitive stress appraisal can be a self-care strategy that affects workers' ability to cope with stress. This study examined cognitive stress appraisal among workers and identified related individual and environmental factors.
   Design Cross-sectional study using self-administered postal questionnaires.
   Setting Companies located in two metropolitan areas of Japan (Tokyo and Kanagawa prefectures).
   Participants 2311 employees of 48 companies in metropolitan areas in Japan. In total, 341 questionnaires were returned (response rate: 14.8%), 337 of which were suitable for analysis (effective response rate: 98.8%).
   Primary measures Cognitive stress appraisal was assessed using the Japanese version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Potential variables related to stress appraisal included demographic, individual and environmental factors. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify factors related to cognitive stress appraisal.
   Results Participants' mean +/- SD age was 42.8 +/- 11.7 years, and two-thirds were male. The mean +/- SD PSS score was 25.8 +/- 6.2. The multiple regression analysis controlled for age, sex and depression showed that those with poorer economic status beta=0.171, p<0.001), lower electronic health (eHealth) literacy (beta=-0.113, p=0.012), higher traditional organisational climate beta=0.131, p=0.004) and lower perceived social support (beta=-0.205, p<0.001) experienced significantly higher levels of negatively perceived stress.
   Conclusions The results show individual and environmental factors related to cognitive stress appraisal among workers. An effective strategy to improve mental health among workers may involve an interprofessional approach by public health nurses and health practitioners that includes enhanced self-coping skills using individual workers' eHealth literacy, improvement of organisational climates in workplaces and community-based social support.

ID NEUROPSYCHIATRIC ADVERSE EVENTS; INFLUENZA; CHILDREN; METABOLITE; SAFETY
AB Oseltamivir was developed for prophylactic and therapeutic use against influenza, specifically targeting the viral enzyme's highly-conserved active site. In recent years, there have been case reports of neuropsychiatric events during or after oseltamivir treatment, in Japan, and other countries. However, a search of the literature revealed no such cases in South Korea. We present the case of a 15-year-old female adolescent diagnosed with depressive episode after taking oseltamivir. Oseltamivir is generally well tolerated. Its most frequent adverse effects include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. In influenza patients taking oseltamivir, neuropsychiatric adverse events include delirium, behavioral disturbance, suicide, delusion, panic attack, convulsion, depressed mood, loss of consciousness, etc. Reportedly, such neuropsychiatric adverse events were more common in children than in adults and generally occurred within 48 hours of administration. Here, we report a retrospective review case of an oseltamivir-related neuropsychiatric event in a female adolescent in South Korea. Psychiatry Investig 2010;7:302-304

AB Although euthanasia has been a pressing ethical and public issue, empirical data are lacking in Japan. We aimed to explore Japanese nurses' attitudes to patients' requests for euthanasia and to estimate the proportion of nurses who have taken active steps to hasten death. A postal survey was conducted between October and December 1999 among all nurse members of the Japanese Association of Palliative Medicine, using a self-administered questionnaire based on the one used in a previous survey with Australian nurses in 1991. The response rate was 68%. A total of 53% of the respondents had been asked by patients to hasten their death, but none had taken active steps to bring about death. Only 23% regarded voluntary active euthanasia as something ethically right and 14% would practice it if it were legal. A comparison with empirical data from the previous Australian study suggests a significantly more conservative attitude among Japanese nurses.

AB Depression is a major cause of suicide among adolescents. Therefore, childhood and adolescent depression is an important public health concern. This study explored factors as class and individual levels that may influence depression among adolescents in Japan.
   A questionnaire survey among junior high school students (N = 2968) from two cities in Japan was conducted. Depression was assessed using the Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children; teachers' support was assessed using the Scale of Expectancy for Social Support. The class average score of teachers' support was calculated to indicate what we termed the "homeroom teachers' support." Multilevel analysis was applied to clarify the relation between homeroom teachers' support and depression.
   Finally, 2466 students completed the questionnaire without missing variables (valid response rate, 83.1%). There was no random effect of the teachers' support at the class level on depression, although there was a significant association between teachers' support and depression for 9th graders (beta = -0.12, p = 0.009). Moreover, there were significant associations between economic status, having a best friend, and experiencing unforgettable stress at the individual level and depression in all grades.
   There was no significant random effect of homeroom teachers' support in class level although there might be marginal negative association between teacher's support and depression. It is suggested that homeroom teachers need to promote population approaches to mental health.

AB A questionnaire survey was conducted among 3,233 workers (2,442 males and 791 females) from 17 medium-sized business establishments in northern Japan with respect to GHQ-12 score, suicidal ideation, sociodemographic characteristics, work-associated factors, and attitude toward mental health resources. Sex differences were assessed for each questionnaire item, and logistic regression analyses were performed separately for males and females. Significant correlations between common mental disorder (CMD: GHQ-12 score >= 3) and the following factors were found for both sexes: short sleep, irregular working schedule, working in specific businesses, and attitude toward mental health resources. Associations between CMD and excess workload were significant only in male workers. While correlations between suicidal ideation and demand for mental health resources were observed in both sexes, significant correlations were observed between suicidal ideation and use of mental health resources for female workers alone. These results suggest that screening of a high-risk population and provision of mental health resources contribute to suicide prevention as a part of mental health promotion measures in medium-sized business establishments. They also suggest the need for identification of business/job type-specific stressors while considering sex differences in lifestyle factors, working environment, and help-seeking behavior.

AB This study examines correlation between unemployment rates and juvenile homicide rates for 16-17 and 18-19 age groups during 1974-2008 in Japan, using cointegration regression and error correction models. Since the publication of Yuma. Kanazawa, and Yuma (2010), two more yearly data sets become available and we include them in this study. For 16-17 age group, our results are consistent with our previous study. For 18-19 age group, on the other hand, we find its homicide rate significantly dropped in 2000, while the effect of unemployment on homicide-higher unemployment rate is associated with higher homicide rate-have been consistently observed during the research period as in our previous study. These results are discussed in terms of the dramatic rise in Japanese suicide rate since 1998 and the public opinion calling for more severe punishment since the late 90s.

AB Cefotaxime-resistant Escherichia coli TUM 1121 was isolated from an abscess of an 83-year-old patient. The CTX-M-14 gene was located on a 70 kb plasmid. The enzyme was purified and its activity was analysed. CTX-M-14 was poorly active against ceftazidime and aztreonam. Aztreonam behaved as a competitive inhibitor. Among the tested suicide substrates for class A beta-lactamases, sulbactam was a rather good substrate. Tazobactam and clavulanic acid behaved as inactivators. The interactions between clavulanic acid and CTX-M-14 were characterised by progressive inactivation of the P-lactamase. Carbapenems such as imipenem, meropenem or doripenem did not behave as inactivators of CTX-M-14, however very small k(cat) values were observed. This result shows that CTX-M-14 is able to hydrolyse carbapenems. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy. All rights reserved.

AB This study provides descriptive information and preliminary first-year outcome data on the only overseas military gambling treatment option currently available. Implemented in January 2003 within the Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Program, U.S. Naval Hospital, Okinawa, Japan, gambling treatment was developed as a specific track within the overall substance abuse program. The present study explores the various considerations and requirements for setting up such a program, as well as a description of individuals seeking gambling treatment and preliminary outcome data. Participants consisted of all gambling referrals (N=35, 26 males; mean age, 33.2 years; SD=8.93) obtained over the first year that gambling services were offered. A significant degree of depression, suicidality, and substance abuse problems were observed in the sample. Results revealed that the gambling program was easily implemented within an established substance abuse program. The program was effective in preventing suicides in both military members and eligible beneficiaries and was effective in facilitating the retention of military members with gambling problems.

AB This study explored patterns of health-risk behaviors among Japanese high school students and examined if a cluster and an accumulation of health-risk behaviors existed. Self-administered questionnaires were employed in 1999 using a sample of 1,466 students (male 50.5%, female 49.5%) in grades 10 through 12 at seven public senior high schools in Okinawa, Japan. Health-risk behaviors studied included cigarette smoking, alcohol use, thinner use, nonuse of seat belts, suicide ideation, sexual intercourse, weight loss practices. and physical inactivity. Among male and female students, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and sexual intercourse clustered Accumulation of these risk behaviors also occurred because the observed proportion was greater than the expected proportion assuming independent occurrence. Vocational high school students and upper graders were strongly associated with accumulation of health risk behaviors. These findings identify a high-risk target group among Japanese adolescents and suggest that preventive intervention strategies should take into consideration the cluster and accumulation of health-risk behaviors.

AB Little is known about psychotropic medication prescriptions prior to drug overdose.
   We aimed to examine the possible associations between the risk of overdose and exposures to various psychotropic medications.
   We conducted a matched case-control study of 3 groups of patients aged 12-74 years, using a large-scale health insurance claims database in Japan (population 1.2 million). A total of 351 cases with drug poisoning were compared with two control groups without overdose: 1755 patients with any treatment (general controls) and those with depression (high-risk controls). Current, past, and nonusers were patients most recently exposed to psychotropic medications a parts per thousand currency sign90 days, 91-180 days, and a parts per thousand yen180 days before the index date.
   Current sedative-hypnotic use was associated with an increased odds of overdose relative to general control nonusers (odds ratio [OR], 21.5; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 9.7-47.8) and high-risk control nonusers (OR, 2.6; 95 % CI, 1.9-3.5). In the comparison of cases and high-risk controls, the ORs for overdose were higher among excessive dosage users than among usual dosage users (OR, 4.3; 95 % CI, 3.0-6.1), among barbiturate users than among benzodiazepine/Z-drug only users (OR, 4.5; 95 % CI, 2.3-8.7), and among multiple provider episodes than among single provider episodes (OR, 4.4; 95 % CI, 1.7-11.0). Psychiatrists prescribed more than 77 % of potentially questionable prescriptions.
   These results highlight the need for psychiatrists to monitor prescribed medications and balance the benefits and risks of pharmacological treatments.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Traditional autopsy has changed little in the past century. In Japan, the rate of forensic autopsy in cases of unusual death is very low. Therefore, multi-slice computed tomography (CT) has been used to obtain imaging data instead of or in addition to autopsy in suspicious forensic cases. In our institute, postmortem multi-slice CT has been performed since 2009, and by 2014 there were over 1,000 cases. Our extensive experience with postmortem CT shows that in many cases of death by drug overdose, stomach contents exhibit high X-ray absorption. This article reviews the relationship between CT findings of stomach contents and toxicological analysis results in 23 cases of death by drug overdose. All cases (12 females and 11 males, aged 44 11 years) known to have orally ingested drugs were included in this study. We assessed the slices of all stomach areas on consecutive axial CT images. Twenty cases (87%) showed high X-ray absorption in the stomach, while the other three did not demonstrate radio-dense stomach contents even though drug analysis detected lethal concentrations of drugs in the blood. In conclusion, drugs were frequently, but not always, visualized as contents with high X-ray absorption in the stomach. Postmortem gastric CT images can provide useful information in cases of oral drug intoxication if there are empty drug packages or a suicide note at the death scene. However, precise determination of the cause of death requires full autopsy in cases where there is no indication of suicide at the death scene.

AB The incidence of prostate cancer has dramatically increased worldwide in the past decade, with mortality rates also increasing in many countries. Once prostate cancer is diagnosed, it is important to rapidly begin a treatment regimen that is either potentially curative or impedes disease progression. When the disease is confined to the prostate, it can be cured by radical prostatectomy or irradiation therapy. However, there are no curative therapies for locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic diseases. Clearly, new therapies are needed for these patients. Gene therapy may provide additional therapeutic options with the potential to affect both localized and metastatic disease. Virus-mediated transduction of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene transfer, followed by a course of the prodrug ganciclovir (GCV), so-called suicide gene therapy, has been demonstrated by several investigators. The present in situ gene therapy clinical trial for human prostate cancer demonstrated safety, clinical efficacy, and biological effects of antitumor activity. HSV-tk clinical trials for prostate cancer are also ongoing in Japan, the Netherlands, and Mexico. Currently, numerous preclinical studies have reported immunomodulatory cytokine gene therapy, such as interleukin-2, interleukin-12, B7-1 (CD80), B7-2 (CD86) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Several clinical studies have been approved that potentially will show that these immunomodulatory gene therapies may generate an effective local and systemic antitumor activity and that should provide options for patients with prostate cancer. We review the multiple issues involved in current in situ gene therapy (gene/immunotherapy), its outcome, and future directions for patients with prostate cancer.

AB This paper examines the colonial discourse of the global population problem in Korea under Japanese rule (1910-1945). I consider the recent call of Alison Bashford to draw attention to the geopolitical and spatial dimensions of the colonial population discourse in the non-Western Japanese Empire and to interrogate global population from the perspective of East Asian imperialism in the twentieth century. By opening up the colonial archives on population through an examination of colonial state and pro-state magazines in Korea, such as Chsen (Korea) and Chsen oyobi Manchu (Korea and Manchuria), I demonstrate how metropolitan and colonial elites, including imperial and colonial state officials, politicians, intellectuals, physicians and so on, at pains to build Japan's empire, engaged in the debates on jink mondai (population problem) in 1920s and 1930s Korea. The details of the debate bring to light the ways in which the management of the population problem undergirded the complex issues of the peninsula and the empire at large, including emigration, Japanese settlement, the cultivation of Manchuria, the development of mining and heavy chemical industries, the Sino-Japanese War, Western imperial rule, and the emancipation of the coloured populations/races. Further, I delineate how these details were deeply imbedded in the racialized struggle between the Japanese race/coloured races vs. the white race in the global governance of the population and territory in the final phase of Japanese imperial aggression. By going beyond the Western, Anglo-Saxon debates on population, this paper seeks to showcase how East Asian imperial power responded to the white, Western discourse of race suicide vs. the yellow peril'.

TI The public health effect of economic crises and alternative policy
   responses in Europe: an empirical analysis
SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article
ID MORTALITY; JAPAN; RATES; ASIA
AB Background There is widespread concern that the present economic crisis, particularly its effect on unemployment, will adversely affect population health. We investigated how economic changes have affected mortality rates over the past three decades and identified how governments might reduce adverse effects.
   Methods We used multivariate regression, correcting for population ageing, past mortality and employment trends, and country-specific differences in health-care infrastructure, to examine associations between changes in employment and mortality, and how associations were modified by different types of government expenditure for 26 European Union (EU) countries between 1970 and 2007.
   Findings We noted that every 1% increase in unemployment was associated with a 0.79% rise in suicides at ages younger than 65 years (95% CI 0.16-1.42; 60-550 potential excess deaths [mean 310] EU-wide), although the effect size was non-significant at all ages (0.49%, -0.04 to 1.02), and with a 0.79% rise in homicides (95% CI 0.06-1.52; 3-80 potential excess deaths [mean 40] EU-wide). By contrast, road-traffic deaths decreased by 1.39% (0.64-2.14; 290-980 potential fewer deaths [mean 630] EU-wide). A more than 3% increase in unemployment had a greater effect on suicides at ages younger than 65 years (4.45%, 95% CI 0.65-8.24; 250-3220 potential excess deaths [mean 1740] EU-wide) and deaths from alcohol abuse (28.0%,12.30-43.70; 1550-5490 potential excess deaths [mean 3500] EU-wide). We noted no consistent evidence across the EU that all-cause mortality rates increased when unemployment rose, although populations varied substantially in how sensitive mortality was to economic crises, depending partly on differences in social protection. Every US$10 per person increased investment in active labour market programmes reduced the effect of unemployment on suicides by 0.038% (95% CI -0.004 to -0.071).
   Interpretation Rises in unemployment are associated with significant short-term increases in premature deaths from intentional violence, while reducing traffic fatalities. Active labour market programmes that keep and reintegrate workers in jobs could mitigate some adverse health effects of economic downturns.

AB It has been well established that statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, reduce mortality from cardiovascular diseases. Statins, a class of cholesterol-lowering drug, may also affect mortality from various diseases by their pleiotropic effects of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities. However, there are only few reports concerning the effects of statins on diseases other than cardiovascular diseases. We therefore designed a population-based analysis, using the data from marketing surveys on statin sales and government reports on mortalities. We compared the statin use as expressed by statin sales per capita in the aged ( >= 65-year-old) population with mortality from major causes of death among 47 prefectures in Japan. As expected, there were significant negative correlations between statin sales per capita and mortality from cardiovascular diseases (p < 0.05). In addition, we found that there was a correlation between statin sales and the decrease in mortality from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (p < 0.0001), senility (p < 0.01), pneumonia (p < 0.05), accidents (p < 0.05), or all death causes (p < 0.05). However, statin sales were not associated with mortalities from renal failure, liver diseases, suicide, and malignant diseases. These results suggest a broad spectrum of beneficial effects of statins, including reduction of mortality rate of COPD as well as cardiovascular diseases. It will be worthy to confirm the protective effect of statins on COPD by prospective randomized clinical trials.

ID ATTRACTIONS
AB This article examines the phenomenon of war-related contents tourism on five small islands in the area of the Seto Inland Sea. While the majority of Japan's densely populated metropolitan areas have complex war histories and networks of commemorative sites and/or tourist sites, small islands are associated with a singular war experience or memory that sustains a tourist attraction on the island. Focusing on such islands allows insights into the ways in which films, novels, games, and other forms of popular culture induce tourism to war-related sites. First, the concept of war-related contents tourism is defined via a critique of the in-vogue concept of dark tourism and its Japanese counterpart, daku tsurizumu. Then, the dynamics of war-related tourism are depicted in five island case studies: Okunoshima (Hiroshima prefecture, "Rabbit Island" and site of a poison gas factory), Shodoshima (Kagawa prefecture, setting of the novel/film Twenty-four Eyes), Okinoshima (Wakayama prefecture, a coastal gun battery popular now as a site of cosplay), Ozushima ( Yamaguchi prefecture, a training base for kaiten suicide attack submarines), and Nomishima (Hiroshima prefecture, site of the Etajima Naval Academy). These islands are also examples of media tourism or contents tourism, where the representation of the history in entertainment formats or the promotion of tourism for " leisure and pleasure" has made the war-related tourism seem more akin to " light/lite tourism" than " dark tourism."

AB Gene therapies are classified into two major categories, namely, in vivo and ex vivo. Clinical trials of human gene therapy began with the ex vivo techniques. Based on the initial successes of gene-therapy clinical trials, these approaches have spread worldwide. The number of gene therapy trials approved worldwide increased gradually starting in 1989, reaching 116 protocols per year in 1999, and a total of 2210 protocols had been approved by 2015. Accumulating clinical evidence has demonstrated the safety and benefits of several types of gene therapy, with the exception of serious adverse events in several clinical trials. These painful experiences were translated backward to basic science, resulting in the development of several new technologies that have influenced the recent development of ex vivo gene therapy in this field. To date, six gene therapies have been approved in a limited number of countries worldwide. In Japan, clinical trials of gene therapy have developed under the strong influence of trials in the US and Europe. Since the initial stages, 50 clinical trials have been approved by the Japanese government. In this review, the history and current status of clinical trials of ex vivo gene therapy for hematological disorders are introduced and discussed.

AB The purpose of the present study was to clarify the relationship between bulimic behavior, dissociative phenomenon and sexual/physical abuse histories in Japanese subjects with habitual self-mutilation. Subjects consisted of 34 female outpatients who had cut their wrists or arms on more than 10 occasions. Two age-matched groups, which consisted of 31 general psychiatric outpatients and 26 non-clinical volunteers, served as controls. They were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II, Bulimia Investigatory Test of Edinburgh, Adolescent Dissociative Experience Scale, and an original self-reporting questionnaire concerning various problematic behaviors and sexual/physical abuse histories. The habitual self-mutilation and the two control groups were compared. The habitual self-mutilation group had significantly higher scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-II, Bulimia Investigatory Test of Edinburgh, and Adolescent Dissociative Experience Scale than either of the two control groups (P<0.001). Furthermore, the habitual self-mutilation group more frequently had a history of illicit psychoactive drug use (P=0.001), shoplifting (P<0.001), suicide attempts (P<0.001), overdosing with medicine (P<0.001), sexual abuse (P=0.011), and childhood physical abuse (P=0.001) than the general psychiatric controls. These results are consistent with those in Western studies. Habitual self-mutilation is likely to coexist with depression, bulimia, and dissociation. Such patients frequently have clinical features similar to those of 'multi-impulsive bulimia'. Evidence supports the association between habitual self-mutilation and sexual/childhood physical abuse in Japan.

AB We searched databases and used various online resources to identify and systematically review all articles on occupational psychiatric disorders among Korean workers published in English and Korean before 2009. Three kinds of occupational psychiatric disorders were studied: disorders related to job stress and mental illness, psychiatric symptoms emerging in victims of industrial injuries, and occupational psychiatric disorders compensated by Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance (IACI). Korea does not maintain official statistical records for occupational psychiatric disorders, but several studies have estimated the number of occupational psychiatric disorders using the Korea Workers' Compensation and Welfare Service (COMWEL, formerly KLWC) database. The major compensated occupational psychiatric disorders in Korea were "personality and behavioral disorders due to brain disease, damage, and dysfunction", "other mental disorders due to brain damage and dysfunction and to physical diseases", "reactions to severe stress and adjustment disorders", and "depressive episodes". The most common work-related psychiatric disorders, excluding accidents, were "neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders" followed by "mood disorders".

TI Public Mood and Consumption Choices: Evidence from Sales of Sony Cameras
   on Taobao
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Previous researchers have tried to predict social and economic phenomena with indicators of public mood, which were extracted from online data. This method has been proved to be feasible in many areas such as financial markets, economic operations and even national suicide numbers. However, few previous researches have examined the relationship between public mood and consumption choices at society level. The present study paid attention to the "Diaoyu Island" event, and extracted Chinese public mood data toward Japan from Sina MicroBlog (the biggest social media in China), which demonstrated a significant cross-correlation between the public mood variable and sales of Sony cameras on Taobao (the biggest Chinese e-business company). Afterwards, several candidate predictors of sales were examined and finally three significant stepwise regression models were obtained. Results of models estimation showed that significance (F-statistics), R-square and predictive accuracy (MAPE) all improved due to inclusion of public mood variable. These results indicate that public mood is significantly associated with consumption choices and may be of value in sales forecasting for particular products.

SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND INSURANCE

DT Article
ID GUN OWNERSHIP; HOMICIDE; SUICIDE; RATES; REGULATIONS; HANDGUN; RISKS;
   CRIME
AB The United States remains far behind most other affluent countries in terms of life expectancy. One of the possible causes of this life expectancy gap is the widespread availability of firearms and the resulting high number of U.S. firearm fatalities: 10,801 homicides in 2000. The European Union experienced 1,260 homicides, Japan only 22. Using multiple decrement techniques, I show that firearm violence shortens the life of an average American by 104 days (151 days for white males, 362 days for black males). Among all fatal injuries, only motor vehicle accidents have a stronger effect. I estimate that the elimination of all firearm deaths in the United States would increase the male life expectancy more than the total eradication of all colon and prostate cancers. My results suggest that the insurance premium increases paid by Americans as a result of firearm violence are probably of the same order of magnitude as the total medical costs due to gunshots or the increased cost of administering the criminal justice system due to gun crime.

ID DEPRESSION; PREVALENCE; BEHAVIOR; GENDER; HEALTH
AB To examine associations of suicidal ideation with somatic symptoms, 863 outpatients were studied in a psychosomatic clinic in Japan, All subjects were diagnosed according to the third and fourth editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R and DSM-IV). They completed the Cornell Medical Index Questionnaire to assess suicidal ideation and 1.5 major somatic symptoms. Mood states were rated using the Profile of Mood States (POMS). In the study, 266 patients (31%) reported suicidal ideation. The age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios (typically in the range of 1.5 to 2.5) of somatic symptoms for suicide ideation showed significant differences (all ps <.05) for 13 of 15 symptoms. The total number of somatic symptoms predicted suicidal ideation (P <.05), controlling for the significant effects of sex, education, marital status, and the POMS Depression scale scores through multiple regression analysis. Evaluation of somatic symptoms might be important to assess suicidal ideation in a psychosomatic medicine population.

AB Despite growing interest in meaning in life, many have voiced their concern over the conceptual refinement of the construct itself. Researchers seem to have two main ways to understand what meaning in life means: coherence and purpose, with a third way, significance, gaining increasing attention. Coherence means a sense of comprehensibility and one's life making sense. Purpose means a sense of core goals, aims, and direction in life. Significance is about a sense of life's inherent value and having a life worth living. Although some researchers have already noted this trichotomy, the present article provides the first comprehensible theoretical overview that aims to define and pinpoint the differences and connections between these three facets of meaning. By arguing that the time is ripe to move from indiscriminate understanding of meaning into looking at these three facets separately, the article points toward a new future for research on meaning in life.

ID FORMALDEHYDE INGESTION; CORROSIVE GASTRITIS
AB The ingestion of formalin causes disorders in the oral cavity, the gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, lung, heart, and central nervous system in the early phase of reaction. The stomach suffers the most severe damage in such cases because the formalin is in contact with the gastric mucosa longer than in the other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Gastric ulcers and mild hemorrhaging are frequently seen. There are no reported cases of gastric perforations in Japan (n = 15), and there are only two reported cases in other countries since 1950 (n = 11). The ingestion of formalin could lead to peritonitis without perforation because of gastric wall inflammation. Cicatrical stricture of the stomach tends to be a major problem in the late phase of formalin ingestion. Similar to our case, seven of twelve reported cases of cicatrical deformity survived without operation. Therefore, a gastrectomy for the cicatrical deformity might not be always indicated if the patients are able to feed themselves sufficiently or if parenteral nutrition can be provided.

DT Article
DE Jiu-Jitsu; jujutsu; Theodore Roosevelt; martial arts; manliness;
   orientalism; Progressive Era
AB The emergence of Japan as a major world power in the early twentieth century generated anxiety over America's place in the world. Fears of race suicide combined with a fear of the feminizing effects of over-civilization further exacerbated these tensions. Japanese jiu-jitsu came to symbolize these debates. As a physical example of the yellow peril, Japanese martial arts posed a threat to western martial arts of boxing and wrestling. The efficiency and effectiveness of Japanese jiu-jitsu, as introduced to Americans in the early twentieth century, challenged preconceived notions of the superiority of western martial arts and therefore American constructions of race and masculinity. As Theodore Roosevelt and the U.S. nation wrestled with the Japanese and jiu-jitsu, they responded in various ways to this new menace. The jiu-jitsu threat was ultimately subjugated by simultaneously exoticizing, feminizing, and appropriating aspects of it in order to reassert the dominance of western martial arts, the white race and American masculinity.

AB There is growing evidence that blood levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), a major metabolite of noradrenaline, are related to depression-associated personality traits as well as to depressive, suicidal and anxious states. Psychological job stress is well known to lead to symptoms of depression, anxiety and suicide. We have recently reported that psychological job stress among hospital employees altered blood levels of BDNF and MHPG (Mitoma et al., 2008). In the present study, we re-examined the effects of social adaptation and personality traits, as well as those of psychological job stress, on plasma levels of BDNF and MHPG in healthy employees (n = 269, male/female = 210/59, age = 49 +/- 10 years) working in a publishing company in Japan. The values (mean +/- SD) of scores on the Stress and Arousal Check Lists (s-SACL and a-SACL), Social Adaptation Self-evaluation Scale (SASS), plasma MHPG levels and plasma BDNF levels were 6.0 +/- 3.4, 5.7 +/- 23, 33.7 +/- 6.8, 5.8 +/- 4.3 and 4.6 +/- 3.1 ng ml(-1), respectively. A positive correlation was found between plasma MHPG levels and scores on the s-SACL, but not the a-SACL. A positive correlation was also found between SASS scores and plasma MHPG levels and between SASS scores and plasma BDNF levels. A negative correlation was found between plasma BDNF levels and s-SACL scores. Furthermore, a positive correlation between NEO-Five factor Inventory (Openness) scores and plasma MHPG levels was observed, as well as between NEO-Five factor Inventory (Extroversion) scores and plasma BDNF levels. These results suggest that levels of plasma BDNF and plasma MHPG might be associated with psychological job stress and certain personality traits among employees in the publishing industry in Japan.

AB Background: This study aims to determine whether significant associations exist between the parents' country of birth and adolescent depressive symptoms in the early stages of a multicultural society.
   Methods: We used data from the 2012-2016 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey, which included responses from 327,357 individuals. Participants were classified into groups according to their parent's country of birth. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the significance of the associations.
   Results: Adolescents whose parents were born abroad are more likely to have depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-2.12) than adolescents whose parents were native Koreans. Respondents whose father was born in North Korea or Japan or Taiwan show greater odds of depressive symptoms than respondents whose parents were native Korean.
   Conclusion: Adolescents whose parents were born abroad are more likely to have depressive symptoms. Multicultural family support policies should be implemented in consideration of the characteristics of the parents' country of birth.

AB Objectives: To examine the extent to which social support and socio-economic status (SES) in adulthood mediate the impact of interpersonal adversity in childhood on adult mental health using large-scale population data in Japan.
   Study design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Methods: Data were derived from the Japanese Study of Stratification, Health, Income and Neighbourhood, which was conducted from October 2010 to February 2011 in four municipalities in and around the Tokyo metropolitan area. Survey participants were community residents aged 25-50 years who were selected at random from voter registration lists. The total sample size was 3292. The self-reported experience of parental maltreatment (physical abuse and/or neglect) and bullying in school and their impacts on adult mental health (in terms of K6 - 5+, K6 - 13+ and suicide ideation) were examined using multivariate logistic models.
   Results: Interpersonal adversity in childhood has a negative impact on adult mental health even after controlling for childhood SES. For example, the odds ratio for K6 = 5+, responding to parental maltreatment, was 2.64 (95% confidence interval 2.04-3.41). Perceived social support and adult SES mediated the impact of interpersonal adversity in childhood, but a substantial proportion of the impact was unexplained by their mediating effects; social support and adult SES only mediated 11-24% and 6-12%, respectively. It was also found that social support and adult SES (except educational attainment) did not moderate the negative impact of interpersonal adversity in childhood.
   Conclusions: This analysis highlighted that the impact of interpersonal adversity in childhood is relatively independent of social support and SES in adulthood. This result has clear policy implications; more focus should be placed on policies that aim to reduce incidents of childhood maltreatment and bullying per se, both of which have a long-lasting direct impact on mental health.

AB Objective: Social capital, the collective resources of groups including perceptions of trust and reciprocity, is recognized as an important contributor to suicide. We examined the association of individual-and community-level social capital with suicidal ideation after adjusting for social support among older adults living in the community. Methods: In August 2010 we sent questionnaires to all residents aged 65 years and older living in 3 rural municipalities (N = 21,232) in Okayama Prefecture, Japan; 13,919 questionnaires were returned (response rate: 65.6%). The final analysis included 10,094 participants. The outcome variable was suicidal ideation. Exposure variables were individual-level mistrust and lack of reciprocity (level 1), and the aggregated responses of these variables from 35 communities in the municipalities (level 2). Covariates included age, sex, educational attainment, marital status, the number of cohabitants, years of residence, self-rated socioeconomic status, disability, social support, and psychological distress. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was performed to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: After adjusting for social support and psychological distress, we found that mistrust and lack of reciprocity were only associated with suicidal ideation at the individual level. Stratified analysis showed that among subjects with psychological distress, mistrust was associated with suicidal ideation at individual (OR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.42-2.51) and community levels (OR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.02-3.81). Conclusions: Our findings show that individual-and community-level social capital is a possible protective factor for suicidal ideation, particularly for people with psychological distress.

AB Aim Little is known about the detailed characteristics of patients using gas substances for self-inflicted injury in prehospital settings. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics, incidence trends, and outcomes of patients who used gas substances for self-inflicted injury in Osaka City, Japan, using ambulance records. Methods This was a retrospective observational study that used data from 2009 to 2015. We extracted details from ambulance records of self-inflicted injury patients who used gas substances. The annual incidence of self-inflicted injury by gas substance and age group and Poisson regression models were applied for calculating the annual incidence trend by type of gas substance. The main outcome was confirmed death at the scene, and we also calculated the crude odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for each gas substance. Results During the study period, there were 324 self-inflicted injury patients who used gas substances. The most commonly used gases were carbon monoxide (CO) (54.9%), followed by hydrogen sulfide (12.7%), helium (6.5%). The incidence of CO and hydrogen sulfide have subsequently decreased (P for trend = 0.023 and <0.001, respectively); however, the incidence of helium did not change during the study period (P for trend = 0.586). The mortality rate was highest in patients who used helium (66.7% [14/21]) and the crude odds ratio of helium was 3.857 (95% confidence interval, 1.267-11.745; P = 0.017) compared with hydrogen sulfide. Conclusion This study revealed that the incidence of self-inflicted injury with helium did not change and its proportion of death at the scene was high in Osaka City.

AB The purpose of the present study is to clarify the impact of multiple births in fatal child maltreatment (child death due to maltreatment).
   The national annual reports on fatal child maltreatment, which contain all cases from July 2003 to March 2011, published by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan, were used as the initial sources of information. Parent-child murder-suicide cases were excluded from the analyses. Multiple births, teenage pregnancy and low-birthweight were regarded as the exposed groups. The relative risks (RRs) and their 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the data from the above reports and vital statistics. These analyses were performed both including and excluding missing values.
   Among 437 fatal child maltreatment cases, 14 multiple births from 13 families were identified. The RRs of multiple births per individual were 1.8 (95 % CI 1.0-3.0) when including missing values and 2.7 (95 % CI 1.5-4.8) when excluding missing values. The RRs of multiple births per family were 3.6 (95 % CI 2.1-6.2) when including missing values and 4.9 (95 % CI 2.7-9.0) when excluding missing values. The RR tended to be much lower than the RR of teenage pregnancy (RR 12.9 or 22.2), but slightly higher than the RR of low-birthweight (RR 1.4 or 2.9).
   Families with multiple births had elevated risk for fatal child maltreatment both per individual and per family unit. Health providers should be aware that multiple pregnancies/births may place significant stress on families and should provide appropriate support and intervention.

AB Despite significant therapeutic advances, mortality of dialysis patients remains unacceptably high. The aim of this study is to compare mortality and its causes in dialysis patients with those in the general Japanese population. We used data for 2008 and 2009 from the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy registry and a national Vital Statistics survey. Cardiovascular mortality was defined as death attributed to heart failure, cerebrovascular disorders, myocardial infarction, hyperkalemia/sudden death, and pulmonary thromboembolism. Non-cardiovascular mortality was defined as death attributed to infection, malignancies, cachexia/uremia, chronic hepatitis/cirrhosis, ileus, bleeding, suicide/refusal of treatment, and miscellaneous. We calculated standardized mortality ratios and age-adjusted mortality differences between dialysis patients and the general population for all-cause, cardiovascular versus non-cardiovascular, and cause-specific mortality. During the 2-year study period, there were 2284272 and 51432 deaths out of 126 million people and 273237 dialysis patients, respectively. The standardized mortality ratio for all-cause mortality was 4.6 (95% confidence interval, 4.6-4.7) for the dialysis patients compared to the general population. Age-adjusted mortality differences for cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular disease were 33.1 and 30.0 per 1000 person-years, respectively. The standardized mortality rate ratios were significant for all cause-specific mortality rates except accidental death. Our study revealed that excess mortality in dialysis patients compared to the general population in Japan is large, and differs according to age and cause of death. Cause-specific mortality studies should be planned to improve life expectancies of dialysis patients.

AB Objective We conducted a multicenter retrospective survey of patients poisoned by synthetic chemicals (SCs) in Japan.
   Methods Letters were sent to 467 emergency facilities requesting participation in the study, and questionnaires were mailed to facilities that agreed to participate. Patients The study participants were patients who were transported to emergency facilities between January 2006 and December 2012 after consuming SC-containing products.
   Results We surveyed 518 patients from 60 (12.8%) facilities. Most patients were male (82.0%), in their 20s or 30s (80.5%), and had inhaled SCs (87.5%) contained in herbal products (86.0%). Harmful behavior was observed at the scene of poisoning for 56 patients (10.8%), including violence to others or things in 32, traffic accidents in seven, and self-injury or suicide attempts in four. Other than physical and neuropsychiatric symptoms, some patients also had physical complications, such as rhabdomyolysis (10.0%). Of the 182 patients (35.1%) admitted to hospitals, including 29 (5.6%) who needed respirators, all of the 21 (4.1%) hospitalized for at least seven days were male, and 20 had physical complications (rhabdomyolysis, 12; liver dysfunction, 5; renal dysfunction, 11; and physical injuries, 3). Most patients (95.6%) completely recovered, although 10 (1.9%) were transferred to a psychiatric department or hospital, and three (0.6%) were handed over to the police due to combative or violent behavior. SCs such as synthetic cannabinoids, synthetic cathinones, or methoxetamine were detected in 20 product samples.
   Conclusion Consuming products containing SCs can result in physical complications, including rhabdomyolysis, injuries, and physical or neuropsychiatric symptoms, which may require active interventions, such as respirator use or prolonged hospitalization.

AB Background: The effect of disasters on suicidality is not known. We aimed to retrospectively determine the cumulative incidence of suicidal ideation during the 3 years after the Great East Japan Earthquake among residents in temporary housing without prior suicidal ideation, as compared to the general population. Moreover, we aimed to identify the risk factors for the onset of suicidal ideation.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey involving face-to-face interviews was conducted 3 years after the earthquake with adult community residents in disaster-affected areas and a control area using the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview version 3.0. We compared the cumulative incidence of suicidal ideation between the two areas using the Cox proportional hazard model and examined risk factors for the onset of suicidal ideation using a multiple logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Among 1019 respondents in the disaster-affected areas, the cumulative incidence of suicidal ideation over 1, 2, and 3 years after the earthquake was 1.4%, 2.4%, and 2.8%, respectively, which was significantly higher than that in the control area. Not being married, being injured in the disaster, and poor subjective physical health were associated with the onset of suicidal ideation.
   Limitations: We estimated the time of onset of suicidal ideation based on the respondents' current age and selfreported onset age, which limits the accuracy of the onset timing.
   Conclusions: We revealed a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in temporary housing residents and identified several risk factors, which suggests the importance of developing countermeasures to prevent suicide after a disaster.

AB Background: In Japan, the annual number of deaths by suicide markedly increased in 1998 and leveled off at approximately 30,000 per year thereafter. The coping behaviors used to deal with stress may have implications for the prevention of depression and suicidal ideation. This study examined coping behaviors in relation to depression and suicidal ideation.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 6762 workers (40-60 years of age; 4119 males and 2643 females) completed both the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) and a questionnaire measuring suicidal ideation. A cut-off score of 19 was used to define probable depression for the CES-D. Stress-coping behaviors were surveyed via an inventory of 14 items that reflected of actual behaviors covering problem-focused, emotion-focused, and avoidant strategies.
   Results: In relation to depression, logistic regression analyses revealed that in both genders, the highest odds ratios (OR) for avoidant coping strategy and the lowest OR was associated with a problem-focused strategy after adjusting for covariates. After making the same adjustments, logistic regression analyses revealed that in both genders, the highest OR were for emotional distraction coping strategies in relation to suicidal ideation.
   Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of this study does not allow for causal assumptions regarding the sequential nature of the relationship between coping behaviors and the onset of depressive symptoms or suicidal ideation.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate that coping behaviors may affect both depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. Furthermore, gender differences in coping behaviors among middle-aged workers were identified. Additional studies are needed to examine the relationships among coping behaviors, depression and suicidal ideation using a longitudinal design. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate long-term, cause-specific mortality trends among patients with childhood-onset type 1 diabetes in Japan.
   Individuals included in the study had received a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes at age < 18 years between 1965 and 1979. All individuals were followed up for their survival status until 1 January 2005. The causes of death were divided into end-stage renal disease (ESRD), acute diabetic complications (ADC), accident/suicide, cardiovascular disease (CVD), infections, cancers, others (non-diabetic/diabetic) and unknown. The cause-specific mortality trends were expressed according to the follow-up period and year of diagnosis.
   A total of 1,385 patients were enrolled in the study, and the survival status of 1,324 was confirmed. Mortality rate at the 35 year follow-up (per 100,000 person-years) was 659.3, and the standardised mortality ratio (SMR) was 10.7. The SMR at the 25 year follow-up markedly declined from 19.3 in the 1965-1969 diagnosis group to 6.6 in the 1975-1979 diagnosis group. Approximately 40% died of ADC among those with < 10 years of follow-up. A similar proportion of individuals died of ESRD among those with 10-19 years of follow-up. The longer the duration of follow-up, the lower the mortality from ADC and the greater the mortality from CVD.
   In Japanese people with childhood-onset type 1 diabetes of more than 20 years of duration, CVD was the leading cause of death, as is the case among similar white people. The longer the duration of diabetes, the more attention should be paid to preventing CVD.

AB Objective: We aimed to estimate risk of recurrent overdose associated with psychosocial assessment by psychiatrists during hospitalization for nonfatal overdose and prescribing patterns of psychotropic medications after discharge.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a nationwide claims database in Japan. We classified patients aged 19-64 years hospitalized for nonfatal overdose between October 2012 and September 2013 into two cohorts: 1) those who had consulted a psychiatrist prior to overdose (n=6,790) and 2) those who had not (n=4,950). All patients were followed up from 90 days before overdose until 365 days after discharge.
   Results: Overall, 15.3% of patients with recent psychiatric treatment had a recurrent overdose within 365 days, compared with 6.0% of those without psychiatric treatment. Psychosocial assessment during hospital admission had no significant effect on subsequent overdose, irrespective of treatment by psychiatrists before overdose. There was a dose-response relationship for the association of benzodiazepine prescription after overdose with subsequent overdose in either cohort, even after accounting for average daily dosage of benzodiazepines before overdose and other confounders. In patients with recent psychiatric treatment, the cumulative proportion of recurrent overdose at 365 days was 27.7% for patients receiving excessive dosages of benzodiazepines, 22.0% for those receiving high dosages, 15.3% for those receiving normal dosages, and 7.6% for those receiving no benzodiazepines. In patients without psychiatric treatment, the cumulative proportion of recurrent overdose at 365 days was 24.3% for patients receiving excessive dosages of benzodiazepines, 18.0% for those receiving high dosages, 9.0% for those receiving normal dosages, and 4.1% for those receiving no benzodiazepines.
   Conclusion: Lower dose of benzodiazepines after overdose is associated with lower risk of subsequent overdose.

AB Background: For patients with a major depressive episode, early differential diagnosis of bipolar disorder and subsequent appropriate treatment are critical. This study, conducted in clinical settings in Japan, examined patients with a major depressive episode to investigate the prevalence and predictors of bipolar disorders.
   Methods: A total of 448 patients with a major depressive episode were interviewed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview to determine the presence of mood episodes and psychiatric comorbidities. The diagnosis of bipolar disorder was based on the collected information according to the DSM-IV-TR.
   Results: Of the 448 patients with a major depressive episode, 114 patients (25.4%) were diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Multivariate logistic regression identified five predictors that were significantly correlated with bipolar disorder: antidepressant-related switch to mania/hypomania, mixed depression, two or more previous mood episodes within the past year, early age at the onset of a major depressive episode (< 25 years), and a history of suicide attempts. The area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic analysis based on the multivariate logistic regression of the five predictors was 0.849.
   Limitations: The diagnosis of bipolar disorder in patients was already conclusively confirmed by long illness observations but was not confirmed by a prospective study.
   Conclusions: In patients with a major depressive episode, the differential diagnosis of bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, which exhibit similar depressive symptoms, is essential. Several predictors identified in the present study may be useful in supporting a differential diagnosis of these disorders in routine clinical practice. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB A case report of penetrating head injury due to 8 nails and a review of multiple penetrating head injury by nails were described. The patient who was a 48-year-old man with a history of for psychiatric care was transferred to our emergency room on May 2007. He had shot his head with 8 nails using a nail-gun in a suicide attempt. His family called an ambulance. His conscious level was 1 on the Japan Coma Scale and 15 on the Glasgow Coma Scale with monoplegia of the right lower extremity and hypoesthesia of the right extremities. X-ray films of his head revealed 8 nails penetrating his cranium. The CT scan showed thin hematoma on the right convexity. Angiography didn't demonstrate any evidence of vascular injury. Under general anesthesia, all nails were removed after craniotomy. His post-operative course was good and he was discharged home with minimal deficits.
   Penetrating head injury with nail-gun use is sometimes seen, but cases with multiple nails are rare. Operative strategies were discussed in the review. It also suggested the need for the care of mental or background problems.

AB Objectives: To test the hypothesis that relationship reported between long working hours and depression was inconsistent in previous studies because job demand was treated as a confounder. Methods: Structural equation modeling was used to construct five models, using work-related factors and depressive mood scale obtained from 218 clerical workers, to test for goodness of fit and was externally validated with data obtained from 1160 sales workers. Multiple logistic regression analysis was also performed. Results: The model that showed that long working hours increased depression risk when job demand was regarded as an intermediate variable was the best fitted model (goodness-of-fit index/root-mean-square error of approximation: 0.981 to 0.996/0.042 to 0.044). The odds ratio for depression risk with work that was high demand and 60 hours or more per week was estimated at 2 to 4 versus work that was low demand and less than 60 hours per week. Conclusions: Long working hours increased depression risk, with job demand being an intermediate variable.

AB Background: Efficient screening for depression is important in community mental health. In this study, we applied a stratum-specific likelihood ratio (SSLR) analysis, which is independent of the prevalence of the target disease, to screen for depression among community-dwelling individuals.
   Method: The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) were administered to 789 individuals (19-87 years of age) who participated in the Iwaki Health Promotion Project 2011. Major depressive disorder (MDD) was assessed using the MINI.
   Results: For MDD, the SSLRs were 0.13 (95% CI 0.04-0.40), 3.68 (95% CI 1.37-9.89), and 24.77 (95% CI 14.97-40.98) for CES-D scores of 0-16, 17-20, and above 21, respectively.
   Conclusion: The validity of the CES-D is confirmed, and SSLR analysis is recommended for its practical value for the detection of individuals with the risk of MDD in the Japanese community.

AB This chapter reports on the symposium, "Translational neuroscience may inform treatment development for posttraumatic stress disorder" (Chair Leo Sher, M.D., Co-Chair - Alexander Neumeister, M.D.) that was held on June 28, 2009 during the 9th World Congress of Biological Psychiatry (June 28-July 2, 2009, Palace of Congresses (Le Palais des Congres de Paris), Paris, France). Compelling animal and human data indicate that stress compromises neurotrophic functions producing neural atrophy and reducing neuroplasticity resulting in dysfunction in brain circuitry associated with PTSD. This problem has been identified as the most important priority for studies of the neurobiology of PTSD. This symposium was the first translational interdisciplinary attack on this problem, from molecular neuroscience to treatment and targets major gaps in our understanding of the neurobiology, neural circuitry, phenomenology, and treatment of PTSD. Four research works were presented at the symposium: "Early postnatal stress: Impact on neural circuits and relevance to psychophysiology" by Machiko Matsumoto (Japan), "Long term alterations in brain and neurobiology in PTSD" by Eric Vermetten (Netherlands), "Mechanisms of resilience: Lessons from PET imaging" by Alexander Neumeister (USA) and "Neurobiology of suicidal behavior in PTSD and implications for suicide prevention" by Leo Sher (USA).

AB There is an urgent need for mental healthcare in the workplace though little has been done so far to address that. Many tragic incidents such as workplace suicide and death due to 'workplace bullying', 'violence' and 'overwork' have happened in South Korea and Japan. The unemployment rate of workers suffering from mental health problems is also increasing, which aggravates the risk of serious economic impacts for an aging population. Therefore, it is crucial to establish a mental health management system at the workplace level. This chapter presents a model based on the use of smart technologies for mental healthcare services to enhance the ergonomics and quality of working conditions at the workplace, and to help create a mentally healthy workplace. With the rapid development of SmartMentalTech, an innovative shift with new ways of delivering mental healthcare services is taking place changing the way service users, employers, and system designers use technology to deliver mental healthcare at the workplace. The objective of this chapter is to suggest an ergonomic platform where viable applications related to psychological challenges at the workplace are provided by service users, developers, practitioners, decision makers, and policymakers. The approach of Occupational Health Psychology (OHP) emphasizes on the significance of workplace design, management and psychosocial risk mitigation. There are differences across service users; therefore, the challenges facing the managers of mental healthcare services at the workplace are daunting. Currently 12 types of developed SmartMentalTech can be used for personalized care. This chapter provides a comprehensive account on how to set up and to manage mental healthcare delivery in order to minimize workplace mental health problems and the social stigma of mental health issues by establishing a new comprehensive mental healthcare stepped-care model (CMHSCM) system for service users' satisfaction and healthy intelligent workplace in a timely and economically responsive manner.

AB Background: There are few national or cross-cultural studies of the stigma associated with mental disorders. Australia and Japan have different systems of psychiatric health care, and distinct differences in cultural values, but enjoy similar standards of living. This study seeks to compare the nature and extent of stigma among the public in the two countries.
   Methods: A household survey of the public was conducted in each country using similar methodologies. The Australian study comprised a national survey of 3998 adults aged over 18 years. The Japanese survey involved 2000 adults aged 20 to 69 from 25 regional sites distributed across the country. Interviewees reported their personal attitudes (personal stigma, social distance) and perceptions of the attitudes of others (perceived stigma, perceived discrimination) in the community with respect to four case vignettes. These vignettes described a person with: depression; depression with suicidal ideation; early schizophrenia; and chronic schizophrenia.
   Results: Personal stigma and social distance were typically greater among the Japanese than the Australian public whereas the reverse was true with respect to the perception of the attitudes and discriminatory behaviour of others. In both countries, personal stigma was significantly greater than perceived stigma. The public in both countries showed evidence of greater social distance, greater personal stigma and greater perceived stigma for schizophrenia (particularly in its chronic form) than for depression. There was little evidence of a difference in stigma for depression with and without suicide for either country. However, social distance was greater for chronic compared to early schizophrenia for the Australian public.
   Conclusion: Stigmatising attitudes were common in both countries, but negative attitudes were greater among the Japanese than the Australian public. The results suggest that there is a need to implement national public awareness interventions tailored to the needs of each country. The current results provide a baseline for future tracking of national stigma levels in each country.

AB Objective To compare the drowning mortality rates and proportion of deaths of each intent among all drowning deaths in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in 2012-2014.
   Design A population-based cross-sectional study.
   Setting 32 OECD countries.
   Participants Individuals in OECD countries who died from drowning.
   Main outcome measures Drowning mortality rates (deaths per 100000 population) and proportion (%) of deaths of each intent (ie, unintentional intent, intentional self-harm, assault, undetermined intent and all intents combined) among all drowning deaths.
   Results Countries with the highest drowning mortality rates (deaths per 100000 population) were Estonia (3.53), Japan (3.49) and Greece (2.40) for unintentional intent; Ireland (0.96), Belgium (0.96) and Korea (0.89) for intentional self-harm; Austria (0.57), Korea (0.56) and Hungary (0.44) for undetermined intent and Japan (4.35), Estonia (3.70) and Korea (2.73) for all intents combined. Korea ranked 12th and 3rd for unintentional intent and all intents combined, respectively. By contrast, Belgium ranked 2nd and 15th for intentional self-harm and all intents combined, respectively. The proportion of deaths of each intent among all drowning deaths in each country varied greatly: from 26.2% in Belgium to 96.8% in Chile for unintentional intent; 0.7% in Mexico to 57.4% in Belgium for intentional self-harm; 0.0% in nine countries to 4.9% in Mexico for assault and 0.0% in Israel and Turkey to 38.3% in Austria for undetermined intent.
   Conclusions A large variation in the practice of classifying undetermined intent in drowning deaths across countries was noted and this variation hinders valid international comparisons of intent-specific (unintentional and intentional self-harm) drowning mortality rates.

AB Background The objectives were to clarify the trend in the cause-specific mortality rate and changes in health and long-term-care use after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011.
   Methods We obtained the following data from national sources: the number of deaths by cause, age and month; the amount of healthcare insurance expenditures by type of services, age and month; the amount of long-term-care insurance expenditures by type of services, age, care need and month. We estimated increase in standardised mortality rate postearthquake compared with pre-earthquake, and change in the standardised amount of health and long-term-care insurance expenditures post-earthquake compared with pre-earthquake in three severely affected prefectures, Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima, by the adjustment for trends in the other prefectures.
   Results The risk of indirect mortality increased in the month of the earthquake (relative risk (RR) with 95% CI 1.20 (1.13 to 1.28) for those 60-69 years of age, 1.25 (1.17 to 1.32) for 70-79 years, and 1.33 (1.27 to 1.38) for 80 years and older). The amount of health and long-term-care insurance expenditures decreased among elderly persons in the month of the earthquake, and recovered to 95% of usual level within 1-5 months. Among cities and towns hit by tsunami, higher percentage of households flooded was associated with higher risk of indirect mortality (p<0.001), lower expenditures for outpatient medical care (p<0.001), and lower expenditures for home-care services (p<0.001).
   Conclusions This study showed transient increase in indirect mortality and recovery of health and long-termcare system after the earthquake.

AB We evaluated the mortality risk among 306 male alcoholics living in Osaka, Japan, at the time of initial diagnosis between 1972 and 1983, with regard to the cause of death, length of time from diagnosis, and participation in an alcohol abstinence self-help group. By the closing date on 1 March 1992, 110 of the 306 alcoholics had died, yielding an observed-to-expected (O/E) ratio of 4.5 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.7-5.4]. The alcoholics had significantly elevated mortality risks from all malignant neoplasms (O/E = 2.1, 95%CI = 1.2-3.3), esophageal cancer (O/E = 8.4, 95%CI = 1.7-24.5), diseases of the circulatory system (O/E = 4.4, 95%CI = 3.0-6.2), liver cirrhosis (O/E = 15.9, 95%CI = 10.2-23.6), diseases of the genitourinary system (O/E = 6.3, 95%CI = 1.3-18.5), and external death (O/E = 10.3, 95%CI = 6.3-15.8). The mortality risk from all causes still remained significantly high beyond the tenth year following initial diagnosis (O/E = 2.6, 95%CI = 1.0-6.2). The mortality risks from liver cirrhosis and external death (such as suicide) were highest within the first year following diagnosis, and were still high beyond the tenth year. A significantly high mortality risk from diseases of the circulatory system was observed between the first and ninth years, and the mortality risk from all malignant neoplasms was significantly elevated beyond 10 years following diagnosis. Alcoholics who did not join a self-help group soon after the initial institutional treatment had different cause-specific and time-specific mortality risks from those who did join a self-help group. These findings show the importance of long-term clinical follow-up of male alcoholics, taking into consideration the cause-specific mortality.

AB Objective. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of duloxetine treatment for 52 weeks. Design. Multicenter, open-label, phase III clinical study. Setting. Forty-one medical institutions in Japan. Subjects. Japanese patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Methods. Duloxetine 60 mg once-daily was administered for 52 weeks. Safety was evaluated based on adverse events (AEs), vital signs, laboratory test values, electrocardiogram, Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale, and occurrence of falls. The efficacy outcome measures were the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI; average pain, worst pain, least pain, and pain right now), BPI Interference, Patient's Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I), Clinical Global Impressions of Severity (CGI-S), Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire-24 (RDQ-24), 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), and European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D). Results. In total, 151 patients (83 who completed a 14-week placebo-controlled superiority trial and 68 newly registered patients) were enrolled. The incidence rates of AEs and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were 86.1% and 50.3%, respectively. ADRs with an incidence of >= 5% were somnolence, constipation, nausea, and dry mouth. Treatment discontinuation for AEs occurred in 16 patients. A significant reduction in the BPI average pain score (mean +/- SD) was observed at all assessment time points from week 2 (-1.02 +/- 1.37) to week 50 (-2.26 +/- 1.63), compared with baseline. BPI pain severity (worst pain, least pain, and pain right now), BPI Interference, PGI-I, CGI-S, RDQ-24, SF-36, and EQ-5D showed significant improvement. Conclusion. Japanese patients with CLBP had significant pain reduction over 52 weeks without new safety concerns.

TI Gendering Ethnic Religion in 1940s and 1950s Yunnan: Sexuality in the
   Gua sa la Festival and the Worship of the Goddess Baijie
SO NAN NU-MEN WOMEN AND GENDER IN CHINA
LA English
DT Article
DE sexuality; Yunnan; Dali; minzu; zongjiao
AB Chinese intellectuals adopted the concepts minzu (ethnicity or "nationality") and zongjiao (religion) from Japan in the late nineteenth century as part of the wider discourse of modernity. This article examines the gendered dimensions of these concepts through writings about sexuality in two examples from Dali, Yunnan (home to the Bai minzu) from the late Republican period (1911-49) to the early years of the People's Republic of China. The first example, the Gua sa la festival, involves sexually explicit songs, cross-dressing, and possibly also sexual encounters with strangers. The second example, the cult of the local goddess Baijie, celebrates the fidelity and chastity of an eighth-century queen who committed suicide rather than marry her husband's killer. The examination of writings about Gua sa la and Baijie demonstrates how intellectuals in the 1940s and 1950s selectively invoked concepts of minzu, zongjiao, and sexuality to affirm these apparently opposing phenomena as representations of Bai ethnic culture. Though the political and discursive climate changed significantly throughout this period, in the 1940s and 1950s Gua sa la and Baijie both remained positive images, which was only possible because intellectuals elided either zongjiao or sexuality in their descriptions.

AB Objectives: Pesticide poisoning stands as a major public health issue worldwide. The objective of this study was to examine the epidemiologic characteristics of pesticide-related hospitalizations in South Korea. Methods: Data from the Korea National Hospital Discharge Survey were analyzed to describe the epidemiologic characteristics of pesticide poisoning among hospitalized patients from 2004 through 2006. Pesticide-related hospitalizations were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes. National estimates of pesticide-related hospitalizations were calculated using sampling weights for number of hospitalizations. Results: A total of 25,982 pesticide-related hospitalizations were estimated during the years 20042006, yielding an average annual pesticide-related hospitalization rate of 17.8 per 100,000 population in South Korea. Age-specific rates for pesticide-related hospitalization increased with age, with the highest rate noted among those aged 70 or above. The majority of pesticide-related hospitalization was cases of intentional poisoning in rural areas. Seasonal variation in the rate was observed, with summer being the highest among both men and women. Conclusions: Pesticide-related hospitalization is prevalent and demonstrates demographic and seasonal and regional variations. More effective strategies to reduce pesticide-related hospitalizations are required in South Korea.

DT Article
DE transplantation; specimen handling; tissue and organ harvesting
AB The growing gap between organ requirements and their availability from brain-stem-dead donors has led to a re-examination of the use of non-heart-beating donors (NHBD). Many non French centers are now using such donors to expand their organ pool. In France, the relevant law was modified in 2005 in order to authorize kidney and liver donation by NHBD donors. Accordingly, the Biomedicine Agency has established a program of formal viability assessment. The protocol recommends that this practice be restricted to kidney transplantation first, before being extended to liver transplantation in a second phase. NHBD donors are defined using the Maastricht classification. Currently, the French program includes groups I, II and IV but excludes group III. Donors are patients in intractable cardiac arrest, despite intensive resuscitation, after accidents, suicide, anoxia or stroke. Organ retrieval obeys the usual legal rules : in particular, a national donation refusal registry is consulted and the relatives' formal consent is required. The results of NHBD transplantation in Europe, the USA and Japan are comparable to those obtained with brain-stem-dead donor organs. The French transplantation working group recommends that this experience be extended in order to reduce the organ shortage and the number of patients on the waiting list.

AB Although palliative sedation therapy is often required in terminally ill cancer patients to achieve acceptable symptom relief, empirical data supporting the ethical validity of this approach are lacking. The primary aim of this study was to systematically investigate whether empirical evidence supports the ethical validity of sedation. This was a multicenter, prospective, observational study, which was conducted by 21. specialized palliative care units in,japan. One-hundred two consecutive adult cancer patients who received continuous deep sedation were enrolled. Continuous deep sedation was defined as the continuous use of sedative medications to relieve intolerable and refractory distress by achieving almost or complele unconsciousness until death. Prior to the stndy, we conceptualized the ethical validity Of sedation from the viewpoints of physicians intent, Proportionality, and autonomy. Sedation was performed mainly with midazolam and phenobarbital. The initial doses of midazolam and phenobarbital were 1.5 mg/hour and 20 mg/hour respectively. Main administration routes were continuous subcutaneous infusion, and continuous intravenous infusion, and no rapid intravenous injection, was reported. Of 59 patients who received artificial hydration or could intake adequate fluids/foods orally before sedation, 63% received artificial hydration. therapy after sedation, and in the artificial hydration, was withheld or withdrawn due to fluid retention symplovis and/or patient wishes. Of 66 patients who ware able to verbally express themselves, 95% explicilty slated that symploms were intolerable. The etiologies of the symptoms requiring sedation were primarily related to 91, the progression of such as cancer cachexia and and and standard palliative treatments had failed: steroids in 68% of patients with fatigue, of opoids in 95% of patients with dyspnea, antisecretion. medications in 75% of patients with bronchial secretion, antipsychotic medications in 74% of patients with delirium, and opioids in all patients with pain. On the basis of the Palliative Prognostic Index, 94% of the patients were Predicted to die within. 3 weeks. Before sedation, 67% 4) the patients expressed explicit wishes for sedation. In. the remaining 34 patients, previous wishes for sedation were-noted in 4 patients, and in the other 30 patients, the families were involved \in the decision-making process. The chief reason for patient nan-involvement, in the decision-making was cognitive impairment. These data indicate that palliative sedation, therapy performed in specialized palliative care units in Japan generally followed the principles of double effect, proportionality, and autonomy.

AB Background: The mental health of the offspring of immigrants is a major public health concern. In this study, we examined associations of multicultural status and parental country of birth with adolescent mental health in South Korea, and assessed the effect of socioeconomic position (SEP) on these associations.
   Methods: We used four waves of the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBS) between 2011 and 2014, including 294,324 participants (149,219 boys and 145,105 girls aged 13-18 years) as study subjects. KYRBS is a cross-sectional survey conducted annually by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The participants in the KYRBS were drawn as stratified multistage clustered samples from Korean middle schools and high schools. We calculated the age-adjusted 12-month prevalence of depressive mood and suicidal behaviors by parental country of birth, and estimated the effects of SEP indicators on the relationship.
   Results: The age-standardized prevalence of suicidality (suicide ideation, plans, and attempts) was significantly different between multicultural and non-multicultural boys. The impact of multicultural status on mental health varied with parental foreign-born status and maternal country of birth. Compared with non-multicultural counterparts, boys with Japan-born mothers showed lower prevalence ratios (PRs) of suicidal plans (PR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.16-0.70). Girls with Japan-born mothers also showed lower PRs of depressive mood (PR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.63-0.95) and suicidal ideation (PR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.41-0.83), while adolescents with Korean-Chinese mothers showed similar PRs. Boys with foreign-born fathers as well as boys with two foreign-born parents were at a greater risk of suicidality than non-multicultural boys. The magnitude of the relationship between multicultural status and mental health outcomes was generally attenuated after adjusting for SEP indicators.
   Conclusions: In general, adolescents with Japan-born mothers showed lower PRs of depressive mood and suicidality than non-multicultural adolescents, while those with Korean-Chinese mothers showed similar PRs. Boys who had foreign-born fathers generally showed greater PRs of depressive mood and suicidality than non-multicultural boys. To ensure the effective implementation of policies to reduce mental health problems among multicultural adolescents in South Korea, detailed information should be considered regarding the cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds of families, such as parental country of birth and SEP.

AB We conducted this study to compare survival rates and morbidity of persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) versus general population, and to clarify the risk of SCI persons. The subjects of this study were 960 men with SCI who had been accommodated in the eight Labor Accident Rehabilitation Centers in Japan during the period of 1965-1995. The surveyed items were the year of birth, the year of injury, level of spinal cord injury and survival status. The classification of cause of death was taken from ICD-10. The cumulative survival rate by life table method was calculated. In order to compare the risks of each cause of death in SCI persons with general population, cause-specific standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was examined. The leading cause of death was malignant neoplasms at 28 persons, and SMR (general population = 100) was 184, followed by the circulatory system disease, external cause (including suicide) and the genitourinary system disease. In the subgroups of malignant neoplasms, the SMR was 6,619 for cutaneous carcinomas and 1,482 for bladder carcinomas (p < 0.01). Thus aging-related diseases which had close correlation with lifestyle and environment were the major cause of deaths in SCI persons.

AB South Korea has the highest suicide rate among countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), with a rising trend that contrasts with the trend in most other OECD countries. This study assessed differential associations of socio-demographic factors with suicidal ideation in South Korea. We used five waves of data from the 2010 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Study subjects included 5803 men and women aged >25 years. We analysed weighted percentages with consideration of the complex survey sample design and unequal weights. Surveylogistic regressions were applied. Protective effects against suicidal ideation were found for higher household income, higher educational attainment, and being married. Functional limitations and depressive symptoms were risk factors for suicidal ideation. However, these significant factors may exert different effects on vulnerability for suicidal ideation among different genders and age groups. Thus, household income was mainly protective for women and subjects aged 25-44 years, and educational attainment was protective for individuals aged > 65 years. Our findings suggest the need for extended social protection policies for the less privileged population and special strategies for different groups. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB We have combined hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ; Sendai virus) with liposomes for efficient in vitro and in vivo fusion-mediated gene delivery. The HVJ-liposome was a highly efficient vehicle for the introduction of oligonucleotides into cells in vivo as well as for the transfer of genes < 100 kbp without damaging cells. By coupling the Epstein-Barr (EB) virus replicon apparatus with HVJ-liposomes (virosomes), transgene expression was sustained in vitro and in vivo. When we added cationic lipids, the HVJ-cationic liposomes increased gene delivery 100 to 800 times in vitro compared with the conventional anionic virosomes and were also more useful for gene expression in restricted areas of organs and for gene therapy of disseminated cancers. We further discovered that the use of anionic virosomes with a virus-mimicking lipid composition (artificial viral envelope; AVE type) increased transfection efficiency approximately 10 fold in vivo, especially in the heart, liver, kidney, and muscle. Most animal organs were found to be suitable targets for the fusigenic virosomes, and numerous gene therapy strategies using this system were successful in animals. The combination of suicide gene therapy with radiation was very effective for killing hepatomas in a mouse model, Arteriosclerosis obliterans in animal models was cured by the transfer of hepatocyte growth factor.

AB As a health problem in Korea, the prevalence of depression is continuously increasing. This study examines factors and help-seeking behaviors associated with depression in Korean adults. Data was extracted from Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (2014 and 2016) using the PHQ-9 depression screening instrument. Among 10,459 participants (weighted frequency = 36,418,292) over 19 years old, 7.2% were classified as having depression including depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 scores >= 10) or depressive disorders diagnosed by psychiatrists. Among those with depression, 58.6% responded that they had never sought help. Statistically high odds ratios for being at risk for depression include being female, aged 19-39, living alone, low household income, low level of education (middle school or lower), occupation (unemployed/inactive), an ex- or current smoker, having a chronic disease, and being underweight. Statistically low odds ratios for seeking counselling, age >= 60 and lower than high household income; for seeing doctor, age 19-39 or >= 60; and for treatment, age 19-39, lower than middle household income, and more than once per week drinking frequency. Overall, there is a need to find persons having these risk factors and to develop tailored strategies that will encourage help-seeking behavior with help-seeking intention.

AB The purpose of the present paper was to investigate the distribution of Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) scores in a general population and its factor structure. Questionnaires on SDS items were sent to 7136 randomly selected residents aged 20-79 years who lived in districts in Japan with high rates of suicide. Valid responses were received from 5547 residents (response rate: 77.7%). Factor analysis of the SDS scores was conducted. The SDS scores of the male subjects were significantly lower than those of the female subjects in all age groups. A reverse-J-shaped relationship was found between age groups and mean SDS scores for the male and female subjects. The highest mean score was in the age group of 20-39 years, and the lowest mean score was in the age group of 60-69 years for the male and female subjects. In factor analysis, two factors consisting of 12 items were extracted, and 10 of those 12 items covered six Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edn; DSM-IV) criteria describing psychological disturbances of depression. The distribution of SDS scores differed depending on the age group. Major components of SDS in the subjects covered the DSM-IV criteria for psychological disturbances of depression.

AB This commentary discusses what is popularly regarded as the Roh Moo-hyun Phenomenon in today's South Korean society, as an attempt to shed some light on an interview which the late President Roh Moo-hyun had with the author in December 2008. This interview is unique not only because it became Roh's last interview conducted before his suicide on May 23, 2009, but also because it provides Roh's candid critical self-assessment on his own presidency, especially regarding his role in both domestic politics and the inter-Korean relationship, and the Korea-US relationship during his term in office, as well as commenting on Japan's approach to Northeast Asian regional politics. Reflecting on Roh's star-like rise to the presidency and fall from grace, this commentary alerts readers that Roh's last interview needs to be considered within the context of the Roh Moo-Hyun Phenomenon, especially in regard to the 2017 presidential election, because it will directly affect the fate of not just the pro-Roh group, with the largest share of the opposition in today's Korean society, but the Korean people as a whole at a time when the country's many leading civic groups are desperately seeking a Great Transformation.

AB Severe mercury intoxication is very rare in developed countries, but still occurs as the result of volatile substance abuse, suicide attempts, occupational hazards, or endemic food ingestion as reported in the cases of public health disasters in Iraq and in Minamata Bay, Japan. Here, we describe the dramatic physical and cognitive decline of a 23-year-old patient caused by a severe methyl mercury (MeHg) intoxication of unknown origin. We show serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the patient's brain, as well as ex vivo analyses of blood and cerebrospinal fluid including multicolor flow cytometric measurements, functional assays of hemostaseologic efficacy, and evaluation of regulatory effector molecules. Together with the clinical history, our findings show the progressive neuronal degeneration accompanying the deterioration of the patient. Moreover, the ex vivo analyses display alterations of thrombocyte function and coagulation, as well as an immunological milieu facilitating autoimmunity. Despite the successful reduction of the MeHg concentration in the patient's blood with erythrocyte apheresis and chelator therapy, his condition did not improve and led to a persistent vegetative state. This case illustrates the neurotoxicity of MeHg following severe intoxication for the first time by serial MRI. Data on immune-cell and thrombocyte function as well as on coagulation in mercury poisoning reveal potential implications for anticoagulation and immunomodulatory treatment.

AB Porcine edema disease (ED) is an enterotoxaemia in pigs after weaning, caused by Shiga toxin 2e (Stx2e) producing Escherichia coli. Recently in Japan, outbreaks of ED are re-emerging in pig production. In this study we constructed a mutant that retained immunogenicity but lost Vero cell cytotoxicity, which produced genetically modified toxin (Stx2e*) by replacing glutamate with glutamine at position 167 and arginine with leucine at position 170 of the A subunit. The stx(2e)* gene was replaced with the stx(2e) gene of the wild type virulent strain by homologous recombination. As the parent wild strain was pathogenic to pigs but the mutant was not, the mutant named as YT106 was given to the pigs to examine its protective immunity against ED. All 20 pigs vaccinated with YT106 survived, but only eight of the 20 non-vaccinated pigs survived after the challenge with a wild strain. Also, the eight pigs that survived had decreased rates of gain relative to those of the controls. Blood IgG and intestinal IgA titres increased 3.3 and 1.6 times more than the control, respectively, showing that YT106 might be a good candidate of a live attenuated vaccine strain to protect against ED.

AB Objective: There have been no previous studies about consultation of the bereaved who have lost a loved one to cancer and ask for medical help. The aim of this study was to investigate their basic characteristics and their psychiatric disorders.
   Methods: A retrospective study using clinical and background data obtained over 30 months (from April 2007 to September 2009) was conducted at outpatient services for bereaved families at the Department of Psycho-Oncology at Saitama Medical University International Medical Center, Japan.
   Results: During the period of investigation, 51 patients underwent consultation. The patients were frequently female (P < 0.0001) and the spouse of the deceased. Regarding the psychiatric diagnoses, major depression was the most common (39%), followed by adjustment disorders (28%).
   Conclusions: This study revealed basic characteristics and psychiatric disorders of the bereaved who asked for medical help. Most of the patients were women (86.3%) and 86.3% of them received a psychiatric diagnosis. This information is important for both physicians and psychologists since the bereaved who have lost a loved one to cancer often ask for medical help in clinical settings.

   healthiest country in the world?
SO MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective: To highlight recent reductions in mortality rates in Australia and identify conditions and population groups with the greatest potential for further reduction in mortality rates.
   Design: International benchmarking and intranational comparisons of mortality rates were used to identify areas with the greatest potential for improvement.
   Results: Latest data from Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries confirm that, while Japan's death rates remain the lowest in the world, Australia's are decreasing rapidly and we now rival Switzerland for second overall ranking. When the contributions of specific conditions are compared, the areas with the greatest potential for reductions are circulatory diseases (especially ischaemic heart disease); suicide; injury and violence; smoking-related conditions; and cancers amenable to prevention/early detection. Intranational comparisons show considerable scope for reduction in inequalities, especially those between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and other Australians, between males and females, and between low and high socioeconomic groups. These conditions and inequalities are highly interrelated, as differentials in health status are often mediated through broader societal inequalities.
   Conclusions: Australia should aim to become the country with the lowest mortality rate in the world. This could realistically be achieved by benchmarking performance nationally and internationally, applying current knowledge and available interventions, matching policies with funding, and implementing systemic national programs and activities to promote health and prevent "illth".

   SAMPLE
AB The present study aimed to explore the status of deliberate self-harm (DSH) among junior high-school students, and investigate the relationship between DSH and substance use and childhood hyperactivity. Subjects were 239 boys (mean age=14.16 years, SD=0.67) and 238 girls (14.22, 0.68) from a junior high-school in Kanagawa, Japan. A self-reporting questionnaire consisting of original questions on self-cutting, self-hitting, and tobacco and alcohol use was employed with the Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS) for assessing childhood hyperactivity. Overall, 8.00% and 27.70% of males and 9.30% and 12.20% of females reported self-cutting and self-hitting, respectively. Regarding substance use, 33.10% and 74.10% of males and 14.30% and 63.40% of females reported tobacco and alcohol use, respectively. Comparisons of WURS scores between those with and without experience of problematic behaviors revealed that with all problematic behaviors in both genders, scores of those with experience were significantly higher than those without (P < 0.01 except for self-cutting in females, P < 0.05). The present study indicated that DSH is an important problem, even among children as young as junior high-school age. An association between DSH and childhood hyperactivity was also suggested.

AB To clarifiy the prevalence and the characteristics of patients who received palliative sedation therapy), for psycho-existential suffering, a questionnaire was sent to 105 responsible physicians at all certified palliative care units in Japan. The participants were requested to report the number of patients who received continuous deep sedation for refractary psycho-existential suffering during the past. year, and to provide details of the 2 most recent patients. A total of 81 physicians returned questionnaires (response rate, 80 %). Twenty-nine physicians (36 %) reported clinical experience in continuous deep sedation for psycho-existential suffering. The overall prevalence of continuous deep sedation was calculated as 1.05 (90 cases/8,661 total patient deaths), and a total of 46 patient histories were collected. Performance status just before sedation was 3 or 4 in 96 %, and predicted survival was 3 weeks or less in 94 The suffering requiring sedation was feeling of meaninglessness/worthlessness (61%) burden on others/dependancy/inability to take care Of oneself (48%), death anxiety/fear/panic (33%), wish to control the time of death by oneself (24%), and isolation/lack of social support (22 %). Before sedation, intermittent sedation and specialized psychiatric, psychological, and/or religious care had been performed in 94 % and 59 %, respectively; 89 % of 26 depressed patients had received antidepressant medications. All competent patients (n = 37) expressed explicit requests for sedation., and family consent was obtained in all cases where family members were available (n = 45). Palliative sedation for psycho-existential suffering was performed in exceptional cases in specialized palliative care units in Japan. The patient condition was generally very poor, and the suffering was refractory to intermittent sedation and specialized psychiatric, psychological, and/or religious care. Sedation was performed on the basis of patient and family consent.. These findings suggest that palliative sedation,for pycho-existential suffering could be ethically permissible in exceptional cases if the proportionality and autonony Principle is applied. More discussion about the role, of palliative sedation therapy for refractory psycho-existential suffering in end-of-life care is urgently necessary.

AB Background: In Japan, some residents develop mental health problems. In previous studies, it was reported that long working hours might be a cause of stress reaction such as depression. There were some reports that compared residents with 80 or more working hours with those with less than 80 working hours. However, many residents are practically detained for extra-long time, designated as 100 h or more per week, for medical practice, training, self-study, etc. There have been few reports on extra-long hours of work. This study evaluated the working environment and the amount of stress experienced by first-year residents, and examined the relationship between long working hours and depression, especially in the group of extra-long working hours.
   Methods: The study included 1241 first-year residents employed at 250 training hospitals in 2011. A self-report questionnaire was administered at the beginning of the residency and 3 months later to collect data on demographics, depressive symptoms, and training conditions (e.g., duration of work, sleep, disposable time, and night shift). Depressive symptoms were rated using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.
   Results: The mean duration of work per week was 79.4 h, with 97 residents (7.8%) working 100 h or more. At 3 months, clinically significant depressive symptoms were reported by 45.5% of residents working 100 or more h per week, which proportion was significantly greater than that for respondents working less than 60 h (P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a working week of 80 to 99.9 h was associated with a 2.83 fold higher risk and 100 h or more was associated with a 6.96-fold higher risk of developing depressive symptoms compared with a working week of less than 60 h.
   Conclusion: Working excessively long hours was significantly associated with development of depressive symptoms. Proper management of resident physicians' working hours is critical to maintaining their physical and mental health and to improve the quality of care they provide.

DE adverse event; mortality rate; patient safety
ID SUICIDE
AB Chart reviews have been used to assess the incidence and impact of adverse events, but most of them are not a nationally representative sample. In addition, the definition of adverse events is generally broad and covers unintended events; the relationship to outcome is often unclear, and official estimates have not matched those of medical practitioner's recognition. The number of patient deaths from adverse events remains unknown.
   This study aimed to investigate the number of adverse event related patient deaths and mortality rate as recognized by medical practitioners in Japan, and to reveal the applicability of our method for estimating the number of adverse event related patient death as an alternative to a chart review.
   In 2015, a mail survey of 3270 hospitals asked how many patient deaths had been caused by adverse events at the hospital in the last 3 years. The hospitals were selected by stratified random sampling according to the number of beds. The number of patient deaths caused by adverse events and the mortality rate were estimated, with adjustments for the hospital type and the number of beds.
   The mail survey response rate was 22.4% (731/3270). The number of patient deaths caused by adverse events in a year was estimated to be between 1326 and 1433. The mortality rate was estimated at 8.81 to 9.52 cases per 100,000 discharged patients, and 2.65 to 2.87 cases per 1,000,000 person-days. The mortality rate was high at acute care hospitals with >= 500 beds and at psychiatric hospitals.
   The nationwide number of patient deaths recognized by medical practitioners as caused by adverse events and its mortality rate were estimated. In comparison with a chart review, a mail survey was a faster and a cheaper way, and was able to cover a wide range of hospitals for estimating mortality rate of adverse events.

AB Although tissue-specific promoters offer a promising approach to the targeting of gene therapy, the activity of such promoters is generally low, which is thus a major limitation, especially when using non-viral vectors. To establish effective transcriptional targeting gene therapy for growth hormone (GH) producing pituitary tumors, an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) based vector system expressing herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-TK) driven by a rat GH promoter (pEBGTK) was developed. This harbors an EBV nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) gene with an origin of the latent viral DNA replication (OriP) gene of EBV. We constructed an EBV-based luciferase plasmid (pEBGL) as a reporter plasmid. We also generated pGTK and pGL, which are non-EBV counterparts. Metastatic GH3 (mGH3) cells were used in this study. The transfection of pEBGL to mGH3 resulted in approximately a 39 times greater luciferase activity than pGL in vitro. Its expression was also prolonged 144 h after transfection. According to the results of pEBGL gene transfer in in vivo experiments, the luciferase activity was only observed in the tumors, but not detected in other normal tissues. The luciferase activities in tumor tissues were found until day 25 post transfection. During in vitro gene therapy, the transfection by pEBGTK using hemmaglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ) liposome enhances the susceptibility of mGH3 to gancyclovir (GCV) 110 times more than that by pGTK. The in vivo antitumor effects of pEBGTK on mGH3-tumor-bearing nude mice were evaluated. The intratumoral injection of HVJ anionic lipososme-enveloped pEBGTK followed by the intra-peritoneal injection of GCV demonstrated a significant growth inhibition against tumors without toxicity, while the tumors treated by other treatment modalities grew progressively. These results demonstrated that the EBV-based vector system can therefore contribute to the improvement of the anti-tumor effects for the HVJ-liposome-mediated transcriptional targeting suicide gene therapy, suggesting that this paradigm may thus be a potentially effective approach for the treatment of uncontrollable pituitary tumors.

AB Serious intoxications and incidences due to misuse of organophosphorus insecticides (OP) have been reported for over three decades. In this meeting I am talking about the following three topics. (1) Epidemiological studies on the use of OP in japan, Taiwan and Thailand. The National Research Institute of Police Science (NRIPS) in japan has published the annual report of the epidemiological studies on the criminal and suicide events. The numbers of the incidence of pesticides are approximately 22%-30% of the total incidences, during 1991 and 1996. The incidence of pesticides has been gradually reduced for past six years. This seems to be influenced by the decrease of the incidences of paraquat having extremely high toxicity. According to the epidemiological data in the National Poison Center in Taiwan, unlike the prevalence of drug poisoning exposures in most western countries, pesticides poisoning exposures are numerous in Taiwan. The number of pesticide intoxication cases is 6,872 out of 23,436 of total case numbers of various intoxications during the 1985 and 1997. The fatality rate is much higher in Taiwan than in most western countries, with 5.65% of all poisoning exposures resulted in death. Paraquet is the leading cause of death in Taiwan. The ratio of death to total OP intoxication cases is 11.5% including accidental exposure and suicide. According to the report of the Division of Epidemiology, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand during the 1990-1995, the overall morbidity due to poisoning was 30 per 100,000 population with 300 deaths per year. The morbidity rate of reported pesticide poisoning in the whole country was 10 per 100,000 population. (2) Sarin victims in Tokyo. On March 20, 1995, a terrorist attack using sarin (isopropylmethylphosphonofluoridate) occurred on the Tokyo subway. Many people inhaled the sarin gas and collapsed in the train. Eventually, 12 people died and over 5,000 were injured. The results of the forensic studies showed that methylphosphonic acid, the hydrolysis product of sarin, bound to AChE in the cerebellums of the victims was separated and identified using GCMS. (3) A sensitive and rapid biomarker of OF-poisoning. beta-Glucuronidase (beta-G) is loosely bound to egasyn which is one of carboxylesterase isozymes in the liver microsomes. The oxon formed from OP in the liver microsomes is covalently bound to egasyn and causes the cleavage of the egasyn-glucuronidase complex, leading to the release of beta-G into the blood. In fact, plasma beta-G activities is a much more sensitive and rapid biomarker than the blood cholinesterase inhibition.
   In conclusion, OPs cause serious toxicity in both acute and chronic exposures. The epidemiological data in Taiwan and Thailand show that paraquat intoxication cause the most serious irreversible damage in the patients. In 1995, terrorists attack using sarin which is one of the most toxic OF, on the Tokyo subway, and 12 people died. This is an example of the acute intoxication of OP and some people have been still in hospitalized Recently, the present authors have reported that the plasma beta-G activity is a novel biomarker of OP intoxication. The plasma beta-G is rapidly and significantly increased after OP exposure, and this is a much more sensitive to OP intoxication than ChE inhibition. (C) 2000 Inter Press, Inc.

AB In contrast with most developed countries, mortality due to ischemic heart disease (IHD) continues to rise in China. We examined the effects of age, period, and cohort on IHD mortality in urban and rural populations from 1987 to 2013 to identify the drivers of this trend. Region-specific data on annual IHD mortality among adults aged 20 to 84 years and corresponding population statistics were collected. We then tested for age, period, and cohort effects using the Intrinsic Estimator approach. Our results indicated that IHD mortality in China increased significantly over the three decades studied. There was a log-linear increase in the age effect on IHD mortality as those aged 80-84 showed 277 and 161 times greater IHD mortality risk than those aged 20-24 in urban and rural populations, respectively. While there was an upward trend in the period effect in both populations, the influence of the cohort effect on mortality decreased over time for those born from 1904 to 1993. The age, period, and cohort effects on mortality in China were generally comparable between urban and rural populations. The results suggest that population aging is a major driver behind the rapid rise in IHD mortality. Increased exposure to air pollution may also have played a role in driving the period effect.

AB Background: The aims of this study were to clarify end-of-life cancer care preferences and associations with good-death concepts.
   Methods: The general population was sampled using a stratified random sampling method (N = 2548; response rate = 51%) and bereaved families from 12 certified palliative care units ('PCU-bereaved families') were surveyed (N = 513; response rate = 70%). The respondents reported their end-of-life care preferences and good-death concepts.
   Results: Regarding place of end-of-life care, approximately 50% of the general population preferred 'Home', while 73% of PCU-bereaved families preferred 'PCU'. The concepts of 'Maintaining hope and pleasure' and 'Dying in a favorite place' were associated with the preference for 'Home'. Regarding prognostic disclosure, approximately 50% of the participants preferred some level of negotiation with the physician. The concept of 'Control over the future' was associated with this preference. Regarding treatment of severe refractory physical distress, 75% of the general population and 85% of the PCU-bereaved families preferred palliative sedation therapy. The concepts of 'Physical and psychological comfort' and 'Unawareness of death' were associated with this preference.
   Conclusions: End-of-life care preferences were associated with good-death concepts. It would be useful for health-care workers to discuss patients' good-death concepts to support subsequent treatment decisions.

AB Recently, several epidemiologic studies have reported that lithium in drinking water may be associated with lower rates of suicide mortality, lower incidence of dementia, and lower levels of adolescents' depression and aggression at the population level. However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated lithium level in tap water in relation to psychotic experiences in a general population of adolescents. This is the first study to investigate this using a large dataset. Information on psychotic experiences, distress associated with these experiences, and depressive symptoms were collected in 24 public junior high schools in Kochi Prefecture in Japan. Samples were collected from sources that supplied drinking water to schools, and lithium levels were measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The association of lithium levels with psychotic experiences, considering distress as a degree of severity, was examined using an ordinal logistic regression model with schools and depressive symptoms as random effects. In total, 3040 students responded to the self-reporting questionnaire (response rate: 91.8%). Lithium levels in tap water were inversely associated with psychotic experiences (p = 0.021). We concluded that lithium level in tap water was inversely associated with psychotic experiences among a general population of adolescents and may have a preventive effect for such experiences and distress.

AB Depression in older adults erodes their health, quality of life and the economy. Existing interventions are not feasible for broad application at the community. Postcard intervention only requires a few resources, and previous studies have shown its effectiveness for patients following drug overdose, self-harm and hospitalisation for major depression. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a postcard intervention. Participants were community-dwelling individuals, aged 65 or older, who eat meals alone and with the score of 4 or higher on the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). We enrolled 184 eligible participants, with 93 in the intervention and 91 in the control arm. Postcards were sent to participants once a month for eight months. Primary outcome was the GDS-15 score at post-intervention. Secondary outcomes were quality of life and activities of daily living. There was no significant difference in primary and secondary outcomes between completers of the intervention and the control arm. However, most of the participants who received intervention thought the intervention was effective. The postcard intervention for depression in community-dwelling elderly people in Japan is neither feasible nor effective. However, the descriptive results suggest that the intervention may be effective given different parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Major affective disorders are common widespread conditions associated with multiple psychosocial impairments and suicidal risk in the general population. At least 3-4% of all depressive individuals die by suicide. At a molecular level, affective disorders and suicidal behavior are recently associated with disturbances in structural and synaptic plasticity. A recent hypothesis suggested that small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), in particular microRNAs (miRNAs), play a critical role in the translational regulation at the synapse. We performed a selective overview of the current literature on miRNAs putative subcellular localization and sites of action in mature neurons analyzing their role in neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, pathological stress changes, major affective disorders and suicidal behavior. miRNAs have played a fundamental role in the evolution of brain functions. The perturbation of some intracellular mechanisms as well as impaired assembly, localization, and translational regulation of specific RNA binding proteins may affect learning and memory, presumably contributing to the pathogenesis of major affective disorders and perhaps suicidal behavior. Also, miRNA dys-regulation has also been linked to several neuropsychiatric diseases. However, further evidence are needed in order to directly clarify the role of miRNAs in major affective disorders and suicidal behavior.

AB Pharmacists work in places where they often get in contact with people who may have trouble with their illness, patients and patients' family with prescription, and customers who purchase over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and/or daily goods. Pharmacists can also identify excessive or unsuitable use of OTC drugs resulting from a psychiatric disorder. Moreover, they are in a position in which they can also find the normal-dose addictions and fatigued patient's family resulting from their daily patient's care. Since the consultation to a pharmacist is free of charge, many people often go to the pharmacist to talk about their health concerns. If pharmacists can get in contact with persons who are not aware of their mental illness and send them to the primary care physician, the pharmacists may contribute to prevent suicide and find the unrecognized psychiatric disorder. However, since pharmacists have little knowledge regarding to the psychiatric disorder, they cannot actively contact with this type of people. This article will argue about the methodology and education for pharmacists to connect undiagnosed patients to the appropriate medical care. It is proposed that the pharmacists should encourage the undiagnosed psychiatric patients to contact with the primary care physician. In addition, pharmacists should recommend the change of prescription to the medical doctors who examine the patients expected the addiction to the prescribed drug.

AB Background: Generational differences in disease rates are the main subject of age-period-cohort (APC) analysis, which is mostly applied in cancer and suicide research. This study applied APC analysis to selected neurological diseases: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: The analyses were based on Swiss mortality data. Age-stratified data has been available for MS, PD and ALS since 1901, 1921, and 1942, respectively. APC analysis was performed within the framework of logit models. Main effect models were extended by implementing nested effects, i.e. age effects nested in sub-periods, in order to account for the fact that age profiles may change for reasons other than generational influences. Results: In preliminary analyses, APC analysis yielded noteworthy birth cohort effects in all three diseases. After implementing nested effects, the birth cohort effects disappeared in ALS, and smoothed out in PD, where they were greater for the generations born before the 1920s. In MS, the birth cohort effects remained stable, and exhibited a peak in cohorts born in the 1910s and 1920s. Conclusions: APC analysis yielded some evidence for birth cohort effects, i.e. predisposing risk factors that may change in historical terms, in MS and PD, but probably not in ALS.

AB Adenosine deaminase-1 and -2 (ADAR-1 and -2) are double-stranded RNA-specific enzymes involved in the editing of genes including serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT2CR) mRNA and ADAR-2 pre-mRNA. We reported that the editing efficacy of 5-HT2CR mRNA altered during brain development in rats. The present study aimed to clarify if changes in the expression of ADAR genes and the editing of ADAR-2 pre-mRNA occur during development. The expression level of ADAR-1 mRNA was constant during development, whereas the expression levels of ADAR-2 mRNA and ADAR-2 pre-mRNA markedly increased during development. ADAR-2 pre-mRNA possesses six editing sites. Editing of these sites did not occur during the embryonic period; however, the number of edited sites and the editing frequency at these sites increased after birth and cultivation period. These results suggest that the increases in ADAR-2 pre-mRNA editing and mRNA expression of the enzyme may play a role in development. We also discuss the relationship between 5-HT2CR mRNA editing and the expression/RNA editing of ADAR-1 and ADAR-2 mRNA. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

AB To examine mortality among Japanese school personnel working at primary and secondary schools, we studied mortality among members of the Mutual Aid Association of Public School Teachers (MAPST) aged 20 to 59 yr working at a primary or secondary school in six prefectures in Japan in 1992-1996 (membership, approximately 180,000/yr). The observed number of deaths during the study period was obtained from the file of deceased members kept at the MAPST. The cause of death was determined by examining the death benefit application submitted by bereaved families. The sex-and-cause-specific mortality was examined by using age-adjusted standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) in comparison with the general population, all workers, or professional and technical workers (peer group). During the study period, 719 deaths occurred. The male school personnel had a significantly lower risk of mortality from all causes than the general population [SMR, 0.45, 95% confidence interval (95%Cl)=0.41-0.49], all workers (SMR: 0.61, 95%Cl=0.56-0.67), and the peer group (SMR: 0.70, 95%Cl=0.64-0.77). The female school personnel had a significantly lower risk of mortality from all causes than the general population (SMR: 0.46, 95%Cl=0.40-0.53), and all workers (SMR: 0.81, 95%Cl=0.71-0.93), but the difference from the peer group was not statistically significant (SMR: 0.93, 95%Cl=0.82-1.07). Lower mortality in school personnel compared with the three populations was observed from all cancers (SMR: male,0.54-0.68; female, 0.54-0.93), heart diseases (SMR: male, 0.60-0.94; female, 0.30-0.90), cerebrovascular diseases (SMR: male, 0.33-0.50; female, 0.31-0.61), and suicide (SMR: male, 0.36-0.68; female, 0.42-0.91). These findings indicate that Japanese school personnel working at a primary or secondary school had only half the mortality of the general population in both sexes. The causes of the low mortality among school personnel, including lifestyle factors and work environment, need to be studied to develop health promotion activities for other occupational employees in Japan.

AB A 2008 review by our group concluded that the risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events (NPAEs) in influenza patients was not increased by oseltamivir exposure, and did not identify any mechanism by which oseltamivir or its metabolites could cause or worsen such events. The current article reviews new information on this topic. Between September 16, 2007 and May 15, 2010, 1,805 spontaneously-reported NPAEs were identified in 1,330 patients receiving oseltamivir: 767 (42.5%) from Japan, 296 (16.4%) from the USA, and 742 (41.1%) from other countries. NPAEs were more common in children: 1,072 (59.4%) events were in those aged a parts per thousand currency sign16 years. NPAEs often occurred within 48 h of treatment initiation (953 events; 52.8%). Nearly half of the events were serious in nature (838; 46.4%). The three largest categories of events were abnormal behavior (457 events, 25.3%), miscellaneous psychiatric events (370; 20.5%), and delusions/perceptual disturbances (316 events, 17.5%). A total of 1,545 events (85.6%) in eight different categories were considered to be delirium or delirium-like. Twenty-eight suicide-related events were reported. A US healthcare claims database analysis showed that the risk of NPAEs in 7,798 oseltamivir-treated patients was no higher than that in 10,411 patients not on antivirals, but a study on oseltamivir and abnormal behavior in Japan was less conclusive. NPAE frequency in oseltamivir-exposed Japanese and Taiwanese children with influenza was the same as in unexposed children. New analysis of the UK General Practice Research Database showed that the relative adjusted risk of NPAEs in influenza patients was 2.18-times higher than in the general population. Other epidemiology studies report frequent occurrence of encephalitis and similar disorders in influenza patients independently of oseltamivir exposure. The new data support the findings of the original assessment. Evidence suggests that influenza-related encephalopathies are caused by influenza-induced inflammatory responses, but more work is needed to confirm the underlying mechanisms.

AB In 1978 Italy implemented Law Number 180, the reform law that blocked all new admissions to public mental hospitals. After 40 years without mental hospitals, we aim at understanding the consequences of the Italian reform in terms of mental health care facility and staff availability. We compared the organization of the Italian mental health system with that of countries belonging to the Group of 7 (G7) major advanced economies. Italy has nearly 8 psychiatrists, 20 nurses, 2 social workers and less than 3 psychologists per 100,000 population, while for example in France there were 22 psychiatrists, in Japan 102 nurses, in the United States 18 social workers, and in Canada and France more than 45 psychologists per 100,000 population. In terms of inpatient facilities, no beds in mental hospitals were available in Italy, while in the other G7 countries mental hospital beds ranged from 8 in the United Kingdom to 204 in Japan per 100 000 population. In Italy there were fewer beds for acute care in general hospitals but more beds in community residential facilities than in the other G7 countries. Service use data showed variability in the provision of mental health care throughout the country. Soon after the implementation of the Italian reform the absolute number of compulsory admissions progressively declined, from more than 20,000 in 1978 to less than 9000 in 2015. Alongside the progressive decline of psychiatric beds imposed by Law 180, the age-adjusted suicide rate remained stable, ranging from 7.1/100,000 population in 1978 to 6.3/100,000 population in 2012. The population of psychiatric patients placed in Italian forensic psychiatric hospitals progressively declined. During the last 40 years without mental hospitals, Italy has seen a progressive consolidation of a community-based system of mental health care. We highlighted, however, reasons for concern, including a decreasing staffing level, a potential use of community residential facilities as long-stay residential services, a still too high variability in service provision across the country, and lack of national data on physical restraints. At a national level, the resources allocated to mental health care are lower in Italy than in other high-income countries.

AB Purpose This study investigated changes in depressive symptoms after the implementation of a universal screening for depression and subsequent care support.
   Methods A cluster-randomized study design used 10 subdistricts (2,400 inhabitants aged 40-64 years) in northern Japan randomly assigned in a 2:3 ratio to intervention and control conditions. All 900 residents aged 40-64 in the intervention districts were invited to participate in a 2-year depressive screening program, with a participation rate of 49.2 %. A 4-year ongoing education program occurred in both intervention and control districts. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to assess depressive symptomatology. Repeated cross-sectional samples were surveyed before (n = 1,516, response rate 63.6 %) and after (n = 1,596, 66.4 %) intervention, and the data, clustered according to district, were analyzed at the individual level using a mixed-effects model.
   Results Significant changes in mean scores between baseline and 5-year follow-up in the intervention group were observed in the Depressive Affect, Somatic Symptoms, and Interpersonal Problems subscales. The difference between the changes over time in the two groups was significant for the three subscales and marginally for the CES-D total scale, but not for the Positive Affect subscale.
   Conclusions Universal depression screening and subsequent support can be effective in preventing general depressive symptoms, but may not influence psychological well-being, among middle-aged adults in a community setting.

AB Compared with other industrialized countries, the suicide rate in Japan is high. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the mental health care offered at a newspaper facing organizational restructuring and with an aging work force. The Health and Safety Committee played a central role in the creation and application of a new mental health care system. This plan, developed to meet the on-site dynamics of the company, was based on the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's "Guide for Workers' Mental Health Promotion in the Workplace." Executive officers' roles were defined at the directors' meetings, and the Health and Safety Committee held Listening Skills Seminars for executive personnel. As a result, the mental health care system functioned effectively and fostered the care of two presenting employees (i.e., one with slight depression with chronic lumbago and the other with alcohol dependency). In addition, the number of workers who took 4 or more days of sick leave decreased from 31 of 190 in 1996 to 5 of 108 in 2004, with no psychologically related absences. Moreover, the number of industrial injuries declined from 8 cases in 1996 to 0 cases in 2004, and no occupational deaths or early retirements occurred between the fiscal years of 1996 and 2004. As a result of this research at the company, a work:site where repeated large-scale organizational restructuring has occurred, the mental health care system functioned effectively and contributed to a decrease in the rate of sick leave taken by workers.

AB Post-disaster reconstruction projects in areas with high pre-disaster vulnerabilities can lead to both temporary and permanent resettlement outcomes. During this complex process, efforts are centred to the provision of housing and basic infrastructure. In general, the limited land available restricts opportunities for high-quality spatial design within the settlements to optimize the land and provide the maximum number of houses possible. Open spaces in these settlements are rarely considered during the planning and implementation of the projects, and consequently there is little scholarship of community space. However, the importance of open spaces to the community and the liveability of these new settlements depend on the interactions which spontaneously take place in these areas. This study explores the different uses and characteristics of open spaces in temporary and permanent resettlement sites established in the aftermath of major disasters in Japan and the Philippines. This study addresses the limitations of the immediate post-disaster urban planning, compared to the longer-term urban space that emerges spontaneously in an attempt by the residents to improve their community. It was observed that the planning of open and public spaces was not a priority for the governments and the other stakeholders involved in settlement design. Despite these compromises, this study reveals that resettled communities appreciate any available open spaces and transform these spaces to accommodate their needs and cultural preferences reflecting their vital role as urban elements for convergence of the multiple sociocultural activities towards the recovery and revitalization of the disaster-affected communities.

AB Cholesterol and uric acid, which might correlate with steroidogenesis and monoamine functions, may change under emotionally stressful conditions and in mental disturbances. Among anxiety disorders, an increase of serum cholesterol has been observed in panic disorder. However, the issue has not been adequately investigated in other anxiety disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The present study investigated serum cholesterols, uric acid and cholinesterase in victims of the Tokyo subway sarin poisoning, 1995, in a series of 5-year follow-ups. Cholinesterase was studied, in relevance with serum lipid changes and symptoms of PTSD, and also in light of a biological effect of satin. Out of 34 victims, eight developed PTSD and two were currently diagnosed with PTSD using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). No significant relationship was observed between PTSD and serum cholesterols or uric acid. Several factors including co-occurrence of other mental disturbances with PTSD, in addition to the limited sample size, might have affected the result. In contrast, serum cholinesterase level was significantly reduced in the victims with the development of PTSD, compared with the matched controls (P < 0.02, t-test). This might partly reflect a long-term remnant effect of satin intoxication, although an effect of the psychological experience could not be totally excluded.

AB Feeling ashamed for seeking help when distressed is known to be a critical factor promoting suicidal behaviors. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between suicidal ideation and psychosocial factors, including worries or anxieties, having a person to confide in, feeling ashamed for seeking help when distressed, and K6 score.
   Fourteen out of 77 municipalities from Nagano Prefecture participated in this questionnaire survey. Participants of both sexes over 20 years of age were randomly selected according to age distribution in each municipality. Association between suicidal ideation and sociodemographic and psychosocial factors, including "feeling ashamed for seeking help", were determined by multiple logistic regression analysis.
   Among a total of 11,100 participants, 7394 (66.6 %) returned the questionnaire. 2147 participants responded properly to essential study parameters and were submitted to the final analyses. The adjusted odds ratio of suicidal ideation was 2.09 (95 % CI 1.49-2.94) among participants feeling ashamed for seeking help, compared to those not feeling ashamed. Although the rate of "no person to confide in" was 4.4 %, participants who responded with "no person to confide in" had significantly increased odds ratio of suicidal ideation compared with those who responded with "having a person to confide in" (OR 1.97, 95 % CI 1.12-3.47).
   Our findings suggest a need for tailored intervention targeting individuals at risk by gatekeepers to encourage individuals at risk to overcome feeling ashamed for seeking help and to cultivate an appropriate person to confide in.

TI Pentacyclic triterpene constituents of yellow birch bark from Quebec
SO JOURNAL OF WOOD CHEMISTRY AND TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CHEMICAL EVALUATION; OUTER BARK; JAPAN
AB Birch bark represents an abundant, and currently under-utilized, natural resource. Yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), the emblem tree of Quebec, is commercially important and one of the most widespread birch species in the province, but the use of its bark is limited. It is only used as a-low value fuel source in solid wood products industries. Yellow birch bark triterpene constituents such as lupeol, betulin and betulinic acid have been described to have high biological activity, The yellow birch bark triterpene constituents such as betulin and certain derivatives of this natural substance have demonstrated interesting therapeutic properties. For example, betulinic acid has been shown to possess antitumor activity against human melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo models. Its mechanism of action consists in the induction of apoptosis or cellular suicide in the cancer cells without affecting healthy cells. In these natural products confer added value to this tree. In this study, we investigated the triterpenoid composition of the outer bark or B. alleghaniensis from three locations in Quebec: Saint-Damien de Bellechasse, Saint-Felix-d'Otis, and Duchesnay. Eight triterpenes not previously reported in the bark of yellow birch were detected in this research. The betulonic aldehyde was identified as a new yellow birch bark constituent in bark samples from all sites, while the betulinic aldehyde and the oleanane type triterpenes were only detected in the sample from Saint-Felix-d'Otis. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the oleanane-type triterpenes are identified in yellow birch bark.

AB AimPrescription drug abuse, including benzodiazepines, is a growing health problem in Japan. This study examined the community pharmacist's clinical behavior regarding patients who overdose on prescribed drugs, and explored the possibility of overdose prevention by community pharmacists.
   MethodsWe surveyed all registered community pharmacies with dispensing functions (n=1867) in the Saitama Pharmaceutical Association. An anonymous self-administered questionnaire was mailed to each pharmacy. Respondents were asked about clinical behavior such as medication counseling and referral to the prescriber if prescription drug overdose was identified.
   ResultsAmong respondents, 26% of community pharmacists reported clinical experience of working with patients who overdosed on prescribed drugs in the previous year. Half of respondents evaluated their practice such as medication counseling and referral to the prescriber as good'. On multivariate analysis, a poor' self-evaluation of referral to the prescriber was significantly associated with the following perceptions: insufficient confidence in communication with prescribers' (odds ratio [OR], 2.7; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.4-5.3), and to avoid trouble with prescribers' (OR, 1.7; 95%CI: 1.0-2.7).
   ConclusionJapanese community pharmacists could prevent prescription drug abuse in their practice, but the pharmacists who have insufficient confidence in communication with prescribers and who are afraid of trouble with a prescriber, reported poor self-evaluation for referral to the prescribers. All prescribers should understand the importance of referral by community pharmacists, to assist community pharmacists in playing a critical role in prevention of prescription drug abuse.

AB Introduction Little is known about the prescription patterns of adjunctive antidepressants in Asian schizophrenia patients. This study aimed to examine trends in the use of antidepressants and their demographic and clinical correlates in the treatment of schizophrenia in Asia between 2001 and 2009. Methods A total of 6,761 hospitalized schizophrenia patients in nine Asian countries and territories were examined: 2,399 in 2001, 2,136 in 2004 and 2,226 in 2009. Patients' socio-demographic and clinical characteristics and prescriptions of psychotropic drugs were recorded using a standardized protocol and data collection procedure. Results The proportion of antidepressant prescription was 6.8% in the whole sample; 5.3% in 2001, 6.5% in 2004 and 8.7% in 2009. There were wide inter-country variations at each survey ranging from 0.9% in Hong Kong to 15.3% in Singapore in 2001; from 1.9% in Korea to 15.4% in Singapore in 2004; and from 2.7% in Japan to 22.0% in Singapore in 2009. Multiple logistic regression analysis of the whole sample revealed that patients on antidepressants were younger, more likely to receive benzodiazepines and have significant extrapyramidal side-effects and less likely to have significant positive symptoms. Discussion Unlike findings in Western countries, adjunctive antidepressant prescription for schizophrenia was not common in Asia. The frequency of antidepressant prescription varied among countries and territories, suggesting that a host of clinical and socio-cultural factors played a role in determining antidepressant use in Asia.

AB Wolfram disease is a rare genetic disorder frequently accompanying depression and psychosis. Non-symptomatic mutation carriers also have higher rates of depression and suicide. Because WfS1, the causative gene of Wolfram disease, is located at 4p16, a linkage locus for bipolar disorder, mutations of WfS1 were suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. In this study, we performed behavioral and gene expression analyses of Wfs1 knockout mice to assess the validity as an animal model of mood disorder. In addition, the distribution of Wfs1 protein was examined in mouse brain. Wfs1 knockout mice did not show abnormalities in circadian rhythm and periodic fluctuation of wheel-running activity. Behavioral analysis showed that Wfs1 knockout mice had retardation in emotionally triggered behavior, decreased social interaction, and altered behavioral despair depending on experimental conditions. Wfs1-like immunoreactivity inmouse brain showed a similar distribution pattern to that in rats, including several nuclei potentially relevant to the symptoms of mood disorders. Gene expression analysis showed down-regulation of Cdc42ep5 and Rnd1, both of which are related to Rho GTPase, which plays a role in dendrite development. These findings may be relevant to the mood disorder observed in patients with Wolfram disease. (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

ID DRINKING-WATER; SUICIDE; DISORDERS; MOOD; RISK; PLACEBO; RATES
AB Objective: We investigated the association between lithium level in tap water and mental health problems, including depressive symptoms, anxiety, and aggressive and suicidal behaviors, in a general population of adolescents using a large individual-level dataset.
   Methods: A school-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted in Kochi Prefecture in Japan between 2008 and 2009. Students in 24 public junior high schools were asked to anonymously complete a self-report questionnaire. The main outcome measures were mental health problems, including those on the 12-item General Health Questionnaire, interpersonal violence, bullying, destructive behavior, self-harm, and suicidal ideation. Samples were collected from sources that supplied drinking water to schools, and lithium levels were measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The associations of lithium levels with mental health problems were examined using a generalized linear mixed model with schools as the fixed effect. Potential confounding factors were also added into the model.
   Results: A total of 3,040 students among 3,311 students responded to the self-report questionnaire (response rate, 91.8%). The mean lithium concentration in tap water was 0.48 mu g/L (SD = 0.52; range, 0.01 to 2.10; skewness = 2.01; kurtosis = 4.04), and it was relatively low compared with previous studies. In multivariable regression analysis, lithium level in tap water had an inverse association with depressive symptoms (P =.02) and interpersonal violence (P =.02) but not with suicidal behaviors (suicidal ideation, P =.82; self-harm, P =.46).
   Conclusions: Lithium level in tap water was inversely associated with depressive symptoms and interpersonal violence among a general population of adolescents and may have antidepressive and antiaggressive effects.

AB Background: In the third quarter of 2008, a major financial crisis hit many developed countries. Taiwan suffered its own share: a rise in unemployment and a severe decline in gross domestic product. This study is to address the health consequences of this crisis on different socioeconomic populations in Taiwan.
   Methods: A sample of 6,225,766 men and 5,417,651 women, was obtained and their admissions data over 2007-2012 were retrieved. Stratified into three income levels, the sample was examined on the 147,921 episodes of hospitalization due to depressive illnesses (DIs) over that period by an interrupted time series analysis for monthly incidence rates of DI hospitalizations
   Results: The adjusted incidence rates of hospitalization (AIRH) for DIs among the low income were 10 times that of the high income group. The AIRHs were generally higher in all of three female income groups than they were in the three male income groups. The low income men and women showed increases (of 18.0% and 14.2%, respectively) beginning in April 2008 that sustained for two years. The high income women exhibited a 5.0% monthly rise in the rate of DI hospitalizations.
   Limitations: Our time series models can control some confounding factors, but the ecological fallacy remained.
   Conclusions: This study provides evidence that the economic recession resulted in increased rates of DI hospitalization in Taiwan, especially among the low income population. Women of higher incomes may have suffered a more enduring impact.

AB Glufasinate is a non-selective herbicide widely used in domestic gardens and agriculture. Few cases of glufosinate poisoning have been reported although there has been an increase in recent years, particularly in Japan. Glufosinate toxicity is related to its capacity to inhibit glutamine synthetase and glutamate decarboxylase, which may 1 ad to a potentially fatal multiorgan failure. We report the case of a 41-year-old woman who ingested between 30 and 50 mL of a herbicide (Finale (R)) containing glufosinate (14%) in a suicide attempt. One hour after ingestion, the patient attended the Emergency Department of her own volition. Her overall status was good, and the physical examination was unremarkable. Gastric lavage was carried out, 25g of activated charcoal was administered, and the patient was admitted for observation. Seventeen hours later, the patient presented drowsiness and a sinus bradycardia of 40 bpm. Thirty-two hours after ingestion, the Glasgow Coma Score was 8, and orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were begun. At 3 days, the patient presented a selflimiting episode of ventricular tachycardia. She recovered consciousness progressively and was extubated without complications. The evolution was favorable, but the sinus bradycardia persisted up to 8 days after the ingestion. A study of lymphocyte mitochondrial function showed no alteration in mitochondrial oxidative capacity or the enzymatic activity of the complexes of the electron transport chain. A small ingestion of glufosinate can cause severe poisoning, whose manifestations predominantly involve the central nervous system and heart rhythm. Signs and symptoms may not appear for several hours and may persist for several days. In spite of these multi-organ manifestations, no alteration in lymphocyte mitochondrial function has been reported.

AB We examined whether infraorbital nerve injury affected the RNA editing efficiency of the serotonin (5HT) 2C receptor in the cervical spinal cord, in association with increased pain thresholds, and whether a 5HT reuptake inhibitor (fluvoxamine; Depromel (R), Meiji Seika, Tokyo, Japan) altered this editing. Accordingly, we injured rats with an infraorbital nerve loose ligation and examined the pain thresholds, mRNA and mRNA editing of the 5HT2C receptor. We evaluated changes in mRNA editing and 5HT2C mRNA expression using cloning along with sequence analysis and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to compare samples taken at post-injury day 28 from spinal cord sites, including the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, in naive, sham and injured rats (groups of each type had also received fluvoxamine). 5HT2C receptor expression was maintained post-injury. The RNA editing efficiency was statistically significantly lower at molecular sites A and B in ipsilateral spinal cord samples from injured rats than in bilateral samples from naive and sham rats, and in contralateral samples from injured rats. After injury, the proportional presence of two receptor isoforms changed, i.e. statistically significantly less VNV and significantly more INV and ISV. The proportions reverted after fluvoxamine administration. The post-injury change might be evidence of a functional adaptation mechanism that increases the expression of 5HT2C mRNA isoforms that encode receptors that are more sensitive to 5HT. This would activate the brainstem-spinal descending 5HT systems and, in effect, suppress nociceptive signals from primary afferent neurons to the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis.

TI Associations between sleep habits and mental health status and

SO JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH

DE eveningness; prospective; pseudo-association; suicide; teens
ID EVENINGNESS; DURATION; BEHAVIOR
AB Several epidemiological studies have indicated that there is a relationship between sleep habits, such as sleep duration, bedtime and bedtime regularity, and mental health status, including depression and anxiety in adolescents. However, it is still to be clarified whether the relationship is direct cause-and-effect or mediated by the influence of genetic and other traits, i.e. quasi-correlation. To examine this issue, we conducted a twin study using a total of 314 data for monozygotic twins from a longitudinal survey of sleep habits and mental health status conducted in a unified junior and senior high school (grades 7-12), located in Tokyo, Japan. Three-level hierarchical linear model analysis showed that both bedtime and sleep duration had significant associations with the Japanese version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) score, suicidal thoughts and the experience of self-harm behaviours when genetic factors and shared environmental factors, which were completely shared between co-twins, were controlled for. These associations were statistically significant even after controlling for bedtime regularity, which was also associated significantly with the GHQ-12 score. These suggest that the associations between sleep habits and mental health status were still statistically significant after controlling for the influence of genetic and shared environmental factors of twins, and that there may be a direct cause-and-effect in the relationship in adolescents. Thus, late bedtime and short sleep duration could predict subsequent development of depression and anxiety, including suicidal or self-injury risk. This suggests that poor mental health status in adolescents might be improved by health education and intervention concerning sleep and lifestyle habits.

AB IntroductionThis study was to assess differences in the symptom profile of depressive illness across various countries/territories in Asia. The study was a part of the Research on Asia Psychotropic Prescription project. The participating countries/territories include China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand.
   MethodsThe pattern of depressive symptoms in 1,400 subjects with depressive disorder from 42 psychiatric centers in 10 Asian countries/territories was assessed. We collected information on socio-demographic and clinical characteristics with a standardized protocol and data collection procedure.
   ResultsThe most common presentations of depressive symptoms were persistent sadness, loss of interest, and insomnia. Similar findings were found regardless of the region, country, or its income level. Patients with depressive disorder from high-income countries presented significantly more with vegetative symptom cluster (P<0.05), while those from the upper middle-income countries had significantly more with both mood (P<0.001) and cognitive symptom clusters (P<0.01). In lower middle-income countries, patients with depressive symptoms had significantly less mood symptom cluster (P<0.001) but significantly more cognitive symptom cluster (P<0.05).
   DiscussionThis study demonstrates that in Asia, despite variations in the initial symptom reported by the patients, across different countries/territories, core depressive symptoms remain the same. Variations have been found in presentation of depressive symptoms with regards to the level of income of countries. Physical or vegetative symptoms were reported more by centers in higher income countries, while depressive cognition and suicidal thoughts/acts were more frequently reported from lower income countries.

AB Background: While the benefits of low cholesterol for physical health are not in doubt, a potential negative aspect of low cholesterol for mental health is suggested by several studies. To examine the association between cholesterol and mental health, the authors performed an observational study.
   Method: From April 1995 to March 2002, a series of questionnaires pertaining to physical activity, food consumption, alcohol, coffee, smoking, and mental health (12 item-version of General Health Questionnaire: GHQ-12) were administered to 1972 employees in Japan. Subjects with less than 150 mg/dL of total cholesterol (very low cholesterol cohort) and other subjects (control cohort) were followed up for one to six years, and their mental health compared using GHQ caseness (GHQ-12 scores more than 3).
   Results: Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that the very low cholesterol cohort had significantly greater GHQ caseness than the control cohort. Notably, this finding applied to males but not to females. After adjustment for general health, Cox's proportional hazards regression model confirmed this association in males only. The survival curves of control cohort were significantly different between males and females whereas those of very low cholesterol cohort were not.
   Limitations: GHQ caseness was regarded as "death" in the survival analysis. As such, it is not possible to differentiate between transient and persistent mental dysfunction and therefore may lead to overestimation of GHQ caseness over observational years.
   Conclusion: The present findings suggest that very low cholesterol may be associated with worse mental health in males and conversely and interestingly indicate that moderate (but not very low) cholesterol levels may protect mental health in males. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The authors assessed the effect of psychological stress on total and cause-specific mortality among men and women. In 1981-1983, the 12,128 Danish participants in the Copenhagen City Heart Study were asked two questions on stress intensity and frequency and were followed in a nationwide registry until 2004, with < 0.1% loss to follow-up. Sex differences were found in the relations between stress and mortality (p = 0.02). After adjustments, men with high stress versus low stress had higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15, 1.52). This finding was most pronounced for deaths due to respiratory diseases (high vs. low stress: HR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.10, 2.91), external causes (HR = 3.07, 95% CI: 1.65, 5.71), and suicide (HR = 5.91, 95% CI: 2.47, 14.16). High stress was related to a 2.59 (95% CI: 1.20, 5.61) higher risk of ischemic heart disease mortality for younger, but not older, men. In general, the effects of stress were most pronounced among younger and healthier men. No associations were found between stress and mortality among women, except among younger women with high stress, who experienced lower cancer mortality (HR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.92). Future preventive strategies may be targeted toward stress as a risk factor for premature death among middle-aged, presumably healthy men.

TI Self-inflicted Burn Injury Is Independently Associated With Increased
   Mortality in a More Economically Developed Country: A Propensity Score
   Matching Analysis
SO JOURNAL OF BURN CARE & RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID INTENTIONAL BURNS; IMMOLATION; SUICIDE; LENGTH; RISK; SURVIVAL;
   PATTERNS; IMPACT
AB Self-inflicted burn accounts for considerable morbidity and mortality in more economically developed countries, and there is a substantial debate regarding the pathophysiological relevance between self-inflicted burns and unfavorable outcomes. To validate whether self-inflicted injury is an independent predictor of high mortality regardless of the severity of burn, they conducted a retrospective observational study using the Japan Trauma Data Bank, a nationwide database including over 200 major tertiary care centers. Among 2006 patients with burn who had arrived at collaborating centers between 2004 and 2016, they included patients aged >= 15 years, those who did not present with cardiopulmonary arrest upon arrival, and those who had >= 10 percent total body surface area burns. Patients with missing survival data or unknown mechanism of injury were excluded. In total, 1094 patients were eligible, of whom 222 (20.3 percent) had self-inflicted burns. The patients were divided into the self-inflicted and non-self-inflicted groups, and propensity score was calculated using the demographic information of the patients, injury variables, time from injury to hospital arrival, and other survival predictors. Via a propensity score matching, 98 pairs were selected, and the self-inflicted group had a higher mortality than the non-self-inflicted group (43.9 vs 28.6 percent, hazard ratio = 1.77; 95% confidence interval = 1.10-2.86; P =.02). Inverse probability weighting and multivariate logistic regression were performed as sensitivity analyses, and results validated that self-inflicted burn was independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Therefore, patients with self-inflicted burns should receive judicious management, regardless of burn injury severity.

TI Older Adults Looking for a Job through Employment Support System in

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID JAPAN; UNEMPLOYMENT; TIME
AB Purpose of the Study
   This study aims to clarify the job seeking process of the elderly people through the local employment support facility known as the Active Senior Employment Support Center (ASESC)" AKUTIBU SINIA SHUGYO SIEN SENTAA" in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and evaluate the performance as a complement to the national support systems.
   Methods
   We conducted 6 waves of longitudinal mail surveys over 38 weeks to 235 older job seekers (146 males and 89 females, average age 63.7, SD 5.6), who visited two ASESCs for the first time, to clarify their living situation, health condition, and changes in their job seeking process.
   Results
   These older job seekers tended to be at a relatively low education level and on low income, as well as tended to seek jobs for earning living expenses rather than for well-being. Half of them found employment in 35.0 days; however, 23.8% couldn't find any job in 38 weeks, especially those who were younger and with higher education.
   Implications
   ASESCs are functioning to assist older job seekers who are mainly seeking jobs for earning living expenses, which can be attained in a short time span and enable them to earn some money. These facilities are expected to be consulting services, not only for employment support but also for general living, because it is important to maintain contact with people who are at risk of social isolation, serious financial difficulty, or suicide. We consider it very helpful to encourage and re-activate these mismatched people, by supporting them to engage in highly contributional services to our society and the next generation, such as providing child-care support or daily life support, the demands for which are rapidly increasing due to recent governmental policies.

AB Objective.-To identify the indicators of major depressive episode (MDE) in primary care patients with a chief complaint of headache.
   Background.-MDE is very frequent among headache patients in primary care. However, primary care physicians often fail to recognize the coexistence of MDE.
   Methods.-A total of 177 consecutive new adult patients who visited 19 primary care clinics from January 2002 to December 2002 with a chief complaint of headache were enrolled in the study. All subjects completed a self-report questionnaire that included questions regarding the duration and severity of their headaches, changes in headache severity, and other symptoms. The questionnaire also identified distressed high utilizers (patients who consulted different doctors for the same episode of an illness, without being referred). MDE was diagnosed using a module of the mini international neuropsychiatric interview (MINI). To identify potential indicators of depression, both univariate analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis were performed.
   Results.-Forty-five of 177 patients (25.4%) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for MDE. Univariate analysis revealed that severe headache, longer duration of headaches, multiple somatic symptoms, and being a distressed high utilizer were associated with MDE. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that patients with headaches lasting 6 months or longer and those with multiple somatic symptoms were more likely to be suffering from MDE (adjusted odds ratios: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.7-10.6; and 3.9, 95% CI: 1.2-8.1, respectively).
   Conclusions.-MDE is highly prevalent in headache patients visiting a primary care setting. Multiple somatic symptoms and longer duration (>= 6 months) of headaches are particularly useful indicators of MDE.

AB Shewanella livingstonensis Ac10, a psychrotrophic bacterium isolated from Antarctic seawater, grows well at low temperatures close to 0 degrees C. The bacterium is useful as a host in a low-temperature protein expression system. It is also useful as a model microorganism to investigate the mechanisms of microbial cold-adaptation. Versatile genetic manipulation techniques would be useful to investigate the biology of this bacterium and to develop its applications. In this study, we developed a method for targeted gene deletion and insertion by using the gene coding for orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase (pyrF), which is involved in pyrimidine synthesis. We found that S. livingstonensis Ac10 is sensitive to 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), which is converted to a highly toxic compound by the product of pyrF. A uracil-auxotrophic strain resistant to 5-FOA was constructed by deleting pyrF, thus allowing the use of a plasmid-borne copy of pyrF for selection of recombinants. We constructed the pyrF complementation suicide plasmid pKKP, which contains pyrF, the R6K replication origin, the mob site of RP4, an antibiotic marker gene, and a multiple cloning site. To demonstrate pyrF-based gene replacement, we deleted the internal region of orf5, the gene coding for an eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) synthesis enzyme. We also successfully inserted a Hiss-tag-coding sequence into orf8, the gene coding for another EPA synthesis enzyme. This system allows the markerless deletion and insertion of desired sequences at specific sites in the genome, which remarkably facilitates genetic manipulation of this bacterium.

AB Research on the mechanism of action of coenzyme B, adenosylcobalamin, as a graduate student introduced the author to the field of organic free radicals in enzymology. Twenty years later, related work on S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a "poor man's coenzyme B-12" was initiated in a detailed analysis of the mechanism of action of lysine 2,3-aminomutase (LAM). The interconversion of L-lysine and L-beta-lysine is catalyzed by LAM, which requires SAM, pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), and a [4Fe-4S] cluster as coenzymes. The mechanism of this reaction has been delineated as a radical isomerization, in which radical formation is initiated by the [4Fe-4S]-dependent cleavage of the SAM into methionine and the 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical. The mechanism of this process is discussed, together with the role of this radical in hydrogen abstraction from lysine to initiate the substrate radical isomerization. The chemistry underlying the functions of SAM, PLP, and [4Fe-4S] in the action of LAM is novel in all respects, except for the formation of a lysine-PLP aldimine at the active site. Of the four free radicals in the mechanism, three have been characterized by EPR spectroscopy. In the suicide inactivation of adenosylcobalamin-dependent dioldehydrase (DDH) by glycolaldehyde, the formation of cob(II)alamin and 5'-deoxyadenosine is accompanied by the conversion of glycolaldehyde to cis-ethanesemidione radical at the active site. The cis-ethanesemidione radical has been characterized by EPR spectroscopy. Its exceptional stability at the active site is the basis for the inactivation of DDH by glycolaldehyde.

AB Background. Although palliative sedation therapy is often required in terminally ill cancer patients, little is known about actual practice. The aims of this study were to clarify the physician-reported sedation practices and the factors influencing the sedation rates. Methods. A questionnaire was sent to 105 representative physicians of all certified palliative care units in Japan. A total of 81 responses were analyzed (effective response rate, 80%). Results. The prevalence of continuous-deep sedation for physical symptoms was <10% in 33 institutions (41%), 10-50% in 43 institutions (53%), and >50% in 5 institutions (6.2%). The prevalence of continuous-deep sedation for psychoexistential suffering was 0% in 52 institutions (64%), 0.5-5% in 26 institutions (32%) and more than 10% in 3 institutions (3.6%). Continuous-deep sedation was more frequently performed by physicians who did not believe clear consciousness was necessary for a good death, who did not believe that sedation often shortened patient life, who worked with nurses specializing in cancer/palliative care, who judged the symptoms as refractory without actual trials of treatments, who performed continuous sedation first rather than intermittent sedation, and who used phenobarbitones frequently. Conclusions. Physician-reported practice in palliative sedation therapy varied widely among institutions. The differences were mainly associated with the physicians' philosophy about a good death, physicians' belief about the effects of sedation on patient survival, and physicians' medical practice. Discussion should be focused on these divergent areas, and clear clinical guidelines are urgently needed to provide valid end-of-life care.

AB Although the ideal body, which consistently appears in the revolutionary manifestos, transformative movements, and artworks, plays an important role in imagining a Utopian humanity of modern China, it proves to be impossible because of the destructive acceleration and fragmentation of the questionable local modernity. Probing into the last Chinese horror film before the Sino-Japan War, I would explore the strategies that artists experimented with to manifest, memorize, and mask the perceptive discomfort aroused by the deformed city and corporality. A nice young man from a roving theatrical troupe is identified by a disfigured artist-revolutionist as his ideal friend who shares the same objet petit a in the struggle for a brighter future. Set against the complicated social condition as well as the consumption culture, Song at Midnight articulates the conflicting discourses and the cinematic technologies to encapsulate the traumatic experiences. The monstrous hero, who lives in a fiercely expressionist world, calls himself "a historian suffering from the excruciation" that hints being deprived of any sexual interaction with his lover, a psychopath expelled by her wealthy and tyrannic father. Eventually, the healthy and handsome actor becomes the incarnation of Song who commits suicide, while the dandy vitriol-throws and inhumanly murders. Virilio quotes Renoir's remarks that the war "subverts the proper experience of sex and death." (2009, p. 28) As a reference to both the social and the psychological disorders, the film stirs and releases the public obsession with subjective purity. The wounded won't quiet, keeping the two approaches to produce prosthesis embodied in the occupational shift of Lu Xun in suspense. The deceased will "sits up in his tomb, saying 'when I turn to ashes, you will see me smile.'"(Lu Xun, 2003, p.82)

AB Background: Few studies have evaluated the actual situations of emergency patients with self-inflicted injuries treated by emergency-medical-service (EMS) personnel.
   Methods: This study retrospectively reviewed population-based ambulance records in Osaka City, Japan, between January 2010 and December 2012, and enrolled emergency patients who suffered from self-inflicted injuries such as poisoning by drugs or gas, cutting/piercing skin, jumping from heights, hanging, and drowning. The endpoint was the annual incidence per 100,000 populations in Osaka City of emergency patients who presented with self-inflicted injuries by age and sex. Their outcomes including deaths at the scene and hospital arrival were also evaluated.
   Results: During the study period, a total of 8,671 patients with 9,424 incidents of self-inflicted injuries were documented. The annual incidence of self-inflicted injuries was higher among women than men in the whole population and in the age group < =49 years (136.9 versus 82.6, and 214.8 versus 93.3, both Ps < 0.001), but it was inversely lower among women in the age group > =50 years (49.0 versus 68.9, P < 0.001). The total number of self-inflicted deaths was 1,564 (16.6 %), and the overall proportion of self-inflicted deaths was greater among men than women (32.2 % [1075/3340] vs. 7.5 % [451/6027], P < 0.001). The proportion of self-inflicted hanging was 76.7 % [1142/1489], followed by poisoning by carbon monoxide at 57.1 % [56/98] and jumping to death at 47.6 % [254/534].
   Discussion: Using large-scale EMS records, we investigated characteristics and outcomes of emergency patients with self-inflicted injuries treated by EMS personnel. Our findings suggested the gender paradox that the proportion of self-inflicted deaths was higher among men than women, while the proportion of non-fatal self-inflicted injuries was higher among women than among men, particularly in the group aged < =49 years. Our findings showing the importance of the prevention for self-inflicted injuries as well as the gender paradox of self-inflicted injuries will provide important epidemiological information to improve psychiatric cares in prehospital emergency settings.
   Conclusions: In the total population, the annual incidence of self-inflicted injuries responded to by EMS personnel was higher among women than among men. However, the proportion of self-inflicted deaths was greater among men than women, and the most frequent manner among deceased patients was by hanging.

AB We retrospectively investigated surgical immediate and long-term overall results after clipping of the unruptured aneurysms. Between 1991 and 2008, 166 patients underwent neck clipping of unruptured saccular aneurysms at our institute. Patients were subsequently followed to clarify the occurrence of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and stroke other than SAH, aneurysm recurrence, cerebrovascular death, all-cause death, and risk factors. Surgical complication was noted in 14 patients (8.4 %) and surgical morbidity in two patients (1.2 %). Of 164 patients except for these two patients who suffered surgical morbidity, we could obtain more than 3 years follow-up information for 144 patients (87.8 %). There were 49 men and 95 women. The mean age was 58.5 years, and mean follow-up period was 7.9 years. Eight cases had died during follow-up (hepatic insufficiency in one, renal insufficiency in one, suicide in one, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in two, SAH in one, and pneumonia after stroke in two). Therefore, the cause of death was stroke and late effects of stroke. Twelve symptomatic cerebrovascular events (cerebral infarction in seven, ICH in four, and SAH in one) occurred in ten patients. Consequently, annual risk of SAH after clipping of unruptured aneurysms was 0.085 %. Besides, annual risk of stroke in those patients was 1.06 %, and this incidence was higher than that in the general population. Although this study confirmed the good surgical result, annual risk of stroke after clipping of unruptured aneurysms was much higher than that in the general population. The long-term periodic examination to detect recurrent aneurysms and appropriate management to prevent stroke should be performed for patients with surgically treated unruptured aneurysm.

AB Hormone-refractory prostate cancer is one of the intractable human cancers in the world. Here, we examined the direct tumor-killing activity of inactivated Sendai virus particle [hemagglutinating virus of Japan envelope (HVJ-E)] through induction of Type I interferon (IFN) in the hormone-resistant human prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145. Preferential binding of HVJ-E to PC3 and DU145 over hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell and normal prostate epithelium was observed, resulting in a number of fused cells. After HVJ-E treatment, a number of IFN-related genes were up-regulated, resulting in Type I IFN production in PC3 cells. Then, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) helicase which activates Type I IFN expression after Sendai virus infection was up-regulated in cancer cells after HVJ-E treatment. Produced IFN-alpha and -beta enhanced caspase 8 expression via Janus kinases/Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription pathway, activated caspase 3 and induced apoptosis in cancer cells. When HVJ-E was directly injected into a mass of PC3 tumor cells in SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice, a marked reduction in the bulk of each tumor mass was observed and 85% of the mice became tumor-free. Although co-injection of an anti-asialo GMI antibody with HVJ-E into each tumor mass slightly attenuated the tumor suppressive activity of HVJ-E, significant suppression of tumor growth was observed even in the presence of anti-asialo GM1 antibody. This suggests that natural killer cell activation made small contribution to tumor regression following HVJ-E treatment in hormone-resistant prostate cancer model in vivo. Thus, HVJ-E effectively targets hormone-resistant prostate cancer by inducing apoptosis in tumor cells, as well as activating anti-tumor immunity. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to examine changes in working hours, shift work, psychological and physical job demands, job control and job insecurity in Taiwanese employees by gender and age during the period of 2001 to 2010. Methods: The study subjects were 36,750 men and 27,549 women, aged 25-64, from 4 rounds of cross-sectional surveys of representative employees. Psychosocial work conditions were assessed by a validated questionnaire. Results: Regression analyses with adjustment of education and employment grade showed that from 2001 to 2010, the proportions of workers with long working hours (>48 hours/week) (OR=1.4 in men and 1.5 in women) and workers with short working hours (<40 hours/week) (OR=1.3 in both genders) both increased over time, indicating an increasing polarization in the distribution of working hours. Furthermore, the proportions of nonstandard work shifts (OR=1.7 in men and 2.1 in women) and work with high physical demands (OR=1.5 for both gender) increased. There were signs of decreasing levels of job control from 2001 to 2007, which seemed to be more apparent in younger workers than in older workers. However, a slight recovery in decision latitude and opportunity for learning was noticed in later years. The trend in job insecurity was not linear, with the highest prevalence found in 2004. Conclusions: Our findings suggested that certain aspects of psychosocial work environment had deteriorated in Taiwan. There is a need to raise public awareness about the changing patterns of psychosocial health risks at work as well as their causes and their potential impacts on worker well-being.

AB "Are teachers at risk for psychiatric disorders? Stereotypes, physiology and perspectives of a job prevalently done by women". Background: Teachers are one of the so-called helping professions which are strongly exposed to the "Burnout syndrome". Nonetheless, public opinion is still convinced teachers enjoy a privileged status and physicians most often ignore psychiatric disorders following burnout due to teaching-related stress. Indeed, although France recently issued a suicide warning among teachers, and psychiatric diagnosis among this profession almost doubled in Japan in ten years, only few studies have been published on the subject in peer-reviewed journals. Objective and methods: The present study was carried out by administering a questionnaire to 1.295 teachers from ten different Italian regions aimed at evaluating teachers' conditions as well as their perception of work-related health risks. Results and conclusions: The outcome showed that teachers are mostly unaware of work-related health risks, they are discouraged by their employers, perceive union support as highly insufficient and feel under attack by the mass media as well as by the public. Further, any attempt by the head teacher to protect teacher's health - mandatory according to recent Italian legislation - is frequently misinterpreted as mobbing, due to the lack of appropriate legal knowledge. Interestingly, the study population believed that investigating the link between menopause and depressive disorders among teachers was extremely useful. In fact, over 82% of teachers are women with a median age of approximately 50. Social stress among women has in fact increased greatly given the triple role played by fifty-year old teachers (mother of adolescents, care-giver for elderly parents and teacher). Lastly, general practitioners and psychiatrists need to be educated on psychiatric disorders due to teaching-related stress in order to achieve a correct diagnosis and treatment.

AB Background: Growing evidence points to an association of daily light exposure and both mood and mood disorders. In recent studies, we demonstrated that higher illuminance of daytime may be positively associated with hyperthymic temperament while lower illuminance of daytime may be positively associated with cyclothymic temperament. However, it is not possible to determine whether hyperthymic or cyclothymic temperament induces higher or lower illuminance via heliotropism or non-heliotropism or whether higher or lower illuminance induces hyperthymic or cyclothymic temperament via light effects.
   Methods: In order to elucidate these questions, we sought to compare bipolar temperaments between residents who live in regions with varying levels of sunshine. Japan has 4 large islands -Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. Sapporo in Hokkaido and Oita in Kyushu located at 43 degrees and 33 degrees of latitude differ significantly in mean yearly sunshine. We investigated the data of 189 subjects (94 from Sapporo and 95 from Oita) including their data of Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-auto questionnaire version (TEMPS-A).
   Results: Multiple regression analyses revealed that latitude (Sapporo or Oita) effect predicted significant variance of hyperthymic temperament, but not of the other temperaments.
   Limitations: The limitation of the present study was that there was a small but significant difference in age between the subjects of Sapporo and those of Oita. Therefore, we included age in the multiple regression analysis. Second, there were several climate factors other than sunshine which were significantly different between Sapporo and Oita. We cannot exclude these effects completely. Finally, we did not consider other factors such as psychosocial factors which might have affected bipolar temperaments.
   Conclusions: The present findings suggest that relatively lower latitude (potentially via more sunshine) may induce hyperthymic temperament. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Little is known about the relationship between Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) and developmental problems, school life, employment, and mental problems. We aimed to clarify whether BMD is a risk factor for developmental disorders, problematic behavior, psychiatric diseases, and other social difficulties in school life and employment.
   Methods: Adults with genetically or immunohistochemically confirmed BMD from the Registry of Muscular Dystrophy in Japan (REM UDY) were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding patient history, school life, employment, and mental problems.
   Results: In total, 125 (68.3%) of 183 participants with BMD (median age, 37.2 years) completed the questionnaire. Of these, ten had developmental disorders (mental retardation, autism, and speech disturbance). Fifty-eight (44%) experienced bullying in school, and 39 felt the reason for bullying was physical handicap. Sixteen participants experienced problematic behavior such as cutting class, domestic violence, violent incidents, suicide attempts, or self-mutilation. Employment histories were noted by 92 (73%), of whom 15 could not continue to work due to physical handicaps. Fifteen participants had psychiatric disorders, with 5, 3 and I having neurosis, depression, and bipolar disorder, respectively. The other 6 participants with psychiatric disorders did not specify their diagnoses. Patients carrying a Dp140 expression change had significantly more incidences of developmental disorders, but not bullying, problematic behavior, workplace difficulties, or psychiatric disorders.
   Conclusions: Patients with BMD risk bullying and workplace difficulties, as well as developing psychiatric disorders. Parents, teachers, and supporters should be mindful of the daily environment of BMD patients and provide support to help them cope with stress. (C) 2017 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

AB Context. Sedation at the end of life, regardless of the nomenclature, is an increasingly debated practice at both clinical and bioethical levels. However, little is known about the characteristics and trends in scientific publications in this field of study.
   Objectives. This article presents a bibliometric analysis of the scientific publications on continuous sedation until death.
   Methods. Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO (R)) were searched for the indexed material published between 1945 and 2011. This search resulted in bibliographic data of 273 published outputs that were analyzed using bibliometric techniques.
   Results. Data revealed a trend of increased scientific publication from the early 1990s. Published outputs, diverse in type (comments/letters, articles, reviews, case reports, editorials), were widely distributed across 94 journals of varying scientific disciplines (medicine, nursing, palliative care, law, ethics). Most journals (72.3%) were classified under Medical and Health Sciences, with the Journal of Pain and Symptom Management identified as the major journal in the field covering 12.1% of the total publications. Empirical research articles, mostly of a quantitative design, originated from 17 countries. Although Japan and The Netherlands were found to be the leaders in research article productivity, it was the U.K. and the U.S. that ranked top in terms of the quantity of published outputs.
   Conclusion. This is the first bibliometric analysis on continuous sedation until death that can be used to inform future studies. Further research is needed to refine controversies on terminology and ethical acceptability of the practice, as well as conditions and modalities of its use.

AB Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor peficitinib versus placebo in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
   Methods In this multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase III study, patients with RA and inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) were randomised 1: 1: 1 to placebo, peficitinib 100 mg once daily or peficitinib 150 mg once daily with MTX for 52 weeks. Based on baseline randomisation, at week 12, non-responders receiving placebo were switched to peficitinib until the end of treatment; the remaining patients were switched to peficitinib at week 28. Primary efficacy variables were American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response rate at week 12/early termination (ET) and change from baseline in van der Heijde-modified total Sharp score (mTSS) at week 28/ET.
   Results 519 patients were randomised and treated. Significantly more (p<0.001) peficitinib (58.6%, 100 mg; 64.4%, 150 mg) than placebo (21.8%) recipients achieved ACR20 response at week 12/ET. Significantly lower (p<0.001) mean changes from baseline in mTSS at week 28/ET occurred in peficitinib (1.62, 100 mg; 1.03, 150 mg) than placebo (3.37) recipients. Peficitinib was associated with haematological and biochemical parameter changes, and increased incidence of serious infections and herpes zoster-related disease. One death from suicide occurred in a patient in the placebo group after switching to peficitinib 100 mg.
   Conclusions In Japanese patients with RA and inadequate response to MTX, peficitinib demonstrated significant superiority versus placebo in reducing RA symptoms and suppressing joint destruction. Peficitinib had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, with no new safety signals compared with other JAK inhibitors.

AB Background: Physicians' mental health may be adversely affected by the number of days of work and time spent on-call, and improved by sleep and days-off. The aim of this study was to determine the associations of depressive symptoms with taking days of off duty, hours of sleep, and the number of days of on-call and overnight work among physicians working in Japanese hospitals.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study as a national survey was conducted by mail. The study population was 10,000 randomly selected physicians working in hospitals who were also members of the Japan Medical Association (response rate 40.5%). Self-reported anonymous questionnaire was sent to assess the number of days off-duty, overnight work, and on-calls, and the average number of sleep hours on days not working overnight in the previous one month. Depressive state was determined by the Japanese version of the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the associations between depressive symptoms and the studied variables.
   Results: Among the respondents, 8.3% of men and 10.5% of women were determined to be depressed. For both men and women, depressive state was associated with having no off-duty days and averaging less than 5 hours of sleep on days not doing overnight work. Depressive state was positively associated with being on-call more than 5 days per month for men, and more than 8 days per month for women, and was negatively associated with being off-duty more than 8 days per month for men.
   Conclusion: Some physicians need some support to maintain their mental health. Physicians who do not take enough days-off, who reduced sleep hours, and who have certain number of days on-calls may develop depressive symptoms.

TI A Pharmacovigilance Approach for Post-Marketing in Japan Using the
   Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) Database and Association
   Analysis
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID RISK
AB Background
   Rapid dissemination of information regarding adverse drug reactions is a key aspect for improving pharmacovigilance. There is a possibility that unknown adverse drug reactions will become apparent through post-marketing administration. Currently, although there have been studies evaluating the relationships between a drug and adverse drug reactions using the JADER database which collects reported spontaneous adverse drug reactions, an efficient approach to assess the association between adverse drug reactions of drugs with the same indications as well as the influence of demographics (e.g. gender) has not been proposed.
   Methods and Findings
   We utilized the REAC and DEMO tables from the May 2015 version of JADER for patients taking antidepressant drugs (SSRI, SNRI, and NaSSA). We evaluated the associations using association analyses with an apriori algorithm. Support, confidence, lift, and conviction were used as indicators for associations. The highest score in adverse drug reactions for SSRI was obtained for "aspartate aminotransferase increased", "alanine aminotransferase increased", with values of 0.0059, 0.93, 135.5, and 13.9 for support, confidence, lift and conviction, respectively. For SNRI, "international normalized ratio increased", "drug interaction" were observed with 0.0064, 1.00, 71.9, and NA. For NaSSA, "anxiety", "irritability" were observed with 0.0058, 0.80, 49.9, and 4.9. For female taking SSRI, the highest support scores were observed in "twenties", "suicide attempt", whereas "thirties", "neuroleptic malignant syndrome" were observed for male. Second, for SNRI, "eighties", "inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion" were observed for female, whereas "interstitial lung disease" and "hepatitis fulminant" were for male. Finally, for NaSSA, "suicidal ideation" was for female, and "rhabdomyolysis" was for male.
   Conclusions
   Different combinations of adverse drug reactions were noted between the antidepressants. In addition, the reported adverse drug reactions differed by gender. This approach using a large database for examining the associations can improve safety monitoring during the post-marketing phase.

ID JAPAN; USERS; RISK
AB Introduction and Aims. As a consequence of the methamphetamine epidemic in Thailand, the occurrence of methamphetamine psychosis (MAP) dramatically increased. This study aimed to examine the long-term outcomes of MAP patients following their first presentation to a psychiatric hospital. Design and Methods. Methamphetamine psychosis patients who were first hospitalised in Suan Prung psychiatric hospital Thailand in 2000-2001 were identified through a review of the hospital database. Eligible participants were scheduled for visits by trained field researchers in 2007. For those giving consent, a structured face-to-face interview was conducted. Outcomes were collected from both medical records and interviews. Results. A total of 1116 participants were included in the study. Ninety-two (8.2%) participants had died from suicide, accident or AIDS. Due to relocation, only 449 (40.2%) individuals were interviewed. Most of the participants were male (90.6%) with a mean age of 33.3 years (SD = 8.0). The medical records showed that 263 had revisited the hospital in the interim. Of those, 39.2% were re-hospitalised and 38% were given a diagnosis of schizophrenia due to persistent psychosis. The outreach interview found that more than half (55.7%) had experienced psychosis relapse. Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview revealed the following current conditions: psychotic disorders (15.8%), alcohol use disorders (52.1%) and suicidality (22.3%). Participants who did not have a diagnosis of current methamphetamine abuse could be divided into those with a single episode psychosis (52.6%) and those with chronic course of psychosis (38.8%). Discussion and Conclusions. Individuals with MAP are likely to have poor outcomes, in terms of premature death, several relapses of psychotic symptoms, chronic psychotic manifestation, and very rates of alcohol use disorder and suicidality. Therefore, those individuals with MAP require long-term monitoring and psychiatric care. [Kittirattanapaiboon P, Mahatnirunkul S, Booncharoen H, Thummawomg P, Dumrongchai U, Chutha W.

TI The changing gender differences in life expectancy in Korea 1970-2005

AB Women live much longer than men in Korea, with remarkable gains in life expectancy at birth for the past decades. The gender differential has steadily increased over time, reaching a peak of more than 8 years in 19805, and decreased thereafter to 6.7 years in 2005. Studies to investigate the pattern and contributing factors to changes in the life expectancy gender gap have been mostly from Western countries, and there has been no such study in Asian countries, except in Japan. We therefore aimed to examine age- and cause-specific contributions to the changing gender differentials in life expectancy in Korea, in particular the decline of the gap, using a decomposition method. Between 1970 and 1979 when the gender gap in life expectancy widened, faster mortality decline among women in ages 20-44 explained 66% of the total increase in the gender gap, which would be due to substantial improvements in reproductive health among women and excess male mortality in occupational injuries and transport accidents. Although greater survival advantage among elderly women over 70 contributed to further increase in the gender gap, the contributions from younger ages with the ages 15-64 contributing the most (-2 years) resulted in the overall reduction of the gender gap which began in 1992 and continued to 2005. Among causes of death, liver diseases (-0.5 years, 38% of the total decline), transport accidents (-0.4 years, 31%), hypertensive diseases (-0.3 years, 19%), stroke (-0.1 years, 11%), and tuberculosis (-0.1 years) contributed the most to the overall 1.4 years reduction in the gender gap. However, changes in mortality from lung cancer (+0.3 years), suicide (+0.3 years), chronic lower respiratory diseases (+0.2 years), and ischemic heart diseases (+0.1 years) contributed to widening the gap during the same period. In sum, while smoking-related causes of death have contributed most to the narrowing gap in most other industrialized countries, these causes contributed toward increasing the gender gap in Korea. Instead, liver disease, hypertension-related diseases, and transport accidents were major contributing causes of death to the narrowing of gender differentials in life expectancy in Korea.

AB Background: Patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital with suicidal behavior (SB) are considered to be especially at high risk of suicide. However, the number of studies that have addressed this patient population remains insufficient compared to that of studies on suicidal patients in emergency or medical settings. The purpose of this study is to seek features of a sample of newly admitted suicidal psychiatric patients in a metropolitan area of Japan.
   Method: 155 suicidal patients consecutively admitted to a large psychiatric center during a 20-month period, admission styles of whom were mostly involuntary, were assessed using Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV Axis I and II Disorders (SCID-I CV and SCID-II) and SB-related psychiatric measures. Associations of the psychiatric diagnoses and SB-related characteristics with gender and age were examined.
   Results: The common DSM-IV axis I diagnoses were affective disorders 62%, anxiety disorders 56% and substance-related disorders 38%. 56% of the subjects were diagnosed as having borderline PD, and 87% of them, at least one type of personality disorder (PD). SB methods used prior to admission were self-cutting 41%, overdosing 32%, self-strangulation 15%, jumping from a height 12% and attempting traffic death 10%, the first two of which were frequent among young females. The median (range) of the total number of SBs in the lifetime history was 7 (1-141). Severity of depressive symptomatology, suicidal intent and other symptoms, proportions of the subjects who reported SB-preceding life events and life problems, and childhood and adolescent abuse were comparable to those of the previous studies conducted in medical or emergency service settings. Gender and age-relevant life-problems and life events were identified.
   Conclusions: Features of the studied sample were the high prevalence of affective disorders, anxiety disorders and borderline PD, a variety of SB methods used prior to admission and frequent SB repetition in the lifetime history. Gender and age appeared to have an influence on SB method selection and SB-preceding processes. The findings have important implications for assessment and treatment of psychiatric suicidal patients.

   murder; cannibalism; Sorok island
AB The purpose of this research is to describe how Hansen's disease patients experienced the modem system of control of Hansen's disease introduced by Japan, and the inimical attitude of society against them in colonial Korea. The study also seeks to reveal the development of the system to eliminate Hansen's disease patients from their home and community to larger society and leprosarium in this era. Sorokdo Charity hospital (SCH), a hospital for Hansen's disease patients, was built in 1916, and vagrant Hansen's disease patients began to be isolated in this hospital beginning in 1917 by the Japanese Government-General of Korea (JGGK). Once the police detained and sent vagrant. Hansen's disease patients to SCH, stigma and discrimination against them strengthened in Korean society.
   Because of strong stigma and discrimination in Korean society, Hansen's disease patients suffered from daily threats of death. First, their family members were not only afraid of the contagiousness of Hansen's disease but also the stigma and discrimination against themselves by community members. If a family had a Hansen's disease patient, the rest of community members would discriminate against the entire family. Furthermore, because Hansen's disease patients were excluded from any economic livelihood such as getting a job, the existence of the patients was a big burden for their families.
   Therefore, many patients left their homes and began their vagrancy. The patients who could not leave their homes committed suicide or were killed by their family members. The victims of such deaths were usually women, who were at the lower position in the family hierarchy. In the strong Confucian society in Korea, more female patients were killed by themselves than male patients. Moreover, all of patients victims in the murder were women. This shows that the stigma and discrimination against Hansen's disease patients within their families were stronger against women than men.
   Strong stigma and discrimination made the patients rely on superstition such as cannibalism. Patients believed that there were not any effective medicine. There were a few reports of patients who were cured, and many were treated with chaulmoogra oil in the modern Hansen's disease hospitals. Eating human flesh was known as a folk remedy for Hansen's disease. As such, patients began to kill healthy people, usually children, to eat their flesh. Increased stigma led to increased victims.
   Hansen's disease patients who left their homes faced many threats during their vagrancy. For survival, they established their own organizations in the late 1920's. The patients who were rejected to be hospitalized in the Western Hansen's disease hospital at Busan, Daegu, and Yeosu organized self-help organizations. The purpose of these organizations was first to secure the medicine supply of chaulmoogra oil. However, as stigma and discrimination strengthened, these organizations formed by Hansen's disease patients demanded the Japanese Government-General of Korea to send and segregate them on Sorok island. They did not know the situation of the inside of this island because news media described it as a haven for patients, and very few patients were discharged from this island to tell the truth.
   On this island, several hundreds of patients were killed by compulsory heavy labor, starvation, and violence. They were not treated as patients, but as something to be eliminated. Under strong suppression on this island, the patients resisted first by escaping this island. However, in 1937, some patients tried to kill a Korean staff but failed. Attempted murderers were all put in the jail, also located on this island. In 1941, a patient murdered another patient who had harassed other patients, and in 1942, Chunsang Lee, a patient, killed the director of Sorok island. These instances show that there was a system to eliminate Hansen's disease patients in colonial Korea.

AB Objectives: To collate data from multiple obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) treatment centers across seven countries and five continents, and to report findings in relation to OCD comorbidity, age of onset of OCD and comorbid disorders, and suicidality, in a large clinical and ethnically diverse sample, with the aim of investigating cultural variation and the utility of the psychiatric diagnostic classification of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.
   Methods: Researchers in the field of OCD were invited to contribute summary statistics on current and lifetime psychiatric comorbidity, age of onset of OCD and comorbid disorders and suicidality in their patients with OCD.
   Results: Data from 3711 adult patients with primary OCD came from Brazil (n = 955), India (n = 802), Italy (n = 750), South Africa (n = 565), Japan (n = 322), Australia (n = 219), and Spain (n = 98). The most common current comorbid disorders were major depressive disorder (28.4%; n = 1055), obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (24.5%, n = 478), generalized anxiety disorder (19.3%, n = 716), specific phobia (19.2%, n = 714) and social phobia (18.5%, n = 686). Major depression was also the most commonly co-occurring lifetime diagnosis, with a rate of 50.5% (n = 1874). OCD generally had an age of onset in late adolescence (mean = 17.9 years, SD = 1.9). Social phobia, specific phobia and body dysmorphic disorder also had an early age of onset. Co-occurring major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and psychotic disorders tended to have a later age of onset than OCD. Suicidal ideation within the last month was reported by 6.4% (n = 200) of patients with OCD and 9.0% (n = 314) reported a lifetime history of suicide attempt.
   Conclusions: In this large cross-continental study, comorbidity in OCD was common. The high rates of comorbid major depression and anxiety disorders emphasize the need for clinicians to assess and monitor for these disorders. Earlier ages of onset of OCD, specific phobia and social phobia may indicate some relatedness between these disorders, but this requires further study. Although there do not appear to be significant cultural variations in rates or patterns of comorbidity and suicidality, further research using similar recruitment strategies and controlling for demographic and clinical variables may help to determine whether any sociocultural factors protect against suicidal ideation or psychiatric comorbidity in patients with OCD.

AB BackgroundPerinatal mental health problems such as mood disorders are common. We propose a new multidisciplinary health service intervention program providing continuous support to women and their children from the start of pregnancy till after childbirth. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the program with respect to making women's mental health better in the postpartum period and improving the state of care for women and their children in the perinatal period.MethodsWe performed a controlled study to investigate the effectiveness of the program in Suzaka City, Japan. The women's mental health status was assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) 3months postpartum. Of 349 women, 210 were allocated to the intervention group and 139 to the control group. From April 2014 to March 2015, the number of the pregnant women who were followed-up by the multidisciplinary meeting in the intervention and control groups were 60 and 4, respectively. In the same period, the number of the pregnant women who were identified as requiring intensive care were 21 and 2, respectively.ResultsThe total EPDS score, which was the primary outcome of the present study, differed significantly between the intervention and control groups (Mean [SD] = 2.74 (2.89) and 4.58 [2.62], respectively; p<0.001). The number of the women receiving counseling from a public health nurse (5.3% in intervention group, 0.7% in control group, p=0.02), attending maternal seminars (attendant ratio: 46% whereas 16%, p=0.01), and receiving home visits by public health nurses (home visit ratio: 93.8% whereas 82.6%, p<0.001) was significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the control group.ConclusionsThe present study indicates that continuum support provided by integrated mental health care through a multidisciplinary maternal and child health service in the community can make women's mental health better in the postpartum period and help women and their children receive more health services from public health nurses.Trial registrationName of registry: Research for the effectiveness of a multi-professional health service intervention program of continuum supports for mother and child which starts for pregnancy periods to enhance maternal mental health.UMIN Clinical Trials Registry number: UMIN000032424.Registration date: April 29th, 2018.Registration timing: retrospective.

AB The Study Model for Future Occupational Health (funded by a research grant from the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Labor) is a joint research project involving various organizations and agencies undertaken from 2002 to 2004. Society has undergone a dramatic transformation due to technological developments and internationalization. At the same time a low birth rate and an aging population have resulted in an increase in both the percentage of workers experiencing strong anxiety and stress in relation to their jobs and the working environment and the number of suicides. As a natural consequence, occupational health services are now expected to provide EAP, consulting and other functions that were formerly considered outside the realm of occupational health. In consideration of this background, the present study propose the following issues to provide a model for future occupational health services that meet the conditions presently confronted by each worker. 1. How to provide occupational health services and occupational physicians' services: 1) a basic time of 20 minutes of occupational health services per year should be allotted to each worker and to all workers; 2) the obligatory regulations should be revised to expand the obligation from businesses each with 50 or more employees under the present laws to businesses each with 30 or more employees. 2. Providers of occupational health services and occupational physicians' services: (1) reinforcement of outside occupational health agencies; (2) fostering occupational health consultant firms; (3) development of an institute of occupational safety and health; (4) support of activities by authorized occupational physicians in the field; (5) expanding of joint selection of occupational physicians including subsidy increase and the extension of a period of subsidy to five hears; (6) licensing of new entry into occupational health undertaking. 3. Introduction of new report system: (1) establishment of the obligation to submit reports on risk evaluation and improvement measures; (2) establishment of the obligation to prepare a report on results of medical examinations in all sizes of businesses. 4. Introduction of a merit system into businesses in establishment of a new system: the application of the special merit system of the workers' compensation insurance shall be revised to add occupational health activities, cover business with 20 or more to 100 or less employees and expand the period of application for three years under the present laws to five years. 5. Ensuring of international coordination: harmonization of standards of individual countries for occupational health and safety; thorough (1) ensuring of international agreement on high-level specialist qualifications; (2) mutual recognition of qualifications of occupational physician, nurse, occupational hygienist, ergonomist, and counselor; (3) preparation of guidelines for occupations relating to occupational health businesses.

TI Varenicline A Novel Pharmacotherapy for Smoking Cessation
SO DRUGS

   CONTROLLED TRIAL; IN-VIVO; PLACEBO; ALPHA-4-BETA-2; THERAPY
AB Varenicline is an orally administered small molecule with partial agonist activity at the alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Varenicline was approved by both the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency of the EU in 2006 as an aid to smoking cessation. Subsequently, varenicline has been approved in over 80 other countries.
   Varenicline is almost entirely absorbed following oral administration, and absorption is unaffected by food, smoking or the time of day. Varenicline undergoes only minimal metabolism and approximately 90% of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged. Varenicline has a mean elimination half-life after repeated administration of approximately 24 hours in smokers. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve is increased in patients with moderate or severe renal failure. No clinically relevant varenicline-drug interactions have been identified.
   In two identical, randomized, double-blind, phase III clinical trials in healthy, motivated-to-quit, mainly Caucasian smokers aged 18-75 years in the US, 12 weeks of treatment with varenicline I mg twice daily was associated with significantly higher abstinence rates over weeks 9-12 than sustained-release bupropion 150mg twice daily or placebo. In a separate phase III trial, an additional 12 weeks of treatment in smokers achieving abstinence in the first 12 weeks was associated with greater abstinence through to week 52 than placebo treatment. Varenicline treatment was also associated with significantly higher rates of abstinence than placebo treatment in randomized, double-blind, clinical trials in smokers in China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. In a randomized, open-label, multi-national, phase III trial, varenicline treatment was associated with a significantly higher rate of abstinence than transdermal nicotine-replacement therapy. In these trials, varenicline treatment was associated with lower urge to smoke and satisfaction from smoking in relapsers than placebo or active comparators.
   In the two US phase III trials, 12 weeks of treatment with varenicline I mg twice daily had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. Nausea and abnormal dreams were the most common adverse events that occurred in more varenicline than placebo recipients. The incidence and prevalence of nausea were greatest in weeks I and 2 of treatment, and declined thereafter. The prevalence of early adverse effects can be reduced by individual dose titration. Adverse events associated with varenicline therapy have been reported in post-marketing surveillance, including neuropsychiatric events such as depressed mood, agitation, changes in behaviour, suicidal ideation and suicide. Currently, it is unclear whether the association of varenicline therapy with these adverse events is causal, coincidental or related to smoking cessation.
   Given the greater efficacy of varenicline compared with other pharmacotherapies, and the high risk of morbidity and mortality associated with continued smoking, varenicline is a valuable pharmacological aid to smoking cessation.

AB Background Efforts to establish the 2015 baseline and monitor early implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) highlight both great potential for and threats to improving health by 2030. To fully deliver on the SDG aim of "leaving no one behind", it is increasingly important to examine the health-related SDGs beyond national-level estimates. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017), we measured progress on 41 of 52 health -related SDG indicators and estimated the health-related SDG index for 195 countries and territories for the period 1990-2017, projected indicators to 2030, and analysed global attainment.
   Methods We measured progress on 41 health-related S DG indicators from 1990 to 2017, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2016 (new indicators were health worker density, sexual violence by non-intimate partners, population census status, and prevalence of physical and sexual violence [reported separately]). We also improved the measurement of several previously reported indicators. We constructed national-level estimates and, for a subset of health-related SDGs, examined indicator-level differences by sex and Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintile. We also did subnational assessments of performance for selected countries. To construct the health related SDG index, we transformed the value for each indicator on a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the 2.5th percentile and 100 as the 97.5th percentile of 1000 draws calculated from 1990 to 2030, and took the geometric mean of the scaled indicators by target. To generate projections through 2030, we used a forecasting framework that drew estimates from the broader GBD study and used weighted averages of indicator-specific and country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2017 to inform future estimates. We assessed attainment of indicators with defined targets in two ways: first, using mean values projected for 2030, and then using the probability of attainment in 2030 calculated from 1000 draws. We also did a global attainment analysis of the feasibility of attaining SDG targets on the basis of past trends. Using 2015 global averages of indicators with defined SDG targets, we calculated the global annualised rates of change required from 2015 to 2030 to meet these targets, and then identified in what percentiles the required global annualised rates of change fell in the distribution of country-level rates of change from 1990 to 2015. We took the mean of these global percentile values across indicators and applied the past rate of change at this mean global percentile to all health-related SDG indicators, irrespective of target definition, to estimate the equivalent 2030 global average value and percentage change from 2015 to 2030 for each indicator.
   Findings The global median health-related SDG index in 2017 was 59.4 (IQR 35.4-67.3), ranging from a low of 11.6 (95% uncertainty interval 9.6-14.0) to a high of 84.9 (83.1-86.7). SDG index values in countries assessed at the subnational level varied substantially particularly in China and India, although scores in Japan and the UK were more homogeneous. Indicators also varied by SDI quintile and sex, with males having worse outcomes than females for non-communicable disease (NCD) mortality, alcohol use, and smoking, among others. Most countries were projected to have a higher health-related SDG index in 2030 than in 2017, while country-level probabilities of attainment by 2030 varied widely by indicator. Under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and malaria indicators had the most countries with at least 95% probability of target attainment. Other indicators, including NCD mortality and suicide mortality, had no countries projected to meet corresponding SDG targets on the basis of projected mean values for 2030 but showed some probability of attaimnent by 2030. For some indicators, including child malnutrition, several infectious diseases, and most violence measures, the annualised rates of change required to meet SDG targets far exceeded the pace of progress achieved by any country in the recent past. We found that applying the mean global annualised rate of change to indicators without defined targets would equate to about 19% and 22% reductions in global smoking and alcohol consumption, respectively; a 47% decline in adolescent birth rates; and a more than 85% increase in health worker density per 1000 population by 2030.
   Interpretation The GBD study offers a unique, robust platform for monitoring the health -related SDGs across demographic and geographic dimensions. Our findings underscore the importance of increased collection and analysis of disaggregated data and highlight where more deliberate design or targeting of interventions could accelerate progress in attaining the SDGs. Current projections show that many health -related SDG indicators, NCDs, NCD-related risks, and violence -related indicators will require a concerted shift away from what might have driven past gains curative interventions in the case of NCDs towards multisectoral, prevention -oriented policy action and investments to achieve SDG aims. Notably, several targets, if they are to be met by 2030, demand a pace of progress that no country has achieved in the recent past. The future is fundamentally uncertain, and no model can fully predict what breakthroughs or events might alter the course of the S DGs. What is clear is that our actions or inaction today will ultimately dictate how close the world, collectively, can get to leaving no one behind by 2030.

AB Background Blonanserin transdermal patch therapy is now available in Japan for the treatment of schizophrenia and may provide several advantages over the tablet formulation. Objective The aim was to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of blonanserin transdermal patches in Japanese patients with schizophrenia. Methods An open-label study was conducted in adults with schizophrenia at 37 sites in Japan. Patients were enrolled in either cohort 1 or 2. Patients in cohort 1 received 8-16 mg/day blonanserin tablets for 6 weeks and then 40-80 mg/day blonanserin patches for 52 weeks. The dose of blonanserin patches was determined according to the dose of the tablets. In cohort 2, every patient started from 40 mg/day and then 40-80 mg/day blonanserin transdermal patches for 52 weeks. Both cohorts had 1-2 weeks of follow-up. Safety endpoints included the incidence of adverse events (AEs), treatment-related AEs, extrapyramidal AEs [also assessed using the change in Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS) score], the use of any concomitant antiparkinsonian drugs, and skin-related AEs, including skin irritation. Patients also underwent assessment of laboratory values including for serum prolactin concentration, vital signs, body weight, electrocardiographic (ECG) changes, and the corrected QT (QTc) interval. Suicidal ideation was assessed via the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) score. Efficacy was assessed via duration of blonanserin transdermal patch treatment, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total and subscale scores, and Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scores. Other endpoints included total Drug Attitude Inventory 10 (DAI-10) scores, EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) effect values, and a patient questionnaire about the dosage form. Results A total of 223 patients with consents, 117 in cohort 1 and 106 in cohort 2 were included in the study. Of the 117 patients in cohort 1, 108 were treated with blonanserin tablets, and 97 received blonanserin patches and were included in the safety analysis set. In cohort 2, 103 of the 106 patients were treated with blonanserin transdermal patches and were included in the safety analysis set. In total, 91 patients were male (45.5%). The mean age was 43.8 years. Discontinuation occurred in 40 patients (41.2%) in cohort 1 and 44 patients (42.7%) in cohort 2. Discontinuation resulted from AEs in 18.6% (cohort 1) and 11.7% (cohort 2) and from withdrawal of consent in 13.4% (cohort 1) and 20.4% (cohort 2), and seven patients overall discontinued due to skin reactions. AEs were reported in 174 patients (87.0%), and 13 serious AEs occurred in 12 patients (6.0%), of which six patients were in cohort 1 and six patients were in cohort 2. Serious AEs were six schizophrenia (n = 6) and seven other AEs (n = 6), which included impulse-control disorder, fracture, epistaxis, asthma, pneumonia aspiration, pneumonia hemophilus, and pneumonia. The most common AEs were nasopharyngitis (n = 62, 31.0%), application site erythema (n = 45, 22.5%), application site pruritus (n = 23, 11.5%), and akathisia (n = 20, 10.0%). AE incidence was similar in cohort 1 (84.5%) and cohort 2 (89.3%). Extrapyramidal and skin-related AEs were reported in 51 patients (25.5%) and 83 patients (41.5%), respectively. None of these AEs were serious. The mean change from baseline in total DIEPSS score at Week 52 {last observation carried forward [LOCF] (standard deviation [SD])} was -0.1 (1.55), indicating no marked effect.
   In terms of concomitant medications used in cohort 1 and cohort 2, 33.0% (32/97) and 22.3% (23/103) used antiparkinsonian drugs, respectively. The majority of skin-related AEs occurred early in treatment and were appropriately managed with topical therapies. Of the patients who answered "No" to all C-SSRS categories at baseline (n = 129), 13 patients (10.1%) were evaluated as having emergence of suicidal ideation. Among patients who answered "No" to all C-SSRS suicidal behavior categories at baseline (n = 172), one (0.6%) was evaluated as having suicidal behavior during blonanserin transdermal patch treatment. There were no clinically significant changes in laboratory tests or examinations, including prolactin level, vital signs, body weight, ECG, metabolism-related parameters, and QTc interval. The mean (SD) change in body weight was - 0.04 (4.561) kg and - 0.67 (6.841) kg in cohort 1 and cohort 2, respectively. The mean changes from baseline in PANSS total score at Week 52 (LOCF [SD]) were - 0.1 [11.6] and - 3.4 [15.3] in cohort 1 and 2, respectively. PANSS scores did not change after switching from tablet to patch formulation in cohort 1 and decreased over the 52 weeks of treatment with the blonanserin patches. The mean change from baseline in CGI-S score at Week 52 (LOCF [SD]) was - 0.2 [1.03] in both cohorts combined. After 52 weeks of blonanserin patch treatment, the total DAI-10 score increased or remained unchanged compared with baseline in 82 of the 129 patients (63.6%) for whom these data were available. In the intention-to-treat population of the combined cohorts (n = 200), the mean (SD) change from baseline in EQ-5D score at the last assessment was - 0.0365 (0.17603). Patients' attitudes to the blonanserin transdermal patches were generally positive. Conclusions Blonanserin transdermal patches are safe and effective in the long-term treatment of schizophrenia.
