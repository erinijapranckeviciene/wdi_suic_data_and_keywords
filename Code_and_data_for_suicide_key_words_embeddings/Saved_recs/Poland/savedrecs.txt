DE Suicides in Poland; Social Problems; Social Work
AB According to police statistics in 2013 in Poland there has been a sharp increase in the number of suicides among men, compared to previous years and to the number of suicides among women. Unfortunately, this trend continues to grow each year. Hence the idea of the article is to present problem and to shed some light on the phenomenon and try to characterise it, referencing the statistics and academic studies of suicides.

TI Forty years of increasing suicide mortality in Poland: Undercounting

AB Background: Suicide rate trends for Poland, one of the most populous countries in Europe, are not well documented. Moreover, the quality of the official Polish suicide statistics is unknown and requires in-depth investigation.
   Methods: Population and mortality data disaggregated by sex, age, manner, and cause were obtained from the Polish Central Statistics Office for the period 1970-2009. Suicides and deaths categorized as 'undetermined injury intent,' 'unknown causes,' and 'unintentional poisonings' were analyzed to estimate the reliability and sensitivity of suicide certification in Poland over three periods covered by ICD-8, ICD-9 and ICD-10, respectively. Time trends were assessed by the Spearman test for trend.
   Results: The official suicide rate increased by 51.3% in Poland between 1970 and 2009. There was an increasing excess suicide rate for males, culminating in a male-to-female ratio of 7:1. The dominant method, hanging, comprised 90% of all suicides by 2009. Factoring in deaths of undetermined intent only, estimated sensitivity of suicide certification was 77% overall, but lower for females than males. Not increasing linearly with age, the suicide rate peaked at ages 40-54 years.
   Conclusion: The suicide rate is increasing in Poland, which calls for a national prevention initiative. Hangings are the predominant suicide method based on official registration. However, suicide among females appears grossly underestimated given their lower estimated sensitivity of suicide certification, greater use of "soft" suicide methods, and the very high 7: 1 male-to-female rate ratio. Changes in the ICD classification system resulted in a temporary suicide data blackout in 1980-1982, and significant modifications of the death categories of senility and unknown causes, after 1997, suggest the need for data quality surveillance.

AB Background: Literature demonstrates that analysis of internet search data is a useful tool in predicting the occurrence of illnesses and health-related behaviors. The aim of the study was to quantitatively present the trends in Google searches for the keyword "suicide" and to analyze its correlation with the number of suicides in Poland.
   Subjects and methods: We used the Google Trends tool to compile data for years 2004-2016. Statistical analysis was performed for annual, monthly, daily and hourly data. Official data on suicide in Poland were obtained from the Central Statistical Office and the General Police Headquarters of Poland.
   Results: A gradual decrease in Google Relative Search Volume of the keyword "suicide" was observed in years 2004-2014, despite the significant increase of suicide rate in Poland (R=-0.24). Reverse correlation was also found between regional suicide coefficients and search volume (R=-0.22). The highest search volumes were recorded in winter months, first days of the week and at night hours (p<0.001).
   Conclusions: Presented results may contribute to more effective suicide prevention programs. By specifying the time intervals in which searching suicide information is the highest, it will become easier get to individuals at risk.

AB The increasing quality of life of modern man should go hand-in-hand with reducing the scale of the problem of attempted suicides. During the last 55 years, the World Health Organization has recorded an increase in the number of suicides by about 60% in the developed and developing countries. In Poland, the highest rate of suicides have been committed by males, and the circumstances depended on gender, age and socio-economic factors. The aim of the presented study is to present the scale of the problem and present results of the analysis of the phenomenon of attempted suicides in 19782010, with particular emphasis on a Polish agricultural region - the Lublin Province in eastern Poland. 167,557 attempted suicides were analyzed across the country, included suicide attempts that resulted in death. Brief description of the state of knowledge and summary: Between 1978-2010 in Poland, the number of attempted suicides was higher in urban than in rural areas, especially among men aged between 31-50 years, while the tendency to commit suicide increased in rural areas in comparison to urban areas. Women usually represented a quarter of the people who attempted or committed suicide, with the majority cases reported in 2002. Most attempted suicides were carried out in the cities, but since 1990, the number of attempted suicides in the country is growing by an average of 8 per annum. In the Lublin Province, far more people are attempting to commit suicide in the rural areas. Despite the trend of increasing numbers of attempted suicides (about 4.36 suicides per year), the number of fatal suicides is decreasing, and the number of suicides committed by teenagers under 14 years of age is decreasing more dynamically.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial distribution of Eastern European suicide mortality both before and at the end of the Communist period, as well as the changes that occurred during this period.
   Regional data on suicide mortality were collected from Czarist "European Russia" in 1910 and from the corresponding area in 1989. The distribution of suicide mortality was mapped at both points in time. Regional continuity over time was further studied with the help of geographical units specially constructed for this purpose.
   In 1910, suicide mortality was found to be high in the northern Baltic provinces, in the urban parts of north and central Russia, the more urbanized parts of northern and western Poland, in east Ukraine, and in the northern Caucasus, while suicide rates were generally low in south Russia, Dagestan, and in southern Poland. In 1989, suicide mortality was highest in the Urals, the east Russian "ethnic" areas, and in southeast Russia. The rates were low in Poland, Moldavia, and in most of the northern Caucasus. The across-time analysis using specially constructed comparison units showed that the spatial distributions of suicide mortality in 19 10 and 1989 were not correlated with each other. Additional analyses pointed to a short-term consistency of regional patterns both in the 1900s-1920s and the 1980S-1990s.
   The lack of regional continuity in suicide mortality in the area may imply an absence of strong and continuous regional cultures, or a strong influence of other factors, such as societal modernization, on suicide mortality. Suicide as an act changed its social nature during the Communist period, becoming more normal, and more equally distributed among social classes and geographical locations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

ID SUGGESTION
AB Amid the acrimonious debates over national identity, the proper political solution to the "Jewish Question," and linguistic primacy, the Jews of interwar Poland were also gripped by panic over rising rates of suicide. Observers claimed that there was an epidemic of self-destruction due to financial woes and the loosening of gender roles. Yet despite persistent poverty, rates of suicide among Jews in Poland still remained low compared to those seen among their Catholic neighbors and other European populations. The phenomenon of suicide loomed large in the Jewish psyche nonetheless, as it had previously been uncommon in this population, and the new trend was perceived as a physical manifestation of the social disintegration of all forms of Jewish civilization. The press fed Jews' fears by publishing morbid details in the hopes of boosting readership. Efforts to stem self-destruction, however, lacked focus and served primarily as a platform to express concern with the increasingly diffuse and heterogeneous nature of Jewish society in Poland.

AB Aim. The presented suicide seasonality analysis based on the Main Statistical Office general Polish population data is the first to deal with this problem in our country. An answer was sought to two research questions: whether the phenomenon of suicide seasonality occurs in Poland, and if so, whether there are any age- and gender-related differences in the seasonality pattern. Moreover, the obtained results were compared with seasonality patterns reported in other countries.
   Method. Statistical analyses were performed using the Demetra v.2.04. programme. The total of 29,232 cases of suicidal death registered in Poland in the years 1999-2003 were analysed.
   Results. In the study, a stable seasonality of suicides was found in three groups: in the general Polish population, in the 40-44 age group irrespective of gender, and in males aged 40-44. A stable seasonality pattern was confirmed to exist in the period under study, with a peak in the spring-summer time and a clear decline in winter. No stable seasonality of suicide was found in women.
   Conclusions. The findings are concordant with a majority of these reported in studies of this type in other countries. The obtained results can be used in the future to assess changes in the suicide seasonality amplitude in Poland over time. Moreover, it seems worthwhile to corroborate the observation made by other authors that seasonality is modified mainly by violent suicides

AB Aims: Acute alcohol intoxication itself may act as a trigger for suicidal thoughts and attempts among individuals at risk and may influence the potential lethality of the suicide attempt. This study in alcohol-dependent patients compared the correlates of suicide attempts during a heavy drinking episode with those of suicide attempts during relative sobriety. Methods: In two outpatient and two residential alcohol treatment programs in Warsaw, Poland, 113 patients who reported a suicide attempt during their lifetime were interviewed. The analyses focused on the patients' most serious suicide attempts and on whether these occurred during a heavy drinking episode. Results: Over two-thirds of the patients reported that their most serious suicide attempt occurred during a period of heavy drinking. A multivariable logistic model indicated that the following factors significantly distinguished those patients whose most serious suicide attempt occurred during a heavy drinking episode: male gender, younger current age, greater severity of alcohol dependence and the attempt being unplanned. Conclusion: Among the patients in treatment for alcohol dependence who made a suicide attempt, the most serious attempt was likely to have been unplanned and committed by men when it occurred during a heavy drinking episode.

AB Aim. The aim of the paper was to: (1) present economic, socio-demographic and other indicators related to suicide, useful from the perspective of social integration theory, and (2) identify new indicators of special importance to contemporary Poland.
   Method. A narrative literature review on the sociological approach to suicide was undertaken by searching MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, Google Scholar databases using the following key words: suicide, suicide risk factors, Durkheim 's theory of suicide, integration and disintegration of society, sociodemographic factors, economic factors, religion, and the time descriptors: 2000-2017.
   Results. Suicide risk was analyzed in relation to: family integration (including the rates of divorce, marriage, fertility, and women's participation in the labour market); economy (including the unemployment rate, gross domestic product per capita, Gini social inequality index, and social welfare indicators); social issues (including the indicators of the healthcare system quality, the rates of alcohol consumption per capita and migration); religion (including the parameters of conventional religiosity, Gallup index, and percentage of religious books). The issues relevant for Poland were addressed while discussing Balanced Development Index in economic aspect, and dominicantes and communicantes rates in religious aspect.
   Conclusions. This literature review may be useful in the assessment of suicide risk when designing suicide prevention programs and for mental health clinicians in their daily practice.

AB Introduction. External causes of death are the third most common causes of death, after cardiovascular diseases and malignant neoplasms, in inhabitants of Poland. External causes of death pose the greatest threat to people aged 5-44, which results in a great number of years of life lost.
   Objective. The aim of the study is the analysis of years of life lost due to external causes of death among rural inhabitants in Poland, particularly due to traffic accidents and suicides.
   Material and methods. The study material included a database created on the basis of 2,100,785 certificates of rural inhabitants in Poland in the period 1999-2012. The SEYLLp (Standard Expected Years of Life Lost per living person) and the SEYLLd (per death) indices were used to determine years of life lost due to external causes of death. Joinpoint models were used to analyze time trends.
   Results. In the period 1999-2012, 151,037 rural inhabitants died due to external causes, including 27.2% due to traffic accidents and 25.2% due to suicides. In 2012, the SEYLLp was 1,817 per 100,000 males and 298 per 100,000 females. Among males, suicides (SEYLLp = 633 years per 100,000) and traffic accidents (SEYLLp = 473 years per 100,000) contributed to the largest number of years of life lost. Among females, SEYLLp values were: 109 years due to traffic accidents and 69 years due to suicides (per 100,000). Among males, SEYLLp values started to decrease in 2008 at the average annual rate of 3.2%. In the group of females in the period 1999-2012, SEYLLp values were decreasing by 2.4% per year.
   Conclusions. The decreasing trend of the number of lost years of life due to external causes among rural inhabitants does not apply to suicides among men. The SEYLLp due to this group of causes has been steadily increasing since 1999. Analysis of the years of life lost focuses on the social and economic aspects of premature mortality due to external causes.

ID ACCIDENTS
AB Although the number of car accidents in Poland is decreasing each year, the number of suicides is increasing at the same time. The real number of suicides can be higher than reported in official statistics because some car accidents can be actually suicides. According to literature, some characteristics of the event itself and the psychophysical condition of a victim constitute risk factors of "car accident associated" suicide. When these are suspected, careful investigation should be extended to verify if a case constitutes suicide in a car accident. Identifying suicides within car accidents would help to prevent such cases, this is important because of the fact that apart from a suicide completer, other parties may get injured or suffer damage. We present two cases, a driver and a pedestrian, where detailed and thorough investigation proved with no doubt the suicidal character in each case.

AB The aim of our study was to estimate the health-related and economic burden of suicide in Poland in 2012 and to demonstrate the effects of using different assumptions on the disease burden estimation.
   Years of life lost (YLL) were calculated by multiplying the number of deaths by the remaining life expectancy. Local expected YLL (LEYLL) and standard expected YLL (SEYLL) were computed using Polish life expectancy tables and WHO standards, respectively. In the base case analysis LEYLL and SEYLL were computed with 3.5 and 0% discount rates, respectively, and no age-weighting. Premature mortality costs were calculated using a human capital approach, with discounting at 5%, and are reported in Polish zloty (PLN) (1 euro = 4.3 PLN). The impact of applying different assumptions on base-case estimates was tested in sensitivity analyses.
   The total LEYLLs and SEYLLs due to suicide were 109,338 and 279,425, respectively, with 88% attributable to male deaths. The cost of male premature mortality (2,808,854,532 PLN) was substantially higher than for females (177,852,804 PLN). Discounting and age-weighting have a large effect on the base case estimates of LEYLLs. The greatest impact on the estimates of suicide-related premature mortality costs was due to the value of the discount rate.
   Our findings provide quantitative evidence on the burden of suicide. In our opinion each of the demonstrated methods brings something valuable to the evaluation of the impact of suicide on a given population, but LEYLLs and premature mortality costs estimated according to national guidelines have the potential to be useful for local public health policymakers.

TI Why Are Suicides So Widespread in Catholic Lithuania?
SO RELIGIONS
LA English
DT Review
DE religion; suicide rates; Lithuania
ID RELIGION; ATTITUDES
AB Religion as a protective factor against suicide was introduced in Durkheim's theory of suicide and analysed from various perspectives in multiple studies. The Lithuanian case is intriguing because before WWII, along with Catholic Poland, it showed much lower suicide rates than its Protestant neighbours Latvia and Estonia. However, today Lithuania is among the leading countries in terms of the prevalence of suicide. Interestingly, not much has changed in Lithuania in terms of religious denomination-about 80% of population call themselves Catholic. The aim of this article was to explore which factors might have affected religions' protective function against suicide during radical historical processes. The method of study consists of an analysis of historical sources, and of recent studies in suicidology and sociology of religion about suicide and religion in Lithuania. The results of this analysis show that two factors seem to be most important-heroicizing resistance suicides and experiencing long-term politics of atheisation.

AB To examine the pattern and trend of deaths due to external causes among Polish children and adolescents in 1999-2012, and to compare trends in Poland's neighboring countries.
   Death records were obtained from the Central Statistical Office of Poland. External causes mortality rates (MR) with 95 % confidence interval were calculated. The annual percentage change of MR was examined using linear regression. To compare MR with Belarus, Ukraine, Czech Republic and Germany, data from the European Mortality Database were used.
   MR were the highest in the age 15-19 years (33.7/100,000) and among boys (22.7/100,000). Unintentional injuries including transport accidents, drowning, and suicides (especially in children over 10 years old), were the main cause of death in the analyzed groups. Between 1999 and 2012 annual MR for unintentional injuries declined substantially. MR due to injuries and poisoning in Poland were higher compared with Czech Republic and Germany and lower in comparison with Belarus and Ukraine.
   Deaths due to unintentional injuries are still the leading cause of death among Polish children and adolescents. There are differences in death rates between Poland and neighboring countries.

ID CONSUMPTION; DRINKING; MORTALITY; RUSSIA; PATTERNS; STATES; LEVEL; RATES
AB Introduction and Aims. The aim of this paper was to estimate how suicide rates in seven eastern European countries are affected by changes in population drinking and to put the results into a comparative perspective. Design and Methods. The analysis included data on annual suicide mortality rates and per capita consumption for the post-war period from: Russia, Belarus, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, the former Czechoslovakia and the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). Overall and gender-specific models were estimated using the Box-Jenkins technique for time-series analysis. The estimates were pooled into two groups, i.e. spirits countries (Russia, Belarus and Poland) and non-spirits countries (Hungary, Bulgaria, former Czechoslovakia and former GDR). Results. All countries obtained positive alcohol effect estimates. The effects on the overall population were largest in the spirits countries, where a 1-litre increase in per capita consumption was associated with an increase in overall suicide rates of 5.7-7.5%. The effects were somewhat smaller in the non-spirits countries, 2.7-4.7%. The estimates for males were larger, but showed the same national variations as the overall population estimates. The female estimates were generally smaller than for men and did not differ between the two country groups. Discussion and Conclusions. The results suggest that per capita consumption matters for suicide mortality in these eastern European countries, but that the strength of the relationship is contingent upon the drinking culture, so that it tends to be stronger in countries with detrimental drinking patterns.

Czynski was one of the best known and yet the most forgotten Polish esoterists and the leader of the Order of Martinists. Was he really linked to Satanism? What about strange suicides among his students? The article attempts to answer these questions.

AB Background: Acute pesticide poisonings constitute an important toxicological problem in numerous countries. This report refers to patients treated for poisonings at the Toxicology Unit, Lodz, Poland, in the period 2004-2014. Material and Methods: Data to be analyzed were obtained from medical records of hospitalized people. A group of 24 301 patients aged >= 15 were selected. In the group of 149 people poisoned with pesticides (0.61% of all poisoning cases), there were 40 women and 109 men. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the impact of age on suicide attempts using pesticides. Results: Suicide attempts significantly more frequently concerned younger people. In this type of behavior, coumarin derivatives were significantly more often used than organophosphorus compounds or pesticides classified as "others." The patients with suicidal pesticide poisonings stayed in the ward significantly longer than those poisoned unintentionally. Conclusions: In the analyzed population inhabiting an area with a high degree of urbanization, in terms of the place of residence and employment, pesticide poisonings were more common in men than in women. Suicide attempts using pesticides more frequently concerned younger people. Information found in this study may prove useful for education purposes, and also in informing clinicians.

AB Background: Suicidal ideation is elevated for individuals with alcohol use disorders. Sleep problems are associated with suicide risk and alcohol use, and sleep problems may be associated with suicide risk in those with alcohol use disorders. For the present study, we hypothesized that self-reported sleep problems are associated with suicidal thoughts in a sample of adults seeking treatment for alcohol dependence in Poland.
   Methods: The sample included 304 patients in addiction treatment programs in Warsaw, Poland who met criteria for alcohol dependence. Measures included demographic characteristics, frequency of alcohol use, psychiatric symptoms, suicidal ideation and two measures of insomnia, which differed by time frame: the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS, past 1 month) and the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire (SDQ-7, past 6 months). Multivariable logistic regression models tested the association between insomnia and suicidal thoughts.
   Results: In models that controlled for age, gender, and days of recent drinking, both measures of sleep problems were associated with suicidal ideation: AOR = 2.01 (95% Cl: 1.50-2.70) [AIS] and 1.73 (95% Cl: 1.29-2.31) [SDQ-7]. The association of sleep problems, as measured by the AIS, with suicide remained significant after adjusting for psychiatric symptoms, although the estimated effect size was smaller (AOR = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.05-2.06).
   Conclusions: Among Polish adults with alcohol dependence, insomnia severity was associated with suicidal ideation. This finding highlights the need to assess for sleep problems, in addition to suicidal thoughts, in alcohol treatment settings and to further examine the potential consequences of poor sleep in this population.

AB Aim. The aim of the study is to investigate the views of adolescents aged 16-19, attending public high schools in Warsaw, on effectiveness of suicide prevention.
   Material and method. The studied population covered adolescents aged 16-19 back in 2015 (M = 17.29; SD = 0.94). The respondents attended eight public high schools in Warsaw in eight different districts. The study group was representative. 1,439 respondents participated in the study - 821 girls (57.1%) and 592 boys (41.1%). PAPI method was used in the conducted study. The questionnaire consisted of 34 questions.
   Results. In most cases respondents did not know whether there was an organized system of suicide prevention in Poland (42.0%), however, a large proportion of the respondents (39.7%) was aware of nonexistence of such a system in Poland. The respondents considered the activity of a school (46.7%), the Church (38.3%) and the police (55.9%) in the field of suicide prevention ineffective, the activity of health care institutions (47.7%) and the media (46.6%) hardly effective, while the family was considered effective (70.9%). Persons who perceive significant role of the Church in suicide prevention at the same time indicate considerable share of the family and a much lesser role of the remaining institutions.
   Conclusions. 1) More than 1/3 of studied adolescents realize that there is no integrated system of suicide prevention; 2) The family, according to high school students, plays the greatest role in preventing self-destructive behaviors; 3) There is a need of greater involvement of schools. the Church, the police, health care institutions and the media in education and raising adolescents' awareness in the field of self-destructive behaviors.

AB Background: Suicidal behavior has been recognized as an increasing problem among alcohol-dependent subjects. The aim of the study was to identify correlates of impulsive and non-impulsive suicide attempts among a treated population of alcohol-dependent patients.
   Methods: A total of 154 patients with alcohol dependence consecutively admitted for addiction treatment participated in the study. Suicidal behavior was assessed together with severity of alcohol dependence, childhood abuse, impulsivity, and family history. A stop-signal procedure was used as a behavioral measure of impulsivity.
   Results and conclusions: Lifetime suicide attempts were reported by 43% of patients in alcohol treatment; of which 62% were impulsive. Compared to patients without a suicide attempt, those with a non-impulsive attempt were more likely to have a history of sexual abuse (OR=7.17), a family history of suicide (OR=4.09), and higher scores on a personality measure of impulsiveness (OR=2.27). The only significant factor that distinguished patients with impulsive suicide attempts from patients without a suicide attempt and from patients with a non-impulsive suicide attempt was a higher level of behavioral impulsivity (OR=1.84-2.42).
   Limitations: Retrospective self-report of suicide attempts and family history. Lack of diagnostic measure. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Academic medicine is a discipline which requires much financial expenditure and the profit is not always immediate. Therefore, an idea has been raised in some circles to limit the expenditures on it. The experience of Poland points out, however, that such a limitation will not bring benefit in the long run-just the opposite, it can bring about both social and economic loss. Even the countries that are not wealthy should invest in academic medicine, as this is a necessary condition for their harmonious growth.

AB Aim: The assessment of suicidal risk is one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges. The aim of present article is to report the process of development and preliminary validation of the Verbal Suicide Scale.
   Material and method: A total of 121 psychiatric inpatients aged 19-67 anonymously completed Verbal Suicide Scale (VSS). The study took place in the Clinic of Psychiatry, Medical University of Warsaw in Mazovia Specialist Health Center in Pruszkow, Poland.
   Results: Factor analysis validated the three factor structure. Cronbach's alpha reliability for each factor was satisfactory: 0.876 for scale 1, 0.700 for scale 2 and 0.710 for scale 3.
   Conclusions: VSS is a short instrument for evaluating the attitude toward suicide and can be a useful tool in mental health nursing practice. Further research and analyses are required to refine the theoretical and external reliability of the method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The aim of the study reported herein was to determine the characteristics of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) practice in Poland.
   Method: A 20-item questionnaire was sent to all Polish inpatient psychiatric facilities including all academic centers, general hospital psychiatric wards and psychiatric institutions.
   Results: Each of the 58 departments (100%) replied by mail or by phone. A total of 25 departments indicated the use of ECT, but only in 20 departments was it administered regularly. Altogether, 435 patients (0.79% of all inpatients) were treated with ECT in Poland during 2005. The main indications of ECT were affective disorders. Bitemporal electrode placement was used twice or 3 times a week in each setting. Anesthesia was usually induced either with thiopental or propofol. The wide variations in the investigations for pre-ECT evaluation reflect the lack of a generally accepted ECT protocol in Poland.
   Conclusion: The rate of ECT use in Poland is among the lowest in the Central-East European region, which raises the possibility that many patients who otherwise would greatly benefit from ECT do not receive this treatment.

DE Standard expected years of life lost; Premature mortality; Burden of
   disease; Poland
ID EUROPEAN-UNION; COUNTRIES; POPULATION; DISEASE; 8-YEAR
AB Background: Despite positive changes in the health of the population of Poland, compared to the EU average, the average life expectancy in 2011 was 5 years shorter for males and 2.2 years shorter for females. The immediate cause is the great number of premature deaths, which results in years of life lost in the population. The aim of the study was to identify the major causes of years of life lost in Poland.
   Methods: The analysis was based on a database of the Central Statistical Office of Poland, containing information gathered from 375,501 death certificates of inhabitants of Poland who died in 2011. The SEYLLp (Standard Expected Years of Life Lost per living person) and the SEYLLd (SEYLL per death) measures were calculated to determine years of life lost.
   Results: In 2011, the total number of years of life lost by in Polish residents due to premature mortality was 2,249,213 (1,415,672 for males and 833,541 for females). The greatest number of years of life lost in males were due to ischemic heart disease (7.8 per 1,000), lung cancer (6.0), suicides (6.6), cerebrovascular disease (4.6) and road traffic accidents (5.4). In females, the factors contributing to the greatest number of deaths were cerebrovascular disease (3.8 per 1,000), ischemic heart disease (3.7), heart failure (2.7), lung cancer (2.5) and breast cancer (2.3). Regarding the individual scores per person in both males and females, the greatest death factors were road traffic accidents (20.2 years in males and 17.1 in females), suicides (17.4 years in males and 15.4 in females) and liver cirrhosis (12.1 years in males and 11.3 in females).
   Conclusions: It would be most beneficial to further reduce the number of deaths due to cardiovascular diseases, because they contribute to the greatest number of years of life lost. Moreover, from the economic point of view, the most effective preventative activities are those which target causes which result in a large number of years of life lost at productive age for each death due to a particular reason, i.e. road traffic accidents, suicides and liver cirrhosis.

In both samples the reliability was substantial (Cronbach's alphas of .93 and .89), and the factor structure identical (one major factor). Significant ethnic differences were found for 10 of the 12 scale items, but no differences related to demographic variables. The obtained differences appear to parallel a conservative-liberal dimension, though this will need to be assessed in future studies.

AB History of child abuse is considered one of the important risk factors of suicide attempt in general population. At the same time it has been shown that suicide attempts appear significantly more frequently in alcoholics than in healthy individuals. The objective of this study was to investigate associations between history of childhood sexual abuse and suicide attempts in a sample of Polish alcohol dependent patients. A sample of 364 alcohol-dependent subjects was recruited in alcohol treatment centers in Warsaw, Poland. Information was obtained about demographics, family history of psychiatric problems, history of suicide attempts, sexual and physical abuse during childhood and adulthood and severity of alcohol problems. When analyzed by gender, 7.4% of male and 39.2% of female patients had a lifetime history of sexual abuse; 31.9% of the study group reported at least one suicide attempt during their lifetime. Patients who reported suicide attempts were significantly younger (p = 0.0008), had greater severity of alcohol dependence (p = 0.0002), lower social support (p = 0.003), and worse economic status (p = 0.002). Moreover, there was a significant association between history of suicide attempts and family history of psychiatric problems (p = 0.00025), suicide attempts in the family (p = 0.0073), childhood history of sexual abuse (p = 0.009) as well as childhood history of physical abuse (p = 0.002). When entered into linear regression analysis with other dependent variables history of childhood sexual abuse remained a significant predictor of suicide attempt (OR = 2.52; p = 0.035). Lifetime experience of sexual abuse is a significant and independent risk factor of suicide attempts in alcohol-dependent individuals. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Fatal and nonfatal suicide attempts are far more common in opioid-dependent individuals than in the general population. More research is needed to understand the specific risk factors for suicidal behaviors in this patient population, particularly outside of the United States and Western Europe. This study investigated the correlates of suicide attempts among Polish patients in methadone maintenance treatment and interpreted results in the context of findings from other countries.
   Methods: The study was based on a sample of 240 individuals recruited from a methadone maintenance clinic in Poland. Participants were interviewed using standardized measures.
   Results: Consistent with studies in other countries, sexual abuse, depression, alcohol dependence, and impulsivity were associated with suicide attempt. Additionally, those patients with somatic comorbidity had an increase in odds (odds ratio = 2.6) of suicide attempt.
   Conclusions: The results of our study suggest a potential benefit to treatment approaches that address somatic concerns of methadone-maintenance patients. More research is needed to identify, assess, and understand possible cultural and regional differences between opioid-dependent populations to better tailor prevention strategies.

ID RISK-FACTORS; TRYPTOPHAN-HYDROXYLASE; TPH GENE; BEHAVIOR; RATES;
   METAANALYSIS; LONGITUDE; LATITUDE
AB There is now convergent evidence from classic quantitative genetics (family, twin, and adoption studies) and molecular genetic studies for specific genetic risk factors for suicidal behavior. This emerging research field has recently been supplemented by geographical studies concerned with the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis (FUSH), which states that population differences in genetic risk factors may partially account for conspicuous geographical patterns seen in suicide prevalence. In particular, the European high-suicide-rate nations constitute a contiguous, J-shaped belt, spanning from Finland to Austria. This area maps onto the second principal component identified for European gene distribution, most likely reflecting a major migration event of the past (i.e., the ancestral adaptation to cold climates and the Uralic language dispersion) still detectable in modern European populations. The present research tested the hypothesis in the United States. Consistent with the hypothesis, available historical (1913-1924 and 1928-1932) U.S. state suicide rates were uniformly positively associated with available state proportions of reported American ancestries from European high-suicide-rate countries (Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, and the Ukraine). However, contrary to the hypothesis, available contemporary (1990-1994) suicide rates were uniformly negatively associated with these ancestry proportions. The findings of this first test outside Europe are therefore conflicting. A proposal based on the geographical study approach is offered to further the progress of investigations into the genetics of suicide.

AB The prominent Jewish-Polish socialist Szmul Zygielbojm arrived in London in March 1942, residing and working there until his suicide on 12 May 1943. This article analyzes his relations with socialists in the British capital during that period. It describes how his contacts helped him disseminate the early information, arriving from Poland, about the Holocaust there - information that had a powerful impact on a significant section of socialist opinion. At the same time, it examines the limitations of his role, his increasing despair at the lack of effective measures to rescue Jews, and his realization that major divisions among the Allies, as well as among socialists and Jews, made unlikely any decisive action to help the Jews in Poland, let alone any potent protest of their treatment by the Nazis.

ID GENDER DIFFERENCES
AB Suicidal behaviors in psychiatric patients are one of the main challenges in current clinical practice. The aim of this study was to investigate the gender differences in suicide risk for psychiatric patients in Poland and the influence of life satisfaction in different stages of life on suicidal tendencies. A descriptive-exploratory approach to inquiry was used for this study. Sixty patients aged 16-67 (45% males and 55% females) answered the demographic-descriptive questionnaire, the Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) and the Cantril Self Anchoring Striving Scale (CSASS). The results suggest that women turned out to show higher risk of suicidal behavior than men (p<0.001). Moreover, women displayed strong negative correlation between suicide risk and the anticipated life satisfaction in the future (rho=-0.542), while men displayed negative correlation between suicide risk and the pre-illness level of functioning (rho=-0.638). The findings suggest that different therapeutic approaches for each gender should be applied in suicide prevention process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Our knowledge of the influence of place of birth and socioeconomic status on attempted suicide in a defined national population is limited.
   Methods: The study population at baseline in 1993 included approximately 4.5 million Swedish persons aged 25 to 64 years, of whom 5 70 000 had been born abroad. Each individual was tracked until attempted suicide, remigration, death, or the end of the study on December 31, 1998. The Cox regression was used in the analysis.
   Results: Labor migrants from Finland and other OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries and refugees from Poland and Iran had higher hazard ratios of attempted suicide than Swedish-born control subjects. Women born in Latin America, Asia, and Eastern Europe had significantly higher hazard ratios of attempted suicide than Swedish-born women. In contrast, men born in southern Europe and Asia had significantly lower hazard ratios of attempted suicide. The hazard ratios of attempted suicide among women from Iran, Asia, southern Europe, Latin America, and eastern Europe considerably exceeded those of men from the same country of origin. When socioeconomic status was included in the final model, the hazard ratios remained high for women, while the risk of attempted suicide among men declined sharply with increased income.
   Conclusions: Place of birth, socioeconomic status, and sex are associated with attempted suicide. Socioeconomic status explains only part of the association between place of birth and attempted suicide.

AB The current paper seeks to systematize the discussion on the causes of the changes in Eastern European countries' suicide mortality during the last 15 years by analyzing the changes in relation to some common causes: alcohol consumption, economic changes, "general pathogenic social stress", political changes and social disorganization. It is found that the development in suicide has varied between in different countries, and that the same causes cannot apply to all of them. However, the relation between suicide mortality and social processes is obvious. A model consisting of general stress, democratization, alcohol consumption and social disorganization (with a period-dependent effect) predicted fairly accurately the percentual changes in the suicide rates in 16 out of the 28 Eastern Bloc countries in 1984-89 and 1989-94, while it failed to do so for Albania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and the Caucasian and Central Asian newly independent states. The data are subject to many potential sources of error: the small number of units and the large multicollinearity between the independent variables may bias results. Nevertheless, the results indicate that the changes in Eastern European suicide mortality, both its decreases and increases, may be explained with the same set of variables. However, more than one factor is needed, and the multicollinearity will continue to pose a problem.

AB Background: We hypothesized that DNA variants affecting neurodevelopment such as rs4307059 (CDH10/CDH9), rs930752 (NRXN1), rs6265 (BDNF) or rs10868235 (NTRK2) may predispose to completed suicide. Methodology: We used a case-control two-stage approach based on a discovery cohort (557 cases and similar to 550 controls) and replication cohort (159 cases and 186 controls). The suicides were ascertained as consecutive cases autopsied at the Department of Forensic Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland. Results: In the discovery cohort we found an association between suicide and the CC genotype in the rs4307059 polymorphism (OR 1.64, p = 0.012). The trend for an overrepresentation of the CC homozygotes among suicides was replicated in the second cohort (OR 1.97, p = 0.056). Analysis in the pooled cohorts showed that rs4307059 CC was associated with completed suicide (OR 1.71, p = 0.002) also after Bonferroni correction (p(cor.) = 0.024). In an exploratory search for genotype-phenotype correlation we found that males with the rs4307059 CC genotype committed suicide earlier than those with CT/TT genotypes (p = 0.049). Conclusions: The CC genotype of rs4307059 located in the region between CDH9 and CDH10 is associated with completed suicide in a Polish cohort. Copyright (c) 2012S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Background: The aim of the study is the analysis of years of life lost due to external causes of death, particularly due to traffic accidents and suicides.
   Materials and Methods: The study material includes a database containing information gathered from 376,281 death certificates of inhabitants of the Lodz province who died between 1999 and 2010. The Lodz province is characterized by the highest mortality rates in Poland. The SEYLLp (Standard Expected Years of Life Lost per living person) and the SEYLLd (per death) indices were used to determine years of life lost. Joinpoint models were used to analyze time trends.
   Results: In 2010, deaths due to external causes constituted 6.0% of the total number of deaths. The standardized death rate (SDR) due to external causes was 110.0 per 100,000 males and was five times higher than for females (22.0 per 100,000 females). In 2010, the SEYLLp due to external causes was 3746 per 100,000 males and 721 per 100,000 females. Among males, suicides and traffic accidents were the most common causes of death (the values of the SEYLLp were: 1098 years and 887 years per 100,000 people, respectively). Among females, the SEYLLp values were 183 years due to traffic accidents and 143 years due to suicides (per 100,000 people).
   Conclusions: A decrease in the number of years of life lost due to external causes is much higher among females. The authors observe that a growing number of suicides contribute to an increase in the value of the SEYLLp index. This directly contributes to over-mortality of males due to external causes. The analysis of the years of life lost focuses on the social and economic aspects of premature mortality due to external causes.

AB Objectives: The importance of investigating various emotional skills in assessment of suicide risk in alcohol-dependent (AD) individuals has recently become the focus of increasing interest. The objective of this study was to explore the relationships between self-reported components of emotional intelligence and lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts in a clinical sample of AD subjects.
   Methods: A group of 80 inpatients entering an alcohol treatment program in Warsaw, Poland, was recruited. Baseline information about demographics, psychopathological symptoms, personality, and severity of alcohol problems was obtained. The Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test was utilized for assessment of emotional processing. Lifetime history of suicide attempts was obtained from the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview.
   Results: After accounting for affect-related suicide risk factors (severity of depression, anxiety, neuroticism), and also other significant predictors (eg, age, sex, history of childhood abuse), mood regulation/optimism deficits remained a significant correlate of lifetime suicide attempts in AD patients. In the mediation models, mood regulation appeared to fully mediate the relationship between history of suicide attempts and depression, and also neuroticism.
   Conclusions: The results of this study support the evidence that poor mood regulation might be related to the risk for suicidal behavior in AD individuals. These findings point towards the significance of addressing the issue of emotion-related skills in the therapy of those AD subjects who are at risk for suicide.

Data were collected in a written survey using the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) as well as questions on attempted suicide and auto-aggressive behaviour. Participants experienced a mean of three traumatic events, with 14 per cent developing a Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) subsequently. In each national sample, more than 50 per cent of the participants were in need of treatment because of psychological symptoms and nearly one-third had attempted suicide.

AB Background: The present study was designed to examine the influence of suicidality on relapse in alcohol-dependent patients. Specifically. a lifetime suicide attempt at baseline was used to predict relapse in the year after treatment. Also, the unique contribution of impulsive suicide attempts was examined.
   Methods: A total of 154 patients with alcohol dependence, consecutively admitted to four addiction treatment facilities in Warsaw, Poland participated in the study. Of the 154 eligible patients. 118 (76.6%) completed a standardized follow-up assessment at 12 months.
   Results: Previous suicide attempts were common in adults treated for alcohol dependence with 43% patients in the present sample reporting an attempt at some point during their lifetime. Additionally, more than 62% of those with a lifetime suicide attempt reported making an impulsive attempt. Lifetime suicide attempts were not associated with post-treatment relapse (chi-square = 2.37, d.f. = 1, p = 0.124). However, impulsive suicide attempts strongly predicted relapse (OR = 2.81. 95% CI = 1.13-6.95, p = 0.026) and time to relapse (OR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.18-3.74, p = 0.012) even after adjusting for other measures of baseline psychopathology, depression, impulsivity, hopelessness and alcohol use severity.
   Conclusions: This study is the first to document the relationship between pre-treatment impulsive suicide attempts and higher likelihood of post-treatment relapse in alcohol-dependent patents. Clinicians should routinely conduct an assessment for previous suicide attempts in patients with alcohol use disorders. and when impulsive suicidality is reported. they should recognize the increased risk for relapse and formulate their patients' treatment plans accordingly with the goals of reducing both alcoholic relapse and suicide rates.

AB The current paper seeks to systematize the discussion on the causes of the changes in Eastern European countries' suicide mortality during the last 15 years by analyzing the changes in relation to some common causes: alcohol consumption, economic;changes, "general pathogenic social stress", political changes, and social disorganization. It is found that the developments in suicide have been very different in different countries, and that the same causes cannot apply to all of them. However, the relation between suicide mortality and social processes is obvious. A model consisting of the hypothetical general stress (as indicated by mortality/life expectancy), democratization, alcohol consumption, and social disorganization (with a period-dependent effect) predicted the percentual changes in the suicide rates in 16 out of the 28 Eastern Blee countries in 1984-89 and 1989-94 fairly accurately, while it failed to do this for Albania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and the Caucasian and Central Asian newly independent states. Most interesting were the strong roles played by changes in life expectancy, the causes of which are discussed, and the fact that economic change seemed to lack explanatory power in multiple analyses. The data are subject to many potential sources of error, the small number of units and the large multicollinearity between the independent variables may distort the results. Nevertheless, the results indicate that the changes in Eastern European suicide mortality, both decreases and increases, may be explained with the same set of variables. However, more than one factor is needed, and the multicollinearity will continue to pose problems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction. Intentional poisonings among children and adolescents are a problem not only for paediatricians, but also constitute a big issue for public health. In many countries worldwide, including Poland, an increase has been observed in suicidal behaviours at developmental age.
   Objective. The aim of the study was a retrospective evaluation of patients hospitalized due to intentional poisoning in the Department of Paediatrics, Children's University Hospital in Lublin, Poland, in 2007-2012.
   Materials and methods. In the study period, 149 patients were hospitalized in the Paediatric Department of the Children's University Hospital in Lublin, due to intentional poisoning with medicines or other chemical substances. The study group comprised 135 girls and 14 boys; The majority of patients (n=105) were urban inhabitants, and only 44 lived in the rural areas. Medical records were analyzed, with consideration of medical, psychological and psychiatric examinations.
   Results. Girls constituted as much as 90.6% of the study group. The majority of patients lived in urban areas -70.46%. A total of 16.77 % of patients came from incomplete families. Alcohol problem occurred in 19 families. The most frequent cause of a suicide attempt was conflict in the family, followed by school problems. During the 6-year-study period, an upward tendency in the incidence of intentional poisoning was observed, particularly in the first 4 years.
   Discussion and conclusion. Suicide attempts in adolescents were mostly undertaken by girls from the urban environment. The majority of those attempts were caused by family problems, including alcoholism.

AB Background: The aim of the study is to evaluate the differences in premature mortality between educational groups of Polish inhabitants in 2002 and 2011.
   Methods: The analysis included all deaths among inhabitants of Poland, aged 25-64 years, which occurred in 2002 (N=97 004) and 2011 (N=104 598). We calculated age-standardised death rates (SDRs) and summary measures on inequalities. The relative index of inequality (RII) was calculated with Poisson regression.
   Results: The SDR for Poland decreased from 285.7 per 100 000 in 2002 to 246.0 in 2011 among males with higher education and increased from 1141.0 in 2002 to 1183.0 in 2011 among males with lower secondary or less education (the rate ratio increased from 4.0 to 4.8). With regard to females with higher education, the SDR decreased from 127.2 per 100 000 in 2002 to 115.6 in 2011. Among females with lower secondary or less education, the SDR increased from 375.8 per 100 000 in 2002 to 423.1 in 2011 (the rate ratio increased from 3.0 to 3.7). The RII increased from 5.8 to 9.7 in the male group and from 4.4 to 8.3 in the female group. The greatest educational inequalities in 2011 were observed in females who died of cardiovascular diseases (RII=14.9) and lung cancer (RII=6.6) and in males who died of suicides (RII=19.3) and lung cancer (RII=11.9).
   Conclusions: Educational inequalities in premature mortality in Poland are growing. There is a need to implement health education programmes targeted at groups of the most poorly educated Polish inhabitants, especially for diseases resulting from smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.

AB Aim. This work aims to present the difficulties in the assessment of sanity of a perpetrator involved in the so-called dyadic death, which in Poland is identified with the occurrence of sever mood disturbances at the time of the crime.
   Methods. A case of a man who killed his wife and two children is presented. The perpetrator himself tried to commit suicide by cutting his veins with a razor.
   Commentary. The authors underline diagnostic difficulties which were encountered in the analysed case, they point out the necessity to go beyond the phenomenological aspect of "dyadic death" and the need for multidimensional clinical evaluation of the perpetrator. The rarity of similar acts and low survival rate of perpetrators leaves experts with relatively small amount of opinion giving experience. Thus, there is a need for high accuracy research and careful consideration.

AB A number of health outcomes were affected by previous financial crises, e. g. suicides, homicides and transport accident mortality. Aim of this study was to analyse the effects of the current financial crisis on selected health outcomes at population level in Europe. Methods: A mixed approach of ecologic and time trend design was applied, including correlation analysis. For eight countries, data on the economic situation (unemployment rate and economic growth) and health indicators (overall mortality, suicide and transport accident mortality) was drawn from EUROSTAT database for 2000-10. Spearman's rank correlation was applied to analyse the influence of social protection on the association between exposure and outcome variables. Results: The financial crisis had no visible effect on overall mortality in any of the eight countries until 2010. Transport accident mortality decreased in all eight countries, in the range of 18% in Portugal to 52% in Slovenia. In contrast, suicide mortality increased in Germany (+5.3%), Portugal (+5.2%), Czech Republic (+7.6%), Slovakia (+22.7%) and Poland (+19.3%). The effect of unemployment on suicide is higher in countries with lower social spending (Spearman's r = -0.83). Discussion: Clear cause-effect relations could not be established owing to the ecological study design and issues concerning data availability. However, there are clear changes in suicide and transport accident mortality after onset of the crisis, and findings are consistent with previous work. As part of this work, a comprehensive framework was developed, which can be applied to analyse health effects of financial crises in more detail.

AB In recent years, sex differences in mortality have followed diverse patterns of change in developed countries. As there is no analogous evidence from Poland, the aim of this study was to describe the pattern of change in excess male mortality among Polish inhabitants aged 35-64 during 19952002, when the major socioeconomic transformation occurred, and compare it with sex differences in mortality observed in the late 1980s. During the study period, excess male mortality decreased significantly, independently of age and educational level. The reduction in mortality was observed in both sexes, but its magnitude was greater in men. These changes resulted mainly from a reduction in mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease and lung cancer in males and a concomitant increase in mortality rates due to lung cancer and suicides in females. Although, in general, excess male mortality decreased, social gradients related to this phenomenon increased. Subjects (in particularly men) who had graduated from university benefited the most, their magnitude of reduction in mortality rates being the greatest. Changes in social environment during the transformation period in Poland are suggested as major determinants of these changes, but further studies are needed.

AB In clinical practice suicidal ideation (SI) is one of the most commonly encountered symptoms in patients with mental disorders. Such encounter calls for diligent evaluation of suicidal risk. Although the risk factors are widely known, accurate estimation of suicidal risk remains one of the most difficult and most important tasks that clinicians face - especially considering recently collected data showing increase in suicide prevalence in Poland. More thorough estimation of suicidal risk in patients with SI requires taking under consideration not only suicidal risk factors but also factors that are more specific for progression of SI to suicidal behaviors (SB). The review presented in this paper consists of a range of suicidological theories that allow to select a number of groups of factors and mechanisms that are most specific for progression of SI to SB. These groups include: (1) transgression of fear of causing harm and pain to oneself, as well as disintegration of other protective barriers such as (2) decline of social integration with others, feeling of being alienated or abandoned, decline of sense of belongingness, lack of social support, (3) resignation from family and social obligations, (4) dismissing cultural or religious norms, (5) rejection of life goals, values and aspirations that were appreciated earlier, (6) narrowing down in perceived alternatives for suicide, i.e., "tunnel vision", feelings of helplessness and powerlessness, (7) devising in details and accepting simple suicidal plan, especially when such plan is being consolidated through rehearsals and as if "automatized", (8) impulsiveness, (9) accumulation of aggression that may be vented out as suicide, and finally (10) accessibility of means to commit suicide.

AB The aim of the study is an evaluation of years of life lost by inhabitants of Poland according to the most important causes of mortality and identification of trends in the period 2000-2014. The study material included a database which contained information gathered from 5,601,568 death certificates of inhabitants of Poland. In order to calculate years of life lost, the SEYLLp index (Standard Expected Years of Life Lost per living person) was applied. We also calculated AAPC (Average Annual Percentage Change). The SEYLLp index (per 10,000 population) in Poland decreased from 2503.4 in 2000 to 2193.2 in 2014 among males (AAPC= -0.8%, p < 0.05) and from 1430.2 in 2000 to 1269.4 in 2014 among females (AAPC= -0.6%, p < 0.05). In 2014, the top 5 causes of years of life lost were: cardiovascular diseases (721.4 per 10,000 males and 475.6 per 10,000 females), malignant tumours (575.5 and 418.3), unintentional injuries (202.2 and 46.8), intentional injuries (114.6 and 16.3) and digestive diseases (120.2 and 58.3). Due to negative trends, there is a need to implement preventative measures, aimed at reducing mortality caused by respiratory infections in both males and females, malignant tumours in females and diabetes mellitus and intentional injuries in males.

AB The article describes the tradition of self-immolation in Eastern Europe as a form of radical protest during periods of structural crisis. The authors describe cases of self-immolation (Ryszard Siwiec, Jan Palach, Evzen Plocek, Musa Mamut) which took place in the communist period, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s. In the context of Eastern European tradition, they also describe the last case of self-immolation, when Piotr Szczsny set himself on fire in Warsaw in October 2017 to protest against the authoritarian rule of the Law and Justice (PiS) party in Poland. After this incident, Piotr Szczsny and his memory have become an element of the culture of protest' in Poland. Quotes from his manifesto began to appear on walls and during anti-government demonstrations. Piotr Szczsny has also become a protagonist of protest songs.

AB Poisoning is considered a significant health problem among elderly people in Poland. This report refers to patients treated for poisonings at the Toxicology Unit, Lodz, Poland, during the period 2008-2012. The data to be analyzed were obtained from medical records of elderly people. A group of 1167 patients aged 60+ was selected. The number of intentional poisonings in the group of patients was 417, which accounted for 35.7% of all poisonings among the elderly people. Patients attempting intentional poisonings included 301 (72.2%) women and 116 (27.8%) men. The most common cause of intentional poisonings were drugs-96.6% (n = 403). Benzodiazepines (46.9%) dominated among the intentional poisoning by drugs. During the analyzed 5 years, 80.3% (n = 335) were suicidal poisonings and 19.7% (n = 82) were demonstrative poisonings. Cardiovascular disease, which was diagnosed among 53.5% of the patients, was the most common physical illness. In conclusion, drugs are the most frequent type of the toxic agent responsible for poisoning cases among the elderly people. In this situation, the role of family doctors is very important: they should prescribe medicines in amounts not greater than absolutely necessary and maybe more often recommend psychiatric care for the elderly patients.

AB Objective: The article summarises the reflections on the results of the research carried out in 2017-2019. The aim of the study was to analyse the causes and determinants of suicide attempts undertaken in early and middle adulthood (among students' representatives). Material and methods: The study group consisted of 425 people - students randomly selected from representatives of the Maria Curie-Sklodowska University in Lublin. Initially, the research was carried out as part of cooperation with the Support Team for People with Disabilities, and then expanded, due to the high demand for research into prevention and mental health at the university. The age of the subjects oscillated between 18 and 31 years. Representatives of individual departments came from the following provinces: Lublin, Subcarpathia, Lesser Poland and Masovia Voivodships. The test results were subjected to qualitative and quantitative analysis. Results: The analysis shows that, according to the majority of respondents, they do not know where to go for free psychological help at the university (93.6%). On the other hand, more than half of respondents believe that suicidal behaviour in a student representative may cause, for example the Werther effect, the desire to imitate a similar act (68.5%). Students believe that social ties during academic learning are becoming less and less strong. They believe that many people do not react to other people's problems, and even threatening situations are often ignored (52.5%). Conclusions: there is a need for education, prevention and stimulation of social interest in the subject of self-destruction, suicide attempts or behaviours threatening the individual's health and life.

SO FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL

DT Article
DE bk-MBDB; Postmortem; LC-ESI-MS-MS
ID DESIGNER DRUGS; MDMA
AB The easily available "legal highs", which are products containing psychoactive substances, such as cathinones, piperazines and synthetic cannabinoids, are abused by adolescents in Poland and in the world as alternatives to classic drugs, such as amphetamines or marijuana. The majority of these potentially dangerous substances are still legal and they are associated with a risk of severe poisoning or even death, and provide new challenges in clinical and forensic toxicological practice.
   Investigations in the field of "designer drugs" may be well illustrated by the case of a suicide of a 21-year old male who ingested a specified dose of a preparation called "Amphi-bi-a" that contains bk-MBDB, chemically 2-methylamino-1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl) butan-1-one, which belongs to the cathinone group, as a synthetic euphoric empathogen and psychoactive stimulant that is chemically similar to MDMA. It is one of more common components of "legal highs" examined in Poland and other countries. The documentation of the case includes a clinical assessment of the patient's health status performed during his almost 4-h hospitalization before death, autopsy and histological examinations supported by toxicological findings revealing bk-MBDB at extremely high concentrations (at 20 mg/l in the blood and 33 mg/kg in the liver); hence, this body of evidence contributes to knowledge in the field of "designer drugs".
   Inventions of designers of new psychoactive xenobiotics, which are much in demand, especially in view of the dynamic Internet marketing, which drums up narcobusiness, must be balanced by a national strategy developed by medical, legal and educational circles in the modern civilized world in order to prevent the spreading of the phenomenon.

AB There were few reports about the relationship between unemployment and mortality in Central Eastern European countries experiencing economic transition.
   This study measures overall and cause-specific mortality rates in 47 247 subjects registered as unemployed in Danzig City and Danzig County for the period of 1999 and 2004 and compares them with the age-matched general population.
   In unemployed male subjects, the age-standardized all-cause mortality rate was significantly higher than in men from the general population: 8.36 per 1000, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 7.71-9.0 compared with 5.1 per 1000, 95% CI 4.94-5.21. The age-standardized mortality in unemployed women was also higher than in the reference population data: 5.55 per 1000, 95% CI 4.77-6.34 and 1.89 per 1000, 95% CI 1.81-1.97, respectively. External causes, suicides, alcohol and smoking-related causes explain the excess mortality among both men and women. Unemployment status was associated with a greater risk of death in men than in women: hazard ratio (HR) 2.02, 95% CI 1.33-3.08 and HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.37-1.5, respectively.
   Possible explanations for this disparity may be the current regulations and sociocultural context in Poland. More research is needed to understand the differences in mortality risk associated with unemployment observed between men and women in Poland.

AB This paper explores whether Catholic organisations, understood as moral communities, may act as intermediary institutions of control between markets and the post-socialist Polish state in constraining shadow economy activities of religionists who professionally run small and medium-sized companies. The interview data show that religious control efficiency is determined by the integrative potential of the specific religious organisation with which the analysed entrepreneurs were associated. This study also shows that the intertwining of an otherworldly orientation and dense social capital implies numerous ambiguities, which may produce destabilising effects for companies' organizational efficiency.

AB The article synthetically presents the actions of the military, the Internal Security Corps and the security apparatus against the underground after the of Operation Vistula. It aims to show the attempts to destroy the remainder of the UPA and OUN forces and the ensuing results. The displacements of the remaining Ukrainian population from the province of Lublin are also discussed, Even before the end of Operation Vistula, two operational groups were formed, numbering about 10,000 soldiers in total. Their task was facilitated by the demobilisation of partisans carried out in the autumn of 1947 by the command of the Ukrainian underground in Poland. The majority returned to Ukraine to continue fighting, while some tried to get through to the American zone of occupation in Germany. The actions of the military and the Internal Security Corps did not yield significant results. The biggest success was tracking down and surrounding the bunker in which the national OUN commander Jaro slaw Staruch "Stiah" was hiding, who later committed suicide. In November 1947, when the demobilisation of Ukrainian partisans was discovered, the operational groups were disbanded; combating the last Ukrainian partisans was entrusted to the local units of militia and the Internal Security Corps.

AB The present study examined the differences in the psychological wellbeing of 270 Polish (198 female) and 209 South Korean (87 female) students. Specifically, it tested the difference in depressive symptom severity between Polish and Korean students, and how this difference may be accounted for by stress and sensitivity to frustration. Poles and Koreans were chosen for this investigation as they vary in terms of culture with Koreans being more collectivistic and more dependent on social context. It was hypothesized that Koreans will have higher levels of depressive symptom severity than Poles due to the elevated levels of stress and sensitivity to frustration. Participants in both countries completed a set of questionnaires including the PHQ-9 - Patient Health Questionnaire, the STAR - Situational Triggers of Aggressive Responses Scale, and the Perceived Stress Scale - PSS 10. We found that Koreans were more depressed than Poles due to the higher stress levels and sensitivity to frustration. We discuss our study from two culturally distinct perspectives: psychological and philosophical. As this article addresses the problem of frustration and stress with attention to social context of emotional expression (or restraining from it), a philosophical concept of resentment may turn out to be a promising area of further research and interpretation.

AB In this article, the authors are interested in exploring discursive transformation of patients' stories of suicidal ideation into medical discourses. In other words, they focus on how the narrated experience of suicidal thoughts made during the psychiatric assessment interview is recorded in the patients' medical record. The authors' data come from recordings of psychiatric interviews, as well as the doctors' notes in the medical records made after the interviews, collected in psychiatric hospitals in Poland. Assuming a constructionist view of discourse, they demonstrate that lived experience of suicide ideation resulting in stories of a complex and homogeneous group of "thoughts" is reduced to brief statements of fact of presence/ existence. Exploration of the relationship between the interviews and the notes suggest a stark imposition of the medical gaze upon them. The authors end with arguments that discursive practices relegating lived experience from the focus of clinical practice deprives it of information which is meaningful and clinically significant.

AB In his early twenties Marek Hasko (1934-69), an angry young man' and a rare authentic' working-class voice, became the great literary hope of the Polish Communist Party. In the space of a few months, and at a crucial moment in post-war Polish history, he made his literary debut, published two books, received the Polish State Literary Prize and instantly became a popular youth-hero and celebrity rebel. But just as rapidly he became an exile, an outcast and a pariah. In the West he found freedom' as difficult to negotiate as life under communism, and while he continued to write, after 11 nomadic years he died of an overdose. His life and his writing are of one piece: his career trajectory illustrates how the Party could operate to promote writers it favoured, but to block and isolate those who opposed it.

AB Background: Driving while intoxicated or under the influence (DUI; for the purposes of this paper, we use the following terms synonymously: driving under the influence, driving while intoxicated, and drunk driving) and engaging in interpersonal violence are two injury-related problems of high public health importance that have both been linked to alcohol consumption. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of DUI and violence in a sample of individuals in treatment for alcohol dependence in Poland. Patient characteristics associated with DUI and violence involvement, with a particular focus on impulsivity, were examined. Methods: Three hundred and sixty-four patients consecutively admitted to four alcohol treatment programs in Warsaw, Poland participated in this study. Questions concerning history of interpersonal violence as well as those about DUI were derived from the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test. Impulsivity level was measured using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11, the Revised NEO Personality Inventory, and the stop-signal task. Results: Among all participants in the study, 148 (40.1%) had been arrested in the past for DUI, and 196 (55%) reported involvement in a fight under the influence of alcohol (FUI). The DUI group had a significantly earlier onset of alcohol problems, a longer period of heavy alcohol use, and fewer women in comparison to participants without a DUI history. FUI patients were significantly younger, with a younger average age of onset of drinking problems, longer period of heavy drinking, and lower percentage of women than the non-FUI group. Conclusion: Both of the self-reported measures of impulsivity indicated a higher level of impulsivity among participants from the FUI group than those from the non-FUI group. (C) 2013 S.

AB Prevalence of depression is high in patients with chronic kidney disease. Depression is associated with increased mortality and the higher rate of suicides in these patients. The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms in haemodialyzed patients in Upper Silesia region of Poland and the possible role of inflammation in depression development.
   Six hundred and ninety-seven haemodialyzed patients from 22 dialysis centres in Upper Silesia region of Poland were enrolled into the study. Mean age was 59.1 +/- A 0.5 years, and mean time of dialysis treatment was 3.6 +/- A 0.2 years. Each patient received 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaire for depression screening. Additional questions considering length of dialysis treatment, concomitant diseases and number of days spent in hospitals during the last year were also asked.
   Depressive symptoms were found in 268 (38.6 %) patients. Patients with depressive symptoms when compared with the patients without them tended to have higher C-reactive protein plasma concentration (14.3 +/- A 1.3 vs. 11.1 +/- A 0.9 mg/l; p = 0.067) and were more often dialyzed with central catheter (27.6 vs. 18.2 %; p = 0.0042). During the last year, patients with depressive symptoms spent in hospitals more days than patients without depressive symptoms (24.3 vs. 15.3 days, respectively; p < 0.0001). Significant positive correlation between BDI score and C-reactive protein level (r = 0.1625; p = 0.001) was found both in univariate and multivariate analysis.
   (1) Depressive symptoms are frequently found (38.6 %) in haemodialyzed patients in Upper Silesia part of Poland. (2) Catheter placement and inflammation seem to play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression in haemodialysis patients.

AB Introduction and objective: Depressive disorders in adolescents and young adults may have serious developmental and functional consequences, such as academic failure or persistent psychosocial problems. University students are affected by specific agents which may play a role in the onset of depression. The problem of student depression is particularly important in Poland because of a recent increase in student numbers, therefore, the aim of the presented study was to evaluate the prevalence of the risk of depression and suicidal thoughts among university students in Poznan, Poland, and to analyze the role of gender, current living arrangements, background (rural/small town or urban permanent place of residence), and reported financial status.
   Materials and methods: 1,065 respondent students, mean age 21.1 years, 72% of whom were females, anonymously answered a questionnaire on the risk of depression (Kutcher's KADS) and a demographics survey. The obtained data were then analyzed statistically with the SPSS programme.
   Results: 6.1 subjects were at risk of depression while 1.6% of them had suicidal thoughts. Among analyzed determinants, perceived financial status and student's background (permanent place of residence) were found to have a statistically significant influence on the risk of depression.
   Conclusion: Students with rural/small town background and/or lower rather than good reported financial status are more likely to become depressed.

AB Few studies have addressed the association between alcohol consumption and homicide rates at the population level in eastern European countries. The aim of the present study was to test hypotheses on how this association may vary across countries with different drinking patterns and for gender specific homicide rates. Time series analysis was used on annual alcohol consumption and homicide rates for six eastern European countries. The estimates were pooled into two groups of countries with more (Russia and Belarus) and somewhat less (Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and former Czechoslovakia) hazardous drinking patterns. The overall results showed that annual changes in alcohol consumption were positively and significantly associated with homicide rates and also indicated that the estimates were stronger in countries with a more detrimental drinking pattern. The results suggest that alcohol consumption has an effect on homicide rates in Eastern Europe and that this effect varies with drinking pattern.

AB The aim of the study was to analyse the level and the trends of Potential Years of Life Lost due to main causes of deaths in Poland in 2002-2011, with consideration of place of residence, urban-rural. The material for the study was the number of deaths due to main causes in Poland in years 2002-2011, based on data from the Central Statistical Office. Premature mortality analysis was conducted with the use of PYLL indicator (PYLL-Potential Years of Life Lost). PYLL rate was calculated according to the method proposed by J.Romeder, according to which the premature mortality was defined as death before the age of 70. Time trends of PYLL rate and the annual percent change (APC) were assessed using the Joinpoint Regression Programme. Rural/urban ratio was used to presented the differences in premature mortality between rural and urban areas. In years2002-2011, the PYLL rate for all-cause deaths decreased by 13.2% among men and 16.0% among women in rural areas, whereas in urban decreased it decreased by 15.7% among men and 14.9% among women. In 2011, the main causes of PYLL among men in rural areas were: external causes (32.3%), cardiovascular diseases (23.5%) and cancers (19.4%); in urban areas: cardiovascular diseases (24.7%), external causes (24.3%) and cancers (20.9%). Among women in rural areas, the leading causes were: cancers (39.9%), cardiovascular diseases (20.1%) and external causes (15.1%). The main causes of premature mortality among women in urban areas were: cancers (41.7%), cardiovascular diseases (19.6%) and external causes (11.1%). Premature mortality among men in rural areas was significantly higher than in urban for all analysed causes of death, with the exception of ischaemic heart diseases and colorectal cancer. Premature mortality among women in rural areas was significantly lower than in urban for all analysed cause of deaths, except of cerebrovascular diseases, external causes, suicides and traffic accidents. The presented epidemiological situation for premature mortality indicate differences in the state of health of the inhabitants in urban and rural areas in Poland. The leading causes of premature mortality are caused by preventable deaths, which leads to a need to intensify measures in primary and secondary prevention.

AB Szmul Zygielbojm was a politician and a member of the Bund and its Central Committee as well as a councilman of Warsaw and Lodz. In 1940, he left occupied Poland and spent the rest of the war in exile - first in France and then in the United States of America. In 1942, he arrived in Great Britain, where he served as a representative of his party in the National Council of the Polish government in exile. For over a year he had devoted his energies to attempts to inform the world about the mass extermination of Jews. In May 1943, he committed suicide in protest against inaction of the free world in the face of the Shoah.
   In January 1940, as he departed Warsaw, Szmul Zygielbojm left behind his family: wife Mania, son Artur and a daughter from his first marriage, Rywka. Between 1940 and 1941, a separated family maintained correspondence. The presented letters (the letters presented above) were sent from Poland by Zygielbojm's wife and two children. Unfortunately, there exists only one letter from Zygielbojm to his wife, the rest are missing. This emotional correspondence shows the drama of the family, but also allows one to have a look at Zygielbojm's private life, thus complementing the politician's biography. The Zygielbojms' wartime correspondence is also an example of how letters can be an important source in the Holocaust research.

AB Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the perceived level of internalized stigma among patients with severe mental illnesses and its relationship with demographic and clinical variables in Poland.
   Patients and methods: A study sample (n=114, mean age=42.46 +/- 14.1 years; 55% of females) consisting of patients with nonorganic psychotic disorders as well as unipolar and bipolar affective disorders was evaluated (58% of outpatients and 39% of inpatients). All patients filled in the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale (maximum severity=4). The demographic and clinical data were collected.
   Results: The study population demonstrated a mild level of internalized stigma (2.23 +/- 0.5). The highest score was observed in the alienation domain (2.63 +/- 0.8) and reflected moderate severity. The lowest score was noted in the stereotype endorsement domain (2.08 +/- 0.6). Moreover, the highest degree of internalized stigma was present in participants with unipolar affective disorder and was of moderate severity (2.46 +/- 0.6), while the level was moderate in the alienation domain (2.85 +/- 0.8). The level of vocational training education was the only variable associated with higher internalized stigma (P=0.02). There were no associations between gender, employment, and marital status and internalized stigma. The duration of the disease was the only clinical factor showing a significant positive correlation with stigma internalization (r=0.23; P=0.01). The number of hospital admissions and suicide attempts was not significantly correlated with internalized stigma.
   Conclusion: People with severe mental illnesses in Poland experience a mild level of self-reported internalized stigma. Internalized stigmatization was most strongly associated with alienation, which indicates the need for stigma assessment procedures followed by stigma intervention programs in daily clinical practice. This is in accordance with the trend of environmental "open door" psychiatry, which could be the first step to decrease the level of stigma and internalized stigma in psychiatric patients in Poland.

AB Aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate years of life lost for citizens of the Lodz Province, which is characterized by the lowest life expectancy in Poland, and to identify current trends in this area according to the most common causes of death.
   Methods: The study material included a database containing information gathered from 470,000 death certificates of Lodz Province inhabitants, who died between 1999 and 2011. In order to calculate years of life lost, the authors applied the SEYLLp (Standard Expected Years of Life Lost per living person) and SEYLLd (per death) indices. The analysis of time trends was carried out with the application of joinpoint models.
   Results: The SEYLLp measure was 2,300 years per 10,000 males and 1,500 years per 10,000 females in 2011. Cardiovascular diseases contributed to the highest number of years of life lost (SEYLLp = 682 years per 10,000 males and 559 years per 10,000 females). Next were malignant neoplasms (SEYLLp = 505 years per 10,000 males and 437 years per 10,000 females), external causes of death (SEYLLp = 361 years per 10,000 males and 83 years per 10,000 females). The number of years of life lost due to acute myocardial infarction decreased most rapidly, the Annual Percent Change (APC) was -10.1% in males and -3.7% in females. However, heart failure contributed to the highest increase in the number of years of life lost (APC = 10.8% in males and 10.9% in females).
   Conclusions: A further decrease in the mortality rate due to cardiovascular diseases might contribute to the highest reduction of years of life lost. The most effective preventive activities are those aimed at reducing productive years of life lost due to a particular cause of death, i.e. road traffic accidents, suicides, cirrhosis of the liver, alcoholic liver disease, and malignant neoplasms of the trachea, bronchi and lungs.

AB Aims: Treatment of patients with comorbidity of mental health problems and alcohol use disorder (AUD) constitutes a challenge in many countries. The article aimed at exploration of personal experiences of clinicians and patients with the comorbidity regarding its assessment, treatment and organization of care in Poland and the UK.
   Methods: Data were collected via in-depth, semi-structured interviews with clinicians (N = 28) and patients (N = 81) in both countries, according to a unified study protocol. Maximum variation sampling was applied to both study groups. All interviews' transcripts were coded (CAQDA) and the consistency of coding across centres was assessed. Data analysis was performed according to the principles of thematic analysis.
   Results: Our data show that most patients with AUD admitted at the psychiatric wards-apart from assessment which is a standard procedure during admission-receive only minimal support during their hospital stay. This is the consequence of two factors: lack of trained staff prepared to help those patients and a priority given to self-referrals by AUD units. At the same time, it is recognized by clinicians and patients that more support is needed to encourage the utilization of AUD services and to prevent the drop-out.
   Conclusions: In order to improve the system response, the use of screening instruments in the process of the assessment of AUD and establishment of special procedures supporting motivation and adherence to treatment and preventing drop-out merits consideration. Moreover, the psychiatric wards and the AUD services could possibly profit from formalization of the collaboration between services.

AB We present the results of the first study on the decomposition of hanging carcasses in a forest habitat of Poland. The decomposition of 12 hanging pigs and 12 ground pigs, which were used as control, in spring, summer, and autumn was examined during a two-year study. Mosaic decomposition was observed with bloating, active decay, and advanced decay irrespective of the carrion treatment (hanging vs ground). Bloating was less visible or did not occur at all in hanging pigs. After undergoing advanced decay, carcasses became mummified and remained in the hanging position. Complete skeletonization was observed only within the head in one case in summer. Irrespective of the carrion treatment, the active decay was driven by the same blow fly species with a similar seasonal pattern of larval dominance. The season was found to affect the decomposition of the hanging carcasses as revealed by a distinct delay in the onset of bloating in autumn and the late onset of active decay in spring. The duration of active decay was the shortest in summer and the longest in autumn. The effect of carrion treatment on the rate of decomposition was statistically insignificant. Nevertheless, some differences in the duration of decomposition between hanging and ground pigs were observed. The most distinct difference was that earlier decomposition proceeded faster in hanging pigs in spring and a delayed decomposition was observed in autumn. In summer, decomposition was similar in all the carcasses. The presented results are largely in contrast to the findings of previous studies on decomposition of hanging pig carrion.

AB The serotonin system is hypothesized to contribute to predisposition and course of alcohol dependence. However, the potential association between the T102C polymorphism (rs6313) in the type 2A serotonin receptor (HTR2A) gene and treatment outcomes in alcohol dependence has not been investigated. The aim of the study was to assess the contribution of this genetic polymorphism as a predictor of relapse in relation to other previously identified predictors. A sample of 254 alcohol dependent subjects, were recruited in alcohol treatment centers in Warsaw, Poland and prospectively assessed at baseline and follow-up after 12 months. At baseline, information about demographics, psychopathological symptoms and alcohol problems was obtained. The stop-signal task was performed and blood samples for genetic analysis of HTR2A T102C (rs6313) were collected. Relapse was defined as any drinking during the follow-up period. The statistical analysis showed that the CC genotype was significantly associated with increased relapse. Other significant factors were baseline depressive symptoms, number of drinking days during the 3 months prior to the baseline assessment, severity of alcohol-related problems, and a lifetime history of impulsive suicide attempts. Logistic regression analysis with and without the genetic factor revealed that adding the genetic factor increased the R square value by about 4%, with the CC genotype in the T102C polymorphism being the strongest predictor of relapse (OR = 2.32). The significant influence on relapse of the CC genotype, which is associated with fewer 5-HT2A receptors in the central nervous system, suggests the possibility that this genetic polymorphism could influence response to serotonergic medications.

AB Suicide is a significant public health issue and a major cause of death throughout the world. According to WHO it accounts for almost 2% of deaths worldwide. The etiology of suicidal behavior is complex but the results of many studies suggest that genetic determinants are of significant importance. In our study,-we have analyzed selected SNPs polymorphisms in the DRD2 and ANKK1 genes in patients with alcohol dependence syndrome (169 Caucasian subjects) including a subgroup of individuals (n=61) who have experienced at least one suicide attempt. The aim of the study was to verify if various haplotypes of selected genes, comprising Taq1A, Taq1B, and Taq1D single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), play any role in the development of alcohol dependence and suicidal behavior. The control group comprised 157 unrelated individuals matched for ethnicity, gender,-and age and included no individuals with mental disorders. All subjects were recruited in the North West region of Poland. The study showed that alcohol dependent subjects with a history of at least one suicidal attempt were characterized by a significantly higher frequency of the T-G-A2 haplotype when compared to individuals in whom alcohol dependence was not associated with suicidal behavior (p=0.006). It appears that studies based on identifying correlation between SNPs is the future for research on genetic risk factors that contribute to the development of alcohol addiction and other associated disorders. To sum up, there is a necessity to perform further research to explain dependencies between the dopaminergic system, alcohol use disorders and suicidal behavior.

AB Background: Acetaminophen is a widely available analgesic and antipyretic medication. Although it is advertised as safe, it is responsible for more than 50% of drug-induced hepatotoxicity cases and the most common cause of acute liver failure in developed countries. Until 2000 the frequency of acetaminophen overdoses in Poland was relatively low, but a significant increase has been seen in recent years. 'I he aim of the study was to perform a demographic analysis of the acetaminophen overdose cases hospitalized at the Pomeranian Center of Toxicology (PCT) in Gdansk, Poland, in 2010-2015. Material and Methods: 'I he Pomeranian Center of Toxicology in Gdansk is the Regional Clinical Toxicology Center for a population of more than 3.5 million people from the Pomeranian and the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeships. All the patients hospitalized at PCT in 2010-2015 were analyzed. Cases in which the primary or secondary diagnosis was encoded as T39.1, according to the International Classification of Diseases ICD-10, were selected. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi(2) and McNemara tests. Results: In the reference period, 7754 poisoned patients were hospitalized, including 4163 men and 3591 women. There were 667 cases of acetaminophen overdose (231 men and 436 women). There was a significant increase in the percentage of acetaminophen overdoses in 2010-2015 (6.5% and 10.8%, p < 0.01). In the group aged < 18 years, there were 217 cases of acetaminophen overdose (37 men and 180 women). The share or acetaminophen overdose cases in this group (17.2%) was significantly higher than among patients aged >= 18 years (6.9%, p < 0.01). The male to female ratio in the group aged >= 18 years was 0.75, and in the group aged < 18 years it was 0.21 (p < 0.01). Conclusions: There was a significant increase in the number of acetaminophen overdose cases hospitalized at the Pomeranian Center of Toxicology in 2010-2015. The share of acetaminophen overdoses was significantly higher in the group aged < 18 years than in the adult group. In both age groups, acetaminophen overdose was more frequent in women.

AB The purpose of this article is to show the psychosocial causes of social exclusion risk for children and youth in Eastern Europe and particularly in Poland. The notion of youth at risk among a group of young people who during childhood and adolescence encounter in their local environment a number of situations with which they are unable to cope. Maturing youngsters lack constructive patterns for handling difficult situations, and they often make decisions that impair their future development. In early adolescence, the increasing force of inner drives combined with a relatively weak ego cause teenagers to experiment in new situations, commence early sexual activity, engage in aggressive behavior, try drugs and other substances, drop-out of school, and even attempt suicide. A poor and dysfunctional family is often unable to fulfill such young people's basic needs, nor does it offer any support while they are going through difficult or crucial developmental periods. Disturbed behavior occurring during adolescence is often related to depression that manifests in increased aggression. A fairly common notion used when referencing adolescents, especially boys, is the so-called atypical depression characterized by the absence of external symptoms of sadness and the presence of intensified resistance, physical aggression and dangerous conduct. In this article, we attempt to show indicators and predictors of youth social exclusion risk as well as discuss methods of prevention.

AB Aim: Research on the east-west health divide has provided extensive evidence of poorer health in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union than in Western Europe. This study focuses on immigrants from Eastern to Western Europe and analyses whether they have an increased risk of self-reported poor health compared with the host population and what determines that. Methods: This cross-sectional study is based on 373 immigrants from Poland, other East European countries, and the former Soviet Union, aged 25-84, who arrived in Sweden after 1944 and were interviewed during 1993 2000 along with their 35,711 Swedish counterparts. Results: Age- and sex-adjusted unconditional logistic regression showed in general a 92% higher risk of reporting poor health among immigrants than among Swedish-born respondents. The risk also persisted after adjustment for several potential confounders (living singly, having a poor social network, low socioeconomic status, and smoking) and after an additional adjustment for acculturation (language at home), and years in Sweden. Conclusions: Being born in Eastern Europe or the former Soviet Union was an independent risk factor for reporting poor health. It is therefore suggested that it is important for primary and public care services to be aware of the health status and needs of immigrants from these countries.

AB The phenomenon of stupefying by the use of available over-the-counter drugs (OTC) among adolescents is an essential problem in both Poland and throughout the world. Popular analgesics, cold medicine and antihistamines contain psychedelic substances, such as dextromethorphan (DXM), pseudoephedrine/ ephedrine, codeine (methylmorphine), dimenhydrinate, paracetamol (acetaminophren) and others. Cases of fatal addiction to dextromethorphan, one of the active substances contained in medicines, e.g., the common cold, have been reported. The test results cited by the authors clearly indicate that the use of OTC drugs, whose turnover is not controlled is a domain of females. The extent of use of drugs not prescribed by a doctor has remained for many years at a constant level. The most common poisonings with OTC drugs are caused by those that affect the respiratory system or exert analgesic or antipyretic effects. They are also used in attempted suicides, especially among females. Analyzing poisonings caused by OTC medications their seasonality has been observed. Their number increases during spring-autumn. A territorial differentiation in areas of OTC drug trade in terms of their quantities, with the predominance of southern regions is also noted. Intoxication with psychoactive substances causes the deterioration of relations between young people. In the reviewed studies there is no detailed information on the composition of non-prescription medicines. Moreover, young people have easy access to mushroom fungi, growing in nearby forests and meadows that may have hallucinogenic effects and are available in pharmacies and on the Internet.

AB Objective: Depression and co-morbid substance abuse disorders are a major public health problem. Information is limited for patients attending Polish primary care clinics. This article addresses 30-day and lifetime prevalence of major depression in a heavy drinking population from 12 Polish primary care clinics. Method: 277 heavy drinkers were interviewed by a researcher in each clinic. Heavy drinking was defined as more than 20 drinks per week for males, or more than 13 drinks per week for females, or consumption of more than four drinks five or more times in the previous 30 days, or two or more positive replies to the CAGE questions. Criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual were used to assess lifetime and past 30-day depression, Results: 35% of women and men met criteria for depression in the 30 days prior to the interview. Lifetime rates were 45% for women and 52% for men. Men and women with a CAGE score of 4 were at higher risk for both 30-day (67%, OR = 3.85 [1.47, 10.08]) and lifetime (78%, OR = 3.28 [1.12, 9.66]) depression. Recreational drug users and patients reporting symptoms of antisocial personality disorders were at increased risk for lifetime depression. Subjects reporting symptoms of a childhood conduct disorder were at higher risk for 30-day depression. Conclusions: Depression among patients with substance abuse problems is a common problem. The rates are higher than for other countries and highlight the need for Polish primary care clinicians to routinely screen for depression in patients with substance use disorders.

AB The market for higher education presents one of the key elements of the socio-economic system of all countries, as well as of the global economic system (Petrescu et al., 2010). The market is gaining an increasingly great significance, especially in countries under economic transition where market economy mechanisms are under constant and dynamic changes (Olaru et al., 2010). It is necessary to underline that all of these changes have a great impact not only on the universities as well academics and administrative staff, but also on students and their behavior on the level of higher education market. This influence can be either positive or negative. Difficulties arising from these changes across the economy, compounded by a financial crisis, often result in various social problems such as: alcoholism, drug addiction, crime, suicide, mental illness, as well as poverty, domestic violence, etc. (Sztompka, 2013). It can be, therefore, concluded that the rate at which the change taking place in transitional economies is greater than the awareness of many students and their ability to understand the processes. Emerging disintegrative processes are reflected in the students' behavior, followed by the phenomenon of negative students' adaptation to the turbulent environment. The phenomenon, which beforehand was considered as disadvantageous or even pathological, is more commonly approached by students in a very liberal way. The main purpose of the paper is to identify role of leadership in preventing students' pathological behavior in universities and to investigate types of pathologies in students' behavior as well the methods of managing identified pathologies by university leaders. To achieve the above mentioned purposes, qualitative research was conducted with the use of a structured questionnaire. Rectors and deans from different higher education institutions from Poland were interviewed in 2016.

AB The beginning of the 21st Century is characterized by significant acceleration of various types of changes in the world, especially in Central and Easter European markets (Mruk 2007, p. 9). These changes generate important influence on customer/patient of medical market and may have both positive and negative effect on their behavior, which has been well demonstrated in the recent global economic crisis. It is worth noting that the current crisis is of a system character and spreads as a result of correlations which are typical of the globalization process (Kolodko 2009, p. 2). Difficulties caused by the crisis across the whole economy, mounted by constant transformation processes, often result in various social problems including alcoholism, drug addiction, crime, divorce, suicide mental and civilization diseases, social care and education failure, abuse in the family, etc. Hence, it can be stated that the rate of changes in the developing economies is bigger than consumers' awareness of the ongoing changes and their ability to grasp the processes. The emerging disintegrative processes are reflected in the consumer market behavior and leads to a phenomenon of consumers' negative adaptation to this reality. Systematically, consumers tend to take a more liberal approach towards phenomena that only recently were considered negative or even pathological. In these circumstances, customer behavior pathologyrelated issues on the medical market present one of the most interesting, both theoretically and practically, economic subjects. That is why the purpose of the paper was to identify pathologies in patients' behavior on medical market. Very important purpose of the paper was to characterize determinant which diversification pathological behavior of patients on medical market. To reach the above-presented purposes, a survey was conducted with the use of a structured questionnaire in Poland, Romania and Ukraine.

AB Higher education market is playing very important role in development of every country and their socio-economic systems (Pospiszyl, 2008). Higher education institutions present special functions especially during acceleration of various types of changes in the world (Mruk 2007, p. 9). However these changes generate important influence on students, teachers and other employees of higher education institutions and may have both positive and negative effect on their behavior, which has been well demonstrated in the recent global economic crisis. It is worth noting that the current crisis is of a system character and spreads as a result of correlations which are typical of the globalization process (Kolodko 2009, p. 2). Difficulties caused by the crisis across the whole economy, mounted by constant transformation processes, often result in various social problems including alcoholism, drug addiction, crime, divorce, suicide mental and civilization diseases, social care and education failure, abuse in the family, etc. (Solomon, 2010).Hence, it can be stated that the rate of changes is bigger than peoples' awareness of the ongoing changes and their ability to grasp the processes. The emerging disintegrative processes are reflected in the peoples' behavior and leads to a phenomenon of their negative adaptation to this reality. Systematically, people tend to take a more liberal approach towards phenomena that only recently were considered negative or even pathological. In these circumstances, students behavior pathology-related issues on the higher education market present one of the most interesting, both theoretically and practically, economic subjects. That is why the purpose of the paper was to identify pathologies in students' behavior on higher education market. Apart of this it was important to characterize determinant which diversification pathological behavior of students on higher education market. Research based on structured questionnaire in Poland shows that the most popular pathological behavior of students are deceptions and improper behavior. The most important determinants influencing students' attitudes toward pathological behavior are different social values.

AB Aim. Comparison of the course of illness and functioning as well as occurrence of somatic diseases between patients with dual diagnosis, alcohol or drug addiction without mental disorders and patients with schizophrenia or affective disorders; drawing attention to the problems of people with dual diagnosis and importance of longer psychiatric inpatient treatment of this group of patients.
   Method. 108 persons were examined during inpatient psychiatric treatment. Injuries, occurrence of somatic diseases, aggressive behaviors, suicidal attempts, and discharges from hospital on patients' request against medical advice were evaluated. Sociodemographic data and data associated with the course and treatment of an illness were compared between dual diagnosis group (n = 30), group of patients with mental illness (n = 41) and patients with alcohol or drug addiction (n = 37) using questionnaires designed by the authors.
   Results. In the dual diagnosis (DD) group, patients more often tried to commit suicide, started to use drugs or alcohol in younger age. In this group significantly more people were before marriage or after divorce. In the DD group and the group of patients with mental disorders (C), there were significantly more patients treated in hospitals longer than 180 days during their life. No statistically significant differences were found between groups when comparing incidence of somatic diseases, injuries, discharges from hospitals on patients' request or aggressive behaviors.
   Conclusions. Due to non-compliance, frequent interruption of treatment, higher suicidal risk in the dual diagnosis group, there is a need of longer inpatient treatment in order to improve mental status, regular pharmacological treatment, provide social support, motivation, and prepare patients for psychotherapy of addiction. It is essential to take actions to create therapeutic standards of treatment and adjust financial funding for this group of patients in Poland.

ID POISONINGS; CARE
AB Objectives: Many research studies conducted in various toxicology centers point to drugs as the most common cause of intoxication. Long-term observations make it possible to clarify the nature of these poisonings. The aim of this study was to examine the trends and reasons of intoxication in patients hospitalized over a 10-year observation period (2005-2015), as well as to compare the number of patients poisoned with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), mainly over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. Material and Methods: A retrospective observational study examined the medical documentation of patients hospitalized in the Department of Toxicology and Internal Diseases of the T. Marciniak Lower Silesian Specialist Hospital in Wroclaw in 2005-2015, including the analysis of the causes of intoxication as well as total poisoning-related death statistics. Quarterly and annual analyses of the numerical data, and comparisons of the frequency of poisonings were included. The patient population from the area of Lower Silesia. Poland. was examined. Results: The number of hospitalized patients has increased, with attempted suicide being the leading cause of death. Male intoxication and mortality have been found to predominate. Drugs are the most common cause of poisoning, and among these the most common are sedatives and psychotropic drugs. Intoxication due to NSAIDs, especially OTC drugs, increased significantly in the observation period. In 2005 no fatal cases were reported as a result of NSAID intoxication, while in 2015 mortality significantly increased to 43%. Conclusions: The lack of a common trend in poisonings is observed but the number of hospitalized patients has increased, especially among young people, which is consistent with global trends. Drugs are the most common cause of mortality, and a significant increase in NSAID (mainly OTC) poisonings in particular indicates the growing prevalence of an uncontrolled use of these drugs.

   SUICIDE; HEALTH; SENSE; POPULATION; DISORDERS
AB Study objective-This study hypothesises that the presumed increased risk of self reported longstanding psychiatric illness and intake of psychotropic drugs among Iranian, Chilean, Turkish, and Kurdish adults, when these groups are compared with Polish adults, can be explained by living alone, poor acculturation, unemployment, and low sense of coherence.
   Design-Data from a national sample of immigrants/refugees, who were between the ages of 20-44 years old, upon their arrival in Sweden between 1980 and 1989. Unconditional logistic regression was used in the statistical modelling.
   Setting-Sweden.
   Participants-1059 female and 921 male migrants from Iran, Chile, Turkey, Kurdistan and Poland and a random sample of 3001 Swedes, all between the ages of 27-60 years, were interviewed in 1996 by Statistics Sweden.
   Main results-Compared with Swedes, all immigrants had an increased risk of self reported longstanding psychiatric illness and for intake of psychotropic drugs, with results for the Kurds being nonsignificant. Compared with Poles, Iranian and Chilean migrants had an increased risk of psychiatric illness, when seen in relation to a model in which adjustment was made for sex and age. The difference became non-significant for Chileans when marital status was taken into account. After including civil status and knowledge of the Swedish language, the increased risks for intake of psychotropic drugs for Chileans and Iranians disappeared. Living alone, poor knowledge of the Swedish language, non-employment, and low sense of coherence were strong risk factors for self reported longstanding psychiatric illness and for intake of psychotropic drugs. Iranian, Chilean, Turkish and Kurdish immigrants more frequently reported living in segregated neighbourhoods and having a greater desire to leave Sweden than their Polish counterparts.
   Conclusion-Evidence substantiates a strong association between ethnicity and self reported longstanding psychiatric illness, as well as intake of psychotropic drugs. This association is weakened by marital status, acculturation status, employment status, and sense of coherence.

TI Involuntary psychiatric holds - the structure of admissions on the
   example of Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw
SO PSYCHIATRIA POLSKA
LA English
DT Article
DE involuntary psychiatric admission; consent; Mental Health Act
AB Aim. The aim of the study was to analyse the structure of involuntary psychiatric holds in Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw, throughout the year. Our research interests included socio-demographic profiles of the patients, time of admissions (time of a day/night/season), type of diagnoses at admission and suicide attempts preceding the admission. We also analysed the normative aspect of involuntary admissions, i.e. which Articles of the Polish Mental Health Act constituted the basis for these patients admission, and if the choice of articles was justifiable by a diagnosis of the mental disorder.
   Methods. The primary research tool consisted of an original questionnaire allowing for the collection of relevant data. The material was submitted to statistical analysis, using primarily simple percentage methods.
   Results. Involuntary psychiatric holds constituted 15.8% of the total number of admissions to the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology (3,498 persons) in 2012. 522 persons with mental disorders were subject to involuntary admission on emergency basis (292 women and 260 men). Majority of patients was over 40 years old. The number of patients admitted to the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology on emergency basis without the consent ranged from 38 to 62 people per month. Season did not differentiate significantly the number of admitted persons; majority of patients was admitted during the day (82%). Among the diagnosed patients, paranoid schizophrenia was the most frequent illness (43%), delirium tremens (7%), bipolar disorders (6%), dementia (5%), other psychotic disorders (5%), paranoid syndrome (5%), schizoaffective disorder (5%), other diagnoses (less than 1%). 4% of admissions to the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology were due to attempted suicide. 37% of patients were admitted to the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology under Article 23.1 of the Mental Health Act, 34% under Article 22.2, in accordance with Article 24.1 - only 7% of patients. Invoking Article 28 of the Mental Health Act by doctors referred to 14% of patients admitted without consent.
   Conclusions. Involuntary psychiatric admissions are common practice not only in Poland but in the world. The structure of involuntary admissions in the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in 2012 did not differ from data from other European countries. However, while quantitative measures describing the phenomenon of involuntary admissions are comparable, knowledge of each country's legal rules in relation to medical conditions is crucial for truly adequate comparisons. From the point of view of the Polish legal system it is essential for doctors, who decide on the admission of the patient against his will, to adequately evaluate the patient's condition in relation to statutory requirements that point to the need of such an admission. Involuntary hospitalisation and treatment first and foremost serve the welfare and protection of chief values of life and human health.

AB Objective: The individual capacity to love (CTL) has been linked to various mental health parameters and is considered to be an important outcome parameter of psychotherapeutic treatment. However, empirical examinations of the concept have not been conducted up to now. The aim of this study was to develop a valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of CTL [Capacity to Love Inventory (CTL-I)] as a trait of personality, which is shown to be related to clinically relevant symptoms and conditions.
   Method: Four independent healthy samples in Austria (n = 547, n = 174, and n = 85) and Poland (n = 240) were assessed by a prototype of the CTL-I and its final shorter version in a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Internal consistency of the total questionnaire and each subscale was assessed by Cronbach alpha. External validity was measured against Beck Depression Inventory, Quality of Relationship Inventory, Sociosexual Orientation Inventory, Pathological Narcissism Inventory, and Narcissistic Personality Inventory according to the theoretical framework of the CTL concept. Further test-retest reliability was assessed.
   Results: The CFA confirmed 41 items in six dimensions: Interest in the life project of the other, Basic trust, Humility and gratitude, Common ego ideal, Permanence of sexual passion, and Acceptance of loss/jealousy/mourning. The Cronbach alphas of the total CTL-I and its subscales ranged between 0.67 and 0.90 in all samples, suggesting a valid construct. The CTL-I was moderately positively associated with quality of relationship (Support r = 0.63, Conflict r = -0.66, and Depth r = 0.66) and inversely associated with symptoms of depression (r = -0.37), pathological narcissism (r = -0.29) and promiscuity (r = -0.42). The test-retest reliability of the total CTL-I was high with r = 0.81, suggesting the stability of answers over time.
   Conclusion: The proposed 41-item version of the CTL-I is a psychometrically sound and validated instrument measuring six dimensions of the concept of the CTL. The reported negative associations with clinically relevant parameters such as depression, pathological narcissism and promiscuity as well as associations with relationship qualities such as conflicts, support, and depth warrant its future use in burdened populations including couples in clinical settings.

AB Background Previous trials have shown that pridopidine might reduce motor impairment in patients with Huntington's disease. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether higher doses of pridopidine than previously tested reduce motor symptoms in a dose-dependent manner while maintaining acceptable safety and tolerability.
   Methods PRIDE-HD was a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2, dose-ranging study in adults (aged >= 21 years) with Huntington's disease at outpatient clinics in 53 sites across 12 countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA). Eligible patients had clinical onset after age 18 years, 36 or more cytosine-adenine-guanine repeats in the huntingtin gene, motor symptoms (Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score [UHDRS-TMS] >= 25 points), and reduced independence (UHDRS independence score <= 90%). Patients were randomly assigned (1: 1: 1: 1: 1) with centralised interactive-response technology to receive one of four doses of pridopidine (45, 67.5, 90, or 112.5 mg) or placebo orally twice a day for 52 weeks. Randomisation was stratified within centres by neuroleptic drug use. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in the UHDRS-TMS from baseline to 26 weeks, which was assessed in all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment (full analysis set). Participants and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2013-001888-23) and ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT02006472).
   Findings Between Feb 13, 2014, and July 5, 2016, 408 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=82) or pridopidine 45 mg (n=81), 67.5 mg (n=82), 90 mg (n=81), or 112.5 mg (n=82) twice daily for 26 weeks. The full analysis set included 397 patients (81 in the placebo group, 75 in the 45 mg group, 79 in the 67.5 mg group, 81 in the 90 mg group, and 81 in the 112.5 mg group). Pridopidine did not significantly change the UHDRS-TMS at 26 weeks compared with placebo at any dose. The most frequent adverse events across all groups were diarrhoea, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, falls, headache, insomnia, and anxiety. The most common treatment-related adverse events were insomnia, diarrhoea, nausea, and dizziness. Serious adverse events occurred in the pridopidine groups only and were most frequently falls (n=5), suicide attempt (n= 4), suicidal ideation (n=3), head injury (n=3), and aspiration pneumonia (n=3). No new safety or tolerability concerns emerged in this study. One death in the pridopidine 112.5 mg group due to aspiration pneumonia was considered to be possibly related to the study drug.
   Interpretation Pridopidine did not improve the UHDRS-TMS at week 26 compared with placebo and, thus, the results of secondary or tertiary analyses in previous trials were not replicated. A potentially strong placebo effect needs to be ruled out in future studies.
