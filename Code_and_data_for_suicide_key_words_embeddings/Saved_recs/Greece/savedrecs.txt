AB Objectives: To complete a 30-year interrupted time-series analysis of the impact of austerity-related and prosperity-related events on the occurrence of suicide across Greece.
   Setting: Greece from 1 January 1983 to 31 December 2012.
   Participants: A total of 11 505 suicides, 9079 by men and 2426 by women, occurring in Greece over the study period.
   Primary and secondary outcomes: National data from the Hellenic Statistical Authority assembled as 360 monthly counts of: all suicides, male suicides, female suicides and all suicides plus potentially misclassified suicides. Results: In 30 years, the highest months of suicide in Greece occurred in 2012. The passage of new austerity measures in June 2011 marked the beginning of significant, abrupt and sustained increases in total suicides (+35.7%, p < 0.001) and male suicides (+18.5%, p < 0.01). Sensitivity analyses that figured in undercounting of suicides also found a significant, abrupt and sustained increase in June 2011 (+20.5%, p < 0.001). Suicides by men in Greece also underwent a significant, abrupt and sustained increase in October 2008 when the Greek recession began (+13.1%, p < 0.01), and an abrupt but temporary increase in April 2012 following a public suicide committed in response to austerity conditions (+29.7%, p < 0.05). Suicides by women in Greece also underwent an abrupt and sustained increase in May 2011 following austerity-related events (+35.8%, p < 0.05). One prosperity-related event, the January 2002 launch of the Euro in Greece, marked an abrupt but temporary decrease in male suicides (-27.1%, p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: This is the first multidecade, national analysis of suicide in Greece using monthly data. Select austerity-related events in Greece corresponded to statistically significant increases for suicides overall, as well as for suicides among men and women. The consideration of future austerity measures should give greater weight to the unintended mental health consequences that may follow and the public messaging of these policies and related events.

ID MORTALITY; GREECE; BEHAVIOR
AB In Greece so far little attention has been given to suicide among women and no systematic analysis has been reported. The goals of the current study were to estimate the proportion of female suicides on the island of Crete, Southern Greece; to describe the victims' sociodemographic profile and suicide-related variables; and to identify potential changes in rates and suicide methods during a predefined time period or between age groups. A retrospective study was undertaken, reviewing all female suicides between 1999 and 2007, and information was extracted into a computerized database. The female suicide incidence in the region was estimated to be 3.2 per 100,000, 1.7 times higher than the corresponding incidence reported for mainland Greece. These women were more likely to be over 55 years of age, to have lived in the western part of the island and to have committed suicide by hanging and self-poisoning. The most interesting finding was that self-immolation accounted for the 4.8% of the female suicide cases in the study area, while there is no mention of suicide by burning in Greece hitherto.

AB Background: Immigrants have higher rates of suicidal behaviour in comparison to the indigenous population.
   Aims: To describe the characteristics of foreign nationality suicide completers and search for differences between them and native Greeks. This is the first study focused on immigrant suicide victims in Greece.
   Methods: Data were collected for all recorded cases of completed suicide for the two-year period November 2007 to October 2009 at the Athens Department of Forensic Medicine, the largest, by far, of its kind in Greece covering approximately 35% of the country's population. The material was collected using the method of psychological autopsy as well as from the victims' forensic records.
   Results: Nearly 10% of Greece's 11 million population are of foreign nationality. Approximately half of them live in Athens and its suburbs, an area where 35% of Greece's population lives. In our sample, 15.8% of the suicide victims were of foreign nationality (53 cases): 41 men (77.4%) and 12 women (22.6%). Higher suicide rates were found for citizens of Kuwaiti (9.1%), Somali (6.7%) and Afghan (0.9%) nationality (immigrant communities with very few members); the lower suicide rates were for individuals of Egyptian (0.01%), Ukrainian (0.01%) and Albanian (0.006%) nationality (the Albanian immigrant community is the largest in Greece). In comparison to their Greek counterparts, immigrant victims were younger (mean age 38.7 vs 54.9 years, p < .001) more often unemployed (p = .007) and with a history of alcohol abuse (p < .001). The main suicide method used by immigrants was hanging (p <.001) while for Greeks it was jumping from a height.
   Conclusions: Individuals who belong to small national communities seem to have the highest risk of dying by suicide. Immigrant suicide victims differ from the indigenous population in several parameters. Our data could help define the most vulnerable of them and apply more effective suicide prevention strategies.

AB BackgroundRecently, suicides in Greece have drawn national and international interest due to the current economic crisis. According to published reports, suicides in Greece have increased up to 40% and Crete has been highlighted as an area with the sharpest increase.AimTo investigate the suicide mortality rates in Crete between 1999 and 2013 and their association with the economic crisis.MethodsData on suicides were selected from the Department of Forensic Medicine files of the University of Crete.ResultsOur analysis showed that (1) Crete, has the highest suicide mortality rate in Greece, however no significant increase was observed between 1999 and 2013, (2) there were opposing trends between men and women, with women showing a decrease whereas men showed an increase in that period, (3) there was a significant increase of suicides in middle-aged men (40-64yrs) and elderly, although the highest unemployment rates were observed in young men and women, and (4) finally, there was a regional shift of suicides with a significant decrease in Western Crete and a significant increase in Eastern Crete.ConclusionsAlthough, Crete has the highest suicide mortality rates in Greece, we did not observe an overall increase during the last 15years, including the period of economic crisis. Furthermore, there was an increase in middle-aged and elderly men, whereas young men and women showed oppositional trends during the years of austerity. This may be related to the culturally different expectations for the two genders, as well as that younger individuals may find refuge to either strong family ties or by immigrating abroad. Finally, the relative increase of suicides in Eastern Crete may be explained by factors, such as the lack of community mental health services in that area.

AB Introduction: Recently there was a debate concerning the relationship between the economic crisis and an increase in attempted and completed suicides in Europe and especially in Greece. The aim of the current study was to calculate the rates of attempted and completed suicide per year in the county of Thessaloniki, Macedonia, northern Greece, for the years 2000-12, and to investigate their relationship with unemployment.
   Material and methods: The archive of the Emergency Outpatient Units of three hospitals was investigated and the results were projected to the county population. Data from the Hellenic statistics authority concerning regional general population and suicides and unemployment were used.
   Results: The rate of attempted suicides was 16.69-40.34 per 10(5) inhabitants for males and 41.43-110.82 for females. Medication was the preferred method for 95.93%. The completed suicide rates varied from 3.62 to 547 for males and from 0.19 to 1.95 per 10(5) inhabitants for females. The male attempt rate correlated negatively with regional male unemployment (-0.63). For females the respected value was similar (-0.72). Concerning competed suicide rates, the respected values were 0.34 and 0.65. The attempt was repeated by 15.34%; almost half-repeated within the same year and 75% within two years. The female to male ratio varied significantly across years with 2:1 (more females) being the probable value for attempts and 1:3.6 (more males) for completed suicides.
   Conclusion: This is the first study from Greece reporting rates on the basis of hospital archives. Attempt and suicide rates are low in Greece. Attempts are negatively and suicides are positively correlated with unemployment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ECONOMIC-CRISIS
AB This paper addresses the rising suicide rate in Greece since the economic crisis began in 2008. By 2011, Greek and international media were reporting the Greek suicide rate as the fastest rising in Europe; dozens of spectacular public suicides were taken as symptoms of an epidemic. In this paper, I explore different accounts of this epidemic: statistical studies and press reports on suicide since the crisis; notes written by people who committed or attempted suicide in public during the crisis; and narratives of suicidality from psychiatric patients before the crisis, in dialogue with local psychiatric epidemiologies. These accounts summon three axes of comparison around suicide in Greece: historical difference, defined by the economic crisis and the time before; locale, contrasting the public sphere of media coverage and consumption with a particular region distinguished by its suicidogenic features; and evidence, moving from the public discourse on suicide to clinical ethnographic research that I conducted in northeastern Greece a decade ago. I show that each way of accounting for suicide challenges the epistemologies and evidence at work in the others; the tensions and the interactions among them are signs of indeterminacy in suicide itself, taken as an object of inquiry. In the public discourse on the Greek crisis, the many meanings of suicide have been condensed and fixed as a politics of protest. Yet, I argue, comparison among epistemologies of suicide and recognition of its indeterminacy generate a space for thinking about suicide beyond the publicity of the crisis.

FX This paper has a long history, originating in my encounters with
   psychiatric patients and practitioners in northeastern Greece during the
   early 2000s. Among these people, I am especially grateful to the women I
   have renamed in this paper as Chrisanthi, Areti, and Paraskevi, who were
   so open with me about their experiences and so ready to reflect on them.
   I am also indebted to the clinical staff at the hospital and community
   mental health centers in Alexandroupolis and Sappes for their
   willingness to include me in their discussions. Early versions of this
   paper were presented at the panel, "The Indeterminacy of 'Global
   Health': Anthropology and Medical Humanitarianism in the Age of Global
   Health Education," at the 2013 Annual Meeting of the American
   Anthropological Association, and at the plenary session, " Greece in
   Transition: Reconsidering Anthropological Approaches to 'Crisis,'" at
   the 2013 Biennial Symposium of the Modern Greek Studies Association. I
   thank Othon Alexandrakis, Heath Cabot, Peter Locke, Neni Panourgia, and
   Saiba Varma in particular for their support, questions, and comments on
   those occasions. Thanks go as well to the anonymous CSSH reviewers for
   their robust and thought-provoking comments on my article manuscript,
   and to Andrew Shyrock and David Akin at CSSH for so ably and
   responsively seeing it through to publication. Finally, for their close
   attention and very helpful feedback on an early draft of this paper, I
   am grateful to my comrades in the 2013-2014 Ethnography and Theory
   working group convened by Didier Fassin at the Institute for Advanced
   Studies in Princeton. The writing of this paper was made possible by a
   Richard Stockton Bicentennial Preceptorship at Princeton University and
   a Membership at the Institute for Advanced Studies, Princeton. My
   research in Greece in 2001-2004 was supported by the German Marshall
   Fund of the United States, the Social Science Research Council, FLAS,
   and the Robert H. Lowie Endowment at University of California, Berkeley.

AB Objectives: There is a controversy about the impact of economic crisis on suicide rates in Greece. We analysed recent suicide data to identify who has been most affected and the relationships to economic and labour market indicators.
   Setting: Greece.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures: Age-specific and sex-specific suicide rates in Greece for the period 2003-2012 were calculated using data provided by the Hellenic Statistical Authority. We performed a join-point analysis to identify discontinuities in suicide trends between 2003 and 2010, prior to austerity, and in 2011-2012, during the period of austerity. Regression models were used to assess relationships between unemployment, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and suicide rates for the entire period by age and sex.
   Results: The mean suicide rate overall rose by 35% between 2010 and 2012, from 3.37 to 4.56/100 000 population. The suicide mortality rate for men increased from 5.75 (2003-2010) to 7.43/100 000 (2011-2012; p<0.01). Among women, the suicide rate also rose, albeit less markedly, from 1.17 to 1.55 (p=0.03). When differentiated by age group, suicide mortality increased among both sexes in the age groups 20-59 and >60 years. We found that each additional percentage point of unemployment was associated with a 0.19/100 000 population rise in suicides (95% Cl 0.11 to 0.26) among working age men.
   Conclusions: We found a clear increase in suicides among persons of working age, coinciding with austerity measures. These findings corroborate concerns that increased suicide risk in Greece is a health hazard associated with austerity measures.

ID SOCIOLOGICAL LITERATURE; PERIOD; TRENDS
AB Objective The economic crisis and the implementation of austerity measures in Greece lead to significant socioeconomic changes. The effects of the crisis were mainly felt by the Greek population during the years 2011 and 2012. This study aimed to investigate the impact of Greece's economic crisis on the seasonality of suicides in the Athens Greater Area.
   Methods Data were collected for all recorded cases of suicides committed over a 5-year period (from 2008 to 2012) from the Athens Department of Forensic Medicine. Two sub-periods were studied in relation to the economic crisis: 2008-2010 and 2011-2012. Seasonality was estimated with the Poison regression variant of the circular normal distribution.
   Results Suicide seasonality appeared significant during 2008-2010 (relative risk, RR=1.36) and strengthened in the years 2011-2012 (RR=1.69), when the impact of the austerity measures was increasingly being felt by the Greek society. Regarding the latter sub-period, seasonality was established for males (RR=1.75), individuals aged 45 years or more (RR=1.75) and suicide by hanging (RR=1.96).
   Conclusion The economic crisis in Greece, especially in the period during its effects had a significant impact on the population's economic condition, seems to have strengthened the seasonality of suicides, while a noteworthy suicide risk of 96% was revealed for suicides by hanging (peak in early June).

AB The financial crisis in Greece is largely impinging on the health and mental health of the population, raising concerns about a potential rise in suicide rates. The aim of this study was to explore changes in suicidal ideation and reported suicide attempts between 2009 and 2011 in a representative sample of the population and in several population subgroups. The socio-economic predictors of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in 2011 were also investigated. Two nationwide cross-sectional telephone surveys were conducted in 2009 and 2011 using the same methodology. A random and representative sample of 2192 and 2256 people, respectively, took part in the surveys. Between 2009 and 2011, there was a substantial increase in the prevalence of suicidal ideation and reported suicide attempts. People suffering from depression, men, married individuals, people experiencing financial strain, people with low interpersonal trust, and individuals with a history of suicide attempts were particularly vulnerable.

AB Background and aims: Since 2008, Greece has entered a long period of economic crisis with adverse effects on various aspects of daily life. In this frame, it is quite important to examine the suicide trends in Greece.
   Method: Our analysis covered the period 1992-2012. 2012 was the last year for which official suicide data were available. The inclusion of data for pre-crisis period enabled us to assess trends in suicide preceding the economic crisis, starting in 2008. Trends in sex- and age-adjusted standardized suicide rates (SSR) were analyzed using joinpoint regression.
   Results: Total SSR presented statistically significant annual decrease of 0.89% (95% confidence interval (CI): -1.7, -0.1) during the period 1992-2008. After 2009, the trend in total SSR increased statistically significant annual increase (12.48%; 95% CI: 0.3%, 26.1%). SSR in males presented an initial period of modest annual decrease (-0.84%; 95% CI: -1.6%, -0.1%), during the period 1992-2008. After 2009, an annual increase by 9.25% (95% CI: 2.7%, 16.3%) was revealed. No change in female SSR trend was observed during the studied period.
   Conclusion: According to the results of this study, there is clear evidence of an increase in the overall SSR and male SSR in Greece during the period of the current financial crisis.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the opinions of physicians and nurses on euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in advanced cancer patients in Greece. Two hundred and fifteen physicians and 250 nurses from various hospitals in Greece completed a questionnaire concerning issues on euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide.
   More physicians (43.3%) than nurses (3.2%, p<0.0005) reported that in the case of a cardiac or respiratory arrest, they would not attempt to revive a terminally ill cancer patient. Only 1.9% of physicians and 3.6% of nurses agreed on physician-assisted suicide. Forty-seven per cent of physicians and 45.2% of nurses would prefer the legalization of a terminally ill patient's hastened death; in the case of such a request, 64.2% of physicians and 55.2% of nurses (p=0.06) would consider it if it was legal.
   The majority of the participants tended to disagree with euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide in terminally ill cancer patients, probably due to the fact that these acts in Greece are illegal.

AB This study determines the risk factors associated with suicide rates and the investigation of time trends in the deprived region of Epirus, north-west Greece, which is considered to be one of the least developed prefectures of the EU. Data selected demonstrated:
   (1) a mean age-standardized suicide rate per year of 4.00/100,000 for males, 1.29/100,000 for females and 2.65/100,000 for the total population;
   (2) a significant rising trend of male suicides in the 35-44 and 65-74 age groups;
   (3) a low female suicide rate in < 35 years age group and a relatively stable rate in the other age groups;
   (4) a significantly higher suicide rate in men than in women from both urban and rural areas and in older men from rural areas;
   (5) higher rates of suicide among widowed men and unmarried women;
   (6) the use of predominantly violent suicide methods, especially self-shooting, hanging and drowning;
   (7) a significant peak in the total suicide rate in the spring and summer months and a decreased rate in September; and
   (8) three out of four of the suicide victims had consumed alcohol and/or other drugs before the act. Data reported here shows some remarkable trends compared to previous reports on suicide in Greece and other countries, probably due to cultural and life style characteristics of the study population.

AB Sharp-force trauma is a popular cause of homicide and suicide in many countries. Characterisation of the injuries between the two is crucial for a differential diagnosis. The current paper reviews 12 self-inflicted sharp-force trauma deaths from the island of Crete in Greece. Forensic reports between 1999 and 2015 were collated, and we studied the number and location of injuries, the demographic characteristics of the deceased, the sharp object and the medical history of the deceased. One third of the cases where the forensic reports were available (3/10) involved multiple injuries, and one case involved a combination of stabbing and hanging. Most injuries involved a kitchen knife. Ninety-two per cent (11/12) of the victims involved male Greek nationals aged >50 years. The type and location of injuries were not found to be specific to suicide alone. Thus, death-scene investigation remains crucial to the differential diagnosis between suicide and homicide. This is the first report on self-inflicted sharp-force fatalities in Greece.

AB Background: Whereas firearm suicide mortality has been a longstanding public concern worldwide, in Greece no systematic analysis has been reported so far despite the recent evidence of a rising rate of gun ownership. Aims: To estimate the proportion of firearm suicides on the island of Crete, Southern Greece, well-known for its widespread gun ownership; to describe the victims' sociodemographic profile and firearm-related suicide variables; and to assess the severity of suicidal intention in the group. Methods: Records of suicides between 1999 and 2007 were reviewed and information was extracted into a computerized database. A rating of the circumstances section of the Beck's Suicide Intent Scale (SIS) for each case was also performed. Results: The firearm suicide rate was 1.3 per 100,000, with males constituting the vast majority. These men were more likely to be less than 55 years of age, to have lived in the western part of the island, to have some degree of planning prior to the suicidal act, and to have used a shotgun, but less likely to have left a note. Conclusions: As an important first step toward implementing preventive initiatives the authors stress the need for a thorough look at the sociocultural factors associated with firearms in the region.

AB For the decade 2000-2010, suicidal rates appear to be both low and stable in Greece and unrelated to the socioeconomic environment. It is highly possible that the recent crisis caused a significant increase in dysphoria, stress, depression and maybe suicidal ideation in the general population, but completed suicides do not seem to have increased so far. Measures are needed to make sure there will be no increase in completed suicides in the near future, since historically, periods of socioeconomic instability might be related to increased suicidality. Community interventions reduce stigma and enhance help-seeking. However, only those including the creation of social support networks are essential in the fight against suicidality.

AB Background: Suicide is the second commonest cause of death among adolescents and young adults aged 15-35 years in Europe. Suicide attempts are a strong risk indicator for suicide. This article examines psychosocial factors associated with self-reported suicide attempts in adolescents in Greece and whether the reported increase in suicide attempts from 1984 to 2007 was accompanied by changes in the pattern of related psychosocial factors. Methods: Data were taken from nationwide probability sample surveys of Greek high school students aged 14-18 years in 1984 (n = 10 507) and 2007 (n = 9873). Logistic regression analysis was used to relate any self-reported suicide attempts to basic sociodemographic and psychosocial variables including family and psychological characteristics, and substance use. Results: Female gender, smoking, illicit drug use, low socio-economic status, not living with both parents, dissatisfaction with relationship with parents, visits to a doctor for psychological problems, depression, anti-social behaviour and low self-esteem were risk factors for self-reported attempted suicide by adolescents in both surveys. Significant interaction terms showed that the effects of gender and illicit drug use were smaller in 2007 than in 1984. However, low self-esteem became significantly more important. Conclusions: Several common psychosocial factors seem to be steadily related to self-reported suicide attempts by Greek adolescents in 1984 and 2007. However, the increase in self-reported suicide attempts between 1984 and 2007 has been accompanied by changes in the relative importance of correlates.

AB Introduction: Recently there was a debate concerning the etiology behind attempts and completed suicides. The aim of the current study was to search for possible correlations between the rates of attempted and completed suicide and climate variables and regional unemployment per year in the county of Thessaloniki, Macedonia, northern Greece, for the years 2000-12.
   Material and methods: The regional rates of suicide and attempted suicide as well as regional unemployment were available from previous publications of the authors. The climate variables were calculated from the daily E-OBS gridded dataset which is based on observational data
   Results: Only the male suicide rates correlate significantly with high mean annual temperature but not with unemployment. The multiple linear regression analysis results suggest that temperature is the only variable that determines male suicides and explains 51% of their variance. Unemployment fails to contribute significantly to the model. There seems to be a seasonal distribution for attempts with mean rates being higher for the period from May to October and the rates clearly correlate with temperature. The highest mean rates were observed during May and August and the lowest during December and February. Multiple linear regression analysis suggests that temperature also determines the female attempts rate although the explained variable is significant but very low (3-5%)
   Conclusion: Climate variables and specifically high temperature correlate both with suicide and attempted suicide rates but with a different way between males and females. The climate effect was stronger than the effect of unemployment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate suicide trends among individuals a parts per thousand currency sign 24 years of age in the region of Epirus, northwestern Greece, from January 1998 to December 2008. Twenty-one cases were classified as suicides out of 242 total deaths (8.7%). The male to female suicide ratio was 4.25 (17 males and 4 females). The preferred suicide method for those aged a parts per thousand yen 19 years involved firearms, and for those aged < 19 years was hanging. Alcohol was implicated in more than 50% of the suicides and was consumed exclusively by those aged > 16 years. Suicides by self-shooting were more often related to drinking than suicides by other methods. Children and adolescents (aged up to 15 years), older adolescents (15-18 years) and young adults (19-24 years) had suicide rates of 0.05/100,000, 0.10/100,000 and 0.39/100,000 inhabitants per year, respectively. These suicide rates are the lowest reported so far in Europe. The main reason for this may be the traditional lifestyle of the local population and the strong family ties that protect against suicide, especially for the young.

AB Suicide rates in Greece (and other European countries) have been on a remarkable upward trend following the global recession of 2008 and the European sovereign debt crisis of 2009. However, recent investigations of the impact on Greek suicide rates from the 2008 financial crisis have restricted themselves to simple descriptive or correlation analyses. Controlling for various socio-economic effects, this study presents a statistically robust model to explain the influence on realised suicidality of the application of fiscal austerity measures and variations in macroeconomic performance over the period 1968-2011. The responsiveness of suicide to levels of fiscal austerity is established as a means of providing policy guidance on the extent of suicide behaviour associated with different fiscal austerity measures. The results suggest (i) significant age and gender specificity in these effects on suicide rates and that (ii) remittances have suicide-reducing effects on the youth and female population. These empirical regularities potentially offer some guidance on the demographic targeting of suicide prevention measures and the case for 'economic' migration. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective To study the characteristics of a sample of suicide victims from the Athens Greater Area using the psychological autopsy method for the first time in Greece.
   Methods We studied all recorded cases of completed suicide for the 2-year time period November 2007 October 2009 collecting data from the victims' forensic records as well as from the completion of a psychological autopsy questionnaire.
   Results 335 persons were recorded as suicide victims. We contacted relatives of 256 victims interviewing those of 248 of them (96.9%). The differences regarding sex, marital and employment status between our sample and the general population were statistically significant (p<0.001). The male/female ratio was 3:1. Comparatively more victims were divorced, separated or single and a greater proportion were pensioners or unemployed. 26.0% of the victims had history of prior attempts (64.4% once, 20.3% twice and 15.3% more times). 42.6% were taking psychiatric medication-significantly more women than men according to blood tests; 14.2% had been hospitalized in a psychiatric clinic the year prior to their death. 84.8% have deceased at the place of suicide and 15.2% died in the hospital; 80.3% died indoors and 19.7% outdoors. Men died primarily by hanging or shooting by a firearm while women preferred jumping from height instead (p<0.001). As many as 48.8% had expressed their intention to die to their relatives; 26.6% left a suicide note.
   Conclusion Our study has shown that the psychological autopsy method is applicable and widely accepted yielding results comparable to the international literature. Specific parameters associated with suicide have been studied for the first time in Greece.

AB Background: Several studies have investigated the relationship between specific occupations and suicide mortality, as suicide rates differ by profession. The aim of this study was to investigate suicide mortality ratios across broad occupational groups in Greece for both sexes in the period 2000-2009.
   Methods: Data of suicide deaths were retrieved from the Hellenic Statistical Authority and comparative mortality ratios were calculated. Occupational classification was based on the International Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88) and the coding for Intentional self-harm (X60-X84) was based on the international classification of diseases (ICD-10).
   Results: Male dominant occupations, mainly armed forces, skilled farmers and elementary workers, and female high-skilled occupations were seen as high risk groups for suicide in a period of 10 years. The ageproductivegroup of 30-39 years in Greek male elementary workers and the 50-59 age-productive group of Greek professional women proved to have the most elevated number of suicide deaths.
   Conclusion: Further research is needed into the work-related stressors of occupations with high suicide mortality risk and focused suicide prevention strategies should be applied within vulnerable working age populations.

AB Elderly suicide rates are the highest of any age group. Greece is among the countries with the highest proportion of elderly people in the European Union (EU). Elderly suicide victims seem to possess different characteristics. Aim of our study was to elucidate the different characteristics of elderly suicide victims. Data was collected from a two-year psychological autopsy study, conducted at the Athens' Department of Forensic Medicine, the largest in Greece. Elderly suicide victims represented 35% of total suicides. The majority (69.5%) were males. Only 12.4% had previous psychiatric hospitalization but more than half (65.2%) had psychiatric history (81% of them had history of depression). As expected, there was a high incidence of physical illness (81.6%). The majority (82%) of the elderly suicide victims made a suicide attempt for the first time and it was unfortunately successful. When the elderly suicide victims were divided in two categories ("young-old" and "old-old") the differences between the two groups were: elderly over 75 years had more physical problems and more frequently positive psychiatric history without ever been hospitalized for psychiatric problems. Late life suicides seem to encapsulate population groups with different characteristics. Their differences can be a useful guide aiming to formulate specific suicide prevention strategies. This is of great importance, given the very high frequency of completed suicides in this age group. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Whether differences exist between those who do leave a suicide note and those who do not has not yet been comprehensively answered. Leaving a suicide note is not a random phenomenon: A minority, varying between 3-42%, of all suicide victims leave a note. Aims: To compare the group of suicide victims who leave notes with the ones who do not, using data from the Athens Department of Forensic Medicine, the largest in Greece. Methods: We examined sex, age, nationality, religious beliefs, marital and residential status, history of prior psychiatric disorder and psychiatric attempt(s), suicide method, physical disease, recent hospitalization, and existence of suicide notes. We completed psychological autopsy questionnaires after phone interviews with relatives of the suicide victims of a 2-year period (November 2007-October 2009). Results: Note writers, 26.1% of our sample, differed in the following: they died by hanging or shooting (p = .007), had no history of psychiatric illness (p < .001) or recent (i.e., within 12 months of the suicide) psychiatric hospitalization (p = .005). Conclusions: Our study showed that there are indeed differences between suicide victims who leave a note and those who do not. We also suggest some explanations for these differences, which could represent a valuable starting point for future research on this topic.

AB Introduction: There is a debate concerning the nature and the causes of the increase in the suicidal rates observed since 2011 in Greece.
   Material and methods: The data from the recent Hellenic Statistical Authority report on death causes for the year 2015 in Greece were used
   Results: The rates are stabilizing at a historical zenith (total increase 51.7% for males and 76.2% for females) with a possible decreasing trend (5.4% for males and 6.8% for females) already visible concerning several age groups since the previous year.
   Discussion: This coincided temporarily with the relative stabilization of the economic situation although unemployment was still very high. Further processing and analysis of the complete set of data concerning all causes of death throughout the last few years is necessary before definite conclusions can be made.

DT Article
DE Global raciality; precarity; Greece; suicide; biofinancialization;
   global capital
AB Many see precarity and precariousness as a 'global condition', others do not. Most of these authors share the idea that populations suffer from economic displacements and ought to be at the forefront of states' economic and labor policy agendas. However, these same authors, from different disciplines, presume an equivalency in precarity, missing that many peoples are racially exposed to injury, violence, and death. This article problematizes some of these disciplinarian notions and logics and argues that raciality is a global structure and a set of institutions of ordering and differencing through which the state resolves its contradictory demands by 'checking claims' about justice. Second, this article expands an analytics about subjectification and biofinancialization by reading how suicide and Greece are not projects but rather sites that expose the works of global raciality which aids, through the logics of precarity and the logics of 'obliteration,' the state's work for global capital.

AB According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimations, approximately 6 million people lose their lives yearly due to some kind of injury, while one-third of these incidents are due to violent acts. Violent deaths include accidents (road traffic accidents, drownings, falls, heat effects etc), suicides as well as homicides. Elderly people seem to be at greater risk due to their special characteristics as a vulnerable social group.
   The aim of this study was to investigate violent deaths (accidents, suicides and homicides) among elderly people in Attica, Greece, during the period 2011-2015 by examining manner of death with respect to demographic data (gender and age) and toxicological examination results. A total of 546 violent deaths among people over 65 years old were included in this study. Autopsy findings along with toxicological examination results were collected from the archives of the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.
   The findings of the study showed that most of the victims were male (63.74%). The overwhelming majority of violent deaths (425 cases) were accidents, 92 cases suicides, and the remaining 29 cases homicides. Drowning was the leading cause of all accidental deaths, followed by road traffic accidents. Hangings prevailed among violent suicide methods and asphyxiation presented as a predominant homicide method.

AB Background and Objectives: Economic adverse conditions are acknowledged as having a major impact on the exacerbation of mental disorders and suicides. The severity of current European crisis and the local unrelenting spending is affecting largely the economy of Greece.
   Methods: The aim of this study was to explore changes in suicides and their possible association with macroeconomic and behavioural factors. Data for the period 1990-2011 were drawn mainly from the Hellenic Statistical Authority and Eurostat. Suicide mortality rates were correlated with economic and behavioural factors.
   Results: Suicide mortality rates were increased by 55.8% between 2007 and 2011 while the total mortality was increased by 1.1% only. Significantly increasing trends in public debt, unemployment rates, consumption of daily units of antidepressants as well as divorces per 1000, homicides per 100,000 and persons with HIV per 100,000 were also observed. Suicides have been found to bear strong correlation with unemployment (r. 0.64). Significant associations were also found between suicide mortality and the percentage of public debt as percentage of GDP, the incidence of infections from HIV and homicides.
   Conclusions: People suffering from income and job losses, living in a demoralized social state caused by severe austerity measures and restrictive health policies, are exposed to risks for developing depression or commit suicide.

DT Article
DE suicide; prisons; prevention
AB Suicides in prison are not merely self-destructive acts or a "cry for help." They reflect the inherent need for freedom and the repercussions of imprisonment. SPACE statistics on suicides in prison reveal a rate above 10 per 10,000 in 10 European countries, 4 of which have a rate above 20. Greek data do not appear in all SPACE statistics. This fact has stimulated the present paper. Unpublished data obtained from the Greek Ministry of Justice reveal that Greece belongs to the group of countries. with a rate below 10 in 1995 (the year of SPACE statistics). However, the suicide rates fluctuated widely in Greece from a low rate of 3.2 per 10,000 prisoners (convicted, on remand, or hospitalized) in 1982 to the incredibly high rate of nearly 40 in the year 1979 (11 suicides, 10 of which occurred in prison hospitals). A review of the literature indicates that various limitations mentioned in relevant studies lie in the unreliability of data (doubts about the validity of official statistics, missing data in archives, missing files on the victims, suicide in juvenile Institutions not always recorded separately, etc.). The research emphasizes the importance of improving suicide statistics (recording, clearing up the incidents of deaths that are recorded without specification of cause, etc.) in order to plan and enforce suicide prevention and intervention strategies that seem to "work" in a particular milieu and are not debatable (e.g., the use of "suicide proof" cells).

AB While linkages between some macroeconomic phenomena and suicides in some countries have been explored, only two studies, hitherto, have established a causal relationship between fiscal austerity and suicide, albeit in a single country. The aim of this study is to provide the first systematic multiple -country evidence of a causal relationship of fiscal austerity on time-, gender-, and age-specific suicide mortality across five Eurozone peripheral countries, namely Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain over the period 1968-2012, while controlling for various socioeconomic differences. The impact of fiscal adjustments is found to be gender-, age- and time-specific. Specifically, fiscal austerity has short-, medium- and long-run suicide increasing effects on the male population in the 65-89 age group. A 1% reduction in government spending is associated with a 138%, 2.42% and 3.32% increase in the short, medium- and long-run, respectively, of male suicides rates in the 65-89 age group in the Eurozone periphery. These results are highly robust to alternative measures of fiscal austerity. Improved labour market institutions help mitigate the negative effects of fiscal austerity on suicide mortality.

AB We investigated all cases of completed suicide in the city area of Piraeus -the largest port in Greece-for the years 2006 up to 2015. We searched, among others, parameters regarding the victims' psychiatric medication intake and drug and alcohol use that -to the best of our knowledge-had never been investigated before by a study on suicides in Greece within the crisis' years. We documented variations before (2006-2010) and during (20112015) crisis. Information was provided by the victims' forensic records at the Piraeus Department of Forensic Medicine. During the period of the study 435 individuals died by suicide. "Before" crisis: 227 cases, 77,1% males, mean age 48.6 years (SD: 19.8), 85% Greek. "During": 208 cases, 79,8% males, mean age 51.4 years (SD: 17.7), 83.2% Greek. Psychiatric medication intake: "Before"-"During": 16.3%-29.8% (p = 0.003), males: 16.1%-31.7%, females: 19.6%-27.5% (p = 0.003). Drug use: opioids 2.7%(5.5%), cannabis 1.4%(5.5%), cocaine 0(1.5%), alcohol 14.5%(13.4%). Significant seasonality was observed only for suicides by jumping with a peak late in the month of July in the "Before" group. There were no significant differences regarding suicide method, place of suicide or place of death. The slight decrease in suicides within the crisis' years, together with the higher medication intake observed within the same period, could imply that more individuals were willing to accept their psychological difficulties and/or to commence treatment. Probably the stigma of psychiatric illness is somewhat lower after the beginning of the crisis and/or non-psychiatrists became more aware of the psychological origins of some of their patients' problems. Our findings tentatively suggest that, as the crisis persists, adaptive mechanisms have been set in motion.

AB Background The suicide rate is a macro indicator of the population's psychosocial wellbeing and an evaluation criterion of the effectiveness of suicide prevention strategies. A high level of injury deaths of undetermined intent (UD) is usually discussed in connection with the validity of suicide statistics. An effort is made to develop a criterion to characterise the quality of suicide statistics.
   Methods Standardised rates of suicides (X60-X84) and UD (Y10-Y34) by the International Classification of Disease version 10 as an average for the past five available years were taken from the WHO European mortality database. Rate ratios were computed by dividing rates of UD by suicide rates.
   Results There is considerable variation in suicide and UD rates among countries. The highest overall rates of UD were registered in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and the lowest in Greece, Spain and Italy. The EU-15 average UD rate of 1.97 and the rate ratio of 0.194 UD to suicides were combined into a '2-20 benchmark', in which the primary indicator is 2.0 UD cases per 100 000 and the secondary indicator is the proportion of UD to suicides 0.20 (20%), which enables countries to be clustered according to the quality of suicide statistics. The following countries satisfied the benchmark: Greece, Norway, Spain, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Austria, Italy, Romania, Hungary, Ireland and Finland.
   Conclusion This study used the developed '2-20 benchmark' in Europe to assess suicide registration quality in a particular country, to compare the relative position of countries, and to set a target for those European countries that have not yet achieved the benchmark.

AB Background: There are an estimated one million completed suicides per year worldwide. As a response to increasing concern about suicide within Europe, the EUROSAVE (European Review of Suicide and Violence Epidemiology) study was undertaken to examine recent trends in the epidemiology of suicide and self-inflicted injury mortality in the European Union (EU). Methods: Suicide and self-inflicted injury mortality data for the 15 EU countries for the years,1984-1998 were obtained from the World Health Organisation (WHO), the European Statistical Office of the European Commission (EUROSTAT) and national statistical agencies. Data were also obtained for a second group of deaths classified as 'undetermined' or 'other violence'. Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated and examined for trends over time. Results: Finland had the highest suicide rate, while Greece had the lowest for the latest available year (1997). Age-standardized suicide rates tended to be lowest in the Mediterranean countries. Significant downward linear time trends in suicide,mortality were observed in most countries, although rates varied markedly between countries. Both Ireland and Spain displayed significant upward linear trends in suicide mortality. Portugal had the highest rate of undetermined deaths-both in 1984 and 1998 while Greece had the lowest in both 1984 and 1997. Five countries (including Ireland and Spain) showed significant downward trends in deaths due to undetermined causes whereas Belgium and Germany showed borderline significant upward linear trends in deaths due to undetermined causes. Conclusions: Although suicide rates in most countries seem to be decreasing, the validity of the data is uncertain. Misclassification may contribute to the geographical and temporal variation in suicide rates in some EU countries but it does not explain the phenomenon. More detailed research comparing suicide-recording procedures and practices across the EU is required. In the absence of adequate EU wide data on suicide epidemiology, effective prevention of this distressing phenomenon is likely to remain elusive.

AB Running away from home and suicide attempts during adolescence are high-risk behaviors for safety and health, and a "way out" from negative life experiences.
   To examine the self-reported prevalence of running away and suicide attempts among adolescents in Greece in the midst of a severe economic recession which is exerting pressure on families, and to identify associated psychosocial factors.
   Data were drawn from a nationally representative school survey (n = 23,279, 15-19 years old). Students answered in their classrooms an anonymous questionnaire under the supervision of trained researchers.
   Each behavior was reported by one in nine adolescents (11.3 % for lifetime suicide attempts and 11.6 % for lifetime running away). Among those who reported the one behavior, a quarter also reported the other. Logistic regression analyses indicated that these behaviors share several common psychosocial correlates: family related (quality of parental relationships, parental monitoring), school related (poor performance and dissatisfaction), substance use, and emotional, psychological and behavioral problems. Gender was a significant correlate but in opposite directions for running away (more common among boys) and suicide attempts (more common among girls). Socioeconomic status was not a significant correlate for either behavior, possibly because the impact of the economic crisis on parents had not yet filtered down to their children in 2011 (the survey year).
   Findings suggest the need for timely interventions towards vulnerable youth and their families by identifying personal, familial and school factors associated with these two health- and life-compromising behaviors.

AB The aim of the study was to ascertain suicide seasonality in the Greek population and to associate this seasonal variation with age, sex, and suicide method. Studying seasonality can be of help in establishing a public health policy, related with suicide prevention. This is an epidemiologic study based on forensic evidence. We studied the deaths caused by self-injury (trauma), namely deaths by violent suicide (not self-poisoning). Statistically significant suicide seasonality was established with a peak in May. This seasonal variation is attributed mainly to males. As for the method, suicide by hanging peaks in June and by shooting in April. It was also observed that seasonality for individuals above the age of 45 peaks in early May.

AB With imprisonment rates rising in a large number of jurisdictions worldwide, ever more research attention has been paid to conditions of imprisonment and prisoner health. With a view to contributing to the emerging body of literature, this article offers a systematic summary of key findings from Greece. Prison establishments in this country are vastly overcrowded and material conditions of detainment are deplorable. Healthcare provision in prison is minimal and the prevalence of serious transmittable diseases and mental disorders amongst prisoner populations is high, as are the rates of deliberate self-harm, suicide and death more generally. Prisoner use of prescribed and illicit drugs is alarmingly common, especially as regards injection drugs, and drug overdose appears to account for the majority of deaths in custody.

ID DRINKING-WATER
AB The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association between lithium levels in the public water supply and prefecture-based suicide rates in Greece. Analyses were conducted with respect to lithium levels in 149 samples from 34 prefectures of Greece. The average lithium level was 11.10 mu g/l (range 0.1 to 121 mu g/l). The results indicate that there is a tendency for lower suicide rates in the prefectures with high levels of lithium in drinking water. Ecological studies explained by researchers Schrauzer and Shrestha have revealed the existence of statistically significant inverse associations between the lithium levels in drinking water and the incidence of suicides, homicides, rapes, possession of narcotic drugs, and in juveniles, the rates of runaway from home. Such a result of inverse relationship was not proven by Kabacs et al., most likely because the differences of the lithium levels in the selection of their case-control samples were not large enough. In addition, probably the selection of random regions in Japan and East England might have been biased. Thus, the addition of small amounts of lithium to the drinking water could provide an effective means to lower the incidence of these conditions in the general population. Furthermore, the nutritional importance of lithium in the form of the carbonate named lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) is currently still viewed primarily as a pharmacological agent. The study by Al-Chalabi et al. state that the therapeutic activity of lithium in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is worth investigating. Any drug that can be shown to slow the course of ALS in a clinically significant way and to be safe and well tolerated will be an important advance for patients with this disease.

AB Purpose: To examine the current debate over the right to die specific to the rational suicide of terminally ill patients.
   Methods: Literature was reviewed for information concerning historical end-of-life practices and the past acceptance of suicide. Another review showed philosophical opinions and perspectives that spanned from ancient Greece and the Roman Empire to modern philosophical discourse. A case study of a terminally ill woman who chose suicide is presented to apply the history and philosophy to nursing care today.
   Conclusions: As more nursing care is delivered in patients' homes, nurses will face this situation with increasing frequency. A call is made for organizations to provide guidelines for nursing practice.

AB Left ventricular assist device is used as a permanent therapy in patients with severe heart failure that are not candidates for organ replacement. It consists of a blood pump implanted in a patient's chest just below the heart. An electrical cable that powers the blood pump passes through the patient's skin to an external controller worn around the patient's waist.
   We present a rare case of a 72 years old man suicide: He found dead by his wife on his house stairs when she returned home in a small town in Greece. He was transferred to the local hospital were pronounced dead. He suffered from severe heart failure since many years and had implanted left ventricular assist device two years ago. The autopsy of the case took place in Forensic Service of Ministry of Justice in Thessaloniki - Greece revealed suicide by cutting the electrical cable of the device.

AB Self-inflicted burns represent a major social and medical problem. The aim of this study was to record the epidemiology, mortality and etiology of suicide attempts by burning, in Athens, Greece. Over a 6-year period from April 1997 to April 2003, all the medical charts of the patients who were admitted to the Burn Center of the General State Hospital of Athens, Greece, with self-inflicted burns were retrospectively studied. Of the 1435 burn patients, 53 (3.69%) had attempted suicide by self-inflicted burn. Their ages ranged from 18 to 90 years old (mean 53.5 years). Females (57%) outnumbered males (43%). The mean total body surface area (TBSA) burned was 41.6% (range: 15-100%). The overall mortality rate was very high (75.4%). A preexisting psychiatric disorder was present in 43.3% of the patients. In conclusion, the extent and the depth of the burn injuries could explain the high mortality rate seen in these patients, in correlation with their negativism to the treatment. Burn care professionals should be familiar with self-inflicted burn patients who constitute a considerable proportion of major burns and require constant psychiatric support in addition to burn care.

AB This study analyzed the forensic features of homicides in North-West Greece (Epirus) from 1998 to 2013, a borderland area between Greece and Albania. Although Greece is critically influenced by both the increasing flow of refugees and the current socioeconomic crisis, very little information has been published regarding the patterns of homicide in the country. Fifty-eight autopsied victims (36 males; 22 females) were investigated. The median age was 37 years old. The average annual homicide rate was 0.85 per 100,000 inhabitants and showed remarkable fluctuation, with largest increase during Greek financial downturn. Sixteen victims were not Greek citizens. The most common method of commitment was the use of firearm (40%). The main motives were economical causes (26%) and passion (14%). Four cases were categorized as matricide (7%), 3 as homicide-suicide (5%), 2 as patricide (3%) and 1 as infanticide (2%). Toxicological analysis proved negative for ethanol and other psychotropic substances in the majority of the victims (50%). There is an urgent need for public actions both in Epirus and in Greece, with the application of effective strategies against criminality.

AB Background: The role of pesticides in suicidal acts has not yet received adequate attention in Greece despite an evident rise of 39% in pesticide use over the period 1990-1992 to 2002-2004. Aims: To investigate the epidemiology of pesticide suicide on the Greek island of Crete. a largely rural agricultural area, and by further exploring the victim profiles, as well as patterns and trends of pesticide ingestion, to suggest probable preventive measures. Methods: Self-poisoning suicides between 1999 and 2007 were reviewed and information gathered was entered into a computerized database. Results: The overall incidence of intentional pesticide poisoning was 1.7 per 100,000, representing the second most frequently used suicide method after hanging. The victim profile was composed of the following features: middle aged male, rural habitant, who carried out a suicidal act by consuming primarily methomyl or paraquat (WHO toxicity class Ib and class II, respectively). As to the place of death, the vast majority was found dead in the place of intoxication. Conclusions: Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for a quarter of the suicides in Crete. More detailed research is required to identify aspects of these deaths amenable to prevention, but measures such as bans on the most toxic pesticides and changes in storage practice would appear to be sensible initial approaches.

AB This paper addresses the influence of economic activity on suicide mortality in Europe. To this end, it employs a new panel data set of 275 regions in 29 countries over the period 1999-2010. The results suggest that unemployment does have a significantly positive influence on suicides. In line with economic theory, this influence varies among gender and age groups. Men of working age are particularly sensitive, while old-age suicide mortality (older than 65years old) hardly responds to unemployment. Moreover, real economic growth negatively affects the suicide rates of working-age men. The results withstand several robustness checks, such as sample variations, and after controlling for serial and spatial autocorrelation. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) in Greek patients with a recent suicide attempt, the predictive ability of BHS especially in terms of age and the possible effect of the financial crisis on hopelessness as it has been identified as a significant suicide risk factor. The study included a total of 510 individuals, citizens of Athens, Greece. Three hundred and forty individuals (170 attempted suicide patients, and 170 -age and gender- matched healthy individuals used as controls) completed BHS before the financial crisis onset (from 2009 to 2010). A sample of 170 healthy individuals also completed the BHS after the financial crisis onset (from 2013 to 2014), when the impact of the austerity measures was being felt by the Greek society. The Greek BHS version demonstrated good psychometric properties and a sufficient degree of internal consistency. Attempted suicide patients (M=9) presented higher hopelessness than the controls (M=3). The patients' age positively correlated with hopelessness (r(s)=.35, p<.001), and the ROC curve revealed that the BHS ability to discriminate the individuals with pathological rates of hopelessness from those without, strengthened as age increased. No significant differences were found between the individuals evaluated before (M=3) and after (M=3, p>.05) the crisis onset. Nevertheless, regarding the latter group, the women, the younger individuals, the less educated, the unemployed and the participants with low or mediocre self-reported financial status presented increased hopelessness. Our findings suggest that BHS could be a useful instrument especially when screening for suicide risk in people of older age, and that the financial crisis in Greece had a greater impact on subgroups of the population regarding hopelessness.

AB This study examines trends in self-reported suicide attempts by Greek adolescents.
   Data were obtained from five nationwide school probability surveys, each of approximately 8,000-10,000 adolescents aged 14-18 years, carried out from 1984 to 2007. Students answered an anonymous questionnaire in their classrooms supervised by research assistants. Logistic regression analysis used as dependent variable any self-reported suicide attempts and as independent variables basic sociodemographic information and the year of the survey.
   Self-reported suicide attempts doubled in prevalence from 7.0% in 1984 to 13.4% in 2007. Female gender (odds ratio OR 2.49, 95% confidence interval CI 2.30-2.71), living in a single parent family (OR 1.91, CI 1.73-2.11), lower paternal education (OR 1.20, CI 1.10-1.31) and living in a major city (OR 1.17, CI 1.08-1.27 for Greater Athens and OR 1.13, CI 1.00-1.28 for Thessaloniki) were significantly associated with suicide attempts. A larger increase among males, from 2.4 to 8.4%, compared to females (11.5 to 17.9%) contributed to a decrease in gender differences.
   Changes in Greek society during the last 30 years, including loosening of family ties, increased drug use and stress because of the demands of school work, are hypothesised to have had an impact on the increasing trend in suicide attempts among adolescents.

AB Several important socio-behavioral public health problems that either peak or start during the second decade of life contribute to young people's mortality. The aim of this study was to explore patterns, rates, trends and regional variations of external-cause (due to environmental events/circumstances) mortality among young people aged 10-24 years in Greece, over the decade 2000-09.
   Data were electronically derived from the database of the Hellenic Statistical Authority to study general and specific mortality rates by major causes of death.
   Road traffic crashes (RTCs), illicit drug use and suicide accounted for 65.8, 14.7 and 4.8%, of total external-cause mortality, respectively. Mortality rates (deaths per 100 000) did not exhibit intra-country variability, were higher in young adults than in adolescents, in males than in females and decreased by 39%, from 33.6 in 2000 to 20.4 in 2009 (P < 0.001), due to declines in mortality from RTCs (from 21.3 to 14.3; P = 0.001), substance abuse (from 5.1 to 2.1; P = 0.003) and suicides (from 2.0 to 0.9; P = 0.003).
   External causes of young people's mortality were mainly psychosocial and behavioral in origin. Despite improvement over the decade, young people in Greece still have unmet health-care needs and may further benefit from a multipronged public health approach through improved youth-friendly health services.

AB Background: The global recession of 2007 has attracted research attention in regard to a possible increase of deaths by suicide among employed populations. The aim of the current study was to update the first Greek study on suicide mortality among broad occupational groups during 2000-2009, with the last available data covering the first period of economic crisis and recession in Greece. Methods: Data on suicide deaths for the age groups of 15-39, 40-49 and 50-59, between 2000-2013 were retrieved from the national statististical authority of Greece, ELSTAT. The coding of suicide used was X60-X84 (intentional self-harm), based on the 10th International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Comparative mortality ratio (CMR) and exact 95% confidence intervals (CI) are presented. Results: Males and females in the occupational group of clerks exhibited high and increased CMRs during the crisis period (2010-2013). Although high ratios for males in elementary, agricultural and fishery and armed forces occupational groups were monitored during the whole period, a decrease was evident during the crisis period. Increased trends in CMRs during the crisis were monitored for both males and females in the broad occupational group of members including managers, executives and directors. In addition, females especially in the 50-59 age group showed increased ratios and trends in several occupational groups during the crisis, especially in technologists and associate professionals, plant and machine operators and assemblers, professionals, and craft and related trade workers. Conclusions: Austerity-related stress should alert key stakeholders and provide mental health and suicide prevention interventions for employed occupations.

This is a study of quality of life (QoL), anxiety, depression, and stress in Greece following the austerity measures imposed after the crisis. A convenience sample of 901 adults completed (1) a brief survey form, (2) the Multicultural Quality of Life Index (MQLI), and (3) the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS). Results indicated higher DASS scores in comparison to other normative populations. Overall, QoL in Greece is lower for women, those who are single, the unemployed, and those with lower incomes. Implications for social work practice and the profession are discussed.

AB Suicide is a universally observed human behavior related to bio-psychological, social and cultural factors. The aim of the present study was to examine suicide in Cyprus, an island that has known many civilizations and cultures. All completed suicide cases in the Christian population of Cyprus during the years 1988-1999 were included in the study and they were analyzed according to age, gender, reported reasons for suicide and suicide methods. The main results indicate that: 1. The mean age-standardized suicide rate is the lowest in Europe, in males (3.08/100,000) and also in females (1.05/100,000). 2. Mean suicide rates increase significantly with age in males only. 3. Female suicide rates are highest in the 15-24 age group. 4. Statistically significant rising trends of male and female suicide rates in the all-ages group. 5. Suicide methods were mostly violent. Among males, the most common methods were poisoning, firearms-explosives, and hanging, while in females, jumping, hanging and poisoning. 6. Mental disorders, physical illness, interpersonal and financial problems were the main reported reasons for suicide. The epidemiological characteristics of suicide in Cyprus might be attributed to a combined effect of social and cultural factors and probably reflect influences from countries to which Cyprus is ethnically, historically or geographically related.

AB Trends in adolescent suicide rates (15-19 years) from 1979 to 1996 were compared with suicide trends in individuals of 20 years and over in 30 countries and with trends in rates of deaths due to undetermined causes in adolescents in 17 countries of the WHO European Region. In 21 of the 30 studied countries, male adolescent suicide rates increased during the study period (highest increases in Belarus, Kazakstan and Ireland) accompanied by far less increases or decreases in suicide rates of males of 20 years and over. Part of the observed increases in Sweden, Ireland and Greece can be attributed to improved suicide statistics, while increases in Finland, Belgium, Bulgaria and the United Kingdom can be even higher due to the rising classification of deaths as "undetermined". In Portugal, decreasing suicide trends seem to be misinterpreted by ignoring the vast increases in rates of undetermined deaths. Female adolescent suicide rates rose less markedly than in males in 18 countries, with the exception of strong increases in Norway, Ireland. Increases in female adolescent suicide rates were marginally affected by changes in classification practices and were accompanied primarily by declining suicide rates in females of 20 years and over.

AB 'Undetermined' (UnD) and accidental deaths (AccD) are explored as possible sources of 'under-reported-suicides' (URS) in 20 Western countries.
   WHO mortality rates per million of AccD, UnD and suicides analysed. UnD:suicides ratios of < 1:5 calculated as likely URS versus ratios > 1:10 unlikely URS and all correlated by sex and age.
   Male URS likely in 7 countries and in 11 for females. URS in AccD likely in 5 countries for both sexes only UnD and suicide rates the elderly (75+) significantly correlated.
   Strong indication of URS in the UK, Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany with likely URS in AccD in Greece, Portugal, Switzerland and USA. These findings have important implications, indicating that, with the exception of France and Japan, official reported suicide rates contain a degree of under-reporting, and especially for women yet it is essential to have accurate suicide data to ensure adequate service provision.

The downward trends were followed by an increase in concomitance with the 2008 global crisis in some countries, including Greece (annual percentage change=+6 in men and +11.8 in women), the Netherlands (+4.2 in men and +4.0 in women), and the UK (+1.6 in men), while the pre-crisis downward trends stopped in Germany, Italy, and Spain. The joinpoint analysis also revealed long-term rises in Brazil (+0.8 since 1990 in men and +1.8 since 1999 in women), Mexico (+1.3 since 1995 in men and +3.6 since 1990 in women), the USA (+1.7 since 2005 in men and +4.2 since 2010 in women), and Australia (+1.8 in men and +3.7 in women, since 2006 in both sexes).ConclusionsDespite downward trendsin several areas of the world, in some countries suicide rates increased since the 2008 global crisis.

TI Prevention of suicide with regulations aimed at restricting access to

   evidence

AB Background Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for 14-20% of suicides worldwide. Regulation aimed at restricting access to pesticides or banning highly hazardous pesticides is one approach to reducing these deaths. We systematically reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness of pesticide regulation in reducing the incidence of pesticide suicides and overall suicides.
   Methods We did a systematic review of the international evidence. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase for studies published between Jan 1, 1960, and Dec 31, 2016, which investigated the effect of national or regional bans, and sales or import restrictions, on the availability of one or more pesticides and the incidence of suicide in different countries. We excluded other interventions aimed at limiting community access to pesticides. We extracted data from studies presenting pesticide suicide data and overall suicide data from before and after national sales restrictions. Two reviewers independently assessed papers for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We undertook a narrative synthesis of the data in each report, and where data were available for the years before and after a ban, we pooled data for the 3 years before and the 3 years after to obtain a crude estimate of the effect of the ban. This study is registered through PROSPERO, number CRD42017053329.
   Findings We identified 27 studies undertaken in 16 countries-five low-income or middle-income countries (Bangladesh, Colombia, India, Jordan and Sri Lanka), and 11 high-income countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, UK, and USA). Assessments largely focused on national bans of specific pesticides (12 studies of bans in six countries-Jordan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Greece [ Crete], South Korea, and Taiwan) or sales restrictions (eight studies of restrictions in five countries-India, Denmark, Ireland, the UK and the USA). Only five studies used optimum analytical methods. National bans on commonly ingested pesticides in five of the six countries studied, including four studies using optimum analytical methods, were followed by reductions in pesticide suicides and, in three of these countries, falls in overall suicide mortality. Greece was the only country studied that did not show a decrease in pesticide suicide following a ban. There were no high-quality studies of restricting sales to people for occupational uses; four of the seven studies (in three of the five countries studied-India, Denmark, and the USA) showed sales restrictions were followed by decreases in pesticide suicides; one of the two studies investigating trends in overall suicide mortality reported a fall in deaths in Denmark, but there were also decreases in suicide deaths from other methods.
   Interpretation National bans on highly hazardous pesticides, which are commonly ingested in acts of self-poisoning, seem to be effective in reducing pesticide-specific and overall suicide rates. Evidence is less consistent for sales restrictions. A worldwide ban on the use of highly hazardous pesticides is likely to prevent tens of thousands of deaths every year. Copyright (C) The Author(s).

AB Background: Several articles refer to the negative health effects of the Greek current economic crisis. Within this context, increased percentages of suicidal attempts and ideation have been associated recently in Greece with the financial crisis. The aim of this paper is to clarify the association of suicidality (suicidal attempts and ideation) with socio-demographic, financial, psychological and psychiatric factors in the years 2009 and 2011 (before and after the implementation of the "memorandum of economic and financial policies" in Greece). Methods: Two nationwide, cross-sectional surveys were conducted from February to April of the years 2009 and 2011. The interview questions covered socio-demographics, the SCID I module for the detection of Major Depressive Episode (1-month prevalence) and the Index of Personal Economic Distress (IPED). Results: We have found that for the year 2011 participants who were male, and who had major depression, serious financial difficulties (high IPED score) and a history of suicide attempt(s) were more likely to experience suicidal ideation or to attempt a suicide. Conclusion: Early detection of depression especially in males and those experiencing financial distress is of great importance for reducing suicidality, especially in times of economic hardships.

AB The 2008 financial crisis has been seen as providing an opportunity for core eurozone members to push neoliberal policies onto the periphery in order to construct a European consolidation state. We adapt a policy transfer model to examine the extent to which the Troika transferred neoliberal policy onto Greece and Ireland. The size of the ideological gap between Troika policies and those embedded in the peripheral country was crucial when explaining why the Troika's policies were more brutal, intrusive and long-lasting in Greece than in Ireland, and why Greece proved more resilient to attempts to transfer policy than Ireland.

AB Background: Suicide attempts are a significant public health problem among youth, resulting in a major social and economic burden for communities and a devastating impact on families. Aims: To determine whether we can identify distinct clinical profiles using latent class analysis in a clinical sample of Greek adolescents who were admitted to hospital following a suicide attempt. Method: Data on 11 clinical parameters from 182 adolescents were analyzed, with a two-class solution selected as the best fitting among the one- through three-class solutions that were examined. Results: We observed two distinct classes, specifically in the probability of mood disorders, substance use disorders, abandonment/neglect, and displaying traits of personality disorders. While most of the adolescents who attempted suicide showed a low probability of these parameters (71.7%), about a third of the sample (28.3%) showed a much more severe clinical profile. Analyses of pertinent contextual and risk factors indicated that those with a more severe clinical profile tend to come from overall more dysfunctional family systems, have more problems in school, and have made a previous attempt. Conclusion: We conclude that the adolescent suicide attempt population is a heterogeneous group in need of focused differentiated care specifically targeted to particular subgroups.

AB Suicide is the most extreme form of violence of one person upon him/herself and one of the least understood phenomenon among violence related behaviors and, therefore, one of the most condemned, both by community and religion.
   Recent statistics (suicide rates dynamics in Greece) show us that suicide can be strongly associated with the socio-economic context of a population or some medical conditions of the subjects, but these are not all the factors that can account for the phenomenon.
   When it comes to suicide among adolescents, the topic gets even more complex. The recently encountered "emo" movement has made us confront some of our most important fears related to the young generation.
   In this context, many youth-targeted initiatives were designed and implemented in all countries facing an increase in suicide rates among adolescents. One of these initiatives, implemented in two Romanian counties (lasi and Timis), will be presented as a good practice model. The project was addressed to and mainly implemented by adolescents, thus making the activities very accessible to the main target group: adolescents at risk.
   The methodology and main outputs of the project will be presented. Also, some aspects regarding the impact of the project and its multiplier effects are also discussed.

AB Background: Verbal expression of suicidal feelings has rarely been investigated in the literature, particularly regarding individuals who died by suicide.
   Subjects and methods: We retrospectively collected data on the suicide cases of the period November 2007-October 2009 from the Athens Greater Area and completed psychological autopsy questionnaires after phone interviews with their family members. The specific question was: "Has your relative expressed to you his/her deep suffering or the intention to end his/her life at any time during the six months prior to the suicide?"
   Results: Data were collected for 248 individuals who died by suicide out of a total of 335. 121 of them (48.8%) had verbally communicated their intention to die -or their profound suffering-to their family members. Suicide communicators were older (p<0.001), less educated (p=0.04), more frequently divorced or separated and less often single (p<0.01) than non-communicators. They had more often positive psychiatric history (p=0.004) and were less physically well (p=0.005), in comparison to non-communicators. Differences regarding sex, nationality, previous attempts, suicide note-leaving, completed suicide method and hospitalization either for physical illness or psychiatric disorder the year prior to the suicide were not statistically significant among the two groups. Considered that we interviewed only one relative for every case, the actual number of suicide communicators would be probably higher; the suicidal feelings could have been disclosed to another relative instead.
   Conclusions: This is the first time that a similar study was carried out in Greece. We found that approximately half of the individuals who died by suicide in our sample had been (verbal) suicide communicators. The latter seem to present distinct characteristics. These findings, coupled with the observation that the relatives are keen observers of the suicidal feelings of their loved ones, could provide new insights to future suicide prevention efforts.

DE Antiquity; modern era; suicide; Western culture
ID DEPRESSION
AB Objective: The aim of this paper is to examine the cultural roots and transmission of Western suicide and suicidal behaviour. Method: We explored a period of antiquity (mythical Greece - 61 CE) and selected accounts of 10 prominent suicides. The precipitating circumstances were tabulated and an assessment made of the most likely attendant emotions. The same process was followed for a recent period (1994-2008), from which 10 suicides were identified. The precipitating circumstances and the attendant emotions were compared. These circumstances and emotions were then compared to statements commonly encountered in clinical practice from people demonstrating suicidal behaviour. Finally, we looked for evidence that these stories (and the response models) had entered Western culture. Results: Precipitating circumstances, loss of a loved one, actual or imminent execution or imprisonment, other losses and public disgrace, and the negative emotions of shame, guilt, fear, anger, grief and sorrow were common to both historical periods. These circumstances and emotions are similar to those commonly expressed by people who have demonstrated suicidal behaviour. There was a clear record (literature, visual arts) of these stories forming part of our cultural heritage. Conclusion: Models of maladaptive responses to certain adverse circumstances are part of Western culture. Suicide as a response to certain circumstances and negative emotions can be traced back more than 2000 years. Cultural change will be necessary to minimize suicide.

AB Background: Comorbidity of suicidal behavior with various risk factors has been reported. This study examines the combined effect and the interactions of the most prominent risk factors in hospitalized suicide attempters.
   Method: Seventy-six successive hospitalized suicide attempters and 76 matched control subjects, 9 to 20 years old, were subjected to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition Axis I and Axis 11 diagnoses and were interviewed for the use of licit and illicit substances. Also, 18 control subjects with the same psychiatric disorders diagnosed in the attempters were examined. Logistic regression analysis was applied to determine the independent effect of the risk factors to suicide attempts.
   Results: The findings showed an 18-fold greater frequency of psychiatric disorders, a 14-fold greater frequency of other conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention (mainly relational problems), a 9.7-fold greater frequency of smoking, and a 4.7-fold greater frequency of psychosocial and environmental problems in the attempters than in the control subjects. The independent association of these factors with increased suicide risk persisted after adjusting for the effect of other factors.
   Conclusions: Psychopathologic behavior, psychosocial factors, and smoking are independently associated with increased risk for serious suicide attempts. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Suicide rates in correctional institutions have been increasing during the last decades. The reasons for this increase remain unclear, yet a lot of contradictory explanations were stated: the increase might be due to mass incarceration and overcrowding of small cells resulting in high psychosocial stress, changes in psychiatric health policy which might have transferred the care for patients from mental hospitals to custodial institutions, or legislation changes that might have led to a selection of offenders at higher risk (e.g. offenders who committed high violent offences or suffered from mental disorders without being referred to psychiatric hospitals). In Greece the situation is not described in details, at least during the last few years. By law, every death of prisoner is subject to medicolegal investigation.
   Materials & methods: Our study consists of the meticulous research of the data records of major Greek correctional facilities, for the time period 1999-2010. An official permission was obtained from the Hellenic Ministry of Justice, which gave us access to these restricted records. Data was also collected from the Piraeus Forensic Service, from the Department of Pathological Anatomy of the University of Athens and finally from our own records. Measures were taken to respect the anonymity of the cases. Data was collected for the social, penal, medical history as well as for the medicolegal investigation.
   Results - conclusions: A total of 339 cases were collected, only 259 of which had available full data records, due to weaknesses in the prison records. From the 259 cases, 70 incidents of suicide were collected. Victims of suicide in major Greek correctional facilities, appear to fulfill the expected profile, as in the general population.

AB Objectives: Suicide rates have widely been reported to peak in spring and summer. A frequent hypothesis is that increased sunlight exposure alters biological mechanisms. However, few attempts have been made to systematically untangle the putative suicidogenic risk of sunlight exposure from that of seasonality. We examined whether average hours of daily sunlight in a month confer additional risk over month of year when predicting monthly suicide rates.
   Design: Historical population-based ecological longitudinal study.
   Setting and participants: We used 3 longitudinal studies (n=31 060 suicides) with monthly suicide and meteorological data from Greece (1992-2001), Victoria, Australia (1990-1998) and Norway (1969-2009).
   Intervention: We used a negative binomial regression to observe (1) the association of month of year with suicides, adjusting for different sunlight exposures, and (2) the association of sunlight exposure with suicides, adjusting for month of year. We then investigated claims that suicides were associated with daily sunlight exposures, defined by us as 2550 sunlight exposure combinations corresponding to a 1-50 days exposure window with lags of 0-50 days.
   Results: Using monthly data, the association between month of year and suicides remained after adjusting for mean daily hours of sunlight and change in the mean daily hours of sunlight. Adjusted for month of year, the associations between sunlight exposure and suicides became non-significant and attenuated towards the null (the coefficient estimate for mean daily hours of sunlight decreased in absolute magnitude by 72%). The findings were consistent across all 3 cohorts, both when analysed separately and combined. When investigating daily sunlight exposures, we found no significant results after correcting for multiple testing.
   Conclusions: Using monthly data, the robustness of our month of year effects, combined with the transient and modest nature of our sunlight effects, suggested that the association between sunlight exposure and suicide was a proxy for the association between seasonality and suicide.

AB Introduction: According to Greek legislation the medico-legal investigation of deaths occurring in prisons is mandatory. Furthermore, in cases of suicide or of suspected suicide the contribution of medico-legal investigation is of grave importance. The current paper addresses the medico-legal investigation of suicide cases in Greek correctional facilities and aims to describe the current situation.
   Materials & methods: Our study consists of the meticulous research in the data records of major Greek correctional facilities, for the time period 1999-2010. Official permission was obtained by the Hellenic Ministry of Justice, which provided us the access to the records. Data was also collected from the Piraeus Forensic Service, from the Department of Pathological Anatomy of the University of Athens and finally from our own records. Measures were taken to respect the anonymity of the cases. Data was collected for the social, penal, medical history as well as for the medico-legal investigation.
   Results-conclusions: It appears that 85.7% of suicide cases were transferred to the Prisoner's Hospital (p < 0.0001), the forensic pathologist who conducted the PME did not perform scene investigation in none of the 70 suicide cases. In a total of 70 cases, histopathological examination, was requested only in 30 cases (42.9%). Hanging was the preferred method for those who committed suicide, followed by the poisoning due to psychoactive substances.
   Understanding the mistakes made during the forensic investigation of suicide cases inside correctional facilities is necessary, in order to prevent them from occurring again in the future, by implementing appropriate new policies and guidelines.

AB Objective. To investigate changes in attempted suicide rates in Castile-La Mancha between 2006 and 2015 and the correlation with sociodemographic and economic indicators.
   Methods. Study of attempted suicides attended by the emergency medical services of Castile La Mancha between 2006 and 2015. We obtained records of the number of incidents and recorded sociodemographic and economic variables. Rates were standardized by direct reference to regional population figures, and change over time was studied by means of segmented Poisson regression models. The correlation with economic indicators was assessed with the Pearson correlation coefficient.
   Results. A total of 1308 attempted suicides were attended; 711 (55.8%) were made by women. The years 2007 and 2013 saw the highest numbers of attempts. The population-standardized suicide rates were 23% higher in women than in men, 10% higher in Toledo than in Albacete, 20% higher in 2007-2008 and 30% to 40% higher between 2012 and 2015 than before the crisis began. Rates were higher in age brackets in which employment is usual. Rates correlated most strongly with economic strain (difficulty making it to the end of the monthly pay cycle) (r=0.29, P<.01), risk of poverty/exclusion in the region (r=0.285, P<.01), and the unemployment rate in the region (r=0.265, P<.01).
   Conclusions. Suicide rates rose during the economic recession. There were variable correlations between socioeconomic indicators and attempted suicide rates.

   regime matter?

DT Article
ID ECONOMIC-CRISIS; GREAT RECESSION; MENTAL-HEALTH; MORTALITY; COUNTRIES;
   GREECE; IMPACT; STATES; RATES
AB Disentangling the immediate effects of an unemployment shock from the long-run relationship has a strong theoretical rationale. Different economic and psychological forces are at play in the first moment and after prolonged unemployment. This study suggests a diverse impact of short- and long-run unemployment on suicides in liberal and social-democratic countries.
   We take a macro-level perspective and simultaneously estimate the short- and long-run relationships between unemployment and suicide, along with the speed of convergence towards the long-run relationship after a shock, in a panel of 10 high-income countries. We also account for unemployment benefit spending, the share of the population aged 15-34, and the crisis effects.
   In the liberal group of countries, only a long-run impact of unemployment on suicides is found to be significant (P = 0.010). In social-democratic countries, suicides are associated with initial changes in unemployment (P = 0.028), but the positive link fades over time and becomes insignificant in the long run. Further, crisis effects are a much stronger determinant of suicides in social-democratic countries. Once the broad welfare regime is controlled for, changes in unemployment-related spending do not matter for preventing suicides.
   A generous welfare system seems efficient at preventing unemployment-related suicides in the long run, but societies in social-democratic countries might be less psychologically immune to sudden negative changes in their professional lives compared with people in liberal countries. Accounting for the different short- and long-run effects could thus improve our understanding of the unemployment-suicide link.

AB The aim of the study was to assess nursing diagnoses and nursing interventions that were accordingly implemented during the care of inpatients with major depression in Greece. Twelve nurses working in three major psychiatric hospitals were recruited. Semi-structured interviews were used and audio-recorded data indicated that risk for suicide, social isolation, low self-esteem, sleep problems, and imbalanced nutrition are the nursing diagnoses most commonly reported. Establishing trust and rapport is the primary intervention, followed by specific interventions according to each diagnosis and the individualized care plan. The findings of the study also highlight the need for nursing training in order to teach nurses initial assessment procedures and appropriate evidence-based intervention techniques.

AB Background: Prospective cohort studies on biological risk factors of completed suicide are scarce. We aimed to test which biological risk factors independently identify subjects at increased risk of suicidal death.
   Methods: In the prospective cohort of the Seven Countries Study, 5,321 middle-aged men from Finland, Serbia, Italy, and Greece were included. Completed suicide (ICD-8 codes E950-959) was assessed during 40 years of follow-up. Biological cardiovascular risk factors (including forced vital capacity [FVC] and height) were tested for their role as predictors in multivariable Cox models stratified by country.
   Results: There were 4518 deaths during follow-up, with 64 from suicide (1.4%). In univariable models, only FVC and height were strongly inversely related with suicide. Socio-economic status and being unmarried were potential confounders. In multivariable models taking these confounders into account, both a low FVC (0.30 for top vs. lowest quartile: 95% CI: 0.12-0.76: P=0.006 for trend) and a low FVC/height ratio (0.37 for top vs. lowest quartile; 95% CI: 0.17-0.82; P=0.004 for trend) were strongly inversely related with completed suicide.
   Limitations: Information oil proximal causes, such as prior Suicidal ideation, emotional distress and depression, was lacking at baseline.
   Conclusions: Poor respiratory function in middle-aged men was an independent risk factor for completed suicide. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Economic downturns have been found to yield adverse consequences on the mental health of the population internationally. In Greece, a series of epidemiological nationwide surveys following the same methodology have recorded a gradual increase in one-month prevalence of major depression during the time period 2008-2011 and a corresponding rise in rates of suicidality. Logistic regression models have identified particular population sub-groups being at increased odds of manifesting major depression and suicidality and highlight the role of financial hardship in the onset of mental illness. Since the impact of economic downturn on mental health is generated through various pathways, any intervention aiming at mitigating the mental health effects of the crisis should be multifaceted. Telephone helplines constitute a promising venue for alleviating people's suffering.

AB Background: Due to the current economic crisis in Greece, effects on health and healthcare have been reported. The aim of this study was to present a systematic overview of the consequences that the financial crisis has had for health and healthcare in Greece. Methods: Systematic literature review was conducted in order to identify articles that were published from January 2009 to March 2013 and explicitly referred to the effects of economic crisis on health or healthcare, in Greece. Data extraction and synthesis was performed with the use of thematic analysis.
   Findings: Thirty-nine studies were considered for further analyses. Various existing and potential relevant effects were identified, including reductions in public health expenditure and changes in healthcare services and the pharmaceutical market, with an increasing number of admissions in public healthcare sector, and efficiency and organizational-related issues being evident, overall. Indications were found for post-crisis deterioration of public health with increasing rates of mental health, suicides, and epidemics, and deterioration of self-rated health.
   Conclusion: The recent efforts to reform the Greek National Health System have been focusing mainly on short-term effects by reducing expenditure, while the measures imposed seem to have dubious long-term consequences for Greek public health and healthcare.

AB In this retrospective study, we report the epidemiological characteristics of all poisoning deaths in Epirus, Greece, from 1998 to 2010; we present the toxicological findings and the statistical evaluation of the results. This is the first detailed scientific report on all the officially certified poisoning deaths concerning part of the Greek population. A total of 126 poisoning fatalities were recorded, 67 of them being mono-intoxications (53.2%). The cause of poisoning was as follows: drugs of abuse (60%); carbon monoxide (19.8%); pesticides (9.5%); corrosives (4.8%); pharmaceuticals (4.8%); and spider bite (0.8%). The most frequently detected poisonous substances were as follows: heroin (65 cases), ethanol (55), benzodiazepines (42), carbon monoxide (25), cocaine (17), cannabinoids (17) and pesticides (12). Increasing tendency in poisoning death rates was recorded, due to an increase in accidental poisoning deaths attributed mainly to drugs of abuse (total, accidental, and drugs-of-abuse poisoning death rates per 100,000 inhabitants per year were 1.87, 1.19, and 0.79, respectively, in the period 19982002 and 3.97, 3.41, and 2.55, respectively, in the period 20072010).

ID SUPPLEMENTATION
AB The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association between lithium levels in the public water supply and incidences of homicide in Greece. A total of 149 samples of drinking water were collected from 34 out of 52 prefectures, and data for homicides were taken from National Statistic Service of Greece (Hellenic Statistical Authority - EL.STAT). The average lithium level was 11.10 mu g/l (SD = 21.16). The results indicate that there is a tendency for lower mean number of homicides in the prefectures with high levels of lithium in drinking water (R (2) = 0.054, beta = -0.38, p = .004). Considering the results of our previous study, which showed an inverse association between the lithium levels in drinking water and the incidence of suicide, homicide, rape, and drug abuse, we suggest that natural lithium level intake may influence impulsiveness, a factor that mediate to the manifestation of both suicidality and aggressiveness.

AB Suicide and non-accidental poisoning are Two important causes of death of female aborigines in Taiwan. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of suicidal ideation and then to identify factors relating to this for Female aborigines of childbearing age. Using stratified random sampling 212 female aborigines, aged between 20 and 49, were recruited into this study. Participants were interviewed at their homes by trained interviewers who used a structured questionnaire. The Suicidal Ideation Screening Questionnaire (SIS-Q) was used to help predict which participants would be more likely to have suicidal ideation. The prevalence rate of suicidal ideation within the previous 12 months was 20.3% (95% CI 14.9-25.7%). Significant related factors of suicidal ideation, which were analyzed by multiple logistic regression, revealed that women suffering depressive mood, living within a extended family, and perceiving poor health status were more likely to have suicidal ideation. Results generated from this study may be used, in primary care, for guidance as to how to prevent suicide. Outreach community programs incorporating a valid and sensitive screening instrument, such as the SIS-Q, should be implemented to help prevent suicides in aboriginal communities.

AB The social and economic development of a country is based on the study of the health level of its population that is directly or indirectly affected by many factors associated with 'health indicators'. From the analysis of the health status of Greece and Spain before and after the economic crisis, the health level of the Greek population is generally good, and the health level of the Spanish population does not seem to be affected by the crisis. On the contrary, the economic crisis in Greece and Spain seems to affect indicators that concern: the incidence of HIV and the birth rate of live offspring weighing less than 2500 grams. In addition, indicators in Greece are also affected: deaths from attacks, suicides and deliberate self-injuries. Finally, the per capita total health expenditure is worse in Greece than in Spain. It is important to note that the national and international statistical data used and elaborated in this article do not exceed 2014, which does not reflect the most recent state of health of the two countries. It is estimated that the data is relatively small for a safer estimate and the effects of the crisis will be better for longer. However, it is estimated that the reduction in per capita health expenditures as well as protracted unemployment and its consequences are highlighted in important issues.

AB The global economic crisis has affected the Greek economy with unprecedented severity, making Greece an important test of the relationship between socioeconomic determinants and a population's well-being.
   Suicide and homicide mortality rates among men increased by 22.7% and 27.6%, respectively, between 2007 and 2009, and mental disorders, substance abuse, and infectious disease morbidity showed deteriorating trends during 2010 and 2011. Utilization of public inpatient and primary care services rose by 6.2% and 21.9%, respectively, between 2010 and 2011, while the Ministry of Health's total expenditures fell by 23.7% between 2009 and 2011.
   In a time of economic turmoil, rising health care needs and increasing demand for public services collide with austerity and privatization policies, exposing Greece's population health to further risks.

AB In the last decades, a growing number of studies worldwide have substantiated the link between adverse socio-economic conditions and suicide. This effect is becoming even more prominent nowadays, as the global recession has increased the risk in vulnerable population groups. The current review presents evidence from the international literature on the relationship between suicidality and economic downturns, highlighting the socioeconomic factors that are shown to contribute highly to the manifestation of suicidal behavior. In this context, special emphasis is given on the role of unemployment, as well as on the nature of working conditions shaped by the global recession, that have been shown to bear a strong association with mental health problems and suicide. In Greece, the course of suicidality during the current economic downturn is explored by recent studies that document a substantial rise in the pertinent rates. Concomitantly, this increment has been found to be related to various socio-economic indices, with a series of Greek studies indicating that the substantial effect of the crisis on suicidality is independent of mental illness. Overall, the growing body of research on the psychosocial determinants of mental health raises questions with regard to the observed shift from the psychopathological substrate of suicidality to its socio-economic underpinnings.

AB Carbon monoxide (CO) is the cause of more than one half of the fatal poisonings throughout the world. The aim of this study was to assess the characteristics of nonfire CO-related deaths in Greece, as they were recorded at the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, School of Medicine, University of Athens. This retrospective study concerned the toxicological records of all fatal cases of CO poisoning received by the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology during the period 1987 to 2009. The records were reviewed and compiled according to the official coroner's verdict as to the manner of poisoning (accident or suicide), as well as according to the sex and the nationality of the victims. The registered victims were 176 (131 males, 45 females). Of CO deaths, 97.2% were accidental, and 2.8% were suicides, through automobile exhaust. Among the decedents, 32 victims were immigrants (30 males, 2 females). The average annual death rate for males was nearly 32 times higher than that for females. This increase suggests a need for preventive strategies targeting not only high-risk population, such as homeless or immigrants, but also the general population. Preventive messages in many languages through the media about potential sources of CO exposure are recommended. Precautions should also be taken during periods of low temperatures.

AB Suicidality is considered to be a typical adolescent behavior. In Greece the rate of suicide is among the lowest internationally. This study investigates the psychological characteristics of all cases (61) of suicide attempt which were reported in a Child and Adolescent Community Center during 1997-2007. The data concern age, gender, socio-demographic and family factors, academic factors, psychiatric symptomatology, previous suicidal behavior, referral and treatment compliance. Age range was 12.4-18.1 years (mean age 15.6 years). Family socio-economic status was low (71%) or moderate (29%). Most families presented symptoms of dysfunction: family conflicts (47%), divorce (38%), inadequate parenting (12%). 25% of cases had experienced school failure and 6% were drop-outs. 61% presented psychiatric morbidity (30% depressive disorders). 46% declared previous suicidal behavior. 13% had parental psychiatric history. 48% dropped out of the treatment. The need for community based prevention became evident.

AB A number of health outcomes were affected by previous financial crises, e. g. suicides, homicides and transport accident mortality. Aim of this study was to analyse the effects of the current financial crisis on selected health outcomes at population level in Europe. Methods: A mixed approach of ecologic and time trend design was applied, including correlation analysis. For eight countries, data on the economic situation (unemployment rate and economic growth) and health indicators (overall mortality, suicide and transport accident mortality) was drawn from EUROSTAT database for 2000-10. Spearman's rank correlation was applied to analyse the influence of social protection on the association between exposure and outcome variables. Results: The financial crisis had no visible effect on overall mortality in any of the eight countries until 2010. Transport accident mortality decreased in all eight countries, in the range of 18% in Portugal to 52% in Slovenia. In contrast, suicide mortality increased in Germany (+5.3%), Portugal (+5.2%), Czech Republic (+7.6%), Slovakia (+22.7%) and Poland (+19.3%). The effect of unemployment on suicide is higher in countries with lower social spending (Spearman's r = -0.83). Discussion: Clear cause-effect relations could not be established owing to the ecological study design and issues concerning data availability. However, there are clear changes in suicide and transport accident mortality after onset of the crisis, and findings are consistent with previous work. As part of this work, a comprehensive framework was developed, which can be applied to analyse health effects of financial crises in more detail.

AB In Greece, a seismogenic country, several studies have explored the psychopathological reactions among exposed populations. In this article, all research publications related to psychological and traumatic consequences of earthquakes on affected population samples in the cities of Athens, Thessaloniki, Kalamata, and Aegion over the last 40 years are reviewed. Significant magnitudes of prevalence in anxiety and depressive symptomatology levels were recorded in the studies under review. The majority of individuals were found also to have developed acute stress reactions and posttraumatic stress disorder. These subjects were more vulnerable due to previous psychopathology or because they have been exposed to serious material losses. A decrease in suicide attempts following the Athens earthquake of 1981 and an increase in the incidence of fatal health attack mortality were also observed. Some methodological and ethical issues were noted, such as the time pressure for the completion of surveys during the acute social disruption followed by limited psychological support.

ID ECONOMIC-CRISIS; SUICIDE; CHILDREN
AB The current European socio-economic crisis, which begun in 2008, has a significant impact on citizens' physical and mental health. Greece has been deeply affected by this crisis. Consequences are multiple: absolute poverty levels are on the rise, adolescents and young adults lack job prospects, while economic strain affects family relationships and parents' physical and mental health. We are increasingly faced with phenomena leading to psychosocial dysfunction and manifestations of psychopathology in children and adolescents such as: an increase of suicidal, aggressive and delinquent behavior, an increased use of legal and illegal addictive substances, school refusal, bullying and a remarkable lack of parental capacity to respond to their children's psychological needs. For every country in the midst of recession protecting high risk groups is a priority. In this context some important challenges have to be addressed: a) including child and adolescent mental health among the priorities of health policies, b) preventing fragmentation and weakening of mental health system, c) responding to the new mental health problems, and d) revising national mental health plans to strengthen early intervention and prevention services for children and their families.

AB Previous studies on the health consequences of the crisis in Greece investigated short-term impacts on selected outcomes. This study examined the impact of the crisis on a key set of health indicators with longer follow up than previous studies. We conducted interrupted time series (ITS) analysis to compare trends in standardised mortality by cause before and during the crisis. We examined changes in fruit and vegetable consumption, smoking, physical activity, obesity, out-of-pocket payments and unmet needs for healthcare using national household data from the "Hellas Health" surveys. Standardised mortality rates for suicides (p < 0.001) and infant mortality (p = 0.003) increased during the crisis compared to pre-existing trends, while mortality from respiratory diseases (p = 0.053) and transport accidents (p = 0.067) decreased. The prevalence of smoking (42.6% to 36.5%; RR = 0.86) and sedentary lifestyle (43.4% to 29.0%; RR = 0.69) declined. The prevalence of unmet need for healthcare significantly increased from 10.0% to 21.9% (RR = 2.10) and the proportion of people paying out-of-pocket for healthcare from 34.4% to 58.7% (RR = 1.69) between 2010 and 2015. The impact of the economic crisis in Greece on health was more nuanced than previous reports suggest. Effective strategies to mitigate the adverse health impacts of economic crises need to be better understood and implemented.

TI TURN OF THE SCREW: NARRATIVES OF HISTORY AND ECONOMY IN THE GREEK CRISIS
SO JOURNAL OF MEDITERRANEAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The Greek crisis has become the most eminent example of neoliberal economic meltdown over the past five years. In towns across Greece people try to come to terms with drastic changes in their everyday lives and grapple with the complex mixture of politics, economy, history and culture that informs crisis experience. This paper addresses recurring themes in crisis narratives from the town of Trikala, central Greece, within the context of local history and economy. Narratives condense historical experience, fashion forms of cultural proximity and facilitate polytemporality. As people recall the era of ciftliks (great estates), the Great Famine of 1941-43, and the stock market collapse they construct a sphere of collective suffering and solidarity based on adversity whilst simultaneously critiquing economic systems. Historical events significantly inform present crisis experience in Trikala, adding local nuances to national and global problems. Three prominent themes can be identified in daily narratives that help locals comprehend the socioeconomic hardship: famine, suicide and colonisation. These recurrent themes form the bases for collective suffering, encouraging solidarity in the face of socioeconomic turmoil. In narrative, actors move seamlessly from past to present, offering a critique of economic systems by means of historical embodiment.

AB A substantial body of research indicates that certain socio-economic factors, such as poverty, income inequalities and unemployment, are strongly associated with criminality, violence rates and public health in general. Recent studies have shown that crime rates increase during economic recessions and decrease during recovery. However, the fact that these findings are controversial limits their generalizability. The current literature review examines the relationship of criminality with economic recessions and specific economic factors, as well as the new empirical evidence derived from the recent economic crisis, which intensely affected many countries worldwide. Most longitudinal studies make evident a clear impact of economic cycles on property crime but not on violent crime. Among specific macro-economic factors, the role of unemployment has been most thoroughly studied and a significant impact of unemployment on criminality, and especially on property crime, has been found. It is of great interest to compare the current international evidence, as well as the data form longitudinal studies, with the respective findings from the current economic crisis in Greece. During the years 2008-2014 in Greece, there was a significant and continuous increase in many but not all crime types. Divergences and peculiarities in crime rate changes observed during the recent international economic crisis could be useful material for further reflections and investigations on possible mediating factors in the relationship between recession and criminality.

AB This article presents both a fatal suicide incident by Flobert 9 mm-type smoothbore weapon with a single-shot projectile and a nonfatal case of a suicide attempt by the same weapon type with a dispersion cartridge from the authors' forensic record. A retrospective study was conducted examining 84 cases involving cases of headshots inflicted by all kinds of weapons deriving from the broader region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace (Northern Greece) between 2000 and 2015, among which only 1 involved lethal wounding by a Flobert 9 mm (1.19%). Only a single case report of a fatality with such a weapon has been described throughout international literature. A comparative study also follows between the 3 incidents. The authors argue that a prerequisite for the lethal outcome of the shooting is the absolute contact of the weapon to the head as well as its placement at an anatomical point where the bone resistance is relatively lower, so that the intracranial entry of the projectile is possible. It is also more harmful if the cartridge contains a single-shot projectile rather than multiple projectiles of smaller diameter.

AB The 2009 economic crisis in Greece had harsh implications on the Greek society. The crisis led to high and increasing unemployment rates, which previously found to relate to increases in suicide rates, health risking behaviors and increased risk of mental health problems. The public's perceptions regarding the consequences of the crisis are crucial to their recovery. In order to get a comprehensive and thorough view of the public's perceptions, which will allow to draw conclusions and recommendations for a possible effective intervention program, the current study assessed the perceptions of a representative sample of the Greek adult population (N = 3002) in three sampling waves: December 2011, March 2011 and November 2012. These assessments included questionnaires designed to evaluate perceptions of current quality of life, economic decline, coping with economic and occupational commitments, physical and psychological health, wellbeing, health related behaviors, attitudes towards emigration, sources of support and political and social trust. Findings showed significantly higher perceptions of financial uncertainty and difficulties coping with economic commitments. Participants generally rated their psychological health lower than their physical health. Trust ratings were also found to be generally low, especially for younger populations. Younger populations also showed a more willing attitude towards emigrating out of Greece, compared to older populations. Coping measurements revealed a strong possible tendency to go back to the traditional ties of confidence and trust in family and friends as sources of support. In light of the results, we recommend to build programs that see the family and the local community as a resources of resilience and coping.

AB Purpose: To investigate the impact of economic crisis on central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) incidence in Greece, analyzing data by 3 different ophthalmology units during the period 2005-2012.
   Methods: Between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2012, all patients at 3 separate ophthalmology units, i.e., 2 public university clinics and 1 private center, presenting with the diagnosis of acute CSCR, either new cases or recurrent ones, were consecutively enrolled in the study. Patients' data, including age and sex, as well as the date of presentation, were recorded and analyzed. Recurrent cases were also recorded.
   Results: The study sample included 580 new cases of CSCR (463 male, 117 female) and 97 recurrent cases (84 male, 13 female). The mean age was 48.8 +/- 10.3 years (range 25-90). The number of incident as well as recurrent cases increased with more recent years. As expected, the increasing trend of cases and recurrences was reproducible upon the sex-specific analyses. Moreover, the increasing trend of cases and recurrences was reproducible upon the majority of analyses stratified by age.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests a potential impact of financial crisis on CSCR. Our results demonstrated that CSCR incidence, in both new and recurrent cases, has increased during the years of economic crisis in Greece, especially in 2010-2011, implying that CSCR is likely to be associated with stress or other emotional stimuli caused by financial crisis. It is also important to note that the results were similar in public and private units.

AB Background: Children's exposure to violence is a major public health issue. The Balkan epidemiological study on Child Abuse and Neglect project aimed to collect internationally comparable data on violence exposures in childhood.
   Methods: A three stage stratified random sample of 42,194 school-attending children (response rate: 66.7%) in three grades (aged 11, 13 and 16 years) was drawn from schools in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Greece, Romania, Serbia and Turkey. Children completed the ICAST-C questionnaire, which measures children's exposure to violence by any perpetrator.
   Results: Exposure rates for psychological violence were between 64.6% (FYROM) and 83.2% (Greece) for lifetime and 59.62% (Serbia) and 70.0% (Greece) for past-year prevalence. Physical violence exposure varied between 50.6% (FYROM) and 76.3% (Greece) for lifetime and 42.5% (FYROM) and 51.0% (Bosnia) for past-year prevalence. Sexual violence figures were highest for lifetime prevalence in Bosnia (18.6%) and lowest in FYROM (7.6%). Lifetime contact sexual violence was highest in Bosnia (9.8%) and lowest in Romania (3.6%). Past-year sexual violence and contact sexual violence prevalence was lowest in Romania (5.0 and 2.1%) and highest in Bosnia (13.6 and 7.7% respectively). Self-reported neglect was highest for both past-year and lifetime prevalence in Bosnia (48.0 and 20.3%) and lowest in Romania (22.6 and 16.7%). Experiences of positive parental practices were reported by most participating children in all countries.
   Conclusions: Where significant differences in violence exposure by sex were observed, males reported higher exposure to past-year and lifetime sexual violence and females higher exposure to neglect. Children in Balkan countries experience a high burden of violence victimization and national-level programming and child protection policy making is urgently needed to address this.

AB This article cybernetically (isomorphically) investigates the causes of the Hellenic financial crisis. It (1) describes the crisis and its commonly assessed root cause: systemic corruption coupled to the decisions of ample numbers of Greeks to endure the problem rather than resolve it; (2) reviews SYRIZA's 2015 anti-austerity campaign and identifies incompatibilities within its apparent collective purposes that imply processes more fundamental than corruption and bad faith may be causing the crisis; (3) situates cybernetics within a sociological framework to analyze those processes appropriately; (4) propositionally reduces them to a general rulethe tragedy of the commonsoperating more or less within the collective conscience of the Greek people; and (5) and exposes the parameter's self-similar manifestation in social actions that have contributed to the crisis.

AB Telephone counselling with adolescents is well known in many countries all over the world, due to its special characteristics, which seem to suit to adolescents. Some of these characteristics are the low cost, the easy access, the anonymity, as well as the possibility for the callers to have the control over the call regarding its duration as they can hang up the phone whenever they feel like it. Based on the experience gained from the operation of the telephone counselling helpline in Greece for children and adolescents, countertransference phenomena that appear during telephone counselling are presented in the present article. More specifically, the link between those countertransference phenomena and the special characteristics of telephone counselling, with the characteristics of the period of adolescence, with the existence of psychopathology in the callers and, moreover, with factors regarding the counsellors themselves is presented.

DT Article
ID CONIUM-MACULATUM; ALKALOIDS; TOXICITY
AB Background. The poison hemlock plant (Conium maculatum) has been a known poison since early in human history, most notably as the agent used for the execution/suicide of Socrates in ancient Greece. No experience has been reported regarding the suitability of a hemlock victim's organs for transplantation.
   Methods and Results. This report documents successful transplantation of the liver, kidney, and pancreas from a 14-year.;old girl who died of anoxic encephalopathy from asphyxia after the accidental ingestion of fresh hemlock while on a nature hike. Predonation laboratory values were not remarkable, and liver and kidney biopsy results were normal. All organs in the three recipients had immediate function, and no recipient had any clinical evidence of transmitted toxin. All recipients are well, with functioning transplants at greater than 6 months after transplantation.
   Conclusions. Poison hemlock intoxication does not seem to be a contraindication to organ donation.

AB The financial crisis that erupted in Greece in late 2009 affected the implementation of social policy and hence the health policies. This literature review on the impact of the crisis on health and healthcare provision was based on the recommendations of the Centre for Review and Dissemination. The method of thematic analysis was used, and the results illustrate the intense scientific interest in this issue and show that the austerity policies have adversely affected the health status of the population, and especially mental health, mortality rates and the dynamics of infectious diseases. Certain health-related behaviors, such as smoking and exercise, have shown improvement, and favorable effects on the frequency and consequences of road accidents have been observed. Cuts in healthcare spending exacerbated the pre-existing deficiencies in human and other resources in the public sector, which combined with the growing demand for free health services, has adversely affected the accessibility and availability of the healthcare facilities and the quality of the services provided. Consequently, it is apparent that the reform measures adopted have widened health inequalities and increased the hospital deficits and the unmet healthcare needs of the population. The findings that emerged from this review are in general agreement with research results, and highlight the need to eliminate health disparities for vulnerable populations and ensure sustainability and efficiency in healthcare provision.

AB The financial crisis in Europe has posed major threats and opportunities to health. We trace the origins of the economic crisis in Europe and the responses of governments, examine the effect on health systems, and review the effects of previous economic downturns on health to predict the likely consequences for the present. We then compare our predictions with available evidence for the effects of the crisis on health. Whereas immediate rises in suicides and falls in road traffic deaths were anticipated, other consequences, such as HIV outbreaks, were not, and are better understood as products of state retrenchment. Greece, Spain, and Portugal adopted strict fiscal austerity; their economies continue to recede and strain on their health-care systems is growing. Suicides and outbreaks of infectious diseases are becoming more common in these countries, and budget cuts have restricted access to health care. By contrast, Iceland rejected austerity through a popular vote, and the financial crisis seems to have had few or no discernible effects on health. Although there are many potentially confounding differences between countries, our analysis suggests that, although recessions pose risks to health, the interaction of fiscal austerity with economic shocks and weak social protection is what ultimately seems to escalate health and social crises in Europe. Policy decisions about how to respond to economic crises have pronounced and unintended effects on public health, yet public health voices have remained largely silent during the economic crisis.

   OUTCOMES
AB Objective: Adverse life events may contribute to the emergence of suicidality. We aimed to test the relationship between the impact of the Greek recession and suicidal risk in people with long-term conditions (LTCs) and to determine whether this relationship is moderated by the presence of a mental disorder.
   Methods: Suicidal risk (RASS) and crisis parameters were assessed in a cross-sectional survey including 376 patients with LTCs (type-II diabetes mellitus, rheumatological disorders and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) attending the Emergency Department or specialty clinics. A diagnosis of mental disorder was confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) interview. Hierarchical regression models were used to quantify moderator effects.
   Results: Suicidal risk was significantly associated with the perceived impact of the recession (p = 0.028). However, moderation analysis showed that this relationship was significant only in those diagnosed with either major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that the perceived impact of the current Greek recession is not correlated with suicidal risk per se, but the recession may act as precipitator in combination with other risk factors, such as the presence of a mental illness, thus supporting the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders in vulnerable groups.

SO ENGLISH STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The first discussion concerns Virginia Woolf's attempted suicide in September 1913 and her recuperation from the attack of mental illness that provoked it. The main focus is on the interest and advice of Roger Fry, who was closely involved with Virginia's sister, Vanessa Bell, and whose wife, the artist Helen Fry, had a long history of mental illness that invites comparison and contrast with that of Virginia. When Virginia was convalescing, and a new nurse was required for her, Roger approached the medical superintendent of the hospital in which Helen was a patient. The letters exchanged between the two are made known for the first time. The second discussion concerns Virginia's and Leonard Woolf's visit to Greece with Roger and his sister Margery Fry in 1932, and specifically a photograph taken while the party was in Athens. The recent contention of Maggie Humm that the common error of identifying the location as the Acropolis originated with Virginia, and that her alleged misidentification is psychobiographically significant, is refuted.

AB Sociolinguistic studies of language shift have in their majority framed their research object in a horizon of theoretically received variables such as class, ethnicity, locality, attitudes etc. In spite of a limited usefulness of such conceptual variables, and of a recently emerging focus on agency, negotiation, and praxis the best results we obtain have not questioned in a coherent and theoretically sound manner the continuing hegemony of mechanistic-metaphorical models (language death, language suicide). In this paper I propose to examine language shift as a multifaceted phenomenon, joining in this respect work by other linguistic anthropologists researching similar areas. I specifically argue that by replacing vertical concepts such as age and generation, and dichotomous logics such as center and periphery with phenomenologically inspired concepts such as typifications, consociateship, contemporariness, and stream of consciousness we are in a better position to generalize about language shift dynamics. Data for this work is derived primarily from the Albanian speech communities of modern Greece, but also from other communities for comparative purposes.

AB We conducted a study using a newly developed dataset based on Emergency Departments records of a network of hospitals from Greece on injuries from dog bites. Our goal is three-fold: (a) to investigate if surrogate factors of leisure time are associated with increased risk of injury from bites; (b) to address recently reported contradictory results on putative association of lunar periods and injuries from dog bites; and (c) to offer a general methodology for addressing similar case-only designs with combined factors of which some can exhibit cyclical patterns. To address these goals, we used a case-only design of our dataset, and conducted an analysis where we controlled simultaneously for weekday/weekend effects, season of year (winter, spring/fall, summer), and lunar periods, because any one of these factors can contribute to the degree of exposure to injuries from dog bites. We found that increased risk of injury from bites was associated with weekends versus weekdays (RR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.10-1.29), summer versus winter (RR = 1.24, 95% Cl: 1.11-1.39), and fall or spring versus winter (RR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.19-1.45). The results support the hypothesis that longer leisure time at these levels of factors does increase the risk of having a bite injury. Moreover, after controlling for these factors, risk of bite injury was not associated with moon periods, thereby also helping settle a longstanding argument. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Background: This study draws on old and well-established evidence that economic change, and especially recession, affects people's lives, behavior and mental health. Even though the literature is rich on the relationship between unemployment and mental distress, there is a renewed research interest on the link between socio-economic inequalities and psychological health.
   Aims: The study investigates the relationship of social class with mental distress during the hard times of persistent and severe economic crisis in Greece by conducting a comparative, community study in the country's second largest city, Thessaloniki.
   Method: A face-to-face structured interview covering living conditions, life events, chronic stressors and coping strategies was employed to 300 residents of socio-economically contrasting neighborhood areas. Social class was operationalized by Erik Olin Wright's social class position typology, based on ownership and control over productive assets. The method of multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was also applied to analyze the collected data.
   Results: The results indicated that mental distress was significantly differentiated across social classes and in each residential area. Unemployed and unskilled workers were the most vulnerable groups in terms of psychological health. Chronic stress arose in this study as a risk factor for poor mental health outcomes and it was associated to low marital quality, intense economic burden and impoverished housing conditions.
   Conclusion: Those who face income loss, job loss and disability are at high risk for poverty and marginalization, suffering from greater psychological distress.

DE Financial crisis; Healthcare reforms; Social policy; Socio-economic
   indicators
AB The global financial crisis, which started in 2008 in the USA, influenced most of the European countries, and in particular Greece, with serious socio-economic and political consequences. The Greek Government, faced with the risk of bankruptcy, was forced to accept financial, signing memoranda that imposed austerity, reductions in expenditure and structural reforms in all sectors. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the austerity policies in the health systems of Greece and other countries that applied budgetary stability programs, and to present the most significant health-care reforms that were instituted from 2010 onwards. A literature search was conducted of the economic indicators of the last 10 years in the international databases of WHO, OECD Health Statistics, Eurostat, the European Core Health Indicators and the statistical service of Cyprus. During the economic crisis the health level of the Greek population was documented to be at a satisfactory level, comparable with the other countries that experienced austerity, and even with Germany, a country with large expenditures on health, which did not experience economic crisis. Despite reduction in health expenditure and increasing unemployment, improvement of most health indicators was observed, with the exception of overall mortality and suicide. Major reforms implemented after 2010 in the Greek health system include restructuring of primary health care services, e-prescribing and the free access of all (including the uninsured) to the Greek National Health Service. Although many health indicators of the Greek population show improvement over this period, it is important to review the data and redefine the priorities in the field of health care at regular intervals, and in population subgroups.

AB Background: The current global financial crisis that started in 2008 resulted in a significant decline in global trade, slowing/reversing economic growth worldwide, and a dramatic increase in public sector debt. At the same time, the global migrant/refugee crisis has reached extreme rates, with millions of people being forced to abandon their homes and communities because of war, political violence or related threats. There is a broad consensus about the deleterious consequences of these crises on psychological well-being, depression, anxiety disorders, insomnia, alcohol abuse and suicidal behavior. Although the separate consequences of economic recession and immigration are extensively discussed in previous research, we know very little about the processes through which the intersection of economic crisis and migrant crisis contributes to the vulnerabilities of natives and migrants during these crises. Of particular concern is the status of children, adolescents and their families, who constitute one of the most vulnerable groups in society.
   Aim: To discuss the contexts that economic and migrant crises shape and suggest possible effects of this intersection on mental health risks, especially among children, adolescents and their families, through reflecting on the recent experience in Greece.
   Method: Review of the literature and critical analysis of the effects of the confluent crises.
   Conclusion: The interactive effects of these two crises need further exploration. Novel and diverse models of psychological understanding need to be developed in order to manage the effects of the confluent crises. The role of mental health professionals is crucial in this respect, offering culturally flexible, accommodating and empathetic approaches, allowing healing and acceptance in the face of adversity.

TI Austerity: a failed experiment on the people of Europe
SO CLINICAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID PUBLIC-HEALTH PROFESSIONALS; FINANCIAL CRISIS
AB Many governments in Europe, either of their own volition or at the behest of the international financial institutions, have adopted stringent austerity policies in response to the financial crisis. By contrast, the USA launched a financial stimulus. The results of these experiments are now clear: the American economy is growing and those European countries adopting austerity, including the UK, Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain, are stagnating and struggling to repay rising debts. An initial recovery in the UK was halted once austerity measures hit. However, austerity has been not only an economic failure, but also a health failure, with increasing numbers of suicides and, where cuts in health budgets are being imposed, increasing numbers of people being unable to access care. Yet their stories remain largely untold. Here, we argue that there is an alternative to austerity, but that ideology is triumphing over evidence. Our paper was written to contribute to discussions among health policy leaders in Europe that will take place at the 15th European Health Forum at Gastein in October 2012, as its theme 'Crisis and Opportunity Health in an Age of Austerity'.

AB The growing interest in the psychological distress in patients with cancer has been the major reason for the conduction of this study. The aims were to assess the relationship of hopelessness, anxiety, distress, and preparatory grief, as well as their predictive power to hopelessness. Ninety-four patients with advanced cancer completed the study at a palliative care unit in Athens, Greece. Beck Hopelessness Scale, the Greek version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale, and the Preparatory Grief in Advanced Cancer Patients scale were administered. Information concerning patients' treatment was acquired from the medical records,whereas physicians recorded their clinical condition. Hopelessness correlated significantly with preparatory grief (r = .630, P < .0005), anxiety (r = .539, P < .0005), depression (r = .642, P < .0005), HAD-Total (r = .686, P < .0005), and age (r = .212, P = .040). Multiple regression analyses showed that preparatory grief (P < .0005), depression (P < .0005), and age (P = .003) were predictors of hopelessness, explaining 58.8% of total variance. In this patient sample, depression, preparatory grief, and patients' age were predictors of hopelessness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Self-harm among prisoners is a common phenomenon. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of self-injurious behavior (SIB) among Greek male prisoners, record their motives and determine independent risk factors.
   Methods: A self-administered, anonymous questionnaire was administered to 173 male prisoners in the Chalkida prison, Greece. The questionnaire included items on self-harm/SIB, demographic parameters, childhood history, family history, physical and mental disease, lifestyle and smoking habits, alcohol dependence (CAGE questionnaire), illicit substance use, aggression (Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire [BPAQ] and Lifetime History of Aggression [LTHA]), impulsivity (Barrat Impulsivity Scale-11) and suicidal ideation (Spectrum of Suicidal Behavior Scale). Univariate nonparametric statistics and multivariate ordinal logistic regression were performed.
   Results: Of all the participants, 49.4% (95% CI: 41.5-57.3%) disclosed self-harm (direct or indirect). The prevalence of SIB was equal to 34.8% (95% Cl: 27.5-42.6%). Most frequently, SIB coexisted with indirect self-harm (80.7%). The most common underlying motives were to obtain emotional release (31.6%) and to release anger (21.1%). At the univariate analysis, SIB was positively associated with a host of closely related factors: low education, physical/sexual abuse in childhood, parental neglect, parental divorce, alcoholism in family, psychiatric condition in family, recidivism, age, sentence already served, impulsivity, aggression, alcohol dependence, self-reported diagnosed psychiatric condition and illicit substance use. Childhood variables were particularly associated with the presence of diagnosed psychiatric condition. At the multivariate analysis, however, only three parameters were proven independent risk factors: self-reported diagnosed psychiatric condition, illicit substance use and aggression (BPAQ scale).
   Conclusion: The prevalence of SIB is particularly high. Psychiatric condition, illicit substance use and aggression seem to be the most meaningful risk factors; childhood events seem only to act indirectly. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

ID SUICIDE
AB Background This paper reports the findings of an analytical comparison of several macro indicators collected routinely from institutional sources in Europe. Methods We carried out a review of macro indicators capable of providing a synthetic description of mental health status and the availability of psychiatric care in European countries. These were collected routinely from sources such as WHO, OECD, EUROSTAT, and IMS. The evaluation of temporal trends in each nation permits subsequent comparisons between countries. Results In all European countries, a decreased trend of suicides was observed in the period 1980 - 2000, with the exception of Ireland and ( partially) of Spain. In Ireland, the increased trend was particularly strong, with a high risk in young and adult males. Portugal and Greece had respectively the highest and the lowest rates of undetermined causes of death. Most countries that were high consumers of alcohol in the initial period of observation had a rate above the national mean until 1980, after which consumption decreased. Most nations that were low consumers in 1960 had rates below the mean until 1980, when the rates progressively increased. However, a general decrease of alcohol-related deaths was apparent in all countries. Mortality associated with mental disorder increased, most clearly during the mid 1980s. The number of psychiatrists per 100,000 inhabitants ranged from 3.6 in Spain to 17.5 in Finland; of child psychiatrists, from 0.9 in Germany to 5.1 in Portugal. Psychiatric beds ranged from 0.4 per 1,000 inhabitants in Italy and Spain to 1.3 in Ireland. Nine countries showed a trend towards a reduction in psychiatric beds, whilst in a further five countries no change was observed. Rates of long-stay patients varied from 9.5 in the UK to 84 in Belgium, with a generally decreasing trend. The use of outpatient facilities differed markedly between countries, although there was a general increase over time. Official data were scarce in relation to the sale of psychotropic drugs. IMS data indicated increasing consumption in all European countries for antidepressant and antipsychotic medication. Conclusions The official data resources available for European countries seem to indicate some discrepancies, probably relating to methods of recording. Better co-ordination in the collection of data about mental health status in the European Union and an improvement of the quality in available services is needed.

DE history of psychoanalysis; Italo Svevo; literature; Marie Bonaparte
AB Marie Bonaparte (1882-1962) played a critical role in the development of psychoanalysis in France. Her clinical activity is not well known yet she was one of the first female French psychoanalysts. The journalist-writers Alice and Valerio Jahier were Bonaparte's first two patients. She conducted this dual analysis with Rudolph Loewenstein (1898-1976). Alice and Valerio exchanged analysts on several occasions. During his analysis, Valerio began corresponding with Italo Svevo (1861-1928), the author of La Coscienza di Zeno, who imparted his doubts on the therapeutic merits of psychoanalysis. Valerio described his difficult analysis in his letters to Svevo. Bonaparte consulted Freud on the subject, but was not able to prevent Valerio's suicide in 1939. The Princess of Greece encouraged Alice in her vocation as a writer and enabled her to benefit from her connections in literary circles. On the margins of this unpublished story of the two analyses, which is based on archived documents recently made available, we discover the importance of the links which were formed - around Marie Bonaparte - between psychoanalysis and literature. In addition to Italo Svevo, we come across the acerbic writer, Maurice Sachs, as well as the famous novelist, Stefan Zweig.

DT Article
AB Background: Out of 1705 patients hospitalised for various reasons in the 3rd Internal Medicine Department of the Regional General Hospital of Nikaea, in Piraeus, 146(8,5%) persons were admitted for drug intoxication between November 1999 and November 2000.
   Methods: On average, these persons [male 50(34,2%) - female 96(65,8%)] were admitted to the hospital within 3.7 hours after taking the drug.
   Results: The drugs that were more frequently taken, alone or in combination with other drugs, were sedatives (67.1%), aspirins and analgesics (mainly paracetamol) (43.5%). 38.3% of patients had a mental illness history, 31.5% were in need of psychiatric help and 45.2% had made a previous suicide attempt. No death occurred during the above period and the outcome of the patients' health was normal. After mental state examination, the mental illnesses diagnosed were depression (20.96%), psychosis (15.32%), dysthymic disorder (16,2%), anxiety disorder (22.58%) and personality disorder (8.87%).
   Conclusions: Self-poisoning remains a crucial problem. The use of paracetamol and sedatives are particularly important in the population studied. Interpersonal psychiatric therapy may be a valuable treatment after people tried to poison themselves.

AB The worldwide financial crisis during recent years has raised concerns of negative public health effects. This is notably evident in southern Europe. In Greece, where the financial austerity has been especially pronounced, the prevalence of mental health problems including depression and suicide has increased, and outbreaks of infectious diseases have risen. The main objective in this study was to investigate whether different indicators of health and stress levels measured by a new biomarker based on cortisol in human hair were different amongst comparable Greek and Swedish young adults, considering that Sweden has been much less affected by the recent economic crises. In this cross-sectional comparative study, young adults from the city of Athens in Greece (n = 124) and from the city of Linkoping in Sweden (n = 112) participated. The data collection comprised answering a questionnaire with different health indicators and hair samples being analyzed for the stress hormone cortisol, a biomarker with the ability to retrospectively measure long-term cortisol exposure. The Greek young adults reported significantly higher perceived stress (p < 0.0001), had experienced more serious life events (p = 0.002), had lower hope for the future (p < 0.0001), and had significantly more widespread symptoms of depression (p < 0.0001) and anxiety (p < 0.0001) than the Swedes. But, the Greeks were found to have significantly lower cortisol levels (p < 0.0001) than the Swedes, and this difference was still significant in a multivariate regression (p < 0.0001), after adjustments for potential intervening variables. A variety of factors related to differences in the physical or sociocultural environment between the two sites, might possibly explain this finding. However, a potential biological mechanism is that long-term stress exposure could lead to a lowering of the cortisol levels. This study points out a possible hypothesis that the cortisol levels of the Greek young adults might have been suppressed and their HPA-axis down-regulated after living in a stressful environment with economic and social pressure.

AB Background: The physical and mental health of a population is based, in particular, on its quality of life and its access to health care. Given these determinants, Greece's population has greatly suffered due to the sharp cuts in the budget for social benefits and health care (some measurable evidence is the recent increase in the suicide rate). Starting January, the 1st of 2015, unemployment benefits in Belgium have been eliminated for all recipients who do not have a full-time year of work over the last three years. Therefore, we must ask whether there will be similar psycho-medical consequences for Belgium's population.
   Subjects and methods: Open study over a year (01/07/14 - 30/06/15) of emergencies admitted to the University Hospital Center of Mont-Godinne including a psychopathological motif. In addition to general socio-demographic data, psychic disorders are measured, as well as different types of crises (familial, professional or couple crisis), familial support and its dynamic (FACES III of Olson) and finally social integration (social isolation scale from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP)). These patients are compared with those admitted during the six months preceding the Act modifying the unemployment benefits.
   Results: Between July the 1st of 2014 and June the 30th of 2015, we saw an increase in the number of admissions to the psychiatric emergency department by 2.5% in six months, despite a decrease in the number of admissions to all-cause emergencies. Our study also shows a degradation of social network quality characterized by a more pronounced social isolation of our patients. At last, an alteration of cohesion in the patient's origin family was highlighted.
   Conclusion: Although we cannot establish a direct causal link between this law and the results of this study, these may suggest a weakening of the population mental health due to difficult socio-economic context. As a result, we are faced not only with a public health problem but also with one concerning health care organization.

ID BODY
AB The very word "anatomy" tells us about this branch's connection with dissection. Studies of anatomy have taken place for approximately 2,300 years already. Anatomy's birthplace lies in Greece and Egypt.
   Knowledge in this specific field of science was necessary during surgical procedures in ophthalmology and obstetrics. Embalming took place without public disapproval just like autopsies and manipulation with relics. Thus, anatomical dissection became part of later forensic sciences. Anatomical studies on humans themselves, which needed to be compared with the knowledge gained through studying procedures performed on animals, elicited public disapprobation and prohibition. When faced with a shortage of cadavers, anatomists resorted to obtaining bodies of the executed and suicide victims - since torture, public display of the mutilated body, (including anatomical autopsy), were perceived as an intensification of the death penalty.
   Decapitation and hanging were the main execution methods meted out for death sentences. Anatomists preferred intact bodies for dissection; hence, convicts could thus avoid torture. This paper lists examples of how this process was resolved. It concerns the manners of killing, vivisection on people in the antiquity and middle-ages, experiments before the execution and after, vivifying from seeming death, experiments with galvanizing electricity on fresh cadavers, evaluating of sensibility after guillotine execution, and making perfect anatomical preparations and publications during Nazism from fresh bodies of the executed.

AB The current study assessed the attitudes of the desire for hastened death in terminally ill cancer patients and whether these are determined by their physical and psychological symptoms. The final sample consisted of 106 terminally ill cancer patients attending a Palliative Care Unit, in University of Athens, Greece, between June and October 2004. Significant associations were found between the desire for hastened death (D.H.D.) and 'pain' (r = 0.469, p < 0.005), 'fatigue' (r = 0.591, p < 0.0005), 'loss of appetite' (r = 0.622, p < 0.0005) and 'feeling sad' (r = 0.635, p < 0.0005). Statistically significant associations were also found between Schedule of Attitudes towards Hastened Death (SAHD) scores, age (r = 0.300, p = 0.002) and ECOG (p < 0.0005). Twenty-six percent of the patients reported high D.H.D. while 41% reported moderate desire. In the prediction of SHAD the contribution of 'pain'(p = 0.011), 'lack of appetite' (p = 0.012) and 'sadness' (p = 0.011) is high (42% of variance). Further findings suggest that D.H.D. is significantly related to 'feeling sad', 'lack of appetite', 'pain' and 'fatigue' after controlling for age, gender and performance status according to ECOG in terminally ill cancer patients.

AB The aim of this survey was to determine levels and severity of self-reported alcohol and drug misuse and associated physical and mental health problems in Greek male prisoners. The sample consisted of 80 randomly selected convicted and remanded male prisoners in a prison in northern Greece. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used to assess psychiatric disorders including substance abuse and dependence. All prisoners who participated completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Those who reported daily use of opiates and stimulants completed the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS). Information was obtained from medical notes about the prisoners' hepatitis B and HIV status. The MINI identified 27.5% of the prisoners as dependent on opiates, 26.3% on alcohol and 73.8% as cannabis users, while 13.8% were misusing both alcohol and illicit drugs. Severity of dependence was rated, using SDS, as serious for all opiate and stimulant users. In terms of physical health examination of medical records indicated that no prisoner was HIV-positive but 26.5% were hepatitis-B-positive. Of those who had a previous history of substance misuse, 31.2% fulfilled the criteria for depression and 37.5% for antisocial personality disorder. Similarly, 15% of those misusing substances had a previous history of deliberate self-harm and 16% were assessed to have moderate to high suicide risk. Copyright (C) 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB The aim of this survey was to determine the prevalence of current and lifetime mental disorder and deliberate self-harm among male prisoners in Greece. The subjects were 80 randomly selected remanded and sentenced prisoners in a Greek prison. They were assessed for mental disorder including suicidality and substance misuse using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). We also collected information regarding contact with psychiatric services, previous deliberate self-harm as well as physical health and conducted a brief assessment of their intellectual functioning. Mental disorder was diagnosed in 63 (78.7%) prisoners. The main diagnoses were: anxiety disorder, 30 (37.5%); major depression, 22 (27.5%); antisocial personality disorder, 30 (37.5%); alcohol dependence, 21 (26.3%) and opiate dependence 22 (27.5%) and schizophrenic or bipolar disorder 9 (11.2%). Deliberate self-harm prior to and during imprisonment was reported by 15% and 2.5% of prisoners, respectively, and 12 prisoners (15%) had IQ below 75.
   This survey identified a significant level of need for specialist mental health services in prison. Further studies are required to assess the specific needs of those patients who are too unwell to remain in prison, the need for specific treatments for substance misuse and improved assessment/treatment of common psychiatric disorders.

AB This study attempts to assess childhood maltreatment in prison through a hierarchical approach. The hierarchical approach principally aims to disentangle the independent effects of childhood maltreatment upon psychiatric morbidity/personality traits, if any, from the burden that the adverse family conditions have already imposed to the mental health of the maltreated individual-prisoner. To this direction, a conceptual framework with five hierarchical levels was constructed, namely: immutable demographic factors; family conditions; childhood maltreatment (physical abuse, neglect and sexual abuse); personality traits, habits and psychiatric morbidity; prison-related variables. A self-administered, anonymous set (battery) of questionnaires was administered to 173 male prisoners in the Chalkida prison, Greece; 26% of prisoners disclosed childhood maltreatment. Psychiatric condition in the family, parental alcoholism and parental divorce correlated with childhood maltreatment. After adjustment for immutable demographic factors and family conditions, childhood maltreatment was associated with aggression (both in terms of Lifetime History of Aggression and Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire scores), illicit substance use, personal history of psychiatric condition, current smoking, impulsivity and alcohol abuse. In conclusion, childhood maltreatment represents a pivotal, determining factor in the life course of male prisoners. Delinquents seem to suffer from long-term consequences of childhood maltreatment in terms of numerous mental health aspects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Social and economic policies are inextricably linked with population health outcomes in Europe, yet few datasets are able to fully explore and compare this relationship across European countries. The European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey aims to address this gap using microdata on income, living conditions and health. EU-SILC contains both cross-sectional and longitudinal elements, with nationally representative samples of individuals 16 years and older in 28 European Union member states as well as Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. Data collection began in 2003 in Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Greece, Luxembourg and Austria, with subsequent expansion across Europe. By 2011, all 28 EU member states, plus three others, were included in the dataset. Although EU-SILC is administered by Eurostat, the data are output-harmonized so that countries are required to collect specified data items but are free to determine sampling strategies for data collection purposes. EU-SILC covers approximately 500 000 European residents for its cross-sectional survey annually. Whereas aggregated data from EU-SILC are publicly available [http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/income-and-living-conditions/data/main-tables], microdata are only available to research organizations subject to approval by Eurostat. Please refer to [http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/microdata/eu_silc] for further information regarding microdata access.

AB Introduction: Stigma concerning mental disorder is a widespread phenomenon concerning the beliefs and attitudes of the public toward mental patients with a significant negative impact on state policy and the outcome of the patients. Material and methods: The study included 1,363 students of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The survey was based on an Internet-based electronic platform. The statistical analysis included analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Yates corrected chi-square test. Results: Approximately, 87% of students responded that they know what mental disorder is, 70% were informed from the Internet, 30% consider mental patients responsible for their condition, more than 95% blame the way they were raised and almost 60% consider mental disorder to be heritable. Only a minority feel negatively with a mental patient around and close to 80% would socialize with them. More than 80% accept the need for psychiatric medication treatment but the opinion is split concerning compulsory treatment, and one-third consider medication to be harmful. Discussion: The results of this study suggest that most students believe they know much about mental illness; however, overall their responses are contradictory. They reply with confidence although they are informed mainly by the media and the Internet in an unreliable way. A number of factors including gender, specific school or personal experience of mental disorder in the family seem to influence the result. A combined educational plus contact might be necessary to reduce stigma, since education alone seems to exert a weak effect.

AB Objective:To investigate risk factors for suicidal ideation (SI) in prisoners, as well as the prediction of suicidal behaviour by SI.Method:Participants were recruited from the all-male,adults', high security prison of Patras, Greece. Sixty-seven prisoners who expressed SI were evaluated using a structured interview, Hamilton's Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA) and the Montgomery Asberg Rating Scale for Depression (MADRS). Sixtyseven control prisoners without SI, matched for age, nationality and penal status were evaluated using the same structured interview and rating scales. All participants were followed-up prospectively for 12 months after their initial assessment and any acts of self-destructive behaviour were recorded. Results:Independent significant risk factors for SI in prisoners were the family history of suicidal behaviour (OR = 56.34, 95% CI = 4.23-750.1, p < 0.002), history of psychiatric hospitalisation (OR = 7.18, 95% CI = 1.83-28.16, p < 0.005), and higher scores in the MADRS (p < 0.03) and HAMA (p < 0.03) scales. During the follow-up period, suicidal behaviour (suicide attempt or self-mutilation) was observed in 12 (17.9%) inmates with SI, as opposed to none of the controls (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: A family history of suicidal behaviour, history of psychiatric hospitalisation and symptoms of anxiety or depression were independent risk factors for SI in prisoners. Inmates with SI had a higher risk for self-destructive acts at follow-up. Inmates with SI are a high-risk group for future self-destructive acts, so special precautions designed to reduce this risk are warranted.

AB Background: Involuntary psychiatric admission is a controversial issue with legislation varying from country to country. Research on elderly individuals being involuntary admitted has been limited. This study aims first at assessing whether elderly involuntary admitted patients (IAPs) differ with regard to demographic, psychopathological, and behavioral characteristics from voluntary admitted psychiatric patients (VAPs) and second to assess whether the former group should be treated in a different (special) way.
   Methods: Forty IAPs were compared to 39 VAPs with regard to sociodemographic data, DSM-IV diagnosis, as well as behavioral issues recorded by the Patient-Staff Conflict Checklist - Shift Report (PSCC-SR). All patients were aged 60 years and over and were admitted in the psychiatric departments of four general hospitals in Athens. The study period lasted 12 months.
   Results: VAPs were more likely to be suffering from mood disorders, while IAPs presented higher rates of delirium. From the 20 items of the PSCC-SR, differences were found only in two: IAPs presented more aggressive behavior during the first few days of admission whereas VAPs had committed recent suicide attempt just before admission.
   Conclusion: From the clinical point of view, IAPs presented with delirium and more aggressive behavior, whereas, the VAPs presented with higher rates of mood disorder and suicidality. However, from the medicolegal point of view, our findings lend support to the argument of either setting a limited time frame for involuntary admission in elderly patients, and/or allowing for elderly individuals with acute organic conditions to be treated against their will.

AB AimsAcute drug overdose, especially with paracetamol, may cause acute liver failure leading to registration for transplantation (ALFT). Population statistics and between-country differences for ALFT related to overdose have been poorly described. The aim of the present study was to evaluate overdose ALFT in the multi-country Study of Acute Liver Transplantation (SALT).
   MethodsAll adult overdose-related ALFT, with or without suicidal intent, in France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK between 2005 and 2007 were identified from liver transplant registries and hospital records. These were compared with whole-country and per capita use of paracetamol.
   ResultsSix hundred cases of ALFT were identified in 52 of 57 eligible transplant centres, of which 114 involved overdose (72 intentional, 10 non-intentional, 32 uncertain). Overdose represented 20% of all-cause ALFT: Ireland 52%, UK 28%, France 18%, the Netherlands 8%, and Italy 1%. Overdose ALFT were mostly females (61%), mean age 33.610.9years. A total of 111 (97%) of the overdoses involved paracetamol. Event rates ranged from one ALFT for 20.7 tons of paracetamol in Ireland, to one for 1074 tons in Italy and one case in 60 million inhabitants over 3years in Italy to one case in 286000 inhabitants per year in Ireland. Per-country event rates for non-overdose ALFT exposed to paracetamol were between 2.5 and 4.0 per million treatment-years sold.
   ConclusionsParacetamol overdose was found to represent one-sixth of all-cause ALFT. There was a 50-fold difference in Europe in the rates of paracetamol overdose ALFT, and a 200-fold difference per million inhabitants.

AB Objective: This study evaluated the desire of patients with advanced cancer for hastened death to determine its relationship to psychological distress, anxiety and pain.
   Methods: One hundred twenty terminally ill cancer patients were surveyed from June to November 2003 at a palliative care unit in Athens, Greece. Greek versions of the Schedule of Attitudes Toward Hastened Death (G-SAHD), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (G-HADS) and the Brief Pain Inventory were administered.
   Results: Significant correlations were seen between desire for hasten death and HADS-Depression (r = .605. P < .0005) and GADS-Anxiety (r = .636; P < .0005) scores. Results of multiple regression analyses showed that the HADS-Depression scale (B = .443, P < .0005) as well as the HADS-Anxiety scale (B = .326; P < .0005) and the interaction between HADS-Depression and opioids (B = .459, P = .012), but not pain intensity, pain-related interference, age, sex, patient's performance status as defined by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group as well as the interactions between average pain and opioids and average pain and HADS-Depression, were significant predictors of G-SAHD scores.
   Conclusions: In terminally ill cancer patients, depression and anxiety as well its the interaction between HADS-Depression and opioids appeared to have a significant impact on the desire for hastened death while pain does not. Effective management of psychological symptoms seems to be an important aspect of adequate palliative care in order to reduce the desire tor hastened death. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

   Cohort study
AB Objectives To assess current medical problems at two Greek refugee sites at Lesbos island (Camp Moria and Caritas hotel), to explore which care is needed and to assess how the provided healthcare can be improved.
   Design In this dynamic cohort study all consecutive patients who visited doctors from the Boat Refugee Foundation were included.
   Outcome Treatment Rates (TR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) were calculated for all major health issues. Additionally, the provided health care was evaluated using the SPHERE project standards.
   Results During the observation period of 30 March 2016 to 15 May 2016, 2291 persons were followed for a total of 289 person years (py). The median age of patients was 23.0 (IQR 8-38) years, 30.0% was aged < 18. The healthcare demand was high with 3.6 patient visits per py. Upper respiratory tract infections were most commonly diagnosed with a TR of 89.6/100py (95% CI 78.7-10.1) followed by dental problems (TR 18.0/100py, 95% CI 13.1-22.9). The rate of suicide attempts was high at TR 1.4/100py (95% CI 0.03-2.8), and many psychological problems were diagnosed, TR 19.4/100py (95% CI 14.3-24.4). Major health care threats are the lack of a vaccination program, inadequate sanitation and hygiene, and severe overcrowding.
   Conclusions This study can help policy makers and Non-Governmental Organizations decide which health care is needed most in the current European refugee crisis. There is an urgent need for mental and dental healthcare. Furthermore, it is crucial that vaccination programs are initiated and "hotspot" camps should transform in camps designed for long-stay situations.

DE creativity; psychopathology; genius
ID MENTAL-ILLNESS; WRITERS; DEPRESSION; SUICIDE; ART
AB What is the relation between creativity and psychopathology? Does psychopathology facilitate creativity? Does creative activity induce psychopathology? We expose here an historical bibliographic review, in search of responses to these questions posed from ancient Greece to these days.
   For Plato, talent was the enthusiasm which drags one away from oneself. For Aristotle, creativity was a rational process originated in nature, but he noticed that the greatest artists and scientists were melancholic. In the Middle Ages the idea of an association between creativity and mental pathology arose. In 1867, Maudsley postulated that genius was the maximum expression of human potentiality and of mental abnormality. In 1869, Galton began his scientific study on creativity. Since then several researchers have studied it by means of: a) biographical studies (Juda, Fernandes da Fonseca, Ludwig, Jamison, Schildkraut, Post, Espinel, who found a there was stronger relation between creativity and affective disorders, specially bipolar spectrum, in artists); b) research on the psychopathology of creative living subjects (Andreasen, Ludwig, Mraz and Runco), and c) research on the creativity of psychiatric patients (Jamison, Steinberg, Richards, Crowell, Stoll, Berrettini, Miller, Dowker). We also reviewed the concepts of Perez-Rincon, Whybrow, Silverman, Poldinger and Rothenberg. Dabrowski, in his positive desintegration theory, suggested that psychoneurosis is critical to development. In a person with a strong potential, symptoms may be a sign of his high developmental potencial, wich can be used for becoming an authentic, autonomous human being. Kopacz and Janikak explained the association between creativity and bipolar disorder: creativity is the product of bipolar desease; creativity and bipolar disease are different but they have related genes, and creative temperament is phenomenologically similar to hipomania. However, we agree with Feder's concept: creativity is a natural process implying ambivalence as well as procreativity.

AB Over the past five decades, two successive waves of political reform have brought democracy to, first, Spain, Portugal and Greece, and, more recently, Central and Eastern European countries. We assessed whether democratization was associated with improvements in population health, as indicated by life expectancy and cause-specific mortality rates.
   Data on life expectancy at birth, age-standardized total and cause-specific mortality rates, levels of democracy and potential time-variant confounding variables were collected from harmonized international databanks. In two pooled cross-sectional time-series analyses with country-fixed effects, life expectancy and cause-specific mortality were regressed on measures of current and cumulative democracy, controlling for confounders. A first analysis covered the 1960-1990 period, a second covered the 1987-2008 period.
   In the 1960-1990 period, current democracy was more strongly associated with higher life expectancy than cumulative democracy. The positive effects of current democracy on total mortality were mediated mainly by lower mortality from heart disease, pneumonia, liver cirrhosis, and suicide.
   In the 1987-2008 period, however, current democracy was associated with lower, and cumulative democracy with higher life expectancy, particularly among men. The positive effects of cumulative democracy on total mortality were mediated mainly by lower mortality from circulatory diseases, cancer of the breast, and external causes. Current democracy was associated with higher mortality from motor vehicle accidents in both periods, and also with higher mortality from cancer and all external causes in the second.
   Our results suggest that in Europe during these two periods democratization has had mixed effects. That short-term changes in levels of democracy had positive effects in the first but not in the second period is probably due to the fact that democratization in Central and Eastern Europe was part of a complete system change which caused major societal disruptions.

AB Objective To compare the drowning mortality rates and proportion of deaths of each intent among all drowning deaths in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in 2012-2014.
   Design A population-based cross-sectional study.
   Setting 32 OECD countries.
   Participants Individuals in OECD countries who died from drowning.
   Main outcome measures Drowning mortality rates (deaths per 100000 population) and proportion (%) of deaths of each intent (ie, unintentional intent, intentional self-harm, assault, undetermined intent and all intents combined) among all drowning deaths.
   Results Countries with the highest drowning mortality rates (deaths per 100000 population) were Estonia (3.53), Japan (3.49) and Greece (2.40) for unintentional intent; Ireland (0.96), Belgium (0.96) and Korea (0.89) for intentional self-harm; Austria (0.57), Korea (0.56) and Hungary (0.44) for undetermined intent and Japan (4.35), Estonia (3.70) and Korea (2.73) for all intents combined. Korea ranked 12th and 3rd for unintentional intent and all intents combined, respectively. By contrast, Belgium ranked 2nd and 15th for intentional self-harm and all intents combined, respectively. The proportion of deaths of each intent among all drowning deaths in each country varied greatly: from 26.2% in Belgium to 96.8% in Chile for unintentional intent; 0.7% in Mexico to 57.4% in Belgium for intentional self-harm; 0.0% in nine countries to 4.9% in Mexico for assault and 0.0% in Israel and Turkey to 38.3% in Austria for undetermined intent.
   Conclusions A large variation in the practice of classifying undetermined intent in drowning deaths across countries was noted and this variation hinders valid international comparisons of intent-specific (unintentional and intentional self-harm) drowning mortality rates.

AB The objectives of this autopsy-based audit of firearm-related fatalities were to acquire data to inform policy decisions and to assess the probability of the injured arriving alive at a hospital and receiving definitive care.
   Evaluated variables: Demographics; co-morbidities; location and intention of the injury; toxicology; types of firearms; Abbreviated Injury Scale; Injury Severity Score (ISS): transfer means and time; and location of death.
   Results: Of a total of 370 fatalities, 85.7% were male. The median age was 38 (9-95) years. Suicides (47%) and assaults (45.1%) were the most common underlying intentions.
   The most seriously injured regions were the head (44.5%), thorax (25.7%), abdomen (10.7%), and spine (5.7%).
   Of the 370 total subjects, 4.9% had an ISS < 16 and 59.5% had an ISS <= 74; both groups were classified as potentially preventable deaths.
   The majority (84%) died at the scene, and only 9.8% left the emergency department alive for further treatment.
   Multivariate analyses documented that postmortem ISS is an independent factor that predicts the probability of the injured reaching a hospital alive and receiving definitive care.
   Individuals injured in greater Athens and those most seriously injured in the face, abdomen or spine had significantly greater chances of reaching a hospital alive and receiving definitive care, whereas those injured by a shotgun and the positive toxicology group were significantly less likely to.
   In conclusion, this study provides data to inform policy decisions, calls for a surveillance network and establishes a baseline for estimating the probability regarding the location of firearm-related deaths. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background Despite a clear impact on the Canadian economy, little is known about the subsequent health impacts of the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC) in this country. This study fills this gap in knowledge by conducting a repeated cross-sectional analysis of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS).
   Methods Data from 7 cycles (2007-2013) of the CCHS were combined to form a large data set representative of the Canadian working-age population (15-64 years) residing in 1 of 10 provinces. A logistic regression model was used to determine whether exposure to various periods of the GFC resulted in increased odds of reporting poor mental health. Exposure was categorised into 4 periods based on political and economic indicators, as follows: precrisis period (baseline), initial crisis period, stimulus period and austerity period. Other outcomes investigated included: anxiety disorders (AD), mood disorders (MD), poor physical health and health-related behaviours (heavy alcohol drinking (HAD) and decreased fruit/vegetable consumption (FVC)).
   Results A significant increased odds of reporting poor mental health was observed during the austerity period compared with the precrisis period (OR=1.26 (1.16 to 1.32)); findings remain significant when adjusted for sex, marital status and education. Exposure to the austerity period was also significantly associated with increased odds of reporting AD, MD, HAD and decreased odds of FVC. No significant associations were observed for the poor self-perceived physical health variable.
   Conclusions Statistically significant associations were observed between several negative health outcomes and the austerity period when compared with the precrisis period. Austerity has been linked to worsening health in other studies and represents an example of how the policy response can have greater detrimental impact on health than the financial crisis itself.

   Greek economic crisis: an interrupted time-series analysis

   IMPACT
AB Background Greece was one of the countries hit the hardest by the 2008 financial crisis in Europe. Yet, evidence on the effect of the crisis on total and cause-specific mortality remains unclear. We explored whether the economic crisis affected the trend of overall and cause-specific mortality rates.
   Methods We used regional panel data from the Hellenic Statistical Authority to assess mortality trends by age, sex, region, and cause in Greece between January, 2001, and December, 2013. We used Eurostat data to calculate monthly age-standardised mortality rates per 100 000 inhabitants for each region. Data were divided into two subperiods: before the crisis (January, 2001, to August, 2008) and after the onset of the crisis (September, 2008, to December, 2013). We tested for changes in the slope of mortality by doing an interrupted time-series analysis.
   Findings Overall mortality continued to decline after the onset of the financial crisis (-0.065, 95% CI -0.080 to -0.049), but at a slower pace than before the crisis (-0.13, -0.15 to -0.10; trend difference 0.062, 95% CI 0.041 to 0.083; p<0.0001). The trend difference was more evident for females (0.087, 95% CI 0.064-0.11; p<0.0001) than for males (0.040, 0.013-0.066; p=0.007). Those aged at least 75 years experienced more negative effects (trend difference 0 . 056, 95% CI 0.042 to 0.071; p<0.0001) than did those aged 20-34 years, in whom mortality trends improved (-0.0074, -0.0089 to -0.0059; p<0.0001). Deaths by diseases of the circulatory system declined more slowly after the onset of compared with before the crisis (trend difference 0.043, 95% CI 0.024 to 0.063; p<0.0001), whereas deaths from vehicular accidents declined faster (-0.0062, -0.0090 to -0.0033; p<0.0001), most prominently among men aged 20-34 years (-0.0065, -0.0085 to -0.0044; p<0.0001). Conversely, deaths from suicides (trend difference 0.0021, 95% CI 0.00092-0.0033; p=0.002), diseases of the nervous system (0.0036, 0.0016-0.0056; p=0.002), and mental health problems (0.00073, 0.000047-0.0014 p=0.038) increased after the onset of the crisis. Also, deaths due to adverse events during medical treatment increased significantly after the onset of the crisis (trend difference 0.0020, 95% CI 0.0012-0.0028; p<0.0001). By comparing the expected values of the period after the onset of the crisis with extrapolated values based on the period before the crisis, we estimate that an extra 242 deaths per month occurred after the onset of the crisis.
   Interpretation Mortality trends have been interrupted after the onset of compared with before the crisis, but changes vary by age, sex, and cause of death. The increase in deaths due to adverse events during medical treatment might reflect the effects of deterioration in quality of care during economic recessions.Copyright (C) The Author(s).
