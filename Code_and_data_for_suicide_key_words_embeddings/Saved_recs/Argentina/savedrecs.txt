AB This study examined the lifetime prevalence and correlates of attempted suicide among transgender persons in Argentina. Data were derived from a nation-wide, cross-sectional survey conducted in 2013. We assessed individual, social, and structural correlates of reporting a history of attempting suicide using logistic regression. Among 482 participants, the median age was 30, 91% identified as transwomen, and 32% resided in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area. A lifetime suicide attempt was reported by 159 (33%), among whom the median age at first attempt was 17. In a multivariate model, internalized stigma was positively associated with a history of suicidal behavior, while participants with stable housing had reduced odds of prior suicide attempt(s). These findings suggest that reducing stigma and mitigating structural vulnerabilities (through, for example, the enactment and enforcement of laws that prohibit discrimination based on gender identity to ensure equitable access to housing) could be effective targets for intervention to reduce suicide attempts among transgender individuals in Argentina.

AB This work shows an analysis of the journalistic treatment of four cases of suicide of international celebrities in digital newspapers of three Spanish-speaking countries: Argentina, Spain and Peru. Two of them, Argentina and Peru, regulate the treatment of suicide through their deontological codes. In Spain, none of the deontological codes applied at the national level do so. The chosen cases have been those of Chester Bennington, Robin Williams, Tony Scott and Alexander McQueen. Our goal was to identify the degree of adequacy of the media to self-regulation norms and to the recommendations of health professionals. We did an analysis of journalistic content, deontological codes and international guidelines prepared by health experts. The results reveal the dysfunction in the informative treatment and the deontological norms regarding the international directives.

DE Youth; suicide; anthropology; qualitative

AB It is presented results of an anthropological research about suicides of young men occurred during the period 2010 to 2013, in Bahia Blanca, Argentina. The main purpose is to characterize suicide as a communicational fact following the postulates of Hjelmeland and Knizek. The methodology is qualitative, it is developed a semiotic approach on: 14 court cases entitled suicide, interviews to informants linked to such cases and facebook commemorative walls linked to 2 of the 14 deaths occurred. Results show that suicide is a perlocutory act, an imperative interruption on the ongoing dialogue which occurs when the young suicide does not find an argumentative strategy to sustain claims towards his other signifiers. These others modify their actions towards the satisfaction of those demands once death occurs. By destroying the physical person, the suicide, manages to preserve his social person.

AB Background: Mental health practices consider unemployment as a suicide main risk factor, based on models built for populations of developed countries. Aim: This study assesses the association between the occupational risk factor and suicidal behaviors, by considering sex, age and temporal distribution, in a Latin American Andean population from north westernmost Argentina. Methods: Data include 481 suicide attempt cases assisted by emergency service psychologists at a head hospital in the Jujuy Province, northern Argentina, during two biennials. General categories and specific types of occupational situation, sex, age and temporal distribution were analyzed. Results: 83.58% of cases corresponded to the with occupation category, but without occupation characterized male cases (p-value = .01). The type no referred occupation (19.15%) mainly contributed to this association (p-value = .02). Unemployed only represented 1.6%. These features revealed independent from the biennial period of assistance (p-value = .96 (general), p-value = .86 (specific)). Associations by age ranges did not seem to be specific of suicidal attempts. Conclusion: The present contribution provides an occupational characterization of suicide attempts in an Andean population from north westernmost Argentina. Unemployment is not associated with suicidal behavior in this population, suggesting that dissimilar patterns underlie suicidal behavior of populations from developed and developing regions.

AB Argentina has one of the highest suicide rates in Latin America and the Caribbean. Though people living with HIV are at increased risk for suicidal behavior, little research on suicide risk has been conducted among HIV-positive people in this region. This study examined risk factors for suicidal ideation among HIV-infected adults (N = 360) re-engaging in care in Argentina. Overall, 21% of participants reported suicidal ideation in the past week. In adjusted logistic regression models, younger age, increased depressive symptomatology, and drug abuse were associated with suicidal ideation (p < 0.05); decreased motivation for adherence and fewer months since initiating antiretroviral therapy approached significance (p = 0.07). Suicidal ideation was common in this sample of HIV-positive patients in Argentina. Findings highlight the need for routine risk assessment and interventions integrated into the HIV care continuum, addressing depression, substance use, and suicidal behavior.

AB A retrospective review was undertaken of 287 unnatural deaths undergoing medicolegal investigation over a 10-year period from January 2008 to December 2017 in Rio Grande, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. There were 219 males and 68 females, age range 7 months to 88 years (average 38.4 years). The 135 accidental deaths (47%) were due mainly to vehicle crashes (N = 62) and carbon monoxide toxicity from fires (N = 31). The 115 cases of suicides (40.1%) were predominantly due to hanging (N = 75) and gunshot wounds (N = 20). The 37 cases of homicide (12.9%) were mainly due to stabbing/sharp force injury (N = 20) and blunt force trauma (N = 9). Carbon monoxide toxicity from faulty heating accounted for a substantial percentage (8.1%) of the accidental deaths. Firearm homicides and suicides related to drug toxicity and carbon monoxide inhalation were relatively uncommon medicolegal cases in this centre.

AB A most shocking criminal case that recently took place in Argentina deals with a suicide committed by a rich, handsome and famous young TV reporter. He seemed to have everything, but suddenly everything went wrong: drugs, sexual promiscuity, work pressure and bad companies made up an explosive cocktail that finished his life. He was attended by a psychiatrist who had recommended him to have a full time confinement in hospital; but he did not respect the physician's words. Due to that, he committed suicide. othing is clear in the case. Some investigators are saying that it was not a suicide, that it was a homicide. Some are even speaking about a government conspiracy. Other theories are putting the blame on the psychiatrist, as if it were a "mal praxis" case. he suicide/homicide of the famous TV reporter has released many suicides and attempts of suicide on young people aged 16 to 25. hat is in the mind of a suicidal? How does it work? Which are the causes that lead someone to kill himself? How can work pressure, drugs and fame affect someone? Besides, why can a famous person suicide trigger the decision of many other people to follow his fate? Is our society so fragile? Is this a problem in Argentina, or does it take place everywhere?
   Furthermore, 1 will try to explain the procedure the Criminal Justice follows in order to investigate a suicide, a suicide attempt and a suicide instigation.
   Finally, I will give full consideration to the real case. And I will also analyze the problem described above and try to answer all the aforementioned questions in the panel presentation.
   As a conclusion, I will make a series of recommendations based on Argentinean and international experiences.

AB Of those in the general population hospitalized for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in Argentina, many reattempt suicide and are readmitted. However, few studies in Argentina have examined suicidal ideation and suicide-related behaviors among people living with HIV (PLHIV) and none have examined these factors among nonadherent PLHIV, though the prevalence of suicidal ideation in this group may be higher than in the general population and also than in other groups of PLHIV. This study of PLHIV in Buenos Aires, Argentina, examined the correlates of suicidal ideation in nonadherent PLHIV. Nonadherent patients with HIV (N=118) were recruited from two clinics providing outpatient healthcare services to PLHIV in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Participants completed assessments on demographic characteristics, depression and suicidality, stigma, and self-efficacy. Participants were HIV-infected men (51%) and women (49%) with a median age of 40 years (IQR=11). About half had completed high school or more, two-thirds were employed, and had a mean monthly income of 4196.79 (SD=3179.64) Argentine pesos (USD$221). Thirty-three (28% [95% CI 20.3, 37.3]) participants reported suicidal ideation in the past two weeks, and one-third (35.6% [27.1, 44.9]) reported lifetime suicidal ideation. In bivariate analyses, attending a public clinic, being female, younger, unemployed, and experiencing greater stigma and depression were associated with suicidal ideation. In multivariable logistic regression, stigma interacted with the number of years since HIV diagnosis to predict suicidal ideation. The impact of stigma on suicidal ideation decreased with time since HIV diagnosis, suggesting that suicidal ideation may arise following HIV diagnosis due to perception of HIV-related stigma. Interventions to reduce perceived stigma during the period following HIV diagnosis may reduce suicidal ideation in this population. Organizational initiatives that explore HIV stigma microagressions in the healthcare setting may be needed to optimize health outcomes.

AB Purpose: To examine suicide mortality trends among young people (10-24 years of age(1)) in selected countries and territories of the Americas.
   Methods: An ecological study was conducted using a time series of suicide mortality data from 19 countries and one territory in the Region of the Americas from 2001 to 2008, comprising 90.3% of the regional population. The analyses included age-adjusted suicide mortality rates, average annual variation in suicide mortality rates, and relative risks for suicide, by age and sex.
   Results: The mean suicide rate for the selected study period and countries/territory was 5.7/100,000 young people (10-24 years), with suicide rates higher among males (7.7/100,000) than females (2.4/100,000). Countries with the highest total suicide mortality rates among young people (10-24 years) were Guyana, Suriname, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Chile, and Ecuador; countries with the lowest total suicide mortality rates included Mexico, Venezuela, Cuba, and Brazil, and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. During this period, there was a significant increase in suicide mortality rates among young people in the following countries: Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, and Suriname; countries with significant decreases in suicide mortality rates included Canada, Colombia, Cuba, El Salvador, and Venezuela. The three leading suicide methods in the Americas were hanging, firearms, and poisoning.
   Conclusions: Some countries of the Americas have experienced a rise in adolescent and youth suicide during the study period, with males at a higher risk of committing suicide than females. Adolescent and youth suicide policies and programs are recommended, to curb this problem. Methodological limitations are discussed. (C) 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a causal agent in many negative adulthood outcomes, including the risk for life -threatening behaviors such as suicide ideation and suicide attempts. Traumatic events such as CSA may pose risk in the healthy development of cognitive and emotional functioning during childhood. In fact, high impulsivity, a risk factor for suicidal behavior, is characteristic of CSA victims. The current study aims to understand the relations among CSA, impulsivity, and frequency of lifetime suicide attempts among a female patient sample admitted for suicidal behavior. Participants included 177 female patients between the ages of 18 and 63 years admitted at two hospitals in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Number of previous suicide attempts and CSA were assessed via structured interviews, while impulsivity was assessed with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11). A model of structural equations was employed to evaluate the role of impulsivity in the relation between CSA and suicide attempts. CSA (beta = .18, p<.05) and impulsivity (beta = .24, p < .05) were associated with the number of previous suicide attempts. However, impulsivity was not significantly associated with CSA (beta = .09, p > .05). CSA and impulsivity are independently associated with lifetime suicide attempts among female patients with recent suicidal behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Firearm policy; Gun violence; Synthetic control group; Homicide; Suicide
ID SUICIDES; DEATHS
AB Gun Buyback programs have been implemented in various forms in countries such as the UK, USA, Brazil, Australia, and Argentina. Whether or not these programs are an effective approach for reducing national violent crime and homicides, however, remains unclear. Much of the uncertainty is due to the different ways in which Gun Buyback programs have been implemented. The Australian Gun Buyback program is distinguished from Gun Buyback programs in other countries by its abrupt implementation, its narrow focus on a particular class of firearms, and its broad application across the entire population. We assess the impact of Australia's 1996 Gun Buyback program on national homicide rates using a synthetic control group quasi-experimental design, comparing the results to suicide and motor vehicle fatality trends to test for plausible alternative hypotheses. Results suggest that the Gun Buyback program significantly reduced Australia's homicide rate in the decade following the intervention (1997-2007).

AB The Inventory of Suicide Orientation ISO-30 is one of the most widely employed scales in Argentina. This paper aims to analyse the psychometric features of the scale in a sample of adolescent students and young college students from Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires. The study entailed two phases. The exploratory phase took into account 821 cases (62.5% female, 37.5% male; M-age=16.40; DS=1.09) and carried out evidences of content validity analyses and an exploratory factor analysis. The confirmatory phase included 297 adolescents and young adults (all students, 67% female, 33% male; M-age=16.78; DS=2.02). A confirmatory factor analysis and internal consistency analyses were conducted. Furthermore, the dimensional model obtained was compared to the previous model. Results allowed to present a shorter version of the scale, ISO-19 which, despite of its differences with the original version, ISO-30 showed adequate psychometric evidences which support and justify its applicability.

AB The main objective was to analyze the level, trend and impact of mortality by external causes in Colombia and Mexico between 1998 and 2015. The years of life lost were calculated for people younger than 85 years of age and their trend was estimated using a joinpoint regression analysis. The decomposition of life expectancy by cause of death and age groups was also calculated. In Colombia a significant decrease was observed in all the analyzed external causes of death; in Mexico, the increase of mortality by homicides and the continued rise in suicides reversed their declining trend. Mexico presented a higher mortality due to external causes than Colombia, which clearly shows the divergent trends in both countries.

AB The evolution of the homicide rate in the outskirts of Buenos Aires and also the existing relation between these episodes and the macroeconomic processes developed in Argentina during period 1989-2006 were analyzed. An ecological study was carried out with correlation analysis among detrended series of the variables to assess the association between mortality by manslaughter and selected macroeconomic indicators (previous softening process according to Hodrick-Prescott). The main results are: the homicide rate decreases during the two first years to keep itself stable till 1997, then it starts increasing. It reaches its peak in 2002 (11,7 per 100.000 inhabitants) to start a decline that ill 2006 present similar values to the ones in 7992. A significant correlation was found between the homicide rate and the Gini coefficient (according to family incomes), the percentage of the Population under the poverty line and the NGP. No correlation was found between homicides and unemployment. The findings suggest that the homicide rate is directly related to poverty and inequality, and inversely to economic development.

AB This work analyzes the impact of firearm mortality between 1980 and 2012 in Argentina. For this purpose a descriptive epidemiological time trend study was carried out including the following variables: sex, age group, intentionality and jurisdiction. Data was obtained from the Office of Health Statistics and Information of the Argentine Ministry of Health. A total of 87,671 deaths due to firearms were discovered, of which 85.7% occurred in men. The highest mortality rate due to firearms corresponded to the year 2002, reaching 21.2 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. The age group concentrating the largest number of deaths due to firearms was that of 20-29 years, accounting for 25.6% of all deaths. The highest adjusted rates corresponded to the years 2000-2002, with values of 10.0 to 11.6 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. This time period coincides with the institutional-economic crisis the country experienced. The province of Buenos Aires was the place of residence of 49.1% of the deceased. In the discussion, political-economic and ideological-cultural dimensions of the relations among firearms, violence, science and society are considered.

AB Introduction. Drug poisoning among children is a frequent reason for visits to the emergency department; among adolescents, it is intentional.
   Objective. To describe the characteristics of drug poisoning among adolescents admitted to the municipal hospital of Bahia Blanca.
   Material and method. Descriptive study based on the review of medical records of patients aged 10-19 years seen for drug poisoning between 2012 and 2016. The following outcome measures were analyzed: age, sex, drug used, cause, clinical manifestations, and length of stay in days. Results. Data from 72 patients were collected. Their mean age was 16 years, and the female:male ratio was 2.5:1. Anxiolytic poisoning (30%) predominated, followed by polydrug use (25%). Ninety-five percent of patients showed a suicidal intention; of these, 55% had a history of suicide attempt.
   Conclusion. Drug poisoning was observed predominantly among girls; it is worth noting the high percentage of youth who had a history of suicide attempt.

AB Objectives: To determine the level of knowledge about depressive disorders including their treatment, comorbidities and suicide potential among a number of general practitioners who agreed to fill out a questionnaire and provided information about their professional activities.
   Method: Exploratory cross-sectional study among a number of physicians who answered voluntarily and anonymously a questionnaire consisting of twelve questions. Data collected from 288 physicians were analyzed.
   Results: The majority of physicians (97.6%, n = 281) considered that depression was a disease, but 39.6% (n = 114) believed that it was caused by lack of will power or characterological weaknesses, which create a dissonance with the concept of disease. They also felt that they did not have enough knowledge about Depressive Disorders such as their origins, type of medications and length of treatment, comorbidities and suicide potential.
   Conclusions: The results point to the need for continuous medical education about Depressive Disorders among general practitioners.

AB Cybervictimization and cyberbullying is an important risk factor for the mental health of individuals, for example, suffering cybervictimization can lead to suicide in victims. However, few studies have been conducted in Argentina to determine their psychological correlates in college students. Therefore, an intentional sample of 410 university students who studied regular first to fifth year in private universities of Parana, Entre Rios, Argentina was constituted; 75% were women. The ages ranged from 17 years to 36, with an average of 21.8 years. The participants completed Calvete et al. Cyberbullying Questionnaire, Lovibond and Lovibond Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, and Labrador et al. Problematic Use of New Technology Questionnaire. A 27% was cybervictim and a 31% was cyberaggressor, more women than men were cybervictims, and no differences were detected regarding cyberaggression. The results showed that cybervictims presented more depression, anxiety-stress and problematic use of new technology, whereas cyberaggressor only showed more problematic use of new technology. In the discussion we analyze the implications of these findings and we provide limitations and suggestions for future studies.

AB This article analyzes the impact of firearms in the homicides of young people in Latin America today. A cross-sectional descriptive epidemiological study was carried out based on data from the Pan American Health Organization. There were 14,427 deaths due to assaults with firearms in young people, that is, a rate of 14.3 per 100,000 young people for the year 2014 in Latin America. Thus, 80% of all homicides in young people between 10 to 19 years of age in the region were committed with firearms. This especially affects young males, with a rate of 26.5 per 100,000 deaths due to assault with firearms, although it should not be overlooked that the deaths among women are largely femicides. In addition, 1,828 deaths of undetermined intent with firearms (especially in Argentina and Venezuela) and 284 deaths with firearms in legal interventions (showing higher policy lethality among young people) were registered. The corrected rate is therefore 16.4 young people killed by others with firearms per 100,000 youth in Latin America. The need for gun control and disarmament policies, de-stigmatization campaigns and youth development programs is discussed, in order to reduce the current conditions that foster and invisibilize the so-called "armed juvenicide" in Latin America.

DE mental health policies
AB The history of Mental Health care is closely linked to political, social, legal and cultural developments. It reflects the vagaries and difficulties of policy makers in attempting to improve the quality of life for people with mental disorders without stigmatizing them. This work traces the relationship between national policies at different periods in history and Health policies, in particular Mental Health.
   Health policies in Argentina have been among the most advanced in the world. The challenge now is to continue the search for better ways of preventing and treating mental illnesses with a strong social component such as drug addiction, alcoholism, suicide, violence, as well as the social reintegration of chronic patients.
   This article lists recommendations and strategies for the implementation of a participatory community model. The purpose of this model is to avoid and / or reduce psychological damage to the population through promotion and rehabilitation, the building of educational-preventive networks, psychiatric and residential institutions and refocusing human resources on the primary care model.
   It outlines the Federal Plan for Mental Health developed in Cordoba in 2004 and some of the results obtained.

DT Article
DE Maria Ines Krimer; Memory; novela negra; genero negro; dictatorship;

AB Lo que nosotras sabiamos by Maria Ines Krimer portrays life in a cement-producing village in Argentina during the dictatorship. The narrative voicenosotras is that of wives of company managers who are reconstructing their memories and in the process seek the reasons behind the suicide of a woman in the village. There are references to ominous occurrences related to the dictatorship, and we discover that behind the appearance of normality lurks the sordid reality of a society complicit with the abuses of power. This study will consider how Lo que nosotras sabiamos fuses elements of the genero negro with a memory narrative to reproduce a discourse of social actors whothrough their prejudices, their alliance with power, and veil of secrecyserved to legitimize State terror. Recent work by memory theorists helps us understand how memory discourses function to enable individuals to come to terms with painful experiences and denounce human rights violations. However, in the case of the narrators, who repress the truth out of their interest in defending the regime, they are unable to give a unifying meaning to the past and find closure. Thus the reader becomes the ultimate detective who pieces together the clues.

AB Background: Neuromyelitis optica is a relapsing inflammatory, secondarily demyelinating astrocytopathy that most commonly affects the optic nerves and the spinal cord.
   Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the psychopathological profile, presence of current depression, and suicidality in patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) in an Argentinean cohort, and compare these parameters to those in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and in healthy controls (HCs).
   Methods: Twenty patients with NMOSD, 18 with MS, and 20 healthy controls were included. The presence and grade of current depression were assessed using Beck's depression inventory (BDI), while psychiatric disease and suicidality were assessed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview.
   Results: The prevalence of psychiatric disease in the NMOSD group was 45%, significantly higher than in the MS group (16%, p = 0.06) and the HCs (5%, p = 0.008).
   Recurrent major depressive disorder was the most frequent psychiatric disease and was diagnosed in four (20%) patients in the NMOSD group and in two (11%) patients in the MS group. In the NMOSD group, two (10%) patients were diagnosed with past manic episodes, one (5%) with current dysthymic disorder, one (5%) with lifetime psychotic disorder, and one (5%) with bulimia nervosa. One patient (5.5%) in the MS group and one in the HC (5%) were diagnosed with current generalized anxiety disorder.
   Ten patients (50%) in the NMOSD group had current depressive symptoms versus five (28%) patients in the MS group (p = 0.16) and two (10%) in the HC group (p = 0.02). Six (30%) patients with NMOSD versus only one (5.5%) patient with MS had attempted suicide at least once, this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.05). Current suicide risk was high in patients with NMOSD (8, 40%) and moderate in patients with MS (4, 22%).
   Conclusions: Our study shows that the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities in patients with NMOSD is significantly higher than in patients with MS and healthy controls. Given the high frequency of suicidality, assessment of pertinent psychiatric disorders in such patients to optimize monitoring and comprehensive treatment is required.

AB In El Calafate, Argentina, a remote global nature tour destination where tourists lodge en route to experience the spectacular glacial beauty of Patagonia, a 17-year-old local boy was kidnapped and taken to an otherwise unremarkable waterscape on the edge of town, where he was tortured and executed. His death, however, was officially declared a suicide. The malevolence of his assailants and their protectors moved outward from the youth's body and the crime site into the homes of despairing and disbelieving family and friends, overflowing into private and public protest, all to no avail. The crime and its aftermath dramatically altered the lives of the victim's working-class family and friends.
   While their faith in the local police and courts has nearly been destroyed, and faith in relevant human rights law barely ignited, continued communication about this crime as part of an ongoing community disaster seems to infer an unspecified promise, or at least, a stubborn desire, to continue seeking justice with words. In this article, I explore the layered attempts of family and friend's to narrate, counter, and untangle the causes and effects emanating from the youth's murder, the official evidence box, and the spatially situated terror that persists. Mediated through ethnographic writing, the forensic narration shows how violent crime distorts and divides human perception of everyday places with ominous and artful precision.

AB Introduction The objective of this study was to explore the acceptability of rapid HIV self-testing (RHST) among men who have sex with men (MSM).
   Methods During 2006-2009, a sample of 500 MSM was recruited through Respondent Driven Sampling for an HIV prevalence/incidence study. Attitude toward RHST was explored among HIV negative MSM. Data were weighted prior to analyses.
   Results Participants reported they were likely to buy RHST (74%), test themselves more frequently than they currently do (77%), and that the procedure would simplify testing (70%). Furthermore, 71% reported they would probably use it alone, 66% would use it with a steady partner, and 56% with a friend/partner. While a majority acknowledged that RHST use would deprive them of receiving counseling (61%), 74% declared they would go for help if they tested positive; 57% would use an RHST in order to avoid condoms. Probability of use surpassed 70% among gay and non-gay identified MSM as well as those with and without a previous HIV test. Those likely to buy RHST were older (p = 0.025) and more likely to identify as gay (p = 0.036). A total of 17% said they would think about killing themselves and 9% would attempt suicide if they tested positive. These MSM were more likely to be younger (p<0.001), with lower mood level (p<0.001) and greater feelings of loneliness (p = 0.026).
   Conclusions The high acceptability of RHST found among MSM should encourage the authorities to consider the possibility of offering it for self-testing, as it can improve early diagnosis and prevention of future transmissions. However, further research is needed to understand how to

AB BACKGROUND: High concentrations of lithium in drinking water were previously discovered in the Argentinean Andes Mountains. Lithium is used worldwide for treatment of bipolar disorder and treatment-resistant depression. One known side effect is altered thyroid function.
   OBJECTIVES: We assessed associations between exposure to lithium from drinking water and other environmental sources and thyroid function.
   METHODS: Women (n = 202) were recruited in four Andean villages in northern Argentina. Lithium exposure was assessed based on concentrations in spot urine samples, measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Thyroid function was evaluated by plasma free thyroxine (T(4)) and pituitary gland thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), analyzed by routine immuno metric methods.
   RESULTS: The median urinary lithium concentration was 3,910 mu g/L (5th, 95th percentiles, 270 mu g/L, 10,400 mu g/L). Median plasma concentrations (5th, 95th percentiles) of T(4) and TSH were 17 pmol/L (13 pmol/L, 21 pmol/L) and 1.9 mIU/L, (0.68 mIU/L, 4.9 mIU/L), respectively. Urine lithium was inversely associated with T(4) [beta for a 1,000-mu g/L increase = -0.19; 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.31 to -0.068; p = 0.002] and positively associated with TSH (beta = 0.096; 95% CI, 0.033 to 0.16; p = 0.003). Both associations persisted after adjustment (for T(4), beta = -0.17; 95% CI, -0.32 to -0.015; p = 0.032; for TSH: beta = 0.089; 95% CI, 0.024 to 0.15; p = 0.007). Urine selenium was positively associated with T(4) (adjusted T(4) for a 1 mu g/L increase: beta = 0.041; 95% CI, 0.012 to 0.071; p = 0.006).
   CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to lithium via drinking water and other environmental sources may affect thyroid function, consistent with known side effects of medical treatment with lithium. This stresses the need to screen for lithium in all drinking water sources.

AB Objective: This multicenter study estimated the prevalence of bipolar disorder (BPD) among emergency department (ED) patients in Latin America. Methods: To identify patients with BPD, a combination of DSM IV-criteria interview and the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) was used. Data from 1,505 patients from hospitals in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico was analyzed. Results: The prevalence of BPD in this sample was 5.2% (95% CI = 4.5% to 6.9%). Themean age was 37 years (response rate of 83.0%). Compared to non-BPD patients, BPD patients were more likely to report asthma (16.7% vs. 9%), thyroid problems (12.8% vs. 5.8%), seizures (23.1% vs. 3.0%), obesity (39.7% vs. 26.9%), alcohol abuse (30.8% vs. 10.0%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (50.0% vs. 12.0%), depression (81.6% vs. 45.7%), obsessive compulsive disorder (20.1% vs. 3.0%), panic disorders (23.1% vs. 12.3%), phobic disorders (11.2% vs. 3.1%), and any anxiety disorder (82.1% vs. 41.8%; all p <= 0.05). Suicidal plans and attempts were also significant higher in the bipolar group (11.5% vs. 2.8% and 10.3% vs. 1.8% respectively). Multivariate analysis identified ADHD, depression, alcohol abuse, anxiety disorder, and last month suicide plans and attempts to be independently associated with BPD. Conclusion: Our study supports that BPD is prevalent in ED in Latin-American countries and that comorbidity is the rule, not the exception. Patients presenting at ED with irritability, anxiety, pressure speech, euphoria, with suicidal tendencies, involved in risky behaviors, alcohol abuse, dependence or those with history of mental health hospitalization in the past 12 months must be assessed for comorbid BPD.
