AB Background: Belgium is a country with a high suicide rate (19.1/100,000 in 2004), and railway suicide poses a substantial safety and public health problem. This problem was addressed by the Suicide Prevention Unit of Infrabel (Manager of the Belgian Railway Infrastructure), which collects relevant data and implements a prevention program. Aims: To present data on fatal and nonfatal suicidal behavior on the Belgian railway network, including monthly and regional distribution and identification of hotspots; and to present the Infrabel suicide prevention program. Methods: Analysis of Infrabel data on railway suicide (1998-2009) and comparison with data on suicide in Belgium. Results: A total of 1,092 railway suicides (1998-2009) and 557 suicide attempts (2003-2009) in Belgium (fatality rate of 54%) were studied. Monthly fluctuations were observed, with the majority of suicides occurring in Flanders, followed by Wallonia and Brussels. We identified 34 hotspots accounting for 35% of cases, mostly in Flanders. Conclusions: In 2004 railway suicide accounted for 5.3% of all suicides in Belgium (railway suicide rate of 1.03/100,000). Such a major human and economic loss warrants implementation of prevention measures. Infrabel has initiated a comprehensive suicide prevention program which focuses mainly on safeguarding the suicide hotspots.

AB This study investigated the geographic distribution of suicide and railway suicide in Belgium over 2008--2013 on local (i.e., district or arrondissement) level. There were differences in the regional distribution of suicide and railway suicides in Belgium over the study period. Principal component analysis identified three groups of correlations among population variables and socio-economic indicators, such as population density, unemployment, and age group distribution, on two components that helped explaining the variance of railway suicide at a local (arrondissement) level. This information is of particular importance to prevent suicides in high-risk areas on the Belgian railway network.

AB Background: Suicide is a leading cause of mortality in prisoners worldwide, yet empirical data on this matter are lacking in Belgium. Aims: This study sought to describe characteristics associated with a consecutive series of suicides in Belgian prisons from 2000 to 2016 inclusive, in order to inform suicide prevention strategies. Method: All documented cases of suicide (N = 262) were reviewed using a standardized assessment checklist. Official records were abstracted for prisoners sociodemographic, criminological, and clinical information, as well as for suicide-related characteristics. Results: Over the 17-year study period, suicides accounted for one third of all deaths in Belgian prisons. The average annual suicide rate in Belgium from 2000 to 2016 was 156.2 per 100,000 prisoners. Examination of all cases highlights both individual (psychiatric disorders and a history of suicide attempt) and situational (the early period of incarceration, interfacility transfers, and placement in solitary confinement) factors common in many prison suicides; some of them amenable to (clinical) management, which presents several potential avenues for suicide prevention. Limitations: Given the absence of a matched control group, no conclusions could be ascertained regarding risk factors. Conciusion: Suicide is a common, preventable cause of death among prisoners in Belgium. The results underscore the timely need for national standards and guidelines for suicide prevention in Belgian prisons.

AB Since Durkheim's work on suicide, the family has widely been seen as providing partial protection against the development of tendencies to suicide. This study assesses the impact of parenthood (both number of children and age of youngest child) on suicide following the death of a spouse. Using data for Belgium in the 5 years following the 1991 census, the study adopts a nested case-control design with information on 3,800 suicides and 75,673 matched controls. The analysis takes into account several social-economic variables. The findings show that the impact of children on the elevated suicide levels found among widows and widowers relative to the still married can be positive or negative, and differs by both age and sex of the parent, age of the child or children, and time since bereavement.

AB Objective: To estimate the evolution of incidence of (attempted) suicide between 1993 and 2001 in Belgium and to examine trends in methods, first caretaker and aspects of seasonality.
   Methods: In 1993-1995 and 2000-2001, the national sentinel network of general practitioners registered, for each case of (attempted) suicide, age, sex, date, place of the event, first caretaker, method, and survival.
   Results: Between 1993-1995 and 2000-2001, the incidence of suicide increased among men from 29/100 000 to 35/100 000, and decreased among women from 14/100 000 to 11/100 000. The incidence of attempted suicide increased among men (from 67/100 000 to 71/100 000) and women (from 131/100 000 to 141/100 000). None of the above mentioned changes were statistically significant however. The use of violent methods as opposed to non-violent methods remained unchanged in women (OR: 0.95 [0.63-1.41]).
   Conclusions: No statistically significant trends were observed in the incidence of suicide, the fraction of cases with fatal outcome and the use of violent methods.

LA English
DT Article
DE Belgium; geographical distribution; principal component analysis;
   psychiatric hospitals; railway; suicide; prevention
AB Suicide on railway networks comprises a serious public health problem. However, the geographical distribution and the environmental risk factors remain unclear. This study analyzed the geographic distribution of railway suicides in Belgium from 2008-2013 at the level of a railway section (average length of 3.5 km). Principal component analysis (PCA) identified three groups of correlations that helped explain the variance of railway suicide. The three groups are related to characteristics of urban spaces, psychiatric facilities, and railway traffic density. Based on the PCA results, the study found four types of railway sections. The density of railway suicide was average and low in the urban and rural/industrial sections, respectively. However, it was high in the suburban sections and the sections close to psychiatric facilities. As the geographical proximity of a psychiatric facility comprises a specific risk factor for suicide on railways, preventative measures should target these sections and establish collaborations with psychiatric facilities. The typology of locations found in this study constitutes crucial information for national and local suicide prevention on the Belgian railway network.

TI Media awards for responsible reporting of suicide: Experiences from
   Australia, Belgium and Denmark
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Media awards to encourage responsible reporting of suicide have been introduced in several countries, including Australia, Belgium and Denmark.
   Aims: This study aimed to examine the experiences of Australian, Belgian and Danish award recipients in preparing stories on suicide, and consider the impacts of the awards for these recipients and for media professionals more broadly.
   Method: We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with the majority (14 out of 15) of past recipients of the awards in the three countries of interest.
   Results: Media awards appear to show promise as a method of reinforcing national and international media guidelines on reporting suicide. The recipients of awards were proud to have had their achievements recognized in this way, and had developed a heightened awareness of the issues inherent in reporting suicide. Although relatively few had prepared subsequent stories on suicide, a number had been given opportunities to provide advice to other media professionals about how best to approach this sensitive topic. Recipients viewed the awards as an important means by which good quality reporting can be rewarded, and a springboard for raising community awareness about suicide.
   Conclusion: The experience from Australia, Belgium and Denmark suggests that media awards which recognize responsible reporting of suicide are extremely worthwhile.

AB IMPORTANCE The increasing legalization of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide worldwide makes it important to understand related attitudes and practices.
   OBJECTIVE To review the legal status of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide and the available data on attitudes and practices.
   EVIDENCE REVIEW Polling data and published surveys of the public and physicians, official state and country databases, interview studies with physicians, and death certificate studies (the Netherlands and Belgium) were reviewed for the period 1947 to 2016. FINDINGS Currently, euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide can be legally practiced in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Colombia, and Canada (Quebec since 2014, nationally as of June 2016). Physician-assisted suicide, excluding euthanasia, is legal in 5 US states (Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont, and California) and Switzerland. Public support for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in the United States has plateaued since the 1990s (range, 47%-69%). In Western Europe, an increasing and strong public support for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide has been reported; in Central and Eastern Europe, support is decreasing. In the United States, less than 20% of physicians report having received requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide, and 5% or less have complied. In Oregon and Washington state, less than 1% of licensed physicians write prescriptions for physician-assisted suicide per year. In the Netherlands and Belgium, about half or more of physicians reported ever having received a request; 60% of Dutch physicians have ever granted such requests. Between 0.3% to 4.6% of all deaths are reported as euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide in jurisdictions where they are legal. The frequency of these deaths increased after legalization. More than 70% of cases involved patients with cancer. Typical patients are older, white, and well-educated. Pain is mostly not reported as the primary motivation. A large portion of patients receiving physician-assisted suicide in Oregon and Washington reported being enrolled in hospice or palliative care, as did patients in Belgium. In no jurisdiction was there evidence that vulnerable patients have been receiving euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide at rates higher than those in the general population.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are increasingly being legalized, remain relatively rare, and primarily involve patients with cancer. Existing data do not indicate widespread abuse of these practices.

AB Background: The Netherlands and Belgium legalized euthanasia in 2002.
   Aim: In this study we describe and compare cases of reported euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in the first 5 years of legislation.
   Design/Setting/participants: The databases of the cases reported in Belgium and the Netherlands were made available by the review committees. We compared characteristics of all cases reported between September 2002-December 2007.
   Results: In the Netherlands 10,319 cases were reported, in Belgium 1917. Gender and age distributions were similar in both countries. Most patients suffered from cancer (83-87%), but patients more often suffered from diseases of the nervous system in Belgium (8.3% vs. 3.9%). In the Netherlands, reported euthanasia more often occurred at home compared with Belgium (81% vs. 42%), where it occurred more often in hospital (52% vs. 9%). In the Netherlands, all cases were based on the oral request of a competent patient. In Belgium, 2.1% of the reported cases was based on an advance directive.
   Conclusions: We conclude that countries debating legislation must realise that the rules and procedures for euthanasia they would agree upon and the way they are codified or not into law may influence the practice that develops once the legislation is effected or what part of that practice is reported.

AB Introduction: Both active euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal in The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg and, most recently, in Canada. Aim: Examination of national legislations of countries where both active euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal. The number of accomplished active euthanasia cases and that of assisted suicide cases. Method: Analysis of national statistical data. Comparison of statistical data before and after 2010. Comparison of the related practices in the surveyed countries. Results: The number of active euthanasia cases markedly predominates over the number of assisted suicide cases. Cancer is a main reason for active euthanasia, or assisted suicide. In countries with a larger population, the number of active euthanasia cases is higher than that in countries with a smaller population. Conclusions: Regarding the fact that the applicants for active euthanasia withdraw their requests in a smaller number than the applicants for assisted suicide, patients prefer the choice of active euthanasia. Since the related legislative product is too recent in Canada at present, it may be only presumed that a certain preference will also develop in the related practices in Canada.

AB Murder followed by suicide (M-S) is a rare phenomenon that has been studied in several countries. Previous studies show that offenders of M-S are predominately men who live in an intimate relationship. Amorous jealousy is often the trigger to commit M-S. Shooting is the most common way to kill a partner and/or children. In general, women are likely to become victims. The aim of this study was to identify M-S and detect patterns of M-S in the district of Ghent and the surrounding areas, since no research on this event was conducted in Belgium. Over a period of 75 years, a total of 80 M-S incidents was recorded involving 176 individuals. Eighty-six percent of the offenders were males and 14% were females. Murder-suicides were mostly completed with firearms. The main motive for offenders to execute M-S is amorous jealousy (56%), followed by familial, financial, or social stressors (27%). In addition, three types of M-S were selected (e.g., spousal murder-suicides, filicide-suicides, and familicides-suicides). Our results suggest differences in these types of M-S in which younger couples' intentions were amorous jealousy; as for older couples the prominent motive was mercy killing; most likely women killed their children and only men committed familicides. Finally a study of the evolution during this period was carried out.

AB This article describes and evaluates the Belgian euthanasia experience by considering its practice and policy, both before and after the formal decriminalisation of euthanasia in 2002. The pre-legal practice of euthanasia, the evolution of euthanasia legislation, criticism of this legislation, the influence of politics, and later changes to the 2002 Act on Euthanasia are discussed, as well as the subject of euthanasia of minors and the matter of organ procurement. It is argued that the Belgian euthanasia experience is characterised by political expedition, and that the 2002 Act and its later amendments suffer from practical and conceptual flaws. Illegal euthanasia practices remain a live concern in Belgium, something which nations who are seeking to decriminalise euthanasia should consider.

Background information is provided; then major developments that have taken place since the enactment of the Belgian Act on Euthanasia are analysed. Concerns are raised about (1) the changing role of physicians and imposition on nurses to perform euthanasia; (2) the physicians' confusion and lack of understanding of the Act on Euthanasia; (3) inadequate consultation with an independent expert; (4) lack of notification of euthanasia cases, and (5) organ transplantations of euthanized patients. Some suggestions designed to improve the situation and prevent abuse are offered. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose The places of death for people who died of suicide were compared across eight countries and socio-demographic factors associated with home suicide deaths identified.
   Methods Death certificate data were analyzed; using multivariable binary logistic regression to determine associations.
   Results National suicide death rates ranged from 1.4 % (Mexico) to 6.4 % (South Korea). The proportion of suicide deaths occurring at home was high, ranging from 29.9 % (South Korea) to 65.8 % (Belgium). Being older, female, widowed/separated, highly educated and living in an urban area were risk factors for home suicide.
   Conclusions Home suicide deaths need specific attention in prevention programs.

ID PREVENTION; INTERVENTIONS
AB In 2004, railway suicide accounted for 5.3% of all suicides in Belgium. In 2008, Infrabel (Manager of the Belgian Railway Infrastructure) introduced a railway suicide prevention programme, including identification of suicide hotspots, i.e., areas of the railway network with an elevated incidence of suicide. The study presents an analysis of 43 suicide hotspots based on Infrabel data collected during field visits and semi-structured interviews conducted in mental health facilities in the vicinity of the hotspots. Three major characteristics of the hotspots were accessibility, anonymity, and vicinity of a mental health institution. The interviews identified several risk and protective factors for railway suicide, including the training of staff, introduction of a suicide prevention policy, and the role of the media. In conclusion, a comprehensive railway suicide prevention programme should continuously safeguard and monitor hotspots, and should be embedded in a comprehensive suicide prevention programme in the community.

TI Frequency and impact of patient suicide on psychiatric trainees

DT Article
DE psychiatric trainees; suicide; post-traumatic stress; training
AB The objective of the present study was to conduct a systematic inquiry into the frequency and impact of patients' suicide on psychiatric trainees, and the availability and usefulness of training courses. Data were collected from 114 psychiatric trainees of the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, representing a 70% response rate. A self-report questionnaire developed in the UK was adapted to the Flemish situation. A Dutch version of the Impact of Event Scale (IES) inquiring about post-traumatic stress symptoms was also used. The frequency of suicide experience was considerably higher in the present study than in similar studies in the USA and the UK. Thirty percent of first year trainees had been confronted with patient suicide. Personal and professional impact of patient suicide, as well as post-traumatic stress scores were considerably lower in Flemish psychiatric trainees. They considered informal support to be of more value than formal support to come to terms with the event. Finally, postgraduate training in post-suicide management was found to be largely insufficient. The results of the present study show that psychiatric trainees in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium are at a high risk of experiencing patient suicide, whereas the impact of this experience appears to be relatively low. Only a small minority of trainees has received adequate training on procedures to follow after patient suicide. (C) 2003 Editions scientitiques et medicales Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Suicide mortality in Belgium at the beginning of the 21st century:

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH

AB Background: Suicidal behaviour has long been recognized to vary widely between countries. Yet, rates of suicidal behaviour do not only vary between, but also within countries. Gender and socioeconomic differences in suicidal behaviour are well established, but the literature on suicidal behaviour and migrants is sparse, particularly in Belgium. The present study maps out the occurrence of suicide mortality across three of the largest migrant groups (Italians, Turks and Moroccans) versus the native population in Belgium, and verifies whether this association persists after accounting for socioeconomic variables. Methods: Census-linked mortality follow-up data covering the period 2001-2011 were used to probe into suicide mortality. To compare absolute differences by migrant background, indirect standardisation analyses were carried out. To assess relative differences, Cox proportional hazards models were performed. Analyses were restricted to 18- to 64-year-olds. Results: Belgian men and women have the highest suicide mortality risk, persons of Moroccan/Turkish origin the lowest, and Italians are somewhere in between. When migration generation is considered, the risk is higher for second-generation groups compared to that of the first-generation. Accounting for socioeconomic determinants, the difference between the native population and the various nationality groups intensifies. Conclusion: Although the risk is generally lower for minorities compared to the majority population, the results across migration generations underscore minorities' increased vulnerability to suicide over time. Future research should focus on understanding the risks and protective factors of suicidal behaviour across different nationality groups. This way, tailored policy recommendations can be developed in order to tackle the burden of suicide.

AB Objective To explore the relation between the care provided in the final three months of life and the prevalence and types of end of life decisions in Belgium.
   Design Two year nationwide retrospective study, 2005-6 (SENTI-MELC study).
   Setting Data collection via the sentinel network of general practitioners, an epidemiological surveillance system representative of all general practitioners in Belgium.
   Subjects 1690 non-sudden deaths in practices of the sentinel general practitioners.
   Main outcome measures Non-sudden deaths of patients (aged >1 year) reported each week. Reported care provided in the final three months of life and the end of life decisions made. Multivariable regression analysis controlled for age, sex, cause, and place of death.
   Results Use of specialist multidisciplinary palliative care services was associated with intensified alleviation of symptoms (odds ratio 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 2.6), continuous deep sedation forgoing food/fluid (2.9, 1.7 to 4.9), and the total of decisions explicitly intended to shorten life (1.5, 1.1 to 2.1) but not with euthanasia or physician assisted suicide in particular. To a large extent receiving spiritual care was associated with higher frequencies of euthanasia or physician assisted suicide than receiving little spiritual care (18.5, 2.0 to 172.7).
   Conclusions End of life decisions that shorten life, including euthanasia or physician assisted suicide, are not related to a lower use of palliative care in Belgium and often occur within the context of multidisciplinary care.

AB This population-based study aims to investigate socio-economic factors, depression and psychosis as independent risk factors for a suicide attempt that requires hospitalization, and estimate the incidence of suicide attempts.
   Individual-level administrative data were analysed that were collected for all members of the Socialist Health Insurance Schemes in Belgium during the period 2011-2013 (N = 3,156,030) in the context of the financing of the health care services provided. Bivariate and multivariate odds ratios were calculated for multiple socio-economic factors, socio-demographic factors and the presence of depression and psychosis.
   During the study period, 4063 persons were hospitalized due to a suicide attempt. The incidence of suicide attempts with hospital admittance was 48.0/100,000 persons/year. Being unemployed, incapable of work over a shorter or longer period with substitute income, living on social welfare, having an increased healthcare reimbursement, living alone and using antidepressants or antipsychotics were identified as independent factors that contributed to the risk of hospitalization due to a suicide attempt.
   Persons from low income groups, however defined, those living alone, or persons using antidepressants or antipsychotics are at an increased risk of attempting suicide and needing hospitalization for it. A social policy that focuses on the improvement of these factors or their consequences may be expected to have a favourable effect on the number of suicide attempts. Funding of mental health care should also better match population needs.

AB In this ecological study, we investigated whether help-seeking related to stigma, intentions, and attitudes toward suicide are associated with the suicide rates of 20 regions within the Netherlands and Belgium. Significant associations were found between regional suicide rates and the intention to seek informal help (=-1.47, p=.001), self-stigma (=1.33, p=.038), and shame (=.71, p=.030). The association between self-stigma and suicide rate was mediated by intentions to seek informal help. These results suggest that to promote suicide prevention at the level of the regional population, stigma, shame, and intentions to seek help should be targeted in the public domain.

AB An ecological study of age-standardized suicide rates in Belgian communities (1996-2005) was conducted using spatial regression techniques. Community characteristics were significantly related to suicide rates. There was mixed support for the social integration perspective: single person households were associated with higher suicide rates, while religious participation was unrelated and both immigration and the presence of non-European inhabitants had a negative impact. Deprivation had a positive relation with suicide. Population density had a negative influence on suicide rates. Areas with older populations had higher suicide risks than expected. A spatial contagion effect of neighboring communities was present for men. In the conclusion, hypotheses are presented on why an aging population could be associated with higher suicide rates in the community.

AB Objective
   To review the empirical claims made in: Pereira J. Legalizing euthanasia or assisted suicide: the illusion of safeguards and controls. Curr Oncol 2011;18:e38-45.
   Design
   We collected all of the empirical claims made by Jose Pereira in "Legalizing euthanasia or assisted suicide: the illusion of safeguards and controls." We then collected all reference sources provided for those claims. We compared the claims with the sources (where sources were provided) and evaluated the level of support, if any, the sources provide for the claims. We also reviewed other available literature to assess the veracity of the empirical claims made in the paper. We then wrote the present paper using examples from the review.
   Results
   Pereira makes a number of factual statements without providing any sources. Pereira also makes a number of factual statements with sources, where the sources do not, in fact, provide support for the statements he made. Pereira also makes a number of false statements about the law and practice in jurisdictions that have legalized euthanasia or assisted suicide.
   Conclusions
   Pereira's conclusions are not supported by the evidence he provided. His paper should not be given any credence in the public policy debate about the legal status of assisted suicide and euthanasia in Canada and around the world.

AB Background: Depression is accompanied by a depletion of n-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). There is also a negative correlation between suicide and fish-oil intake (rich in n-3 PUFAs) across different countries. Both depression and suicide show a seasonal variation and are related to disorders in the serotonergic system.
   Aims: The present study was carried out to determine if there is a seasonal variation in the PUFA fractions in serum phospholipids and whether there are significant relationships between lowered n-3 PUFA status and the seasonal variation in the number of suicide deaths and serotonergic markers of suicide.
   Methods: We took monthly blood samples during 1 calendar year from 23 healthy volunteers and analyzed the PUFA composition in serum phospholipids and related those data to the annual variation in the mean weekly number of suicides for Belgium and the B a [H-3]-paroxetine binding to platelets in the same 23 subjects.
   Results: Significant annual rhythms were detected in the long-chain PUFAs only, i.e. arachidonic acid (C20: 4n-6; AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (C20: 5n-3; EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (C22: 6n-3; DHA). There was a significant correlation between the changes over the last 2 weeks in AA and EPA and the mean weekly number of violent, but not nonviolent, suicide deaths in Belgium. There was a significant correlation between the PUFAs, AA and DHA, and the B-max [H-3]-paroxetine binding to platelets.
   Conclusions: Our results show that there is a true seasonality in long-chain PUFAs, such as AA, EPA and DHA. The results suggest that the seasonality in PUFAs may be related to the incidence of violent suicide and the expression of the serotonin transporter complex. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Due to their complex mental health needs, female inmates comprise a particularly vulnerable group, at an elevated risk for suicide. Although suicidal ideation-the early stage in the trajectory towards suicidal behavior-represents a valid target for suicide prevention, there has been little research devoted to this outcome among female inmates. In order to address this void and to inform prevention efforts, the present study sought to investigate correlates of recent suicidal ideation among women incarcerated in Flanders, Belgium. A representative sample of prisoners (N= 123; aged 19-70 years) was randomly selected from all Flemish correctional facilities detaining female inmates, representing one in four incarcerated women throughout Belgium. Prevalence estimates for lifetime history of suicide ideation and attempts are 57.7% and 36.6%, respectively. Multivariate analysis indicates that women with recent suicidal ideation while incarcerated are significantly more likely than their non-suicidal peers to report a lifetime history of non-suicidal self-injury (aOR = 7.36), in-prison drug use (aOR = 4.72), and severe psychological distress (aOR = 3.14). The findings highlight the importance of providing adequate mental health services in prison, in order to address women's unique needs and vulnerabilities, and consequently, to reduce suicide risk.

DT Article
ID PARADOX
AB Case studies of prison policy in France and Belgium contrast sharply. Following the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights ('ECHR') against France for the lack of healthcare for prisoners, the lack of suicide-prevention measures and generally poor conditions of detention, and the integration of ECHR case-law into French law by the 'Council of State' (France's highest administrative court), France has developed a policy for suicide prevention in custody, partially renovated its prisons and implemented major reform of its medical and psychiatric care of prisoners. The ECHR's judgments were influenced by complaints made by very active French human-rights pressure groups to the ECHR. The French situation is therefore characterised by interactions between the European and national regulatory bodies, in contrast to the situation in Belgium, where the Conseil d',tat has exerted only limited control over Belgian prisons, as it has, to date, not incorpated ECHR case-law into Belgian law [1]. In addition, the absence of effective domestic regulation of prisons in Belgium can be explained by the Belgian government's failure to ratify the United Nations' Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture ('OPCAT') and to establish an independent body to prevent torture. This means that the only effective regulation of Belgian prisons is by the United Nations and the Council of Europe, in particular the ECHR, the Committee of Ministers and the Committee for the Prevention of Torture ('CPT'), which have extended the scope of their supervision to cover suicide prevention, physical and mental healthcare, overcrowding and domestic legal remedies for prisoners. In response, Belgium has only occasionally complied with ECHR case-law, especially in the field of domestic legal remedies available to prisoners.

AB What is the best way to care for a child with severe neurologic impairment who seems to be dying and is in intractable pain? Can we give sedation as we remove life support? Is it ethically permissible to hasten death? In the United States, 5 states have legalized assisted suicide (although only for competent adults). In Belgium and the Netherlands, euthanasia is legal for children under some circumstances. We present a case in which parents and doctors face difficult decisions about palliative care. Experts from Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United States then discuss how they would respond to such a case.

AB Aim. To study the effect of sociodemographic and attitudinal determinants of physicians making end-of-life decisions (ELDs). Methods. The physicians having signed 489 consecutive death certificates in the city of Hasselt (Belgium) were sent an anonymous questionnaire regarding their ELDs and another on their attitudes toward voluntary euthanasia (EUTH) and physician-assisted suicide (PAS). Results. 55% response rate, Nontreatment decisions occurred in 16.7% of all death cases; in 16%, there was potentially life-shortening use of drugs to alleviate pain and symptoms; in 4.8% of cases, death was deliberately induced by lethal drugs, including EUTH, PAS, and life termination without explicit request by the patient. In their attitudes toward EUTH and PAS, the 92 responding physicians clustered into 3 groups: positive and rule oriented, positive rule-adverse, and opposed. Cluster group membership, commitment to life stance, years of professional experience, and gender were each associated with specific ELD-making patterns.

The subjects' psychological dimensions were investigated by means of several self-report questionnaires including: BDI-13 (Beck), Sensation-Seeking Scale (Zuckerman), Toronto Alexithymia Scale (Taylor), Interpersonal Dependency Inventory (Hirschfeld), MMPI-2, and some additional scales. For most dimensions, repeat attempters, both past and recent, but more specifically the recent repeaters, had a more severe psychological profile compared to the other suicide attempters.

AB Trends in adolescent suicide rates (15-19 years) from 1979 to 1996 were compared with suicide trends in individuals of 20 years and over in 30 countries and with trends in rates of deaths due to undetermined causes in adolescents in 17 countries of the WHO European Region. In 21 of the 30 studied countries, male adolescent suicide rates increased during the study period (highest increases in Belarus, Kazakstan and Ireland) accompanied by far less increases or decreases in suicide rates of males of 20 years and over. Part of the observed increases in Sweden, Ireland and Greece can be attributed to improved suicide statistics, while increases in Finland, Belgium, Bulgaria and the United Kingdom can be even higher due to the rising classification of deaths as "undetermined". In Portugal, decreasing suicide trends seem to be misinterpreted by ignoring the vast increases in rates of undetermined deaths. Female adolescent suicide rates rose less markedly than in males in 18 countries, with the exception of strong increases in Norway, Ireland. Increases in female adolescent suicide rates were marginally affected by changes in classification practices and were accompanied primarily by declining suicide rates in females of 20 years and over.

AB This paper presents three different models of the legal regulation of assisted suicide in European countries. First, the current legal regime governing assisted suicide in the Netherlands is described where both euthanasia and assisted suicide have been legalised. This section also includes some empirical data on euthanasia and assisted-suicide practices in the Netherlands, as well as a comparison with the current legal legislation in Belgium and Luxembourg. Next, Switzerland is presented as a country where euthanasia is punishable by law but assisted suicide is legally allowed, provided it is not carried out with selfish motives. This section also focuses on the assisted-suicide related case law of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights. Last, the current legal situation regarding assisted suicide in Austria and Germany is described. While the Austrian Penal Code explicitly prohibits assisted suicide, assistance with suicide is not specifically regulated by the German Penal Code. However, medical doctors are not allowed to assist suicides according to the professional codes of conduct drawn up by the German medical associations under the supervision of the health authorities.

TI Testing the hypothesis of the natural suicide rates: Further evidence
   from OECD data
SO ECONOMIC MODELLING
LA English
DT Article
DE Natural rate of suicides; Cointegration; Time series; OECD
ID COINTEGRATION; UNEMPLOYMENT
AB This paper provides further evidence on the hypothesis of the natural rate of suicide using the time series data for 15 OECD countries over the period 1970-2004. This hypothesis suggests that the suicide rate of a society could never be zero even if both the economic and the social conditions were made ideal from the point of view of suicide (Yang and Lester, 1991). This research relates the suicide rates to harmonized unemployment and divorce rates to test the natural hypothesis statistically. We also address methodological flaws by earlier suicide studies by employing autoregressive-distributed lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration advocated by Pesaran et al. (2001). In majority of regression equations, the constant term was positive and statistically significant, indicating a non-zero natural suicide rate. In particular, we find evidence that at aggregate level. Turkey has the lowest (3.64) and Japan has the highest (13.98) natural rate of suicides. In terms of the male natural suicide rates, the United Kingdom ranks the lowest (4.73) and Belgium ranks the top (15.44). As for the female natural suicide rates, japan takes the lead (16.76) and Italy has the lowest (5.60). The results are also compared and contrasted to each other with a view to drawing plausible policy conclusions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Notwithstanding the epidemiological studies indicating an increased risk of attempted suicide among adolescents and young adults, there is a scarcity of international studies that examine long-term epidemiological trends in rates and characteristics of this vulnerable group. Aims: This article describes the results of a 9-year monitoring study of suicide attempts in adolescents and young adults referred to the Accident and Emergency Department of the Gent University Hospital (Belgium). Methods: Between January 1996 and December 2004, trends, sociodemographic, and methodrelated characteristics of suicide attempts were assessed by a psychiatrist on data sheets. Results: Attempted suicide rates declined from 1996 to 2001 and then rose until 2004, but did not exceed previous rates. During the 9 years of monitoring, there was a preponderance of female suicide attempters, except for 1997. Rates of attempts and of fatal suicide were negatively correlated. Significantly more males than females deliberately injured themselves. Younger attempters, especially females, significantly more often poisoned themselves with analgesics. In nearly one in five attempts, alcohol was used in combination with other methods, and alcohol intake was more commonly observed in older suicide attempters. Nearly half of the adolescents were identified as repeaters. Conclusions: The results of this study warrant further monitoring of trends and characteristics of young suicide attempters.

AB Although suicide rates among prisoners are high and vary between countries, it is uncertain whether this reflects the importation of risk from the general population or is associated with incarceration rates.
   We collected data on suicides and undetermined deaths in 12 countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England and Wales, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, and Sweden) directly from their prison administrations for 2003-2007. These were compared with rates of suicides in the general population separately by gender using Pearson's correlations. In addition, they were compared with rates of incarceration. Linear regression was used to examine any association after adjustment for rates of incarceration.
   Data were collected on 861 suicides in prison, of which 810 were in men. In the men, crude relative rates of suicide were at least three times higher than the general population. Western European countries had similar rates of prisoner suicide which were mostly higher than those in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. There was no association between rates of suicide in prisoners and general population rates or rates of incarceration. In the women, inmate suicide rates varied widely and were mostly raised compared with rates in the general population. In addition, these rates did not appear to be associated with general population rates of suicide.
   Rates of prison suicide do not reflect general population suicide rates, suggesting that variations in prison suicide rates reflect differences in criminal justice systems including, possibly, the provision of psychiatric care in prison.

DE euthanasia; assisted suicide; criminal law; euthanasia in Europe;
   euthanasia outside Europe; rule of law
AB The passive form of euthanasia is legalized almost in every civilized country. Its active form is not a generally accepted legal institution. In Europe, active euthanasia is legalized only in The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland. In Australia, the Act on the Rights of the Terminally Ill of 1995 legalized the institution of assisted suicide, which is not identical to active euthanasia. The difference lies in the fact that legalized active euthanasia means that the author of a murder is not punishable (under certain circumstances), whilst assisted suicide is not about murder, rather about suicide. In the first case, the patient is killed on his or her request by someone else. In the second case, the patient himself or herself executes the act of self-killing (by the assistance of a healthcare worker). In Australia, the institution of assisted suicide was repealed in 1997. Assisted suicide is legal in four USA member states: in Vermont, Washington, Montana and Oregon. In Uruguay, the active form of euthanasia has been legal since 1932.

AB This article is a response to Raphael Cohen-Almagor's paper entitled 'First do no harm: intentionally shortening lives of patients without their explicit request in Belgium'. His paper deals with very important matters of life and death, however its concept usage is in part misleading. For instance, the fact that medical murder takes place both in Belgium and the Netherlands is missed. Cohen-Almagor calls such acts 'worrying' and considers them to be 'abuse'. However, it remains an open question whether or not there can be such a thing as legitimate murder in a medical context. From the combined perspectives of justice and the duty to end unbearable suffering, there might be. Thus, key arguments for euthanasia are also prominent in an argument for medical murder.

DT Article
DE Euthanasia; Minors; Belgium; Legal competence
ID SWITZERLAND; CHILDREN; SUICIDE
AB In 2014, the Belgian Euthanasia Law was amended so as to extend the possibility of obtaining euthanasia to minors who have the capacity for discernment. The amendment led to considerable debate among Belgian legal experts, health care professionals and ethicists, in large part due to concerns about the scope and assessment of the minor's capacity for discernment', a concept first introduced in Belgian medical law by the amendment. This article offers a critical legal analysis of the concept of capacity for discernment' and its implications for euthanasia practice in Belgium. We do so by focusing on a ruling of the Belgian Constitutional Court of 29 October 2015, where the concept figured prominently in the examination of the constitutionality of the amendment. This approach also allows us to shed light on the interpretation of several core aspects of the original 2002 Euthanasia Law and its 2014 amendment.

AB Background: General Practitioners (GPs) play a central role in suicide prevention. This study aims to compare the characteristics of individuals who attempt suicide to those who complete suicide in a same primary care setting.
   Methods: We compared the characteristics and GP's management of all patients with attempted (N=498, SA) or completed suicide (N=141, SC) reported to the GPs' French Sentinelles surveillance system (2009-2013).
   Results: Compared to patients who attempted suicide, those who completed suicide were more likely to be male, older and to have used a more lethal method; for men they were less likely to have a history of previous suicide attempt and prior contacts with their GP. In terms of GPs' management, we found no differences between the SA and SC groups in the identification of psychological difficulties and in the care, but GPs were more likely to provide psychological support to the SA group. During the last consultation, the SC group expressed suicidal ideas more frequently than the SA group (26.7% vs. 14.8%, p < 0.01), only for women.
   Limitations: The network may have missed cases and selected more serious SA.
   Conclusions: Individuals who commit suicide differ from those who attempt suicide in terms of demographic characteristics and by sex, of history of suicide attempt, previous contact and expressed suicidal ideas. We show that GPs do not act more intensively with patients who will commit suicide, as if they do not foresee them. Current prevention programs particularly in primary care should be tailored.

AB Since the Carter judgment in 2015, voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal in Canada. The purpose of this article is to analyze the relevance of making people with mental disorders eligible for medical aid in dying (MAD). The text consists of three parts. The first part presents the history of the legalization of the MAD in Canada. In the second part, we discuss the extension of the MAD to individuals suffering from mental disorders. We then insist on five aspects: the MAD and suicide in Quebec, suicide's place in the values of Quebec society, a reflection on rational suicide and the impact of mental health on the ability to make decisions, the respect of the laws and their application as well as assisted suicide of people with mental disorders in Belgium and the Netherlands. In the third part, we suggest four recommendations: to extend the requests to cases with mental disorders whose suffering is refractory to all care, to increase the minimum delay for the treatment of these requests, to systematically include a mental health specialist and to involve the loved ones throughout the process.

AB The aim of this study was (1) to estimate the incidence of suicidal behavior, i.e., suicide and suicide attempts, among Belgian general practice patients in 2007-2008 and to estimate trends since previous surveillance periods, i.e., 1991-1993 and 2000-2001; and (2) to investigate characteristics of actors, acts, and first care delivery. Data were collected by the national network of sentinel general practitioners, recording all suicidal behavior they were confronted with in their daily practice in the three periods. In 2007-2008 incidence rates of both suicide and suicide attempts had declined compared to the previous periods while the use of violent versus non-violent suicidal methods remained unchanged. GP involvement in first care after suicidal behavior declined over time from 71% to 39% in the largest part of the population, i.e., younger and adult persons. The last surveillance of suicidal behavior by the Belgian sentinel network of GPs most likely resulted in an underestimation, probably as a result of a declining role of GPs in delivery of first care to patients following suicidal behavior.

AB Objective : To assess differences in mortality rates between social security statuses in two independent samples of Belgian and Spanish male workers.
   Methods : Study of two retrospective cohorts (Belgium, n = 23,607; Spain, n = 44,385) of 50-60 year old male employees with 4 years of follow-up. Mortality rate ratios (MRR) were estimated using Poisson regression models.
   Results : Mortality for subjects with permanent disability was higher than for the employed, for both Belgium [MRR = 4.56 (95% CI: 2.88-7.21)] and Spain [MRR = 7.15 (95% CI: 5.37-9.51)]. For the unemployed/early retirees, mortality was higher in Spain [MRR = 1.64 (95% CI: 1.24-2.17)] than in Belgium [MRR = 0.88 (95% CI: 0.46-1.71)].
   Conclusion : MRR differences between Belgium and Spain for unemployed workers could be partly explained because of differences between the two social security systems. Future studies should further explore mortality differences between countries with different social security systems. (C) 2016 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

AB Background The suicide rate among young males in Belgium has doubled over the last decade. As more knowledge about risk factors is required to develop national prevention strategies, we investigated adolescent suicides using the psychological autopsy method. Methods A total of 32 informants were interviewed regarding 19 suicide cases (aged 15-19). A semi-structured interview schedule, constructed by Houston et al. (J Affect Disord 63: 159-170, 2001), was used. Results All adolescents were suffering from one or more mental disord er(s) at the time of their death, and almost half of them were diagnosed with personality disorders. Adjustment disorders were diagnosed in one fifth of the sample, which appears to be relevant in view of the multiple life events and other psychosocial problems which adolescents were facing shortly before death. This suggests that difficulties in coping with stressful psychosocial problems are important in the course of the suicidal process. Only a small minority was receiving treatment for their disorders. Conclusions Mental disorders, commonly untreated and combined with personality disorders and psychosocial problems, are frequently found in young suicide victims. This study suggests that education in the diagnosis and treatment of depression, adjustment disorders and suicidality is important in the prevention of suicide.

AB Euthanasia motivated by mental disorders is legal in only a few countries and has a short history. In a recent report of all psychiatric euthanasia cases in Belgium between 2002 and 2013, Dierickx and colleagues suggest that the number of these cases is increasing, and provide a profile of the applicants. To date, knowledge of the practice of psychiatric euthanasia is limited, but rising public awareness might increase the number of requests. The authors reveal several shortcomings in cases of psychiatric euthanasia and open avenues for future research.

AB How differences in drinking patterns may affect the impact of alcohol consumption on deliberate self-harm among adolescents is explored in this international comparative study. Schools in Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Norway (N=30,532) were surveyed. In all countries the risk of deliberate self-harm was significantly elevated among adolescents who reported some or numerous episodes of intoxication, controlling for confounding factors. The results support the assumption that intoxication is significantly related to the association between alcohol consumption and deliberate self-harm in adolescents.

ID EUTHANASIA
AB The recent legalization of assisted dying in California, along with similar bills before other states, returned assisted suicide to the national spotlight. In Anglo-American dying bills, two criteria restrict eligibility for assisted suicide: (1) the uncoerced request to die (roughly, the "autonomy" criterion) and (2) severely deteriorated health of a certain kind (roughly, the "physical" criterion) from a six-month terminal illness (US jurisdictions) to severe and irreversible conditions (the Netherlands, Belgium). I argue that the physical criterion in any form violates the equality of respect and moral status of a large class of people, thereby degrading them, and I supplement this with theological considerations drawn from Thomas Aquinas. Even if the slope were not slippery and the autonomy firewall prevented Dutch-style mission creep, the physical criterion itself degrades tens of thousands of sick, disabled, and dying people by insinuating that their lives-but crucially, not other people's-are "objectively" the sort of thing they might reasonably want to dispose of.

AB Belgium is a country with no formal registration or authorization procedure for end-of-life decisions. Acts of euthanasia ('the administration of drugs with the explicit intention of ending the patient's life at the patient's request') are treated as murder under criminal law. In 1996, a study of euthanasia and other medical practices concerning the end of life was conducted in Hasselt, a city in the Flemish part of Belgium. All physicians who signed a death certificate in 1996 received an anonymous self-administered mail questionnaire. The response rate was 55% (75% among family physicians and 44% among clinical specialists).
   This chapter explores the incidence of end-of-life decisions in Belgium (Flanders). Based on the corrected data obtained from the study in Hasselt, incidence estimates are presented for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, ending of life without the patient's explicit request, alleviation of pain and symptoms with a potential life-shortening effect, and withholding or withdrawing of a potential life-prolonging treatment. Furthermore, the circumstances of these end-of-life decisions that are relevant to legislation and to ethical acceptability are discussed. Based on our research experience in the domain of end-of-life decisions, we are of the opinion that the following topics deserve more attention in future research: assessment of the criteria used by physicians to define and establish the '(in)competence' of patients; patient-physician communication about the end of life under conditions of secrecy and prohibition (versus regulated conditions); research into the role of paramedical personnel, and, in particular, nurses; development and testing of causal models to explain why end-of-life decisions happen; the design of comparative international research.

DE Aging; Death; Euthanasia; Suicide
AB The purpose of this article is to promote a debate about controversial issues there are pertinent to human ageing, but which are not often discussed by the society. Through bibliographic research, documentary and empirical studies, we presented questions related to ageing, death, euthanasia and suicide. It has been noted in this study that some topics are often considered a taboo, such as euthanasia, but there are countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Colombia where this procedure has already been adopted and, in some cases, even regulated. It has been found in this work that death is often not the greatest fear of the human being, but rather the fear of loss of freedom and control of one's life. Family support, clinical treatments and spirituality can be considered to be great allies in trying to prevent suicide by older people.

AB Background: There are an estimated one million completed suicides per year worldwide. As a response to increasing concern about suicide within Europe, the EUROSAVE (European Review of Suicide and Violence Epidemiology) study was undertaken to examine recent trends in the epidemiology of suicide and self-inflicted injury mortality in the European Union (EU). Methods: Suicide and self-inflicted injury mortality data for the 15 EU countries for the years,1984-1998 were obtained from the World Health Organisation (WHO), the European Statistical Office of the European Commission (EUROSTAT) and national statistical agencies. Data were also obtained for a second group of deaths classified as 'undetermined' or 'other violence'. Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated and examined for trends over time. Results: Finland had the highest suicide rate, while Greece had the lowest for the latest available year (1997). Age-standardized suicide rates tended to be lowest in the Mediterranean countries. Significant downward linear time trends in suicide,mortality were observed in most countries, although rates varied markedly between countries. Both Ireland and Spain displayed significant upward linear trends in suicide mortality. Portugal had the highest rate of undetermined deaths-both in 1984 and 1998 while Greece had the lowest in both 1984 and 1997. Five countries (including Ireland and Spain) showed significant downward trends in deaths due to undetermined causes whereas Belgium and Germany showed borderline significant upward linear trends in deaths due to undetermined causes. Conclusions: Although suicide rates in most countries seem to be decreasing, the validity of the data is uncertain. Misclassification may contribute to the geographical and temporal variation in suicide rates in some EU countries but it does not explain the phenomenon. More detailed research comparing suicide-recording procedures and practices across the EU is required. In the absence of adequate EU wide data on suicide epidemiology, effective prevention of this distressing phenomenon is likely to remain elusive.

AB Background:Legal in some European countries and US states, physician-assisted suicide and voluntary active euthanasia remain under debate in these and other countries.Objectives:The aim of the study was to examine numbers, characteristics, and trends over time for assisted dying in regions where these practices are legal: Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Oregon, Washington, and Montana.Design:This was a systematic review of journal articles and official reports. Medline and Embase databases were searched for relevant studies, from inception to end of 2012. We searched the websites of the health authorities of all eligible countries and states for reports on physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia and included publications that reported on cases of physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia. We extracted information on the total number of assisted deaths, its proportion in relation to all deaths, and socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals assisted to die.Results:A total of 1043 publications were identified; 25 articles and reports were retained, including series of reported cases, physician surveys, and reviews of death certificates. The percentage of physician-assisted deaths among all deaths ranged from 0.1%-0.2% in the US states and Luxembourg to 1.8%-2.9% in the Netherlands. Percentages of cases reported to the authorities increased in most countries over time. The typical person who died with assistance was a well-educated male cancer patient, aged 60-85 years.Conclusions:Despite some common characteristics between countries, we found wide variation in the extent and specific characteristics of those who died an assisted death.

AB This article investigates the prevalence of traumatization and mental distress in a sample of 1055 male European long-term prisoners as part of a wider study of the living conditions of prisoners serving sentences of at least five years in Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Germany, Lithuania, Poland, Spain and Sweden. Data were collected in a written survey using the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) as well as questions on attempted suicide and auto-aggressive behaviour. Participants experienced a mean of three traumatic events, with 14 per cent developing a Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) subsequently. In each national sample, more than 50 per cent of the participants were in need of treatment because of psychological symptoms and nearly one-third had attempted suicide.

AB Euthanasia is legal in Belgium if due care criteria are met, which is judged by committees including physicians, ethicists, and jurists. We examined whether students in these disciplines differ in how they judge euthanasia as an acceptable act. A cross-sectional, anonymous e-mail survey revealed that they have similar attitudes and accept its legalization. Therefore, joint decision-making of physicians, ethicists, and lawyers regarding euthanasia seems to have a common attitudinal base in Belgium. However, they differ to some extent regarding the conditions they put forward for euthanasia being acceptable. Philosophy of life (religion) was an independent predictor of these attitudes.

   physician-assisted suicide; slippery slope
ID END
AB During the past four decades, the Netherlands played a leading role in the debate about euthanasia and assisted suicide. Despite the claim that other countries would soon follow the Dutch legalization of euthanasia, only Belgium and the American state of Oregon did. In many countries, intense discussions took place. This article discusses some major contributions to the discussion about euthanasia and assisted suicide as written by Nigel (2004), Arthur J. Dyck (2002), Neil M. Gorsuch (2006), and John Keown (2002). They share a concern that legalization will undermine a society's respect for the inviolability and sanctity of life. Moreover, the Report of the House of Lords Select Committee on the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill (2005) is analyzed. All studies use ethical, theological, philosophical, and legal sources. All these documents include references to experiences from the Netherlands. In addition, two recent Dutch documents are analyzed which advocate further liberalization of the Dutch euthanasia practice, so as to include infants (Groningen Protocol, NVK 2005) and elderly people "suffering from life" (Dijkhuis Report, KNMG 2004).

AB Background: The practice of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide has been compared between countries, but it has not been compared between regions within the Netherlands. This study assesses differences in the frequencies, characteristics, and trends of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide between five regions in the Netherlands and tries to explain the differences by demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related differences between these regions.
   Methods: Data on the frequencies, characteristics, and trends of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide for each region and each year from 2002 through 2014 were derived from the annual reports of the Regional Review Committees. Averages and trends were determined using a regression model with the regions and years as independent variables. Demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related variables for each region and each year were derived from the Central Bureau for Statistics and added to the model as covariates.
   Results: The frequencies, characteristics, and trends of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide differed between the regions, whereas the frequencies of non-assisted suicide did not differ. Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide were most frequent and were performed most often by general practitioners, in patients with cancer, in the patient's home, in North Holland. The regional differences remained after adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related differences between the regions.
   Conclusion: More detailed research is needed to specify how and why the practice of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide differs between regions in the Netherlands and to what extent these differences reflect a deficiency in the quality of care, such as other forms of regional variation in health care practice.

LA English
DT Article
ID RISK-FACTORS; SELF-HARM; ENGLAND; WALES; PREVENTION; RATES
AB Background Prison suicide rates, rate ratios, and associations with prison-related factors need clarification and updating. We examined prison suicide rates in countries where reliable information was available, associations with a range of prison-service and health-service related factors, how these rates compared with the general population, and changes over the past decade.
   Methods We collected data for prison suicides in 24 high-income countries in Europe, Australasia, and North America from their prison administrations for 2011-14 to calculate suicide rates and rate ratios compared with the general population. We used meta-regression to test associations with general population suicide rates, incarceration rates, and prison-related factors (overcrowding, ratio of prisoners to prison officers or health-care staff or education staff, daily spend, turnover, and imprisonment duration). We also examined temporal trends.
   Findings 3906 prison suicides occurred during 2011-14 in the 24 high-income countries we studied. Where there was breakdown by sex (n=2810), 2607 (93%) were in men and 203 (7%) were in women. Nordic countries had the highest prison suicide rates of more than 100 suicides per 100 000 prisoners apart from Denmark (where it was 91 per 100 000), followed by western Europe where prison suicide rates in France and Belgium were more than 100 per 100 000 prisoners. Australasian and North American countries had rates ranging from 23 to 67 suicides per 100 000 prisoners. Rate ratios, or rates compared with those in the general population of the same sex and similar age, were typically higher than 3 in men and 9 in women. Higher incarceration rates were associated with lower prison suicide rates (b = -0 . 504, p = 0 . 014), which was attenuated when adjusting for prison-level variables. There were no associations between rates of prison suicide and general population suicide, any other tested prison-related factors, or differing criteria for defining suicide deaths. Changes in prison suicide rates over the past decade vary widely between countries.
   Interpretation Many countries in northern and western Europe have prison suicide rates of more than 100 per 100 000 prisoners per year. Individual-level information about prisoner health is required to understand the substantial variations reported and changes over time. Copyright (C) The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The experience of the Netherlands in relation with the legalization and practice of euthanasia is better known in Spain than the Belgian experience in this matter. But the historical process of social debate in Belgium has many specific details which should be known by Spanish healthcare professionals, bioethicists, politicians and lawyers. This paper begins with a comparative analysis of both countries: Spain and Belgium and follows with a description of the milestones of the historical process of debating and, finally, passing the Belgian Law on Euthanasia in 2002. The next chapter consists of a description of the main contents of this important Law. The paper continues then with an approach to the epidemiology of the practice of euthanasia in Belgium and finishes with a description of the different positions of the actors of the process. Two positions are described more in depth: the opinion of the specialists in palliative care, and the opinion of the Catholic Church. The paper ends underlining the reason for the incorporation of the Belgian experience on euthanasia to the debate about the possibility of legalizing euthanasia in Spain.

AB This paper unpacks the slippery slope argument as it pertains to assisted death.
   The assisted-death regimes of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and the states of Washington and Oregon are discussed and examined with respect to the slippery slope analytical rubric. In addition to providing a preliminary explanation of how the slippery slope argument has been academically defined and constructed, the paper examines assisted-death models from the perspective of considering what might exist at the top and at the bottom of the slippery slope. It also explores the nature and scope of safeguards implemented to avoid slippage, and shows that what lies at the top and bottom of the slippery slope may be different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. After identifying some of the recent concerns that have arisen within each of the jurisdictions (concerns that might be viewed by some as evidence of slide), the paper concludes by making note of certain critical issues in the current assisted-death debate that merit deeper examination.

AB We assess (i) whether being married is a protective factor against socio-economic inequalities in suicide, and (ii) whether any such buffering effect varies between countries. We used the data from a European cross-national comparison project, a prospective follow-up of several European population censuses matched with vital statistics. The data encompass 99.5 million person-years aged 30 and above and, 25,476 suicides in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Turin, Madrid, Norway and Switzerland. Standardised rates were computed and logistic regressions were used to assess educational inequalities. Among the non-married, the lower educational group had an increased risk of dying of suicide compared to the higher group (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.45). Inequalities among the married were lower (OR = 1.29). In all countries or regions except Austria, the lower educational group had a higher risk of suicide mortality among the non-married than among the married. The buffering effect of being married was not observed for elderly individuals (65 and over). Among younger individuals, the buffering effect of being married on relative inequalities in suicide was stronger in Madrid, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland (but significant only for Denmark and Norway). There was no indication that countries with stronger welfare policies or lower divorce rate had a lower buffering effect. We conclude that being married protects against inequalities in suicide and that this protective effect is not affected by the level of social capital at the country level. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Euthanasia and assisted suicide: Comparison of legal aspects in
   Switzerland and other countries
SO MEDICINE SCIENCE AND THE LAW
LA English
DT Article
AB The purpose of this paper is to present the legal aspects associated with assisted suicide in Switzerland and compare them with those in other countries. Like euthanasia, assisted suicide is a subject that induces much discussion in many countries. While the law is very liberal in some countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands (where both euthanasia and assisted suicide take place), these practices are very controversial in other countries, such as France, where they remain taboo subjects.
   In the United States of America, the laws concerning assisted suicide can differ greatly from one state to another. For example, in Oregon, assisted suicide is allowed if applied by a medical doctor; in others, this act is illegal. In Canada, it is punishable according to the Criminal Code.
   In Switzerland euthanasia is punishable by law. However, the penal code does not condemn assisted suicide, whether carried out by a medical doctor or another person, provided it is not carried out through selfish motives. The application of these practices has become simplified in recent years and societies for the right to die with dignity based on this principle have come into being (Exit and Dignitas).
   In the French- and German-speaking parts of Switzerland the association Exit assists individuals living in Switzerland with serious progressive and incurable disease in their engagement to end their life. The association Dignitas, in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, also undertakes - in the same circumstances - to assist individuals coming from foreign countries. Dignitas welcomes several such individuals every year, especially from Germany, where a similar approach does not currently exist.

AB BACKGROUND: The treatment of advanced cancer often involves potentially life-shortening end-of-life decisions (ELDs). This study aimed to examine the prevalence and characteristics of ELDs in different cancer types.
   METHODS: A nationwide death certificate study was conducted based on a large random sample of all deaths in Flanders, Belgium, between 1 January and 30 June 2013. All cancer deaths were selected (n = 2392). Attending physicians were sent a questionnaire about ELDs and the preceding decision-making process.
   RESULTS: The response rate was 58.3%. Across cancer types, a non-treatment decision occurred in 7.6-14.0%, intensified pain and symptom alleviation in 37.5-41.7%, euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide in 8.7-12.6%, and life shortening without explicit patient request in 1.0-2.4%. ELD prevalence did not differ significantly by cancer type. Reasons for ELDs were most frequently patient's physical suffering and lack of prospect of improvement. 'Anticipated further suffering' and 'unbearable situation for relatives' were reasons more often reported in haematological cancer than in other cancer types. Patient, family, and caregiver involvement in decision-making did not differ across cancer types.
   CONCLUSIONS: Euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide rates were relatively high in all cancer types. Neither the prevalence of ELDs nor characteristics of the decision-making process differed substantially between cancer types. This indicates a uniform approach to end-of-life care, including palliative care, across oncological settings.

TI A role for doctors in assisted dying?: An analysis of legal regulations
   and medical professional positions in six European countries
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID PALLIATIVE CARE; SUICIDE; EUTHANASIA; NETHERLANDS; ATTITUDES
AB Objectives: To analyse legislation and medical professional positions concerning the doctor's role in assisted dying in western Europe, and to discuss their implications for doctors.
   Method: This paper is based on country-specific reports by experts from European countries where assisted dying is legalised (Belgium, The Netherlands), or openly practiced (Switzerland), or where it is illegal (Germany, Norway, UK).
   Results: Laws on assisted dying in The Netherlands and Belgium are restricted to doctors. In principle, assisted suicide (but not euthanasia) is not illegal in either Germany or Switzerland, but a doctor's participation in Germany would violate the code of professional medical conduct and might contravene of a doctor's legal duty to save life. The Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill proposed in the UK in 2005 focused on doctors, whereas the Proposal on Assisted Dying of the Norwegian Penal Code Commission minority in 2002 did not.
   Professional medical organisations in all these countries except The Netherlands maintain the position that medical assistance in dying conflicts with the basic role of doctors. However, in Belgium and Switzerland, and for a time in the UK, these organisations dropped their opposition to new legislation. Today, they regard the issue as primarily a matter for society and politics. This "neutral'' stance differs from the official position of the Royal Dutch Medical Association which has played a key role in developing the Dutch practice of euthanasia as a "medical end-of-life decision'' since the 1970s.
   Conclusion: A society moving towards an open approach to assisted dying should carefully identify tasks to assign exclusively to medical doctors, and distinguish those possibly better performed by other professions.

TI End-of-life practices in the Netherlands under The Euthanasia Act
SO NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID TERMINAL SEDATION; DECISION-MAKING; DEATH; EXPERIENCES; BELGIUM;
   OPIOIDS; CARE
AB BACKGROUND:
   In 2002, an act regulating the ending of life by a physician at the request of a patient with unbearable suffering came into effect in the Netherlands. In 2005, we performed a follow-up study of euthanasia, physician-assisted suicide, and other end-of-life practices.
   METHODS:
   We mailed questionnaires to physicians attending 6860 deaths that were identified from death certificates. The response rate was 77.8%.
   RESULTS:
   In 2005, of all deaths in the Netherlands, 1.7% were the result of euthanasia and 0.1% were the result of physician-assisted suicide. These percentages were significantly lower than those in 2001, when 2.6% of all deaths resulted from euthanasia and 0.2% from assisted suicide. Of all deaths, 0.4% were the result of the ending of life without an explicit request by the patient. Continuous deep sedation was used in conjunction with possible hastening of death in 7.1% of all deaths in 2005, significantly increased from 5.6% in 2001. In 73.9% of all cases of euthanasia or assisted suicide in 2005, life was ended with the use of neuromuscular relaxants or barbiturates; opioids were used in 16.2% of cases. In 2005, 80.2% of all cases of euthanasia or assisted suicide were reported. Physicians were most likely to report their end-of-life practices if they considered them to be an act of euthanasia or assisted suicide, which was rarely true when opioids were used.
   CONCLUSIONS:
   The Dutch Euthanasia Act was followed by a modest decrease in the rates of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. The decrease may have resulted from the increased application of other end-of-life care interventions, such as palliative sedation.

   INEQUALITY; FLANDERS; PATIENT; ADULTS
AB Background: Educational attainment has been shown to influence access to and quality of health care. However, the influence of educational attainment on decision-making at the end of life with possible or certain life-shortening effect (ELDs ie intensified pain and symptom alleviation, non-treatment decisions, euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide, and life-ending acts without explicit request) is scarcely studied. This paper examines differences between educational groups pertaining to prevalence of ELDs, the decision-making process and end-of-life treatment characteristics.
   Method: We performed a retrospective survey among physicians certifying a large representative sample of Belgian deaths in 2007. Differences between educational groups were adjusted for relevant confounders (age, sex, cause of death and marital status).
   Results: Intensified pain and symptom alleviation and non-treatment decisions are more likely to occur in higher educated than in lower educated patients. These decisions were less likely to be discussed with either patient or family, or with colleague physicians, in lower educated patients. A positive association between education and prevalence of euthanasia/assisted suicide (acts as well as requests) disappeared when adjusting for cause of death. No differences between educational groups were found in the treatment goal in the last week, but higher educated patients were more likely to receive opioids in the last day of life.
   Conclusion: There are some important differences and possible inequities between educational groups in end-of-life decision-making in Belgium. Future research should investigate whether the found differences reflect differences in knowledge of and adherence to patient preferences, and indicate a discrepancy in quality of the end of life.

AB Background
   Self-harm is a major health care problem and changes in its prevalence and characteristics can have important implications for suicide prevention. The objective was to describe trends in the epidemiology of self-harm based on emergency department (A&E departments) visits over a 26-year period in Ghent, Belgium.
   Methods
   We analyzed data on all self-harm presentations from the three large general hospitals in Ghent between 1987 and 2013. We investigated trends in prevalence (events by year per 100.000), methods and alcohol use.
   Results
   Rates of self-harm steadily decreased during the 26-year study period. In general female rates of self-harm were higher than male rates. The mean patient age was 35 years. The most commonly used method of self-harm was self-poisoning by means of an overdose of medication (80.8%), followed by cutting (10.2%) and hanging (4.2%). Psychotropics (including antidepressants, benzodiazepines, barbiturates and other tranquilizers) were the most frequently used drugs (74.5%). A proportional increase in the use of self-injurious methods in self-harm was highly significant, more specifically in the use of hanging, jumping from heights and the use of other violent methods such as the use of firearms, jumping before a moving object or other traffic related injury.
   Conclusion
   This epidemiological study showed an increase in the use of high-lethality methods in self-harm which has important implications for suicide prevention. As restrictions in the availability of these methods are difficult or impossible to achieve, prevention programmes will have to emphasize the role of thorough psychosocial assessment and adequate follow-up care of self-harm patients.

AB Background: This study provides an analysis on the use of emerging technologies for the prevention of suicide in 8 different European countries.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to analyze the potentiality of using emerging technologies in the area of suicide prevention based on the opinion of different professionals involved in suicide prevention.
   Methods: Opinions of 3 groups of stakeholders (ie, relevant professionals in suicide field) were gathered using a specifically designed questionnaire to explore dimensions underlying perceptions of facilitating factors and barriers in relation to the use of emerging technologies for suicide prevention.
   Results: Goal 1 involved facilitating factors for the use of emerging technologies in suicide prevention. Northern European countries, except for Belgium, attach greater relevance to those that optimize implementation and benefits. On the other hand, Southern European countries attach greater importance to professionally oriented and user-centered facilitating factors. According to different stakeholders, the analysis of these facilitating factors suggest that professionals in the field of social work attach greater relevance to those that optimize implementation and benefits. However, professionals involved in the area of mental health, policy makers, and political decision makers give greater importance to professionally oriented and user-centered facilitating factors. Goal 2 was related to barriers to the usability of emerging technologies for suicide prevention. Both countries and stakeholders attach greater importance to barriers associated with resource constraints than to those centered on personal limitations. There are no differences between countries or between stakeholders. Nevertheless, there is a certain stakeholders-countries interaction that indicates that the opinions on resource constraints expressed by different stakeholders do not follow a uniform pattern in different countries, but they differ depending on the country.
   Conclusions: Although all countries and stakeholders agree in identifying resource constraints as the main barrier to the use of emerging technologies, factors facilitating their use in suicide prevention differ among countries and among stakeholders.

AB Aim. To report a study on the role of nurses in euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in hospitals, conducted as part of a wider study on the role of nurses in medical end-of-life decisions.
   Background. Issues concerning legislation and regulation with respect to the role of nurses in euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide gave the Dutch Minister for Health reason to commission a study on the role of nurses in medical end-of-life decisions in hospitals, homecare and nursing homes.
   Method. A questionnaire was sent in 2003 to 692 nurses employed in 73 hospital locations. The response suitable for analysis was from 532 (76.9%) nurses. Data were quantitatively analysed using SPSS version 11.5 for Windows.
   Results. In almost half of the cases (45.1%), the nurse was the first with whom patients discussed their request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. Consultations between physicians and nurses quite often took place (78.8%). In several cases (15.4%), nurses themselves administered the euthanatics with or without a physician. It is not self-evident that hospitals have guidelines concerning euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide.
   Conclusions. In the decision-making process, the consultation between the physician and the nurse needs improvement. In administering the euthanatics, physicians should take responsibility and should not leave these actions to nurses. Guidelines may play an important role to improve the collaboration between physicians and nurses and to prevent procedural, ethical and legal misunderstandings.
   Relevance to clinical practice. Nurses in clinical practice are often closely involved in the last stage of a person's life. Consequently, they are often confronted with caring for patients requesting euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. The results provide relevant information and may help nurses in defining their role in euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, especially in case these practices should become legalised.

AB Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of end-of-life decisions and to describe their characteristics and the preceding decision-making process in minors in Belgium.
   Design: Population-based postmortem anonymous physician survey.
   Setting: Flanders, Belgium.
   Participants: All physicians signing the death certificates of all patients (N=250) aged 1 to 17 years who died between June 2007 and November 2008 in Flanders, Belgium.
   Outcome Measures: Prevalence and characteristics of end-of-life decisions and the preceding decision-making process.
   Results: For 165 of the 250 deaths, a physician questionnaire was returned (70.5%). In 36.4%, death was preceded by an end-of-life decision. Drugs were administered to alleviate pain and symptoms with a possible life-shortening effect in 18.2% of all deaths, nontreatment decisions were made in 10.3%, and lethal drugs without the patient's explicit request were used in 7.9%. No cases of euthanasia, ie, the use of drugs with the explicit intention to hasten death at the patient's explicit request, were reported. Poor clinical prospects (84.6%) and low quality of life expectations (61.5%) were important reasons for the physicians to engage in end-of-life decisions. Parents were involved in decision making in 85.2% of these decisions, patients in 15.4%.
   Conclusions: Medical end-of-life decisions are frequent in minors in Flanders, Belgium. Whereas parents were involved in most end-of-life decisions, the patients themselves were involved much less frequently, even when the ending of their lives was intended. At the time of decision making, patients were often comatose or the physicians deemed them incompetent or too young to be involved.

AB Purpose Our aim was to describe and assess the medicinal products and doses used for euthanasia in a series of cases, identified within an epidemiological death certificate study in Belgium, where euthanasia was until recently legally forbidden and where guidelines for euthanasia are not available.
   Methods In a random sample of the deaths in 1998 in Belgium, the physicians who signed the death certificates were identified and sent an anonymous mail questionnaire. The questionnaires of the deaths classified as euthanasia cases were reviewed by a multi-disciplinary panel.
   Results A total of 22 among 1925 questionnaires pertained to voluntary euthanasia. In 17 cases, detailed information on the euthanatics (medicinal substances used for euthanasia) used was provided. Opioids were used in 13 cases (in 7 as a single drug). Time between last dose and expiry ranged from 4 to 900 min. The panel judged that only in 4 cases effective euthanatics were used.
   Conclusions In the end-of-life decision cases perceived by Belgian physicians as euthanasia, pharmacological practices were disparate, although dominated by the use of morphine, in the very late phase of dying, in doses which were unlikely to be lethal. Most physicians clandestinely engaging in euthanasia in Belgium seemed unaware of procedures for guaranteeing a quick, mild and certain death. Information on the pharmacological aspects of euthanasia should be included in the medical curriculum and continuing medical education, at least in countries with a legal framework permitting euthanasia under specified conditions.

AB In addition to underlying health disorders and socio-economic or community factors, air pollution may trigger suicide mortality. This study evaluates the association between short-term variation in air pollution and 10 years of suicide mortality in Belgium. In a bidirectional time-stratified case-crossover design, 20,533 suicide deaths registered between January 1st 2002 and December 31st 2011 were matched by temperature with control days from the same month and year. We used municipality-level air pollution [particulate matter (PM10) and O-3 concentrations] data and meteorology data. We applied conditional logistic regression models adjusted for duration of sunshine and day of the week to obtain odds ratios (OR) and their 95% CI for an increase of 10 mu g/m(3) in pollutant concentrations over different lag periods (lag 0, 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4, 0-5, and 0-6 days). Effect modification by season and age was investigated by including interaction terms. We observed significant associations of PM10 and O-3 with suicide during summer (OR ranging from 1.02 to 1.07, p-values <0.05). For O-3, significant associations were also observed during spring and autumn. Age significantly modified the associations with PM10, with statistically significant associations observed only among 5-14 year old children (lag 0-6: OR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.03-2.04) and >= 85 years old (e.g. lag 0-4: OR = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.06-1.29). Recent increases in outdoor air pollutants such as PM10 or O-3 can trigger suicide, particularly during warm periods, even at concentrations below the European thresholds. Furthermore, PM10 may have strong trigger effects among children and elderly population.

AB Changes in medical practices during transitions in regulating healthcare are rarely investigated. In this study, we investigated changes in medical end-of-life decisions with a possible or certain life-shortening effect (ELDs) that occurred during the legalization process of euthanasia in Belgium. We took representative random samples from deaths reported to registries in Flanders, Belgium in 1998 (n = 3999) at the beginning of the process and in 2001 (N = 5005), at the end of the process. The reporting physicians received an anonymous mail questionnaire about possible ELDs preceding the death involved. We found no significant shifts in the epidemiology of diseases between 1998 and 2001. The overall incidence of ELDs did not change. The incidence decreased for euthanasia, administering life-ending drugs without patient's explicit request, and alleviation of pain and symptoms with life-shortening co-intention. Incidence increased for alleviation of pain and symptom without life-shortening intention, and remained stable for non-treatment decisions. All decisions in 2001 were more often discussed with patients, their relatives and nurses. In 2001, continuous deep sedation was reported in 8.3% of deaths. We can conclude that physicians' end-of-life practices have substantially changed during the short but tumultuous legalization process of euthanasia in Belgium. Although follow-up research is needed to investigate the continuance of these changes, it is important for policy makers to keep in mind that social factors related to transitions in healthcare regulation may play an important role in the physicians' actual behaviour.

AB This study investigates attitudes and practices of community pharmacists with respect to physician-assisted death. Between 15 February and 15 April 2002, we sent anonymous mail questionnaires to 660 community pharmacists in the eastern province of Flanders, Belgium. The response rate was 54% (n=359). Most of the pharmacists who responded felt that patients have the right to end their own life (73%), and that under certain conditions physicians may assist the patient in dying (euthanasia: 84%; physician-assisted suicide: 61%). Under the prevailing restrictive legislation, a quarter of the pharmacists were willing to dispense lethal drugs for euthanasia versus 86% if it were legalized, but only after being well informed by the physician. The respondents favour guidelines for pharmacists drafted by their own professional organizations (95%), and enforced by legislation (90%) to ensure careful end-of-life practice. Over the last two years, 7.3% of the responding pharmacists have received a medical prescription for lethal drugs and 6.4% have actually dispensed them. So we can conclude that community pharmacists in East Flanders were not adverse to physician-assisted death, but their cooperation in dispensing lethal drugs was conditional on clinical information about the specific case and on protection by laws and professional guidelines.

AB Bill C-14 introduces a new era in end-of-life care by permitting death to be hastened through medical assistance in dying (MAiD). This article reviews those aspects of MAiD that are of particular relevance to psychologists, as seen through the perspective of the author's research. It includes a brief overview of the major legal cases that led the Supreme Court of Canada to overturn the laws against assisted suicide. It addresses such issues as the prevalence of the desire for death in the terminally ill, reasons for requesting MAiD, the concept of "intolerable suffering," and the association between MAiD, depression, and suicide. Findings from the Canadian National Palliative Care Survey are highlighted, which document the attitudes of patients receiving palliative care for cancer. Data from the Netherlands, Belgium, and Oregon are also reviewed briefly and contrasted; differences in the incidence of MAiD in these jurisdictions point to the importance of permitting MAiD to be provided by clinicians (euthanasia) rather than requiring patients to self-administer lethal medication (assisted suicide). It is concluded that Bill C-14 aligns with the opinions expressed by the majority of terminally ill participants in the National Palliative Care Survey. It remains to be seen whether new legal challenges will lead to the extension of MAiD to other patient groups.

AB Objectives. In Belgium, dominant ideological traditions - Christianity and non-religious humanism - have the floor in debates on euthanasia and hardly any attention is paid to the practices and attitudes of ethnic and religious minorities, for instance, Jews. This article aims to meet this lacuna.
   Design. Qualitative empirical research was performed in the Orthodox Jewish community of Antwerp (Belgium) with a purposive sample of elderly Jewish (non-)Hasidic and secularised Orthodox women. In-depth interviews were conducted to elicit their attitudes towards (non-) voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide.
   Results. The research reveals diverse views among women in the community on intentionally terminating a patient's life. Absolute rejection of every act which deliberately terminates life is found among the overwhelming majority of (religiously observant) Orthodox (Hasidic and non- Hasidic) women, as they have an unconditional faith and trust in God's sovereign power over the domain of life and death. On the other hand, the views of secularised Orthodox women - mostly irreligious women, who do not consider themselves Orthodox, thus not following Jewish law, yet say they belong to the Orthodox Jewish community - show an acceptance of voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide but non-voluntary euthanasia is approached more negatively. As they perceive illness and death as merely profane facts, they stress a patient's absolute right towards self-determination, in particular with regard to one's end of life. Among non- Hasidic Orthodox respondents, more openness is found for cultivating a personal opinion which deviates from Jewish law and for the right of self-determination with regard to questions concerning life and death. In this study, these participants occupy an intermediate position.
   Conclusion. Our study reveals an interplay between ethical attitudes on euthanasia and religious convictions. The image one has of a transcendental reality, or of God, has a stronger effect on one's (dis)approval of euthanasia than being (ir)religious.

AB Prisoners constitute a high-risk group for suicide. As an early stage in the pathway leading to suicide, suicidal ideation represents an important target for prevention, yet research on this topic is scarce in general prison populations. Using a cross-sectional survey design, correlates of suicidal ideation while incarcerated were examined in a sample of 1203 male prisoners, randomly selected from 15 Flemish prisons. Overall, a lifetime history of suicidal ideation and attempts was endorsed by 43.1% and 20.3% of respondents, respectively. Approximately a quarter of all prisoners (23.7%) reported past-year suicidal ideation during their current incarceration, which was significantly associated with both imported vulnerabilities (psychiatric diagnoses and a history of attempted suicide) and variables unique to the prison experience (lack of working activity, exposure to suicidal behaviour by peers, and low levels of perceived autonomy, safety and social support) in the multivariate regression analysis. A first-ever period of imprisonment and a shorter length of incarceration (<= 12 months) were also associated with increased odds of recent suicidal ideation. Collectively, the current findings underscore the importance of both vulnerability factors and prison-specific stressors for suicidal ideation in prisoners, and hence the need for a multi-faceted approach to suicide prevention in custodial settings. In addition to the provision of appropriate mental health care, environmental interventions that target modifiable aspects of the prison regime could provide a substantial buffer for the onset and persistence of suicidal ideation in this at-risk population.

AB Aim. This paper is a report of the findings of a study into the role of district nurses in euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in homecare organizations, conducted as part of a study into the role of nurses in medical end-of-life decisions.
   Background. Issues concerning legislation and regulation with respect to the role of nurses in euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide gave the Minister for Health reason to commission a study into the role of nurses in medical end-of-life decisions in hospitals, nursing homes and homecare organizations. This is the first quantitative study from the perspective of nurses. Previous quantitative studies were conducted under physicians and information on the role of nurses was obtained indirectly.
   Method. A questionnaire was sent in 2003 to 500 district nurses employed in 55 homecare organizations. The absolute response rate was 86.0% and 81.6%( 408) could be used for analysis.
   Results. In 22.3% of 278 cases, the district nurse was the first with whom patients discussed their request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. In about half (49.8%) of 267 cases nurses were not involved in the general practitioner's decision-making process, and in only 13.3% of 264 cases, did they attend the administration of the lethal drugs. District nurses had provided some degree of aftercare to the surviving relatives in 80.3% of 264 cases.
   Conclusion. Collaboration between general practitioners and district nurses needs improvement, particularly in relation to decision-making. Our Dutch data could help nurses in other countries to define their ( future) role in euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide.

ID SAFETY
AB Context: The long-term mortality in adults treated with recombinant GH during childhood has been poorly investigated. Recently released data from the French part of the European Union Safety and Appropriateness of GH treatments in Europe (EU SAGhE) study have raised concerns on the long-term safety of GH treatment.
   Objective: To report preliminary data on long-term vital status and causes of death in patients with isolated GH deficiency or idiopathic short stature or born small for gestational age treated with GH during childhood, in Belgium, The Netherlands, and Sweden.
   Design: Data were retrieved from national registries of GH-treated patients and vital status from National Population Registries. Causes of death were retrieved from a National Cause of Death Register (Sweden), Federal and Regional Death Registries (Belgium), or individual patient records (The Netherlands).
   Patients: All patients diagnosed with isolated GH deficiency or idiopathic short stature or born small for gestational age started on recombinant GH during childhood from 1985-1997 and who had attained 18 yr of age by the end of 2010 were included. Vital status was available for approximately 98% of these 2,543 patients, corresponding to 46,556 person-years of observation.
   Main Outcome Measure: Vital status, causes of death, age at death, year of death, duration of GH treatment, and mean GH dose during treatment were assessed.
   Results: Among 21 deaths identified, 12 were due to accidents, four were suicides, and one patient each died from pneumonia, endocrine dysfunction, primary cardiomyopathy, deficiency of humoral immunity, and coagulation defect.
   Conclusions: In these cohorts, the majority of deaths (76%) were caused by accidents or suicides. Importantly, none of the patients died from cancer or from a cardiovascular disease. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 97: E213-E217, 2012)

AB Some form of assisted dying (voluntary euthanasia and/or assisted suicide) is lawful in the Netherlands, Belgium, Oregon, and Switzerland. In order to be lawful in these jurisdictions, a valid request must precede the provision of assistance to die. Non-adherence to the criteria for valid requests for assisted dying may be a trigger for civil and/or criminal liability, as well as disciplinary sanctions where the assistor is a medical professional. In this article, we review the criteria and evidence in respect of requests for assisted dying in the Netherlands, Belgium, Oregon, and Switzerland, with the aim of establishing whether individuals who receive assisted dying do so on the basis of valid requests. We conclude that the evidence suggests that individuals who receive assisted dying in the four jurisdictions examined do so on the basis of valid requests and third parties who assist death do not act unlawfully. However, further research on the elements that may undermine the validity of requests for assisted dying is warranted. More research on the reasons why requests for assisted dying are refused is also desirable.

DE Euthanasia; Assisted suicide; Legal liability; Europe
ID OF-LIFE PRACTICES; CHILDREN; TRENDS
AB INTRODUCTION: End-of-life legislation, because of its bioethical, medico-legal, and judicial implications, is heatedly disputed in Europe and throughout the world, engendering a variety of legal end-of-life care options in different countries. We thought it could be interesting to compare the Italian law with current European legislation regulating end-of-life matters.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic search of the Medline, Cochrane Central, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases was conducted using the search words: "euthanasia", "law", "Europe", and "assisted suicide". The search word "euthanasia" was entered singly or in combination with each of the other search terms.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: To date, only three countries in Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) have legalized euthanasia, and four countries (Switzerland, France, Austria, Germany) permit only assisted suicide. Acceptance by the general public of euthanasia and assisted suicide increased in 11 of 13 European countries between 1981 and 2008, in parallel with a decrease in religiosity (except for Italy and Holland) and an increase in secularization. There was also a trend toward a correlation between an increase of the value of self-determination in important life issues and an increase in acceptance of euthanasia.
   CONCLUSIONS: This review shows that end-of-life decisions constitute a challenge for political governance and bioethical deliberation in modern liberal democracies. It appears that in certain situations, euthanasia is perceived more as a means to reduce health care costs rather than an ethical question regarding self-determination.

AB Euthanasia or assisted suicide and sometimes both have been legalized in a small number of countries and states. In all jurisdictions, laws and safeguards were put in place to prevent abuse and misuse of these practices. Prevention measures have included, among others, explicit consent by the person requesting euthanasia, mandatory reporting of all cases, administration only by physicians (with the exception of Switzerland), and consultation by a second physician.
   The present paper provides evidence that these laws and safeguards are regularly ignored and transgressed in all the jurisdictions and that transgressions are not prosecuted. For example, about 900 people annually are administered lethal substances without having given explicit consent, and in one jurisdiction, almost 50% of cases of euthanasia are not reported. Increased tolerance of transgressions in societies with such laws represents a social "slippery slope," as do changes to the laws and criteria that followed legalization. Although the initial intent was to limit euthanasia and assisted suicide to a last-resort option for a very small number of terminally ill people, some jurisdictions now extend the practice to newborns, children, and people with dementia. A terminal illness is no longer a prerequisite. In the Netherlands, euthanasia for anyone over the age of 70 who is "tired of living" is now being considered. Legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide therefore places many people at risk, affects the values of society over time, and does not provide controls and safeguards.

AB The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of commonly used antidepressants as first-line treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in Belgium.
   The model structure was based on a decision tree developed by the Swedish TLV (TandvAyenrds- och lakemedelsformAyennsverket) and adapted to the Belgium healthcare setting, using primary local data on the patterns of treatment and following KCE [Federal Knowledge Center (Federaal Kenniscentrum voor de Gezondheidszorg)] recommendations. Comparators were escitalopram, citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine. In the model, patients not achieving remission or relapsing after remission on the assessed treatment moved to a second therapeutic step (titration, switch, add-on, or transfer to a specialist). In case of failure in the second step or following a suicide attempt, patients were assumed to be referred to secondary care. The time horizon was 1 year and the analysis was conducted from the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (NIHDI; national health insurance) and societal perspectives. Remission rates were obtained from the TLV network meta-analysis and risk of relapse, efficacy following therapeutic change, risk of suicide attempts and related death, utilities, costs (2012), and resources were derived from the published literature and expert opinion. The effect of uncertainty in model parameters was estimated through scenario analyses and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA).
   In the base-case analysis, escitalopram was identified as the optimal strategy: it dominated all other treatments except venlafaxine from the NIHDI perspective, against which it was cost effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a,not sign6,352 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Escitalopram also dominated all other treatments from the societal perspective. At a threshold of a,not sign30,000 per QALY and from the NIHDI perspective, the PSA showed that the probability of escitalopram being identified as the optimal strategy ranged from 61 % (vs. venlafaxine) to 100 % (vs. fluoxetine).
   Escitalopram was associated with the highest probability of being the optimal treatment from the NIHDI and societal perspectives. This analysis, based on new Belgian clinical practice data and following KCE requirements, provides additional information that may be used to guide the choice of treatments in the management of MDD in Belgium.

AB In Belgium and the Netherlands, consultation of a second independent physician by the attending physician is mandatory in euthanasia cases. In both countries, specialized consultation services have been established to provide physicians trained for that purpose. This retrospective study describes and compares the quality of consultation of both services based on surveys of attending physicians and those providing the consultation (consultants). While Dutch consultants discussed certain subjects, for example, alternative curative or palliative treatment more often with the attending physician than Belgian consultants, both usually discussed those subjects considered necessary for a quality consultation and were independent from patient and attending physician. Over 90% of attending physicians in both countries evaluated the consultant's knowledge of palliative care, patient's disease, and judicial procedure, and their communication skills, as sufficient. Consultation with specialized consultation services seems to promote quality of euthanasia consultations.

AB Belgium has become one of the few countries in the world where euthanasia is legally allowed within a specific juridical framework. Even more unique is the inclusion of grounds for requesting euthanasia on the basis of mental suffering. Further refinement of the legal, medical and psychiatric approach to the issue is required in order to clear up essential practical and ethical matters. Psychiatrists and their professional organisations need to play a greater role in this ongoing debate and contribute from a clinical, scientific and ethical point of view.

AB This study explored nurses' involvement in the care process for mentally competent, terminally ill patients requesting euthanasia in general hospitals in Flanders, Belgium. In-depth interviews with 18 nurses who had experience in caring for patients requesting euthanasia since May 2002 were analyzed using grounded theory qualitative methods. We found that the involvement of nurses in the care process is influenced by their predominant perspective on it: the procedural, action-focused perspective, from which good practical organization of the care process is essential; or the existential-interpretative perspective, from which it is important to understand the patient's request within a dialogue-focused and communicational atmosphere. Findings show that the two perspectives are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary dimensions of the euthanasia care process. Hence, sufficient support for nurses to reach a well-balanced integration of both perspectives is essential.

AB The tale of two foul-mouthed Irish contract killers hiding out in Belgium may initially appear incompatible with the writings of Saint Augustine of Hippo (354-430), the Latin Father of the Church. However, this article argues that Martin Mcllonagh's film In Bruges (2008, UK/USA) has the dimensions of an Augustinian drama, addressing themes raised in the theological epic City of God, including eschatology, sin, suicide, war and the nature of suffering. In 107 minutes rather than the voluminous pages of Augustine's magnum opus In Bruges offers an opportunity for its protagonists to ponder on some of life's most vital questions.

AB We aimed to estimate the prevalence of suicidal behaviours, i.e. ideation and attempt, in the adult population of Belgium, and to explore their association with household composition.
   Data of 4,459 adults (25-64 years) from the 2004 Belgian Health Interview Survey were used for analyses. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to calculate the odds of engaging in suicidal behaviours according to household type, further controlling for age, sex, income, employment status and social support.
   Lifetime prevalence of ideation and attempts was 14 and 4.7 %, respectively. Current prevalence of ideation was 4.0 % and past year prevalence of attempts was 0.5 %. Compared to other household compositions, living alone (A) and as lone parent (P) increased the odds of lifetime and current suicidal thoughts (ORA 2.3, 95 % CI 1.7-2.9 and ORP 3.8, 95 % CI 1.9-7.7) and lifetime attempts (ORA 2.3, 95 % CI 1.4-3.6 and ORP 4.5, 95 % CI 2.4-8.5). When controlling for confounders, single person and single parent households still presented increased adjusted-odds of lifetime and current suicidal thoughts (a-ORA 1.8, 95 % CI 1.1-2.9 and a-ORP 2.3, 95 % CI 1.0-5.5). The likelihood of ever attempted suicide was also higher among single parent households (a-ORP 4.5, 95 % CI 2.4-8.5) after adjustment, but not among those living alone (a-ORA 1.4, 95 % CI 0.8-2.8).
   Living alone or as lone parent place adults at higher risk for suicide behaviour, and this is only partly explained by lower socio-economic status or poor perceived support.

AB The prevalence of violence exposure is relatively unexplored in adolescents in European communities, and reports on the association between exposure to community violence and suicidal behavior are rare. The aim of this study was to investigate (1) the prevalence of community violence in a European urban adolescent sample, (2) the relationship between exposure to community violence and suicidal ideation/deliberate self-harm, and (3) the influence of depressive symptoms and aggressive behavior on this relationship. Self-report surveys were administered to a representative school-based sample of 1509 adolescents in Antwerp (Belgium). The prevalence rate of violence exposure was still high but lower than that reported in U.S. communities. Suicidal ideation and deliberate self-harm were both related to violence exposure. The gender-specific influence of depressive symptomatology and aggressive behavior on the association between exposure to violence and suicidal behavior suggests the need for further research.

AB Purpose To explore how physicians analyse their non-treatment decisions in light of the concepts of hastening, causing and intending the patient's death.
   Methods Sixteen Norwegian physicians from relevant specialties were interviewed and the results analysed by systematic text condensation, a qualitative analysis framework.
   Results The physicians' chief dilemma in non-treatment decisions was the attempt to achieve the proper balance for the level of treatment at life's end. Respondents framed their challenges in medical and not ethical terms. They treated the concepts of intending, hastening and causing the patient's death as alien to their practical deliberations and, for many, irrelevant to the moral appraisal of their end-of-life practices.
   Conclusions The core concepts of traditional medico-ethical analyses of end-of-life decision-making do not map the practical terrain well. Research on physician intentions must be designed and interpreted in light of this.

AB In 2002, Belgium saw the enactment of 3 laws concerning euthanasia, palliative care, and patient rights that are likely to affect end-of-life decision making. This report examines trends in the occurrence and decision-making process of end-of-life practices in different patient groups since these legal changes. A large-scale retrospective survey in Flanders, Belgium, previously conducted in 1998 and 2001, was repeated in 2007. Questionnaires regarding end-of-life practices and the preceding decision-making process were mailed to physicians who certified a representative sample (N = 6927) of death certificates. The 2007 response rate was 58.4%. In patient groups in which the prevalence of life-ending drug use without explicit patient request has dropped, performance of euthanasia and assisted suicide has increased. The consistent increase in intensified pain and symptom alleviation was found in all patient groups except cancer patients. In 2007, competent patients were slightly more often involved in the discussion of end-of-life practices than in previous years. Over the years, involvement of the patient in decision making was consistently more likely among younger patients, cancer patients, and those dying at home. Physicians consulted their colleagues more often than in previous years for euthanasia and nontreatment decisions. The euthanasia law and emerging palliative care culture have substantially affected the occurrence and decision making for end-of-life practices in Belgium. Efforts are still needed to encourage shared end-of-life decision making, as some patients would benefit from advance care planning.

ID EUTHANASIA; NETHERLANDS; ACT
AB The Assisted Dying for the Terminally III Bill proposed to legalise both euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide for those with a terminal illness in the UK. A House of Lords Select Committee was convened to scrutinise this Bill and has recently published its report, which will be debated in Parliament on October 10th 2005.
   The written and oral evidence submitted to the Select Committee represented a wide range of views on 'assisted dying'. Much of the evidence from those countries which have legalised euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide (The Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, USA) dealt with the practicalities of ending life, and the legal procedures and safeguards instigated in these countries.
   All the written and oral evidence in the public domain was scrutinised by the authors whilst the Select Committee was sitting. We have extracted those themes relevant to specialist palliative care practice and present them in this paper. We hope that this will provide a useful resource to inform the forthcoming public debate on assisted dying. The evidence of harms inherent in making such a change in the law, as presented to the Select Committee, has moved all three authors to oppose a change in the law.

AB Palliative sedation is an option of last resort to control refractory suffering. In order to better understand palliative-care nurses' attitudes to palliative sedation, an anonymous questionnaire was sent to all nurses (589) employed in palliative care in Flanders (Belgium). In all, 70.5% of the nurses (n = 415) responded. A large majority did not agree that euthanasia is preferable to palliative sedation, were against non-voluntary euthanasia in the case of a deeply and continuously sedated patient and considered it generally better not to administer artificial floods or fluids to such a patient. Two clusters were found: 58.5% belonged to the cluster of advocates of deep and continuous sedation and 41.5% belonged to the cluster of nurses restricting the application of deep and continuous sedation. These differences notwithstanding, overall the attitudes of the nurses are in accordance with the practice and policy of palliative sedation in Flemish palliative-care units.

AB Belgium is characterised by the weakness of its own national judicial control over its prisons, both by the judiciary and administratively. This poor control can be explained by the refusal by the Council of State to exert control over the prison administration and the division of competences between the judicial and administrative orders. This weakness is also considerably reinforced by Belgium's failure to ratify the Optional Protocol of the UN which implies a lack of independence for the surveillance commissions and for the Central Committee for surveillance that are the main Belgian bodies responsible for internal control over prisons. Therefore, control over Belgian prisons is more and more exercised by the Council of Europe and in particular the European Court of Human Rights, the Committee of Ministers and the Committee for the Prevention of Torture, which have extended the scope of their supervision to cover suicides, illegal detention, healthcare and insanity.

TI Premises and evidence in the rhetoric of assisted suicide and euthanasia

DT Article

ID CANCER-PATIENTS; TERMINALLY-ILL; LIFE; DIE; DESIRE; DEATH; RISK
AB In debates about euthanasia and assisted suicide, it is rare to find an article that begins with an expression of neutral interest and then proceeds to examine the various arguments and data before drawing conclusions based upon the results of a scholarly investigation. Although authors frequently give the impression of being impartial in their introduction, they invariably reach their prior conclusions. Positions tend to be clearly dichotomized: either one believes that the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide is totally acceptable or completely unacceptable in a just and moral society. Where there is some admission of a gray zone of incertitude, authors attempt to persuade us that their beliefs (preferences) are the only sensible way to resolve outstanding dilemmas. The practice of vehemently promoting a "pro" or "con" position may be useful when societies must decide to either legalize certain practices or not. Although only a handful of countries have thus far accepted the legal practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide (Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, the U.S. states of Montana, Oregon, Vermont and Washington, and Switzerland), scholarly articles in recent trends mainly promote legalization, to the point of recommending expansion of the current practices. Is this a case of the philosophers being ahead of their time in promoting and rationalizing the wave of the future? Alternatively, does the small number of countries that have legalized these practices indicate a substantial gap between the beliefs and desires of common citizens and the universe of the 'abstracted realm'? For the time being, what we do know is that more countries and states are debating legalization of euthanasia or assisted suicide, the nature of laws and legal practices vary greatly and both ethical and empirical assessments of current practices are the subject of much controversy. This article presents an examination of the premises and evidence in the rhetoric of assisted suicide and euthanasia. Inasmuch as any analysis cannot be totally impartial, we do not contend that our analysis is without influence from our experiences and philosophical affinities. Notwithstanding this caveat, we venture to propose that our scrutiny of the arguments and empirical data may offer some guidance to individuals who are attempting to reach practical conclusions based upon the available evidence, whether empirical or rationalized.

   NATIONAL-SURVEY; END; NETHERLANDS; OPIOIDS; SEDATIVES; COUNTRIES;
   FLANDERS
AB Background: Legalization of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide has been heavily debated in many countries To help inform this debate, we describe the practices of euthanasia and assisted suicide, and the use of life-ending drugs without an explicit request from the patient, in Flanders, Belgium, where euthanasia is legal.
   Methods: We mailed a questionnaire regarding the use of life-ending drugs with or without explicit patient request to physicians who certified a representative sample (n = 6927) of death certificates of patients who died in Flanders between June and November 2007.
   Results: The response rate was 58.4%. Overall, 208 deaths involving the use of life-ending drugs were reported: 142 (weighted prevalence 2.0%) were with an explicit patient request (euthanasia or assisted suicide) and 66 (weighted prevalence 1.8%) were without an explicit request. Eutha-nasia and assisted suicide mostly involved patients less than 80 years of age, those with cancer and those dying at home. Use of life-ending drugs without an explicit request mostly involved patients 80 years of older, those with a disease other than cancer and those in hospital. Of the deaths without an explicit request, the decision was not discussed with the patient in 77.9% of cases. Compared with assisted deaths with the patient's explicit request, those without an explicit request were more likely to have a shorter length of treatment of the terminal illness, to have cure as a goal of treatment in the last week, to have a shorter estimated time by which life was shortened and to involve the administration of opioids.
   Interpretation: Physician-assisted deaths with an explicit patient request (euthanasia and assisted suicide) and with-out an explicit request occurred in different patient groups and under different circumstances Cases without an explicit request often involved patients whose diseases had unpredictable end-off life trajectories. Although opioids were used in most of these cases, misconceptions seem to persist about their actual life-shortening effects.

TI Establishing specialized health services for professional consultation
   in euthanasia: experiences in the Netherlands and Belgium
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID TERMINALLY-ILL; HOPELESSNESS; DEPRESSION; PHYSICIAN; OREGON; CANCER;
   DEATH
AB Background: The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg have adopted laws decriminalizing euthanasia under strict conditions of prudent practice. These laws stipulate, among other things, that the attending physician should consult an independent colleague to judge whether the substantive criteria of due care have been met. In this context initiatives were taken in the Netherlands and Belgium to establish specialized services providing such consultants: Support and Consultation for Euthanasia in the Netherlands (SCEN) and Life End Information Forum (LEIF) in Belgium. The aim of this study is to describe and compare these initiatives.
   Methods: We studied and compared relevant documents concerning the Dutch and Belgian consultation service (e.g. articles of bye-laws, inventories of activities, training books, consultation protocols).
   Results: In both countries, the consultation services are delivered by trained physicians who can be consulted in cases of a request for euthanasia and who offer support and information to attending physicians. The context in which the two organisations were founded, as well as the way they are organised and regulated, is different in each country. By providing information on all end-of-life care matters, the Belgian LEIF seems to have a broader consultation role than the Dutch SCEN. SCEN on the other hand has a longer history, is more regulated and organised on a larger scale and receives more government funding than LEIF. The number of training hours for physicians is equal. However, SCEN-training puts more emphasis on the consultation report, whereas LEIF-training primarily emphasizes the ethical framework of end-of-life decisions.
   Conclusion: In case of a request for euthanasia, in the Netherlands as well as in Belgium similar consultation services by independent qualified physicians have been developed. In countries where legalising physician-assisted death is being contemplated, the development of such a consultation provision could also be considered in order to safeguard the practice of euthanasia (as it can provide safeguards to adequate performance of euthanasia and assisted suicide).

LA English
DT Article
ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; MAIL SURVEYS; EUTHANASIA; NETHERLANDS
AB Background Our study is a repeat of the Dutch death-certificate study on end-of-life decisions (ELDs). The main objective was to estimate the frequency of euthanasia (the administration of lethal drugs with the explicit intention of shortening the patient's life at the patient's explicit request), physician-assisted suicide (PAS), and other ELDs in medical practice in Flanders, Belgium.
   Methods A 20% random sample of 3999 deaths was selected from all deaths recorded between Jan 1 and April 30, 1998. The physicians who signed the corresponding death certificates received one questionnaire by post per death.
   Findings The physicians' response rate was 1355 (52%). 1925 deaths were described. The results were corrected for non-response bias, and extrapolated to estimated annual rates after seasonal adjustment for death causes, and we estimate that 705 (1.3%, 95% CI 1.0-1.6) deaths resulted from euthanasia or PAS. In 1796 (3.2%, 2.7-3.8) cases, lethal drugs were given without the explicit request of the patient. Alleviation of pain and symptoms with opioids in doses with a potential life-shortening effect preceded death in 10 416 (18.5%, 17.3-19.7) cases and non-treatment decisions in 9218 (16.4%, 15.3-17.5) cases, of which 3261 (5.8%, 5.1-6.5) with the explicit intention of ending the patient's life.
   Interpretation ELDs are prominent in medical practice in Flanders. The frequency of deaths preceded by an ELD is similar to that in the Netherlands, but lower than that in Australia. However, in Flanders the rate of administration of lethal drugs to patients without their explicit request is similar to Australia, and significantly higher than that in the Netherlands.

TI Determinants of unbearable suffering in hospice patients who died due to
   Euthanasia: A retrospective cohort study
SO DEATH STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; BELGIUM; REQUEST; TRENDS
AB In this retrospective study, determinants of unbearable suffering in hospice patients who died due to euthanasia were analyzed. The four dimensions of suffering (physical, psychological, social, and existential) were used as a framework. 28 patients (5% of all admitted patients in nine years) were included. Most patients indicated 3-5 determinants, predominantly a combination of physical (96% of patients) and existential determinants (89%). Fatigue, anorexia, and dry mouth were the most prevalent and severe symptoms. Psychological (21%) and social determinants (4%) were much less often described. The results of this study may be used to assess determinants playing a role in euthanasia requests.

AB Background: While suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) among college students are common, the associations between STB and academic performance are not well understood.
   Methods: As part of the World Mental Health Surveys International College Student project, web based self reported STB of KU Leuven (Leuven, Belgium) incoming freshmen (N=4921; response rare = 65.4%) was collected, as well as academic year percentage (AYP), and the departments to which students belong. Single- and multilevel multivariate analyses were conducted, adjusted for gender, age, parental educational level, and comorbid lifetime emotional problems.
   Results: Lifetime suicide plan and attempt upon college entrance were associated with significant decreases in AYP (3.6% and 7.9%, respectively). A significant interaction was found with average departmental AYP, with STB more strongly associated with reduced AYP in departments with lower than higher average AYP.
   Limitations: Limited sample size precluded further investigation of interactions between department-level and student-level variables. No information was available on freshman secondary school academic performance.
   Conclusions: Lifetime STB has a strong negative association with academic performance in college. Our study suggests a potential role for the college environment as target for treatment and prevention interventions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The Attitude of Flemish Palliative Care Physicians to Euthanasia and
   Assisted Suicide: An Empirical Study
SO ETHICAL PERSPECTIVES

DT Article
DE Voluntary euthanasia; non-voluntary euthanasia; assisted suicide;
   influence of religions; palliative care; physicians; attitudes
AB Surveys carried out among palliative care physicians have shown that most participants do not support euthanasia and assisted suicide. Belgium, however, is one of the few countries in the world in which voluntary euthanasia is allowed by law. The potential influence of this legal dimension thus warranted a study of the attitudes of Belgian palliative care physicians toward euthanasia and assisted suicide. To this end, an anonymous self-administered questionnaire in Dutch was sent to all physicians (n=147) working in Flemish palliative care. 99 physicians responded (67.3%).
   A majority of the physicians who responded are of the opinion that voluntary euthanasia can be ethically justified (79%). Most physicians believe, nonetheless, that non-voluntary euthanasia is always unethical (67%). More than three quarters of the respondents favour the inclusion of a 'palliative filter' in the law on euthanasia. Using a traditional cluster algorithm, the following three clusters were obtained: staunch advocates of euthanasia (48 physicians, 52.2%), opponents of euthanasia (12 physicians, 13%), and an intermediate group (32 physicians, 34.8%). There were no significant differences between the clusters on the level of gender, age, and years of experience in palliative care. A statistically significant association exists, however, between the euthanasia clusters and the religious or ideological clusters we had obtained in an earlier study. Church attending respondents are least likely to be staunch advocates of euthanasia. The majority of the physicians favour legalisation on assisted suicide. There is no significant association between the euthanasia clusters and attitudes toward assisted suicide.
   We conclude that although most Flemish palliative care physicians agree that there may be circumstances in which a euthanasia request is justified, they also strongly believe in the effects of good palliative care and want the 'palliative filter' to be included in the law on euthanasia. Religion and worldview are an important factor determining attitudes towards euthanasia.

TI Cost-effectiveness of a helpline for suicide prevention

ID CRISIS HOTLINE OUTCOMES; REPETITION; INJURIES
AB We evaluated the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of a suicide helpline in Belgium, consisting of a telephone-and a chat service. An age-and gender-dependent Markov model with a ten-year time horizon and a one-year cycle length was developed, assuming a societal perspective, to predict cumulative costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in the helpline users. The model included six transition states: the initial state (at risk), first attempt, re-attempt, follow-up, suicide and death from other causes. Data on the effect of the helpline and costs associated with model states were obtained from the literature. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to capture uncertainty. In addition, the budget impact of the helpline was analysed. Over ten years, the telephone-as well as the chat service could avoid about 36% of suicides and attempts in this high-risk population. In males, 0.063 QALYs (95% confidence interval, CI 0.030-0.097) and 0.035 QALYs (95% CI -0.026-0.096) were gained by users of the telephone-and chat service respectively. The corresponding values for females were 0.019 QALYs (95% CI -0.015-0.052) and a QALY-neutral result of -0.005 (95% CI -0.071-0.062). There were net societal savings of respectively (sic)2382 (95% CI 1953-2859) and (sic)2282 (95% CI 1855-2758) in male users; (sic)2171 (95% CI 1735-2664) and (sic)2458 (95% CI 1945-3025) in female users. At the population level, an investment of (sic)218,899 saved (sic)1,452,022 for the public health service (national health insurance), mainly due to the telephone service. The analysis predicted that both means of telemedicine for suicide prevention in Flanders are cost-saving, and have a modest effect on QALYs.

   VALIDATION; DIAGNOSIS; VERSION; SAMPLE; ONSET
AB Background: Despite the fact that suicide is an important public health problem, the etiology is still not well understood. Especially lacking is a societal-level approach that takes into account the extent to which several risk factor domains are attributable to new onset of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB).
   Methods: Data stem from a cross-sectional population study of the non institutionalized adult (18+) population from Belgium (N=2419). The third version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI-3.0) was administered to assess lifetime STB and risk factor domains. Multivariate approaches, expressed in population attributable risk proportions, were used to estimate the proportion of new onset cases of STB related to the occurrence of different risk factors.
   Results: Approximately 38% of cases of suicidal ideation onset were attributable to mental disorders, 20% to chronic physical conditions, and another 13% to parental psychopathology. Suicide attempts in the general population were attributable to mental disorders (PARP=48%), but attempts among persons with suicidal ideation were unrelated to mental disorders, but rather to trauma (PARP=17%) and childhood adversities (PARP=12%).
   Limitations: This is an explorative study using multivariate additive general models that generates specific hypotheses on the development of STB onset rather than testing specific pathways in the process of STB.
   Conclusions: New onset STB is mostly attributable to proximal risk factors such as mental disorders. However, distal risk factors like childhood adversities or trauma also play a considerable role in the new onset of STB, especially in the transition from suicide ideation to suicide attempt.

   MEDICAL ASSISTANCE; MENTAL-DISORDERS; CANCER-PATIENTS
AB Medical professional societies have traditionally opposed physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia (PAS-E), but this opposition may be shifting. We present 5 reasons why physicians shouldn't be involved in PAS-E.
   1. Slippery slopes: There is evidence that safeguards in the Netherlands and Belgium are ineffective and violated, including administering lethal drugs without patient consent, absence of terminal illness, untreated psychiatric diagnoses, and nonreporting;
   2. Lack of self-determination: Psychological and social motives characterize requests for PAS-E more than physical symptoms or rational choices; many requests disappear with improved symptom control and psychological support;
   3. Inadequate palliative care: Better palliative care makes most patients physically comfortable. Many individuals requesting PAS-E don't want to die but to escape their suffering. Adequate treatment for depression and pain decreases the desire for death;
   4. Medical professionalism: PAS-E transgresses the inviolable rule that physicians heal and palliate suffering but never intentionally inflict death;
   5. Differences between means and ends: Proeuthanasia advocates look to the ends (the patient's death) and say the ends justify the means; opponents disagree and believe that killing patients to relieve suffering is different from allowing natural death and is not acceptable.
   Conclusions: Physicians have a duty to eliminate pain and suffering, not the person with the pain and suffering. Solutions for suffering lie in improving palliative care and social conditions and addressing the reasons for PAS-E requests. They should not include changing medical practice to allow PAS-E.

AB Objective: To examine differences in end-of-life decision-making in patients dying at home, in a hospital or in a care home.
   Design: A death certificate study: certifying physicians from representative samples of death certificates, taken between June 2001 and February 2002, were sent questionnaires on the end-of-life decision-making preceding the patient's death.
   Setting: Four European countries: Belgium (Flanders), Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland (German-speaking part).
   Main outcome measures: The incidence of and communication in different end-of-life decisions: physician-assisted death, alleviation of pain/symptoms with a possible life-shortening effect, and non-treatment decisions.
   Results: Response rates ranged from 59% in Belgium to 69% in Switzerland. The total number of deaths studied was 12 492. Among all non-sudden deaths the incidence of several end-of-life decisions varied by place of death. Physician-assisted death occurred relatively more often at home (0.3-5.1%); non-treatment decisions generally occurred more often in hospitals (22.4-41.3%), although they were also frequently taken in care homes in Belgium (26.0%) and Switzerland (43.1%). Continuous deep sedation, in particular without the administration of food and fluids, was more likely to occur in hospitals. At home, end-of-life decisions were usually more often discussed with patients. The incidence of discussion with other caregivers was generally relatively low at home compared with in hospitals or care homes.
   Conclusion: The results suggest the possibility that end-of-life decision-making is related to the care setting where people die. The study results seem to call for the development of good end-of-life care options and end-of-life communication guidelines in all settings.

AB Background: Issues concerning legislation and regulation with respect to the role of nurses in euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide gave the Minister for Health reason to commission a study of the role of nurses in medical end-of-life decisions in hospitals, home care and nursing homes.
   Aim: This paper reports the findings of a study of the role of nurses in euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, conducted as part of a study of the role of nurses in medical end-of-life decisions. The findings for hospitals, home care and nursing homes are described and compared.
   Method: A questionnaire was sent to 1509 nurses, employed in 73 hospitals, 55 home care organisations and 63 nursing homes. 1179 responses (78.1%) were suitable for analysis. The questionnaire was pilot-tested among 106 nurses, with a response rate of 85%.
   Results: In 37.0% of cases, the nurse was the first person with whom patients discussed their request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. Consultation between physicians and nurses during the decision-making process took place quite often in hospitals (78.8%) and nursing homes (81.3%) and less frequently in home care situations (41.2%). In some cases (12.2%), nurses administered the euthanatics.
   Conclusions: The results show substantial differences between the intramural sector (hospitals and nursing homes) and the extramural sector (home care), which are probably linked to the organisational structure of the institutions. Consultation between physicians and nurses during the decision-making process needs improvement, particularly in home care. Some nurses had administered euthanatics, although this task is by law exclusively reserved to physicians.

AB Objective To compare the drowning mortality rates and proportion of deaths of each intent among all drowning deaths in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in 2012-2014.
   Design A population-based cross-sectional study.
   Setting 32 OECD countries.
   Participants Individuals in OECD countries who died from drowning.
   Main outcome measures Drowning mortality rates (deaths per 100000 population) and proportion (%) of deaths of each intent (ie, unintentional intent, intentional self-harm, assault, undetermined intent and all intents combined) among all drowning deaths.
   Results Countries with the highest drowning mortality rates (deaths per 100000 population) were Estonia (3.53), Japan (3.49) and Greece (2.40) for unintentional intent; Ireland (0.96), Belgium (0.96) and Korea (0.89) for intentional self-harm; Austria (0.57), Korea (0.56) and Hungary (0.44) for undetermined intent and Japan (4.35), Estonia (3.70) and Korea (2.73) for all intents combined. Korea ranked 12th and 3rd for unintentional intent and all intents combined, respectively. By contrast, Belgium ranked 2nd and 15th for intentional self-harm and all intents combined, respectively. The proportion of deaths of each intent among all drowning deaths in each country varied greatly: from 26.2% in Belgium to 96.8% in Chile for unintentional intent; 0.7% in Mexico to 57.4% in Belgium for intentional self-harm; 0.0% in nine countries to 4.9% in Mexico for assault and 0.0% in Israel and Turkey to 38.3% in Austria for undetermined intent.
   Conclusions A large variation in the practice of classifying undetermined intent in drowning deaths across countries was noted and this variation hinders valid international comparisons of intent-specific (unintentional and intentional self-harm) drowning mortality rates.

AB Background: Euthanasia is performed worldwide, regardless of the existence of laws governing it. Belgium became the second country in the world to enact a law on euthanasia in 2002. Healthcare institutions bear responsibility for guaranteeing the quality of care for patients at the end of life, and for ensuring support for caregivers involved. Therefore, institutional ethics policies on end-of-life decision-making, especially on euthanasia, may be useful.
   Methods: A cross-sectional mail survey of general directors of Catholic hospitals and nursing homes in Belgium was used to describe the prevalence and content of written ethics policies for competent terminally ill, incompetent terminally ill, and non-terminally ill patients.
   Results: Of the 298 targeted institutions, 81% of hospitals and 62% of nursing homes returned complete questionnaires. Of these, 79% of hospitals and 30% of nursing homes had a written ethics policy on euthanasia. Of hospitals 83% and of nursing homes 85% permitted euthanasia for competent terminally ill patients only in exceptional cases in accordance with legal due care criteria and provisions outlined by the palliative filter procedure. Euthanasia for incompetent terminally ill patients was prohibited by 27% of the hospitals and by 60% of the nursing homes. For non-terminally ill patients, these figures were 43 and 64%, respectively.
   Conclusions: Catholic healthcare institutions in Belgium (Flanders) made great efforts to develop written ethics policies on euthanasia. Only a small group Of institutions completely prohibited euthanasia. Most of the institutions considered euthanasia to be an option if all possible alternatives (e.g., palliative filter procedure, which contains more rigorous criteria than those in the Belgian Euthanasia Act), have been thoroughly investigated.

AB A small proportion of deaths result from,the use of drugs with the intention to hasten death without an explicit request of the patient. Additional insight into its characteristics is needed for evaluating this practice. In the Netherlands in 2001, questionnaires were mailed to physicians that addressed the decision making that preceded their patient's death. Cases of ending life without an explicit request of the patient were compared with similar cases from 1995 and with cases from Belgium, Denmark, and Switzerland. In the Netherlands in 2001, patients receiving life-ending drugs without their explicit request were most Often 80+ years old and had cancer. Most of them were incompetent patients nearing death. Characteristics of this practice in 7995 were quite comparable, as were characteristics of this practice in Belgium, Denmark, and Switzerland. The use of drugs with the intention to hasten death without an explicit request of the patient is part of medical end-of-life practice in the studied countries, regardless of their legal framework, and it occurs in similar fashion.

AB The current study looked into non-suicidal self-injury behavior, comparing two countries, that is Belgium and Romania, tackling into the attachment styles and the psychopathology characteristic for this behavior. The sample consisted of 85 non-clinical participants, 43 in Romanian sample and 42 in Belgian sample, aged between 20 and 26 years, students or graduates. The data was collected via both social networks and pen-and-pencil. The measurements we used were: Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Questionnaire (NSSIQ), Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL - 90), Experiences in Close Relationships Scale Revised (ECR-SR), Functions of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Questionnaire (FNSIQ). Results showed for Belgian sample that participants had a higher rate of non-suicidal self-injury behavior and we found a positive correlation between avoidant attachment, but not between anxious attachment, and non-suicidal self-injury behavior. None of the following symptoms (somatization, depression, anxiety, hostility, paranoid ideation, psychotic traits, phobic anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity, obsessive-compulsive traits) were predictors of non-suicidal self-injury for Belgian or Romanian participants.

TI Does legal physician-assisted dying impede development of palliative

SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS

DT Article
ID MAPPING LEVELS; EUTHANASIA; END; NETHERLANDS; SUICIDE; UPDATE; VIEW
AB Background In 2002, physician-assisted dying was legally regulated in the Netherlands and Belgium, followed in 2009 by Luxembourg. An internationally frequently expressed concern is that such legislation could stunt the development of palliative care (PC) and erode its culture. To study this, we describe changes in PC development 2005-2012 in the permissive Benelux countries and compare them with non-permissive countries.
   Methods Focusing on the seven European countries with the highest development of PC, which include the three euthanasia-permissive and four non-permissive countries, we compared the structural service indicators for 2005 and 2012 from successive editions of the European Atlas of Palliative Care. As an indicator for output delivery of services to patients, we collected the amounts of governmental funding of PC 2002-2011 in Belgium, the only country where we could find these data.
   Results The rate of increase in the number of structural PC provisions among the compared countries was the highest in the Netherlands and Luxembourg, while Belgium stayed on a par with the UK, the benchmark country. Belgian government expenditure for PC doubled between 2002 and 2011. Basic PC expanded much more than endowment-restricted specialised PC.
   Conclusions The hypothesis that legal regulation of physician-assisted dying slows development of PC is not supported by the Benelux experience. On the contrary, regulation appears to have promoted the expansion of PC. Continued monitoring of both permissive and non-permissive countries, preferably also including indicators of quantity and quality of delivered care, is needed to evaluate longer-term effects.

In this article, we synthesize evidence from 6 articles focusing on the experiences of 55 nurses from Canada, Belgium, and the Netherlands, with relevant ethical and policy implications derived from the literature. Nurses have a central role in negotiating inquiries about assisted death and in providing wraparound care for patients, families, and other health care providers. This role is impactful for nurses and requires significant personal and professional moral work.

AB Background: Euthanasia for people who are not terminally ill, such as those suffering from psychiatric disorders or dementia, is legal in Belgium under strict conditions but remains a controversial practice. As yet, the prevalence of euthanasia for people with psychiatric disorders or dementia has not been studied and little is known about the characteristics of the practice. This study aims to report on the trends in prevalence and number of euthanasia cases with a psychiatric disorder or dementia diagnosis in Belgium and demographic, clinical and decision-making characteristics of these cases.
   Methods: We analysed the anonymous databases of euthanasia cases reported to the Federal Control and Evaluation Committee Euthanasia from the implementation of the euthanasia law in Belgium in 2002 until the end of 2013. The databases we received provided the information on all euthanasia cases as registered by the Committee from the official registration forms. Only those with one or more psychiatric disorders or dementia and no physical disease were included in the analysis.
   Results: We identified 179 reported euthanasia cases with a psychiatric disorder or dementia as the sole diagnosis. These consisted of mood disorders (N = 83), dementia (N = 62), other psychiatric disorders (N = 22) and mood disorders accompanied by another psychiatric disorder (N = 12). The proportion of euthanasia cases with a psychiatric disorder or dementia diagnosis was 0.5% of all cases reported in the period 2002-2007, increasing from 2008 onwards to 3.0% of all cases reported in 2013. The increase in the absolute number of cases is particularly evident in cases with a mood disorder diagnosis. The majority of cases concerned women (58.1% in dementia to 77.1% in mood disorders). All cases were judged to have met the legal requirements by the Committee.
   Conclusions: While euthanasia on the grounds of unbearable suffering caused by a psychiatric disorder or dementia remains a comparatively limited practice in Belgium, its prevalence has risen since 2008. If, as this study suggests, people with psychiatric conditions or dementia are increasingly seeking access to euthanasia, the development of practice guidelines is all the more desirable if physicians are to respond adequately to these highly delicate requests.

TI Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide of Patients With Psychiatric Disorders
   in the Netherlands 2011 to 2014
SO JAMA PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID MEDICAL-PRACTICE; BELGIUM
AB IMPORTANCE Euthanasia or assisted suicide (EAS) of psychiatric patients is increasing in some jurisdictions such as Belgium and the Netherlands. However, little is known about the practice, and it remains controversial.
   OBJECTIVES To describe the characteristics of patients receiving EAS for psychiatric conditions and how the practice is regulated in the Netherlands.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This investigation reviewed psychiatric EAS case summaries made available online by the Dutch regional euthanasia review committees as of June 1, 2015. Two senior psychiatrists used directed content analysis to review and code the reports. In total, 66 cases from 2011 to 2014 were reviewed.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Clinical and social characteristics of patients, physician review process of the patients' requests, and the euthanasia review committees' assessments of the physicians' actions.
   RESULTS Of the 66 cases reviewed, 70%(n = 46) were women. In total, 32%(n = 21) were 70 years or older, 44% (n = 29) were 50 to 70 years old, and 24% (n = 16) were 30 to 50 years old. Most had chronic, severe conditions, with histories of attempted suicides and psychiatric hospitalizations. Most had personality disorders and were described as socially isolated or lonely. Depressive disorders were the primary psychiatric issue in 55% (n = 36) of cases. Other conditions represented were psychotic, posttraumatic stress or anxiety, somatoform, neurocognitive, and eating disorders, as well as prolonged grief and autism. Comorbidities with functional impairments were common. Forty-one percent (n = 27) of physicians performing EAS were psychiatrists. Twenty-seven percent (n = 18) of patients received the procedure from physicians new to them, 14 of whom were physicians from the End-of-Life Clinic, a mobile euthanasia clinic. Consultation with other physicians was extensive, but 11% (n = 7) of cases had no independent psychiatric input, and 24%(n = 16) of cases involved disagreement among consultants. The euthanasia review committees found that one case failed to meet legal due care criteria.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Persons receiving EAS for psychiatric disorders in the Netherlands are mostly women and of diverse ages, with complex and chronic psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial histories. The granting of their EAS requests appears to involve considerable physician judgment, usually involving multiple physicians who do not always agree (sometimes without independent psychiatric input), but the euthanasia review committees generally defer to the judgments of the physicians performing the EAS.

AB There has been contentious debate over the years about whether there are morally relevant similarities and differences between the three practices of continuous deep sedation until death, physician-assisted suicide, and voluntary euthanasia. Surprisingly little academic attention has been paid to a comparison of the uses of these practices in the two types of circumstances in which they are typically performed. A comparative domains of ethics analysis methodological approach is used in the paper to compare 1) the use of the three practices in paradigm circumstances, and 2) the use of the practices in paradigm circumstances to their use in non-paradigm circumstances. The analytical outcomes suggest that a bright moral line cannot be demonstrated between any two of the practices in paradigm circumstances, and that there are significant, morally-relevant distinctions between their use in paradigm and non-paradigm circumstances. A thought experiment is employed to illustrate how these outcomes could possibly inform the decisions of hypothetical deliberators who are engaged in the collaborative development of assisted dying regulatory frameworks.

AB Belgium legalised voluntary euthanasia in 2002, thus ending the long isolation of the Netherlands as the only country in which doctors could openly give lethal injections to patients who have requested help in dying. Meanwhile in Oregon, in the United States, doctors may prescribe drugs for terminally ill patients, who can use them to end their life - if they are able to swallow and digest them. But despite President Bush's oft-repeated statements that his philosophy is to 'trust individuals to make the right decisions' and his opposition to 'distant bureaucracies' his administration is doing its best to prevent Oregonians acting in accordance with a law that its voters have twice ratified. The situation regarding voluntary euthanasia around the world is therefore very much influx..
   This essay reviews ethical arguments regarding voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide from, a utilitarian perspective. I shall begin by asking why it is normally wrong to kill an innocent person, and whether these reasons apply to aiding a person who, when rational and competent, asks to be killed or given the means to commit suicide. Then I shall consider more specific utilitarian arguments for and against permitting voluntary euthanasia.

AB This paper reports findings from visits to palliative care settings and research units in the UK, Belgium and the Netherlands. The aim was to learn about clinicians' (both nurses and doctors) and academic researchers' understandings and experiences of palliative sedation for managing suffering at the end of life, and their views regarding its clinical, ethical and social implications. The project was linked to two larger studies of technologies used in palliative care. Eleven doctors, 14 nurses and 10 researchers took part in informal interviews. Relevant reports and papers from the academic, clinical and popular press were also collected from the three countries. The study took place in a context in which attention has been drawn towards palliative sedation by the legalisation of euthanasia in the Netherlands and Belgium, and by the reexamination of the legal position on assisted dying in the UK. In this context, palliative sedation has been posited by some as an alternative path of action. We report respondents' views under four headings: understanding and responding to suffering; the relationship between palliative sedation and euthanasia; palliative sedation and artificial hydration; and risks and uncertainties in the clinician-patient/family relationship. We conclude that the three countries can learn from one another about the difficult issues involved in giving compassionate care to those who are suffering immediately before death. Future research should be directed at enabling dialogue between countries: this has already been shown to open the door to the development of improved palliative care and to enhance respect for the different values and histories in each.

AB Objective To investigate attitudes towards physician-assisted death in minors among all physicians involved in the treatment of children dying in Flanders, Belgium over an 18-month period, and how these are related to actual medical end-of-life practices.
   Design Anonymous population-based postmortem physician survey.
   Setting Flanders, Belgium.
   Participants Physicians signing death certificates of all patients aged 1-17 years who died between June 2007 and November 2008.
   Main outcome measures Attitudes towards physician-assisted death in minors and actual end-of-life practices in the deaths concerned.
   Results 124 physicians for 70.5% of eligible cases (N=149) responded. 69% favour an extension of the Belgian law on euthanasia to include minors, 26.6% think this should be done by establishing clear age limits and 61% think parental consent is required before taking life-shortening decisions. Cluster analysis yielded a cluster (67.7% of physicians) accepting of, and a cluster (32.2% of physicians) reluctant towards physician-assisted death in minors. Controlling for physician specialty and patient characteristics, acceptant physicians were more likely to engage in practices with the intention of shortening a patient's life than were reluctant physicians.
   Conclusion A majority of surveyed Flemish physicians appear to accept physician-assisted dying in children under certain circumstances and favour an amendment to the euthanasia law to include minors. The approach favoured is one of assessing decision-making capacity rather than setting arbitrary age limits. These stances, and their connection with actual end-of-life practices, may encourage policy-makers to develop guidelines for medical end-of-life practices in minors that address specific challenges arising in this patient group.

AB Objectives: To describe and compare current legal procedures for notifying, controlling and evaluating (NCE-procedures) euthanasia in Belgium and the Netherlands, and to discuss the implications for a safe and controllable euthanasia practice.
   Methods: We systematically studied and compared official documents relating to the Belgian and the Dutch NCE-procedures for euthanasia.
   Results: In both countries, physicians are required to notify their cases to a review Committee, stimulating them to safeguard the quality of their euthanasia practice and to make societal control over the practice of euthanasia possible. However, the procedures in both countries differ. The main differences are that the Dutch notification and control procedures are more elaborate and transparent than the Belgian, and that the Belgian procedures are primarily anonymous, whereas the Dutch are not. Societal evaluation is made in both countries through the Committees' summary reports to Parliament.
   Conclusions: Transparent procedures like the Dutch may better facilitate societal control. Informing physicians about the law and the due care requirements for euthanasia, and systematic feedback about their medical actions are both pivotal to achieving efficient societal control and engendering the level of care needed when performing such far-reaching medical acts.

AB Since the Netherlands produced the Groningen protocol describing the methods to be used for pediatric euthanasia and Belgium passed laws authorizing euthanasia for children who consent to it, the issue of pediatric euthanasia has become a relevant topic to discuss. Most rejections of pediatric euthanasia fall into 1 or more of 3 categories, each of which has problems. This article shows how several recent arguments against pediatric euthanasia fail to prove that pediatric euthanasia is unacceptable. It does not follow from this that the practice is permissible but rather that if one is to reject such a practice, stronger arguments will need to be made, especially in countries where adult euthanasia or assisted suicide is already permitted.

AB Background: This study compares prevalence and types of medical end-of-life decisions between the Dutch-speaking and French-speaking communities of Belgium. This is the first nationwide study that can make these comparisons and the first measurement after implementation of the euthanasia law (2002).
   Methods: We performed a mortality follow-back study in 2005-2006. Data were collected via the nationwide Sentinel Network of General Practitioners, an epidemiological surveillance system representative of all Belgian GPs. Weekly, all GPs reported the medical end-of-life decisions among all non-sudden deaths of patients in their practice. We compared the northern Dutch-speaking (60%) and southern French-speaking communities (40%) controlling for population differences.
   Results: We analysed 1690 non-sudden deaths. An end-of-life decision with possible life-shortening effect was made in 50% of patients in the Dutch-speaking community and 41% of patients in the French-speaking community (OR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.8). Continuous deep sedation until death occurred in 8% and 15% respectively (OR 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4 to 0.7). Community differences regarding the prevalence of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide were not significant.
   Community differences were more present among home/care home than among hospital deaths: non-treatment decisions with explicit life-shortening intention were made more often in the Dutch-speaking than in the French-speaking community settings (OR 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.9); while continuous deep sedation occurred less often in the Dutch-speaking community settings (OR 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.9).
   Conclusion: Even though legal and general healthcare systems are the same for the whole country, there are considerable variations between the communities in type and prevalence of certain end-of-life decisions, even after controlling for population differences.

AB Since 2002, Belgium has had a national law legalising euthanasia. The law prescribes several substantive due care requirements and two procedural due care requirements, i.e. consultation with an independent physician and reporting of euthanasia to a Federal Control Committee. A large discrepancy in reporting rates between the Dutch-speaking (Flanders) and the French-speaking (Wallonia) parts of Belgium has led to speculation about cultural differences affecting the practice of euthanasia in both regions. Using Belgian data from the European Values Study conducted in 2008 among a representative sample of the general public and data from a large-scale mail questionnaire survey on euthanasia of 480 physicians from Flanders and 305 from Wallonia (conducted in 2009), this study presents empirical evidence of differences between both regions in attitudes towards and practice of euthanasia. Acceptance of euthanasia by the general population was found to be slightly higher in Flanders than in Wallonia. Compared with their Flemish counterparts, Walloon physicians held more negative attitudes towards performing euthanasia and towards the reporting obligation, less often labelled hypothetical cases correctly as euthanasia, and less often defined a case of euthanasia having to be reported. A higher proportion of Flemish physicians had received a euthanasia request since the introduction of the law. In cases of a euthanasia request, Walloon physicians consulted less often with an independent physician. Requests were more often granted in Flanders than in Wallonia (51% vs 38%), and performed euthanasia cases were more often reported (73% vs 58%). The study points out some significant differences between Flanders and Wallonia in practice, knowledge and attitudes regarding euthanasia and its legal requirements which are likely to explain the discrepancy between Wallonia and Flanders in the number of euthanasia cases reported. Cultural factors seem to play an important role in the practice of (legal) euthanasia and the extent to which legal safeguards are followed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,

AB In many European countries there is a public debate about the acceptability and regulation of euthanasia. In 2002, Belgium became the second country after the Netherlands to enact a law on euthanasia. Although euthanasia rarely occurs, the complexity of the clinical-ethical decision making surrounding euthanasia requests and the need for adequate support reported by caregivers, means that healthcare institutions increasingly need to consider how to responsibly handle euthanasia requests. The development of written ethics policies on euthanasia may be important to guarantee and maintain the quality of care for patients requesting euthanasia. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, development, position, and communication of written ethics policies on euthanasia in Flemish nursing homes. Data were obtained through a cross-sectional mail survey of general directors of all Catholic nursing homes in Flanders, Belgium. Of the 737 nursing homes invited to participate, 612 (83%) completed the questionnaire. Of these, only 15% had a written ethics policy on euthanasia. Presence of an ethics committee and membership of an umbrella organization were independent predictors of whether a nursing home had such a written ethics policy. The Act on Euthanasia and euthanasia guidelines advanced by professional organizations were the most frequent reasons (76% and 56%, respectively) and reference sources (92% and 64%, respectively) for developing ethics policies on euthanasia. Development of ethics policies occurred within a multidisciplinary context. In general, Flemish nursing homes applied the Act on Euthanasia restrictively by introducing palliative procedures in addition to legal due care criteria. The policy was communicated to the consulting general practitioner and nurses in 74% and 89% of nursing homes, respectively.
   Although the overall prevalence of ethics policies on euthanasia was low in Flemish nursing homes, institution administrators displayed growing awareness of bearing responsibility for stimulating dialogue and reflection about how to deal with euthanasia requests within their institution.

AB Besides being known for population overcrowding, prison staff strikes, and prisoner suicides or escapes, which are frequently reported by the press, prison might also be a place for rare innovative projects. One such project can be seen in a penitentiary policy initiated in Belgium in 2000 aimed at re-shaping the culture of detention towards a culture of 'restorative justice'. What can be said of this attempt at introducing the concepts of victim, restoration, responsibilization, sensitizing and awareness within prison walls? The present article proposes an illustrative and interpretive account of this prison policy. Rather than restoring the broken victim-offender relationship, its implementation has something to do with detainees working on their 'self'.

AB Suicide is a major public health issue, and treatment of suicidal thoughts may contribute to its prevention. Provision of online treatment of suicidal ideation may reduce barriers that suicidal individuals experience in face-to-face treatment. We therefore aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a web-based intervention targeting a reduction of suicidal ideation. We carried out a two-arm, parallel-design, randomised controlled trial in the general population in Flanders (Belgium) (registered as NCT03209544). Participants who were 18 years or older and experienced suicidal ideation were included. The intervention group (n = 365) received access to the unguided web-based intervention, and the control group (n = 359) was placed on a waitlist. Assessments were carried out at baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks. Participants reported high levels of suicidal ideation, depression, hopelessness, worrying, and anxiety at baseline. Compared to the control group, participants in the intervention group experienced a significant decline in suicidal ideation, depression, hopelessness, worrying, and anxiety both at post-test and at follow-up. An important limitation of the study was a high dropout rate, in particular in the intervention group. Our findings suggest that the online self-help intervention was more effective in reducing suicidal ideation and suicide-related symptoms than a waitlist control in a severely affected population. It can help in filling the gap between crisis help and face-to-face treatment.

AB Background: Since Belgium legalised euthanasia, the number of performed euthanasia cases for psychological suffering in psychiatric patients has significantly increased, as well as the number of media reports on controversial cases. This has prompted several healthcare organisations and committees to develop policies on the management of these requests.
   Method: Five recent initiatives that offer guidance on euthanasia requests by psychiatric patients in Flanders were analysed: the protocol of Ghent University Hospital and advisory texts of the Flemish Federation of Psychiatry, the Brothers of Charity, the Belgian Advisory Committee on Bioethics, and Zorgnet-Icuro. These were examined via critical point-by-point reflection, focusing on all legal due care criteria in order to identify: 1) proposed measures to operationalise the evaluation of the legal criteria; 2) suggestions of additional safeguards going beyond these criteria; and 3) remaining fields of tension.
   Results: The initiatives are well in keeping with the legal requirements but are often more stringent. Additional safeguards that are formulated include the need for at least two positive advices from at least two psychiatrists; an a priori evaluation system; and a two-track approach, focusing simultaneously on the assessment of the patient's euthanasia request and on that person's continuing treatment. Although the initiatives are similar in intent, some differences in approach were found, reflecting different ethical stances towards euthanasia and an emphasis on practical clinical assessment versus broad ethical reflection.
   Conclusions: All initiatives offer useful guidance for the management of euthanasia requests by psychiatric patients. By providing information on, and proper operationalisations of, the legal due care criteria, these initiatives are important instruments to prevent potential abuses. Apart from the additional safeguards suggested, the importance of a decision-making policy that includes many actors (e.g. the patient's relatives and other care providers) and of good aftercare for the bereaved are rightly stressed. Shortcomings of the initiatives relate to the aftercare of patients whose euthanasia request is rejected, and to uncertainty regarding the way in which attending physicians should manage negative or conflicting advices, or patients' suicide threats in case of refusal. Given the scarcity of data on how thoroughly and uniformly requests are handled in practice, it is unclear to what extent the recommendations made in these guidelines are currently being implemented.

AB INTRODUCTION: Euthanasia (EU) and/or physician-assisted suicide (PAS) is legal in some countries and being considered in others. Attitudes to EU/PAS among Danish geriatricians were studied.
   METHODS: An online questionnaire with 12 questions was e-mailed to all members of the Danish Geriatric Society.
   RESULTS: The response rate was 46% (120/261). A total of 55.8% (67/120) disagreed that EU is ethically justifiable, whereas 22.5% (27/120) found that EU is justifiable. Furthermore, 13.3% (16/120) agreed that EU should be offered as an alternative to palliative treatment, 73.4% (88/120) disagreed. A total of 64.2% (67/120) disagreed that PAS is ethically justifiable, whereas 19.2% (23/120) found that PAS is justifiable. In all, 15% (18/120) agreed that PAS should be offered as an alternative to palliative treatment, whereas 76.6% (92/120) disagreed. The impact of legalisation of EU/PAS on the relationship between physician and patient was believed to be negative by 62.2% (74/119), positive by 12.6% (15/119) and without implications by 25.2% (30/119). Younger physicians tended to be more positive towards EU/PAS.
   CONCLUSIONS: The majority of Danish geriatricians are opposed to EU and PAS.

ID EUTHANASIA LAW; BELGIUM; NETHERLANDS; SUICIDE
AB Although physician-assisted death (PAD) is established in certain countries, the legality and ethics of this issue have been debated for decades in Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada has now settled the issue of legality nationally, and as a result of the decision in Carter v. Canada, PAD (which includes both physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia) will become legal on February 6, 2016. It is difficult to predict the potential demand for PAD in Canada. This paper highlights other countries' experiences with PAD in order to shed light on this question and to forecast issues that Canadian physicians will face once the change to the law comes into effect. At present, there is no legislative scheme in place to regulate the conduct of PAD. Physicians and their provincial colleges may find themselves acting as the de facto regulators of PAD if a regulatory vacuum persists. With their specialized knowledge of pharmacology and interdisciplinary leadership, anesthesiologists may be called upon to develop protocols for the administration of PAD as well as to administer euthanasia. Canadian anesthesiologists currently have a unique opportunity to consider the complex ethical issues they will face when PAD becomes legal and to contribute to the creation of a regulatory structure that will govern PAD in Canada.

AB To describe the content of practice guidelines on euthanasia and assisted suicide (EAS) and to compare differences between settings and guidelines developed before or after enactment of the euthanasia law in 2002 by means of a content analysis. Most guidelines stated that the attending physician is responsible for the decision to grant or refuse an EAS request. Due care criteria were described in the majority of guidelines, but aspects relevant for assessing these criteria were not always described. Half of the guidelines described the role of the nurse in the performance of euthanasia. Compared with hospital guidelines, nursing home guidelines were more often stricter than the law in excluding patients with dementia (30% vs 4%) and incompetent patients (25% vs 4%). As from 2002, the guidelines were less strict in categorically excluding patients groups (32% vs 64%) and in particular incompetent patients (10% vs 29%). Healthcare institutions should accurately state the boundaries of the law, also when they prefer to set stricter boundaries for their own institution. Only then can guidelines provide adequate support for physicians and nurses in the difficult EAS decision-making process.

ID BRAIN DISEASE-MODEL; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; ASSISTED SUICIDE; CANADA
AB The recent practice in Belgium and the Netherlands of accepting addiction as a reason for performing euthanasia raises important issues for the field of addiction and the practice of euthanasia. In this paper we outline some of these issues. We also argue that physicians making decisions about whether to accept requests for euthanasia from people with an allegedly untreatable addiction should consider two issues carefully. They should ensure that: (1) the person has the capacity to give free and informed consent to undergo euthanasia; and (2) their request is the outcome of a deliberative process in which all reasonable treatment options and harm reduction measures have been offered to and considered by the person.

AB Background: Physician-assisted suicide (PAS) is an important subject of the public debate. So far, legal regulations exist in the Netherlands, Belgium and in Oregon (USA). This review reports results of nine empirical studies from Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the U.S. which examine attitudes of psychiatrists toward PAS. Results: The approval of PAS by psychiatrists varies between the four countries (40-69%). Comparisons with the attitudes of other physicians show a greater agreement among the psychiatrists. A psychiatric examination in order to evaluate competence even in patients with severe somatic illness was advocated by the majority of psychiatrists. Conclusion: Psychiatrists' attitudes toward PAS vary and are compared with other medical specialities, as well as in different legal and cultural contexts. Therefore, and because of missing empirical studies, results can not be transferred into the context of German speaking countries easily. So far, no acknowledged criteria for the assessment of competence exist. Further empirical research is needed on German psychiatrists' attitudes towards PAS and on competence assessment at the end of life. It remains an open question how legal changes and future developments of palliative care will influence attitudes toward PAS.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate associations between self-injury training and attitudes across different health care professions. In the study, 342 psychologists, social workers, psychiatric, and medical nurses were recruited from 12 hospitals in Belgium. Participants completed a confidential questionnaire assessing attitudes, perceived knowledge/competence in self-injury, and prior self-injury training. Professionals with training reported more positive empathy, less negative attitudes, and greater perceived knowledge/competence, which was related to positive attitudes. Mental health providers had more positive attitudes than medical professionals. Conclusions: Attitudes towards self-injuring patients are multifaceted and vary across health professions. Training on self-injury should be incorporated into the educational curriculum of all health care professions.

AB Background: End-of-life decisions remain controversial. Switzerland, with three main languages shared with surrounding countries and legal suicide assistance, allows exploration of the effects of cultural differences on end-of-life practices within the same legal framework.
   Methods: We conducted a death certificate study on a nationwide continuous random sample of Swiss residents. Using an internationally standardized tool, we sent 4998, 2965, and 1000 anonymous questionnaires to certifying physicians in the German-,French-, and Italian-speaking regions.
   Results: The response rates were 63.5%, 51.9%, and 61.7% in the German-, French-, and Italian-speaking regions, respectively. Non-sudden, expected deaths were preceded by medical end-of-life decisions (MELDs) more frequently in the German- than in the French- or Italian-speaking region (82.3% vs. 75.0% and 74.0%, respectively), mainly due to forgoing life-prolonging treatment (70.0%, 59.8%, 57.4%). Prevalence of assisted suicide was similar in the German- and French-speaking regions (1.6%, 1.2%), with no cases reported in the Italian-speaking region. Patient involvement was smaller in the Italian-than in the French- and German-speaking regions (16.0%, 31.2%, 35.6%). Continuous deep sedation was more frequent in the Italian- than in the French- and German-speaking regions (34.4%, 26.9%, 24.5%), and was combined with MELDs in most cases.
   Conclusion: We found differences in MELD prevalence similar to those found between European countries. On an international level, MELDs are comparably frequent in all regions of Switzerland, in line with the greater role given to patient autonomy. Our findings show how cultural contexts and legislation can interact in shaping the prevalence of MELDs.

AB This study explores expressed wishes and requests for euthanasia (i.e. administration of lethal drugs at the explicit request of the patient), and incidence of end-of-life decisions with possible life-shortening effects (ELDs) in advanced lung cancer patients in Flanders, Belgium.
   We performed a prospective, longitudinal, observational study of a consecutive sample of advanced lung cancer patients and selected those who died within 18 months of diagnosis. Immediately after death, the pulmonologist/oncologist and general practitioner (GP) of the patient filled in a questionnaire. Information was available for 105 out of 115 deaths.
   According to the specialist or GP, one in five patients had expressed a wish for euthanasia; and three in four of these had made an explicit and repeated request. One in two of these received euthanasia. Of the patients who had expressed a wish for euthanasia but had not made an explicit and repeated request, none received euthanasia. Patients with a palliative treatment goal at inclusion were more likely to receive euthanasia. Death was preceded by an ELD in 62.9% of patients.
   To conclude, advanced lung cancer patients who expressed a euthanasia wish were often determined. Euthanasia was performed significantly more among patients whose treatment goal after diagnosis was exclusively palliative.

AB Background Reducing socioeconomic inequalities in mortality, a key public health objective may be supported by a careful monitoring and assessment of the contributions of specific causes of death to the global inequality.
   Methods The 1991 and 2001 Belgian censuses were linked with cause-of-death data, each yielding a study population of over 5 million individuals aged 25-64, followed up for 5 years. Age-standardised mortality rates (ASMR) were computed by educational level (EL) and cause. Inequalities were measured through rate differences (RDs), rate ratios (RRs) and population attributable fractions (PAFs). We analysed changes in educational inequalities between the 1990s and the 2000s, and decomposed the PAF into the main causes of death.
   Results All-cause and avoidable ASMR decreased in all ELs and both sexes. Lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease (IHD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and suicide in men, and IHD, stroke, lung cancer and COPD in women had the highest impact on population mortality. RDs decreased in men but increased in women. RRs and PAFs increased in both sexes, albeit more in women. In men, the impact of lung cancer and COPD inequalities on population mortality decreased while that of suicide and IHD increased. In women, the impact of all causes except IHD increased.
   Conclusion Absolute inequalities decreased in men while increasing in women; relative inequalities increased in both sexes. The PAFs decomposition revealed that targeting mortality inequalities from lung cancer, IHD, COPD in both sexes, suicide in men and stroke in women would have the largest impact at population level.

TI Euthanasia in Belgium: trends in reported cases between 2003 and 2013

DT Article
ID OF-LIFE DECISIONS; MEDICAL-PRACTICE; NATIONWIDE SURVEY; ASSISTED
   SUICIDE; LAW; PHYSICIANS; FLANDERS; CONSULTATION; NETHERLANDS; REQUESTS
AB Background: In 2002, the Belgian Act on Euthanasia came into effect, regulating the intentional ending of life by a physician at the patient's explicit request. We undertook this study to describe trends in officially reported euthanasia cases in Belgium with regard to patients' sociodemographic and clinical profiles, as well as decision-making and performance characteristics.
   Methods: We used the database of all euthanasia cases reported to the Federal Control and Evaluation Committee on Euthanasia in Belgium between Jan. 1, 2003, and Dec. 31, 2013 (n = 8752). The committee collected these data with a standardized registration form. We analyzed trends in patient, decision-making and performance characteristics using a (2) technique. We also compared and analyzed trends for cases reported in Dutch and in French.
   Results: The number of reported euthanasia cases increased every year, from 235 (0.2% of all deaths) in 2003 to 1807 (1.7% of all deaths) in 2013. The rate of euthanasia increased significantly among those aged 80 years or older, those who died in a nursing home, those with a disease other than cancer and those not expected to die in the near future (p < 0.001 for all increases). Reported cases in 2013 most often concerned those with cancer (68.7%) and those under 80 years (65.0%). Palliative care teams were increasingly often consulted about euthanasia requests, beyond the legal requirements to do so (p < 0.001). Among cases reported in Dutch, the proportion in which the person was expected to die in the foreseeable future decreased from 93.9% in 2003 to 84.1% in 2013, and palliative care teams were increasingly consulted about the euthanasia request (from 34.0% in 2003 to 42.6% in 2013). These trends were not significant for cases reported in French.
   Interpretation: Since legalization of euthanasia in Belgium, the number of reported cases has increased each year. Most of those receiving euthanasia were younger than 80 years and were dying of cancer. Given the increases observed among non-terminally ill and older patients, this analysis shows the importance of detailed monitoring of developments in euthanasia practice.

TI A post-mortem survey on end-of-life decisions using a representative

AB Background: Reliable studies of the incidence and characteristics of medical end-of-life decisions with a certain or possible life shortening effect (ELDs) are indispensable for an evidence-based medical and societal debate on this issue. This article presents the protocol drafted for the 2007 ELD Study in Flanders, Belgium, and outlines how the main aims and challenges of the study (i.e. making reliable incidence estimates of end-of-life decisions, even rare ones, and describing their characteristics; allowing comparability with past ELD studies; guaranteeing strict anonymity given the sensitive nature of the research topic; and attaining a sufficient response rate) are addressed in a post-mortem survey using a representative sample of death certificates.
   Study design: Reliable incidence estimates are achievable by using large at random samples of death certificates of deceased persons in Flanders (aged one year or older). This entails the cooperation of the appropriate administrative authorities. To further ensure the reliability of the estimates and descriptions, especially of less prevalent end-of-life decisions (e.g. euthanasia), a stratified sample is drawn. A questionnaire is sent out to the certifying physician of each death sampled. The questionnaire, tested thoroughly and avoiding emotionally charged terms is based largely on questions that have been validated in previous national and European ELD studies. Anonymity of both patient and physician is guaranteed through a rigorous procedure, involving a lawyer as intermediary between responding physicians and researchers. To increase response we follow the Total Design Method (TDM) with a maximum of three follow-up mailings. Also, a non-response survey is conducted to gain insight into the reasons for lack of response.
   Discussion: The protocol of the 2007 ELD Study in Flanders, Belgium, is appropriate for achieving the objectives of the study; as past studies in Belgium, the Netherlands, and other European countries have shown, strictly anonymous and thorough surveys among physicians using a large, stratified, and representative death certificate sample are most suitable in nationwide studies of incidence and characteristics of end-of-life decisions. There are however also some limitations to the study design.

AB This article analyses domestic and foreign reactions to a 2008 report in the British Medical Journal on the complementary and, as argued, synergistic relationship between palliative care and euthanasia in Belgium. The earliest initiators of palliative care in Belgium in the late 1970s held the view that access to proper palliative care was a precondition for euthanasia to be acceptable and that euthanasia and palliative care could, and should, develop together. Advocates of euthanasia including author Jan Bernheim, independent from but together with British expatriates, were among the founders of what was probably the first palliative care service in Europe outside of the United Kingdom. In what has become known as the Belgian model of integral end-of-life care, euthanasia is an available option, also at the end of a palliative care pathway. This approach became the majority view among the wider Belgian public, palliative care workers, other health professionals, and legislators. The legal regulation of euthanasia in 2002 was preceded and followed by a considerable expansion of palliative care services. It is argued that this synergistic development was made possible by public confidence in the health care system and widespread progressive social attitudes that gave rise to a high level of community support for both palliative care and euthanasia. The Belgian model of so-called integral end-of-life care is continuing to evolve, with constant scrutiny of practice and improvements to procedures. It still exhibits several imperfections, for which some solutions are being developed. This article analyses this model by way of answers to a series of questions posed by Journal of Bioethical Inquiry consulting editor Michael Ashby to the Belgian authors.

TI EFFECTS OF FINANCIAL PRECARIOUSNESS ON MENTAL HEALTH
SO PSYCHIATRIA DANUBINA
LA English
DT Article
DE mental health; precariousness; exclusion; poverty
ID LONELINESS; SUICIDE
AB Background: The physical and mental health of a population is based, in particular, on its quality of life and its access to health care. Given these determinants, Greece's population has greatly suffered due to the sharp cuts in the budget for social benefits and health care (some measurable evidence is the recent increase in the suicide rate). Starting January, the 1st of 2015, unemployment benefits in Belgium have been eliminated for all recipients who do not have a full-time year of work over the last three years. Therefore, we must ask whether there will be similar psycho-medical consequences for Belgium's population.
   Subjects and methods: Open study over a year (01/07/14 - 30/06/15) of emergencies admitted to the University Hospital Center of Mont-Godinne including a psychopathological motif. In addition to general socio-demographic data, psychic disorders are measured, as well as different types of crises (familial, professional or couple crisis), familial support and its dynamic (FACES III of Olson) and finally social integration (social isolation scale from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP)). These patients are compared with those admitted during the six months preceding the Act modifying the unemployment benefits.
   Results: Between July the 1st of 2014 and June the 30th of 2015, we saw an increase in the number of admissions to the psychiatric emergency department by 2.5% in six months, despite a decrease in the number of admissions to all-cause emergencies. Our study also shows a degradation of social network quality characterized by a more pronounced social isolation of our patients. At last, an alteration of cohesion in the patient's origin family was highlighted.
   Conclusion: Although we cannot establish a direct causal link between this law and the results of this study, these may suggest a weakening of the population mental health due to difficult socio-economic context. As a result, we are faced not only with a public health problem but also with one concerning health care organization.

AB Coprolites are fossilized fecal material that can reveal information about ancient intestinal and environmental microbiota. Viral metagenomics has allowed systematic characterization of viral diversity in environmental and human-associated specimens, but little is known about the viral diversity in fossil remains. Here, we analyzed the viral community of a 14th-century coprolite from a closed barrel in a Middle Ages site in Belgium using electron microscopy and metagenomics. Viruses that infect eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea were detected, and we confirmed the presence of some of them by ad hoc suicide PCR. The coprolite DNA viral metagenome was dominated by sequences showing homologies to phages commonly found in modern stools and soil. Although their phylogenetic compositions differed, the metabolic functions of the viral communities have remained conserved across centuries. Antibiotic resistance was one of the reconstructed metabolic functions detected.

AB Objectives First, to examine general practitioner (GP) knowledge about the care (needs) of their patients; second, to examine the quality of GP follow-up care; third, to examine the transmission of patient care information from hospitals/emergency services (ES) to GPs.
   Setting 105 general practices from the representative Belgian Network of Sentinel General Practices (SGP) in Flanders, the largest region of Belgium, during 2013-2016.
   Participants 245 suicide attempts by regular patients.
   Outcomes measures Ten care-related measures, including three indicators of quality of follow-up care, were based on data reported by the SGP on structured forms at baseline and at two follow-up points in time.
   Results As for GP knowledge, 10.5% of SGP failed to report whether suicidal risk was noticed in patients seen in the month preceding the attempt; 9.0% whether there were previous attempts; 22.5% whether the patient was receiving mental health treatment at follow-up and 22.0% whether suicidal behaviour was repeated at follow-up. Relatively more patients >= 65 years had no suicide risk evaluation (OR 3.54; 95% CI 1.11 to 11.26). As for quality of follow-up care, there was a GP-patient contact following 90.5% of the attempts, follow-up appointments were planned following 43.4% of the attempts and there was a GP contact with patient proxies following 62.8% of the attempts. Patient age >= 65 years (OR 4.09; 95% CI 1.79 to 9.33), a recent GP-patient contact preceding the attempt (OR 1.97; 95% CI 1.13 to 3.43), depression of patient (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.14 to 3.37) and a suburban SGP area (OR 2.34; 95% CI 1.13 to 4.82) were determinants of an increased quality of care sum. GPs received patient care information from a hospital (ES) for 67.8% of eligible attempts, with SGP practice location being a determinant.
   Conclusions GPs are highly involved in the care of suicide attempters but there is room for improvement, also in informational continuity from hospital (ES) to GPs.

DT Article

AB In the United States, different people have different rights to die. This Article traces the origins of death-sentenced prisoners' ability to enlist assistance in dying and compares it to the considerably more circumscribed right held by people with serious illness. It uses empirical research on "volunteers," death-sentenced prisoners who sought execution, to argue that the legal standard for adjudicating their requests to hasten execution should be changed. Empirical evidence suggests many of the concerns governing the regulation of assisted dying in the medical context are present in the death row case. This Article therefore urges courts to use a balancing test comparable to that developed in cases involving assisted dying in the medical context. Further, counsel should be appointed to articulate the state's interests in subjecting the conviction and sentence to appellate review.

AB Purpose of reviewMedical Assistance in Dying (MAID) is now legal in many jurisdictions for competent adults who have intolerable suffering and/or have a terminal illness with a short prognosis. Mental illness can be a source of suffering for these individuals, but it can also affect their capacity to make medical decisions. Clinicians, and psychiatrists in particular, need to understand how to assess patients with mental illness who are requesting MAID, to determine the impact of their mental illness on the MAID request.Recent findingsPsychiatric disorders can be a primary indication for MAID in parts of Europe, and recent published case series from Belgium and the Netherlands have generated strong responses from the psychiatric community. Patients dying of terminal illnesses who request MAID often have symptoms of depression or anxiety, but psychiatrists are rarely involved in their care. Psychiatrists may be helpful in assessing decision capacity, but documentation of capacity assessment could be improved. There is a broad need to develop educational resources to train current and future physicians about MAID.SummaryMAID represents an ethical and clinical challenge for psychiatrists in a variety of ways. As more jurisdictions legalize MAID, the psychiatric community will need to be prepared to meet these challenges with robust clinical standards and educational programs to ensure the highest standards of care for patients.

AB Adolescents seeking professional help with their gender identity development often present with psychological difficulties. Existing literature on psychological functioning of gender diverse young people is limited and mostly bound to national chart reviews. This study examined the prevalence of psychological functioning and peer relationship problems in adolescents across four European specialist gender services (The Netherlands, Belgium, the UK, and Switzerland), using the Child Behavioural Checklist (CBCL) and the Youth Self-Report (YSR). Differences in psychological functioning and peer relationships were found in gender diverse adolescents across Europe. Overall, emotional and behavioural problems and peer relationship problems were most prevalent in adolescents from the UK, followed by Switzerland and Belgium. The least behavioural and emotional problems and peer relationship problems were reported by adolescents from The Netherlands. Across the four clinics, a similar pattern of gender differences was found. Birth-assigned girls showed more behavioural problems and externalising problems in the clinical range, as reported by their parents. According to self-report, internalising problems in the clinical range were more prevalent in adolescent birth-assigned boys. More research is needed to gain a better understanding of the difference in clinical presentations in gender diverse adolescents and to investigate what contextual factors that may contribute to this.

AB Background: Extensive debate surrounds the practice of continuous sedation until death to control refractory symptoms in terminal cancer care. We examined reported practice of United Kingdom, Belgian and Dutch physicians and nurses.
   Methods: Qualitative case studies using interviews.
   Setting: Hospitals, the domestic home and hospices or palliative care units.
   Participants: In all, 57 Physicians and 73 nurses involved in the care of 84 cancer patients.
   Results: UK respondents reported a continuum of practice from the provision of low doses of sedatives to control terminal restlessness to rarely encountered deep sedation. In contrast, Belgian respondents predominantly described the use of deep sedation, emphasizing the importance of responding to the patient's request. Dutch respondents emphasized making an official medical decision informed by the patient's wish and establishing that a refractory symptom was present. Respondents employed rationales that showed different stances towards four key issues: the preservation of consciousness, concerns about the potential hastening of death, whether they perceived continuous sedation until death as an alternative' to euthanasia and whether they sought to follow guidelines or frameworks for practice.
   Conclusion: This qualitative analysis suggests that there is systematic variation in end-of-life care sedation practice and its conceptualization in the United Kingdom, Belgium and the Netherlands.

AB Context. - Management of the end of life is a major social issue which was addressed in France by law, on April 22nd 2005. Nevertheless, a debate has emerged within French society about the legalization of euthanasia and/or assisted suicide (E/AS). This issue raises questions for doctors and most especially for anesthetists and intensive care physicians.
   Objective. - To highlight, dispassionately and without dogmatism, key points taken from the published literature and the experience of countries which have legislated for E/AS.
   Results. - The current French law addresses most of the end of life issues an intensive care physician might encounter. It is credited for imposing palliative care when therapies have become senseless and are withdrawn. However, this requirement for palliative care is generally applied too late in the course of a fatal illness. There is a great need for more education and stronger incentives for early action in this area. On the rare occasions when E/AS is requested, either by the patient or their loved-ones, it often results from a failure to consider that treatments have become senseless and conflict with patient's best interest. The implementation of E/AS cannot be reduced to a simple affirmation of the Principle of autonomy. Such procedures present genuine difficulties and the risk of drift.
   Conclusion. - We deliver a message of prudence and caution. Should we address painful end of life and moral suffering issues, by suppressing the subject, i.e. ending the patient's life, when comprehensive palliative care has not first been fully granted to all patients in need of it ?

TI Legalising physician-assisted suicide in South Africa: Should it even be
   considered?
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOETHICS AND LAW
LA English
DT Article
ID EUTHANASIA; ETHICS
AB For many years, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) have been topics that no one dared to mention. However, over the past few decades, the subject has emerged as a very pertinent issue around the world, for a number of reasons - so much so that these life-ending practices have already been legalised or decriminalised in some developed countries, such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, and within certain states of the USA. In the states and countries where the practices have been legalised, or at least decriminalised, the effects of the legalisation have been relatively well documented. On the other hand, in countries like South Africa (SA), where they are illegal, whether or not they should be legalised (taking into consideration all the associated benefits and consequences) should be discussed, and a consensus reached, sooner rather than later. A consensus regarding the feasibility of legalising euthanasia and/or PAS in SA is needed because these practices (or mere requests for them) are becoming increasingly common, especially among people with terminal illnesses. Furthermore, the relative ease with which patients who desperately seek to end their life through either of the aforementioned methods, and are able to access them - by applying for them in countries where the pertinent laws and regulations are adjudged to be more liberal - is alarming. This highlights the importance and need for each country to set clear laws or parameters (and regulations, where applicable) that relate to these life-ending practices.

AB Context. In many countries, physicians are confronted with requests for euthanasia. Notwithstanding that euthanasia is legally permitted in Belgium, it remains the subject of intense debate.
   Objectives. To gather in-depth empirical data on how general practitioners (GPs) deal with these requests in Belgium.
   Methods. Mortality follow-back study in 2005-2006 via the nationwide Sentinel Network of General Practitioners. Standardized face-to-face interviews were conducted with GPs for all the reported patients who did not die suddenly or totally unexpectedly at home, as judged by the GP.
   Results. We conducted 205 interviews. Of these, 27 patients had at some point expressed a wish to receive a drug administered by a physician with the explicit intention to end life, that is, euthanasia. Thirteen of these formulated their requests explicitly and repeatedly, according to their GP. Compared with patients who expressed a wish but not an explicit/repeated request for euthanasia, those patients' requests were more often documented (8 of 13 vs. 2 of 14; P = 0.01), and reiterated until their final days of life (6 of 13 vs. 0 of 14; P = 0.02). Five patients received euthanasia. For the other 22 patients, GPs gave different reasons for not acceding to the request, often related to criteria stipulated in the Belgian law on euthanasia, and sometimes related to personal reasons.
   Conclusion. It is not uncommon for patients to ask their GP for euthanasia, although explicit requests remain relatively rare. Requests tend to vary widely in form and content, and far more are expressed than complied with. For many GPs, the Belgian law on euthanasia serves as a guiding principle in this decision-making process, although in a minority of the cases, a GP's personal opinion toward euthanasia seems to be decisive.

AB Objectives: The objective of this study is to estimate the proportion of different types of end-of-life decisions (ELDs) of physicians in the city of Hasselt (Flanders, Belgium), The question is addressed to what degree these ELD meet legal constraints and the ethical requirements for prudent practice.
   Methodology: All physicians of the city of Hasselt who signed at least one death certificate in 1996 (N = 166) received an anonymous self-administered mail questionnaire per death case (max. 5/doctor).
   Results: the response rate was 55% (N = 269). rn 37.3% of all cases at least one ELD was made (16.5% non-treatment decisions; 16% potential life-shortening by intensifying the treatment of pain and symptoms; 4.8% administration, supply or prescription of lethal drugs). In 59.5% of the cases were an ELD was made that decision was legally questionable. Patient characteristics were clearly related to the type of ELD There was no influence of physician characteristics, except for commitment to life-stance, In 71.3 % of the cases the ELD was in no way discussed with the patient, 8.1 % of the ELD-cases were in response to a direct request from the patient.
   Conclusions: The incidences of ELDs in Hasselt are consistent with earlier findings. The study shows that religious commitment influences the behaviour of physicians at the end of their patients' life. The patient's and her family's entitlements to participation in the decision making process were rather poorly respected.

AB Background. Medical end-of-life decisions (ELDs) have been discussed for several years in different countries, but little is known about the involvement of GPs in these ELDs.
   Objectives. The aim of the present study was to establish the incidence and characteristics of ELDs by GPs.
   Method. We selected 3999 deaths, a 20% random sample of all registered deaths during the first 4 months of 1998 in Flanders, Belgium, and mailed anonymous questionnaires to the attesting physicians. Here we focus exclusively on the 1647 deaths certified by GPs.
   Results. The GPs returned 1067 questionnaires (response rate of 64.8%). At least one ELD was made in 39.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 37.8-41.2] of all primary care deaths. The incidence of euthanasia (including physician-assisted suicide) was 1.5% (95% CI 0.9-2.3) (incidence higher among more educated patients and at home), of administration of lethal drugs without the patient's explicit request 3.8% (95% CI 2.9-5.0) (higher among cancer patients), of alleviation of pain and symptoms with possibly life-shortening effect 18.6% (95% CI 17.0-20.2) (higher among cancer patients and married patients) and of non-treatment decisions 15.6% (95% CI 14.2-17.2) (higher among cancer patients and in nursing homes). The decision was not discussed with the patient in three out of four of the ELDs. A colleague was consulted in one in four ELD cases.
   Conclusion. ELDs are common in general practice in Flanders, Belgium, despite the restrictive law concerning euthanasia at the time of this study. The incidence of these ELDs varies with cause and place of death, the patient's education and the GP's religion and age. Requirements of prudent practice regarding ELDs are rather poorly met by GPs. Further international research and debate is needed to highlight the GPs' important role in end-of-life care.

AB Background: Reports about regulations and laws on Euthanasia and Physician Assisted Suicide (PAS) are becoming increasingly common in the media. Many groups have expressed opposition to euthanasia and PAS while those in favor argue that severely chronically ill and debilitated patients have a right to control the timing and manner of their death. Others argue that both PAS and euthanasia are ethically legitimate in rare and exceptional cases. Given that these discussions as well as the new and proposed laws and regulations may have a powerful impact on patients, caregivers, and health care providers, the International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care (IAHPC) has prepared this statement.
   Purpose: To describe the position of the IAHPC regarding Euthanasia and PAS.
   Method: The IAHPC formed a working group (WG) of seven board members and two staff officers who volunteered to participate in this process. An online search was performed using the terms "position statement'', "euthanasia'' "assisted suicide'' "PAS'' to identify existing position statements from health professional organizations. Only statements from national or pan-national associations were included. Statements from seven general medical and nursing associations and statements from seven palliative care organizations were identified. A working document including a summary of the different position statements was prepared and based on these, an initial draft was prepared. Online discussions among the members of the WG took place for a period of three months. The differences were reconciled by email discussions. The resulting draft was shared with the full board. Additional comments and suggestions were incorporated. This document represents the final version approved by the IAHPC Board of Directors.
   Result: IAHPC believes that no country or state should consider the legalization of euthanasia or PAS until it ensures universal access to palliative care services and to appropriate medications, including opioids for pain and dyspnea.
   Conclusion: In countries and states where euthanasia and/or PAS are legal, IAHPC agrees that palliative care units should not be responsible for overseeing or administering these practices. The law or policies should include provisions so that any health professional who objects must be allowed to deny participating.

AB Background: The reduction of socio-economic inequality in mortality is an important public health goal. Previous ecological studies aimed at studying the relationship between mortality rate and socio-economic factors have paid little attention to mortality causes avoidable by primary or secondary prevention. Furthermore, these studies do not make the distinction between, on the one hand, the strength of the relationship mortality/socio-economic deprivation and, on the other hand the significance of the unequal distribution of mortality. The present work is aimed at measuring the strength of this relationship and the concentration of mortality in relation to socio-economic deprivation for both overall mortality and mortality avoidable by primary and secondary prevention.
   Method: Standardised mortality ratios were computed at the community level in Belgium (1985-93 period) for all causes and for 11 mortality causes avoidable by primary and secondary prevention. A deprivation index was elaborated using a factorial principal component analysis on 11 socio-economic indicators. The mortality/deprivation relationship was assessed by way of a standardised regression coefficient (B) while socio-economic concentration of mortality was estimated using the Concentration Illness Index (Cii) and the P90/P10 ratio.
   Results: A strong positive relationship was found between mortality and deprivation for under 65 years all-causes mortality (B = 0.71; CI [0.66; 0.76]), mortality for cirrhosis of the liver (B = 0.56, CI [0.51; 0.62]), lung cancer (B = 0.49, CI [0.42; 0.56]), suicide (B = 0.35; CI [0.29; 0.42]) and falls (B = 0.34; CI [0.28; 0,41]). However, the concentration of mortality was more limited: 14% (CI [11%-17%]) of cirrhosis of the liver mortality, 7% of fall (CI [5%-10%]) and suicide mortality (CI [4%-9%]), 6% (CI [5%-7%]) of lung cancer mortality is unequally distributed.
   Conclusion: Socio-economic deprivation is positively associated with mortality. This association is more pronounced for tobacco, alcohol and mental health related mortality. However, the strength of the relationship between socio-economic deprivation and mortality is not a good indicator of unequal distribution.

AB Background. Death in modern societies is often preceded by medical end-of-life decisions. Empirical research on these end-of-life decisions focuses predominantly on the physicians' role. Little is known about the role of other health care workers, especially that of nurses.
   Aim. This paper reports the findings of a study that investigated how often nurses are consulted by physicians in the decision-making process preceding end-of-life decisions and how often nurses participate in administering lethal drugs in end-of-life decisions.
   Method. Data were collected within a nationwide cross-sectional retrospective death certificate study in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. We selected 3999 deaths, a 20% random sample of all those occurring during the first 4 months of 1998. Anonymous questionnaires were mailed to the physicians who signed the death certificates. Several questions concerned the involvement of nurses in end-of-life decisions.
   Results. We received 1925 valid questionnaires. For all reported end-of-life decisions (39.3% of all deaths in Flanders), physicians provided information about the involvement of nurses. Physicians consulted at least one nurse in 52% of end-of-life decisions cases occurring in institutions, compared with 21.4% of such cases at home. Nurses administered lethal drugs in 58.8% of euthanasia cases occurring in institutions and in 17.2% at home. For cases in which life was ended without the patient's explicit request because, predominantly, they were too ill to do so, these percentages were respectively 82.7% and 25.2%. In institutions, nurses mostly administered drugs without the attendance of a physician who had prescribed the drugs.
   Conclusions. Nurses in Belgium are largely involved in administering lethal drugs in end-of-life decisions, while their participation in the decision-making process is rather limited. To guarantee prudent practice in end-of-life decisions, we need clear guidelines, professionally supported and legally controlled, for the assignment of duties between physicians and nurses regarding the administration of lethal drugs to reflect current working practice. In addition, we need appropriate binding standards governing mutual communication about all end-of-life decisions.

AB Background: Belgium legalized euthanasia in 2002. Physicians must report each euthanasia case to the Federal Control and Evaluation Committee. This study examines which end-of-life decisions (ELDs) Belgian physicians label 'euthanasia', which ELDs they think should be reported and the physician characteristics associated with correct labelling of euthanasia cases, the awareness that they should be reported and the reporting of them. Methods: Five hypothetical cases of ELDs: intensified pain alleviation, palliative/terminal sedation, euthanasia with neuromuscular relaxants, euthanasia with morphine and life-ending without patient request were presented in a cross-sectional survey of 914 physicians in Belgium in 2009. Results: About 19% of physicians did not label a euthanasia case with neuromuscular relaxants 'euthanasia', 27% did not know that it should be reported. Most physicians labelled a euthanasia case with morphine 'intensification of pain and symptom treatment' (39%) or 'palliative/terminal sedation' (37%); 21% of physicians labelled this case 'euthanasia'. Cases describing other ELDs were sometimes also labelled 'euthanasia'. Factors associated with a higher likelihood of labelling a euthanasia case correctly were: living in Flanders, being informed about the euthanasia law and having a positive attitude towards societal control over euthanasia. Whether a physician correctly labelled the euthanasia cases strongly determined their reporting knowledge and intentions. Conclusion: There is no consensus among physicians about the labelling of euthanasia and other ELDs, and about which cases must be reported. Mislabelling of ELDs could impede societal control over euthanasia. The provision of better information to physicians appears to be necessary.

AB This article gives an overview of the nursing ethics arguments on euthanasia in general, and on nurses' involvement in euthanasia in particular, through an argument-based literature review. An in-depth study of these arguments in this literature will enable nurses to engage in the euthanasia debate. We critically appraised 41 publications published between January 1987 and June 2007. Nursing ethics arguments on ( nurses' involvement in) euthanasia are guided primarily by the principles of respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice. Ethical arguments related to the nursing profession are described. From a care perspective, we discuss arguments that evaluate to what degree euthanasia can be considered positively or negatively as a form of good nursing care. Most arguments in the principle-, profession- and care-orientated approaches to nursing ethics are used both pro and contra euthanasia in general, and nurses' involvement in euthanasia in particular.

AB Although research shows that young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) struggle with higher rates of depression, anxiety, and other co-occurring psychiatric disorders, their psychological development through emerging adulthood remains understudied. To explore relevant developmental themes for young adults with ASD while subscribing to a social-constructionist epistemology, we interviewed young adults with ASD and their mental health care professionals individually, and organized focus groups with their parents in a multiperspective design. Developmental themes were identified using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Despite a substantial body of research considering lack of social motivation, a central ASD characteristic, narratives were remarkably socially oriented. This article discusses the overarching themes of (a) searching for balance and negotiating ASD and (b) searching for suitable surroundings in different areas of life, as well as their implications for clinical practice.

AB Is opposition to child euthanasia motivated only by ideology, or also by other personality characteristics and individual differences? In Belgium, the first country to legalize child euthanasia (in 2014), we investigated religious, moral, emotional, and cognitive factors underlying the (dis)approval of this legalization (N = 213). Disapproval was associated with religiousness, collectivistic morality (loyalty and purity), and prosocial dispositions, in terms of emotional empathy and behavioral generosity, but not values (care and fairness). It was also associated with low flexibility in existential issues and a high endorsement of slippery slope arguments, but not necessarily low openness to experience. A regression analysis showed that in addition to religiousness, low flexibility in existential issues and high empathy and generosity distinctly predicted opposition to child euthanasia. Whereas most of the findings parallel those previously reported for adult euthanasia, the role of prosocial inclinations in predicting moral opposition seems to be specific to child euthanasia.

AB Introduction. Studies conducted in the psychiatric setting and related with biometeorology generally coincide that there is a seasonal rhythm between seasons and depressive disorders, violent suicides and manic episodes. However, there are many discrepancies about the correlation of specific meteorological variables with the remaining clinical pictures. This work has aimed to study a wide sample of psychiatric cases in this area (Baix Camp/Tarragona) to see whether there is a relationship between meteorological variables and the total number of daily emergencies.
   Method. We recorded the data of 3,048 cases attended in the Emergency Department of the Hospital Pere Mata de Reus (Tarragona) from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2005. The possible relationship between the number of daily visits and different meteorological end-points (such as wind direction and speed, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure and solar radiation) were analyzed statistically.
   Results. The results were statistically significant for the meteorological endpoints of medium temperature (TMED), maximum temperature (TMAX) and minimum temperature (TMIN). The relationship between humidity and number of daily visits was also statistically significant (non-linear form). The remaining comparisons did not reach statistical significance.
   Conclusions. The main conclusion of our study is that there is a direct relationship between environmental temperature increase and the number of patients attended in the hospital emergency department. A relationship could also be observed in regards to humidity. This fact may suggest the need to have suitable medical attendance planning for the hottest and most humid periods.

AB Background. In debates on euthanasia legalization in Belgium, the voices of nurses were scarcely heard. Yet studies have shown that nurses are involved in the caring process surrounding euthanasia. Consequently, they are in a position to offer valuable ideas about this problem. For this reason, the views of these nurses are important because of their palliative expertise and their daily confrontation with dying patients.
   Aim. The aim of this paper is to report a study of the views of palliative care nurses about euthanasia.
   Methods. A grounded theory approach was chosen, and interviews were carried out with a convenience sample of 12 palliative care nurses in Flanders (Belgium). The data were collected between December 2001 and April 2002.
   Findings. The majority of the nurses were not a priori for or against euthanasia, and their views were largely dependent on the situation. What counted was the degree of suffering and available palliative options. Depending on the situation, we noted both resistance and acceptance towards euthanasia. The underlying arguments for resistance included respect for life and belief in the capabilities of palliative care; arguments underlying acceptance included the quality of life and respect for patient autonomy. The nurses commented that working in palliative care had a considerable influence on one's opinion about euthanasia.
   Conclusion. In light of the worldwide debate on euthanasia, it is essential to know how nurses, who are confronted with terminally ill patients every day, think about it. Knowledge of these views can also contribute to a realistic and qualified view on euthanasia itself. This can be enlightening to the personal views of caregivers working in a diverse range of care settings.

AB Purpose Incidence studies reported more end-of-life decisions with possible/certain life-shortening effect (ELDs) among cancer patients than among noncancer patients. These studies did not correct for the different proportions of sudden/unexpected deaths of cancer versus noncancer patients, which could have biased the results. We investigated incidences and characteristics of ELDs among nonsudden cancer and noncancer deaths.
   Methods We sampled 5,005 certificates of all deaths in 2001 (Flanders, Belgium) stratified for ELD likelihood. Questionnaires were mailed to the certifying physicians. Data were corrected for stratification and nonresponse.
   Results The response rate was 59%. Among 2,128 nonsudden deaths included, ELDs occurred in 74% of cancer versus 50% of noncancer patients (P < .001). Symptom alleviation with possible life-shortening effect occurred more frequently among cancer patients (P < .001); nontreatment decisions occurred less frequently (P < .001). The higher incidence of lethal drug use among cancer patients did not hold after correcting for patient age. Half of the cancer patients who died after an ELD were incompetent to make decisions compared with 76% of noncancer patients (P < .001). Discussion with patients and relatives was similar in both groups. In one fifth of all patients the ELD was not discussed.
   Conclusion ELDs are common in nonsudden deaths. The different incidences for symptom alleviation with possible life-shortening effect and nontreatment decisions among cancer versus noncancer patients may be related to differences in dying trajectories and in timely recognition of patient needs. The end-of-life decision-making process is similar for both groups: consultation of patients and relatives can be improved in a significant minority of patients.

TI Cost analysis of medical assistance in dying in Canada
SO CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID OF-LIFE PRACTICES; EUTHANASIA LAW; BELGIUM; TRENDS; SUICIDE
AB BACKGROUND: The legalization of medical assistance in dying will affect health care spending in Canada. Our aim was to determine the potential costs and savings associated with the implementation of medical assistance in dying.
   METHODS: Using published data from the Netherlands and Belgium, where medically assisted death is legal, we estimated that medical assistance in dying will account for 1%-4% of all deaths; 80% of patients will have cancer; 50% of patients will be aged 60-80 years; 55% will be men; 60% of patients will have their lives shortened by 1 month; and 40% of patients will have their lives shortened by 1 week. We combined current mortality data for the Canadian population with recent end-of-life cost data to calculate a predicted range of savings associated with the implementation of medical assistance in dying. We also estimated the direct costs associated with offering medically assisted death, including physician consultations and drug costs.
   RESULTS: Medical assistance in dying could reduce annual health care spending across Canada by between $34.7 million and $138.8 million, exceeding the $1.5-$14.8 million in direct costs associated with its implementation. In sensitivity analyses, we noted that even if the potential savings are overestimated and costs underestimated, the implementation of mdedical assistance in dying will likely remain at least cost neutral.
   INTERPRETATION: Providing medical assistance in dying in Canada should not result in any excess financial burden to the health care system, and could result in substantial savings. Additional data on patients who choose medical assistance in dying in Canada should be collected to enable more precise estimates of the impact of medically assisted death on health care spending and to enable further economic evaluation.

AB The aim of the study was to investigate attitudes of secondary school students towards acceptability of requests by minors for end-of-life decisions (ELDs) with a possible life-shortening effect: non-treatment decisions, potentially life-shortening alleviation of pain and symptoms (APS) and euthanasia.
   A cross-sectional survey was conducted among second and fourth grades students in 20 secondary schools in Flanders, Belgium. An anonymous structured questionnaire was administered to measure attitudes towards acceptability of requests for euthanasia and other ELDs, towards the right to be informed about terminal prognosis and their own desire to be informed.
   In total, 1769 students participated. In case of a terminal patient, 61% found a request for euthanasia acceptable, 60% a request for APS and 69% a request for non-treatment decision, compared with 18% (euthanasia) and 50% (APS) in case of a non-terminal patient. Acceptance was highest among: boys, participants older than 14 years and participants from general as opposed to technical and vocational education. Sixty-six per cent said the parents' opinion not being asked was a circumstance that should hold back a physician from administering a lethal drug. Ninety per cent of participants thought a minor has the right to be informed about terminal prognosis of a disease while 78% would like to be informed themselves.
   Attitudes towards ELD requests varied with case and participant characteristics and type of ELD. The studied adolescents have a clear wish to be informed about terminal prognosis. Physicians and caregivers should adequately involve adolescents in decision making and tailor prognosis-related information to their needs and level of competency.

AB Background In 2002, the euthanasia act came into effect in the Netherlands, which was followed by a slight decrease in the euthanasia frequency. We assessed frequency and characteristics of euthanasia, physician-assisted suicide, and other end-of-life practices in 2010, and assessed trends since 1990.
   Methods In 1990, 1995, 2001, 2005, and 2010 we did nationwide studies of a stratified sample from the death registry of Statistics Netherlands, to which all deaths and causes were reported. We mailed questionnaires to physicians attending these deaths (2010: n=8496 deaths). All cases were weighted to adjust for the stratification procedure and for differences in response rates in relation to the age, sex, marital status, region of residence, and cause and place of death.
   Findings In 2010, of all deaths in the Netherlands, 2.8% (95% CI 2.5-3.2; 475 of 6861) were the result of euthanasia. This rate is higher than the 1.7% (1.5-1.8; 294 of 9965) in 2005, but comparable with those in 2001 and 1995. Distribution of sex, age, and diagnosis was stable between 1990 and 2010. In 2010, 77% (3136 of 4050) of all cases of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide were reported to a review committee (80% [1933 of 2425] in 2005). Ending of life without an explicit patient request in 2010 occurred less often (0.2%; 95% CI 0.1-0.3; 13 of 6861) than in 2005, 2001, 1995, and 1990 (0.8%; 0.6-1.1; 45 of 5197). Continuous deep sedation until death occurred more frequently in 2010 (12.3% [11.6-13.1; 789 of 6861]) than in 2005 (8.2% [7.8-8.6; 521 of 9965]). Of all deaths in 2010, 0.4% (0.3-0.6; 18 of 6861) were the result of the patient's decision to stop eating and drinking to end life; in half of these cases the patient had made a euthanasia request that was not granted.
   Interpretation Our study provides insight in consequences of regulating euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide within the broader context of end-of-life practices. In the Netherlands the euthanasia law resulted in a relatively transparent practice. Although translating these results to other countries is not straightforward, they can inform the debate on legalisation of assisted dying in other countries.

AB Background: Although nurses play an important role in end-of-life care for patients, they are not systematically involved in end-of-life decisions with a possible or certain life-shortening effect (ELDs). Until now we know little about factors relating to the involvement of nurses in these decisions.
   Objective: To explore which patient- and decision-characteristics are related to the consultation of nurses and to the administering of life-ending drugs by nurses in actual ELDs in institutions and home care, as reported by physicians.
   Method: We sampled at random 5005 of all registered deaths in the second half of 2001 - before euthanasia was legalized - in Flanders, Belgium. We mailed anonymous questionnaires to physicians who signed the death certificates and asked them to report on ELDs, including nurses' involvement.
   Results: Response rate was 59% (n = 2950). Physicians reported nurses involved in decision making more often in institutions than at home, and more often in care homes for the elderly than in hospitals (OR 1.70, 95 % CI 1. 15, 2.52). This involvement was more frequently when physicians intended to hasten the patient's death than when they had no such intention (institutions: OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.41, 2.99; home: OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.19, 3.49). In institutions, this involvement was also more likely where patients were of lower rather than higher education (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.49, 5.84). The administering of life-ending drugs by nurses, as reported by physicians was also found more frequently in institutions than at home, and in institutions more frequently with lower rather than higher educated patients (p = .037).
   Conclusions: These findings raise questions about physicians' perception of the nurse's role in ELDs, but also about physicians' skills in interacting with all patients. Education and guidelines for physicians and nurses are needed to optimize good communication and to promote a clearer assignment of responsibilities concerning the execution of those decisions.

AB Much of the literature on health care provider perspectives on medical assistance in dying (MAiD) is focused on the role of the physician, with some literature examining the views of nurses. Some Canadian provinces however, have implemented multidisciplinary approaches to MAiD. As a result, an improved understanding of the experiences of a variety of health care providers in the MAiD process will be important to consider as provincial MAiD plans continue to develop. This scoping review aimed to summarize the existing qualitative literature focused on provider experiences in the MAiD process. Key themes emerged across the literature that were related to the complexity of the MAiD process, the importance of relationships and communication, interprofessional roles and dynamics, and the coping process. The results of this review demonstrate the need for further investigation into the experiences of diverse MAiD providers, especially within the Canadian context.

AB In the context of an European collaborative research project (EURELD), a study on attitudes towards medical end-of-life decisions was conducted among physicians in Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Australia also joined the consortium. A written questionnaire with structured questions was sent to practising physicians from specialties frequently involved in the care of dying patients. 10,139 questionnaires were studied. Response rate was equal to or larger than 50% in all countries except Italy (39%). Apart from general agreement with respect to the alleviation of pain and symptoms with possible life-shortening effect, there was large variation in support-between and within countries-for medical decision that may result in the hastening of death. A principal component factor analysis found that 58% of the variance of the responses is explained by four factors. 'Country' explained the largest part of the variation of the standardized factor scores. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: A growing body of scientific research is suggesting that end-of-life care and decision making may differ between age groups and that elderly patients may be the most vulnerable to exclusion of due care at the end of life. This study investigates age-related disparities in the rate of end-of-life decisions with a possible or certain life shortening effect (ELDs) and in the preceding decision making process in Flanders, Belgium in 2007, where euthanasia was legalised in 2002. Comparing with data from an identical survey in 1998 we also study the plausibility of the 'slippery slope' hypothesis which predicts a rise in the rate of administration of life ending drugs without patient request, especially among elderly patients, in countries where euthanasia is legal.
   Method: We performed a post-mortem survey among physicians certifying a large representative sample (n = 6927) of death certificates in 2007, identical to a 1998 survey. Response rate was 58.4%.
   Results: While the rates of non-treatment decisions (NTD) and administration of life ending drugs withouFWOt explicit request (LAWER) did not differ between age groups, the use of intensified alleviation of pain and symptoms (APS) and euthanasia/assisted suicide (EAS), as well as the proportion of euthanasia requests granted, was bivariately and negatively associated with patient age. Multivariate analysis showed no significant effects of age on ELD rates. Older patients were less often included in decision making for APS and more often deemed lacking in capacity than were younger patients. Comparison with 1998 showed a decrease in the rate of LAWER in all age groups except in the 80+ age group where the rate was stagnant.
   Conclusion: Age is not a determining factor in the rate of end-of-life decisions, but is in decision making as patient inclusion rates decrease with old age. Our results suggest there is a need to focus advance care planning initiatives on elderly patients. The slippery slope hypothesis cannot be confirmed either in general or among older people, as since the euthanasia law fewer LAWER cases were found.

AB A major issue in the care of terminally ill patients is communication and information provision. This paper reports the extent to which physicians in Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland discuss topics relevant to end of life care with terminally ill patients and their relatives (without first informing the patient), and possible associations between physician-specific characteristics and such discussions. Response rates to the postal survey ranged from 39% to 68% (n = 10139). Physicians in most of the countries except Italy in principle, always' discuss issues related to terminal illness with their patients but not with patients' relatives without first informing the patient, unless the relatives ask. Cross-national differences remained strong after controlling for physician characteristics. The majority of physicians appeared to support the principle of patient-centred care to terminally ill patients, consistent with palliative care philosophy and with the law and/or professional guidelines in most of the countries studied.

AB Phenomenological and cultural understandings of recovery from the perspective of individuals who engage in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) are rare. The primary study objective was to understand similarities across three samples in (a) how young people define recovery from NSSI and (b) what they consider helpful approaches taken by parents and professionals to assist their recovery. Using a cross-national sample of young people (n = 98) from Australia (n = 48), Belgium (n = 25) and the United States (n = 25), we assessed their perspectives on NSSI. Consistent across all samples, young people defined recovery as no longer having the urge to self-injure when distressed, often displayed ambivalence about recovery, and reported it was helpful when parents and professionals were calm and understanding. Acceptance of recovery as a process involving relapses may need to be emphasized in NSSI treatment, to ease the pressure young people often place on themselves to stop the behavior outright.

AB Objectives To describe the form and content of ethics policies on euthanasia in Flemish nursing homes and to determine the possible influence of religious affiliation on policy content. Methods Content analysis of euthanasia policy documents. Results Of the 737 nursing homes we contacted, 612 (83%) completed and returned the questionnaire. Of 92 (15%) nursing homes that reported to have a euthanasia policy, 85 (92%) provided a copy of their policy. Nursing homes applied the euthanasia law with additional palliative procedures and interdisciplinary deliberations. More Catholic nursing homes compared to non-Catholic nursing homes did not permit euthanasia. Policies described several phases of the euthanasia care process as well as involvement of caregivers, patients, and relatives; ethical issues; support for caregivers; reporting; and procedures for handling advance directives. Conclusion Our study revealed that euthanasia requests from patients are seriously considered in euthanasia policies of nursing homes, with great attention for palliative care and interdisciplinary cooperation.

AB Background A regulatory signal suggested that sertindole was associated with a 10-fold increased risk of death. This observational study aimed to identify deaths and their causes in patients treated with sertindole.
   Methods Sertindole-treated patients in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Hungary, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom were identified and their vital status ascertained. Eventual cause of death and patient and treatment characteristics were ascertained. A nested case-control study compared on-treatment cardiac or unexplained deaths with randomly selected survivors matched on age and gender for potential risk factors.
   Results Eight thousand six hundred eight patients were identified as having initiated treatment with sertindole, for a total 3819 person-years exposure. Thirty-five had died since (all-cause mortality rate 0.92 per 100 person-years exposed). Of these, 15 (43%) had been previously reported to the regulatory authorities. Eight deaths were suicides, of which 2 (25%) had been previously reported; 11 were cardiac deaths, of which 8 (73%) had been reported. On average, patients who died because of cardiac disorders were older, and patients who committed suicide were younger than the other patients who died. The nested case-control study revealed that patients receiving sertindole were at a higher risk of premature cardiac or unexplained death if they had hypertension or other cardiovascular disorders associated with diabetes or metabolic disorder.
   Conclusion Overall and cardiovascular death rates were similar or lower than those observed in premarketing clinical trials. There was a very high reporting rate of all-cause and cardiovascular deaths that could have contributed to the regulatory alert. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Background: This study estimates the frequency of different end-of-life decisions (ELDs) in medical practice in the UK, compares these with other countries and assesses doctors' views on the adequacy of current UK law. Method: Postal survey of 857 UK medical practitioners using a questionnaire used in other countries. Findings: The proportion of UK deaths involving an ELD were: 1) voluntary euthanasia 0.16% (0-0.36), 2) physician-assisted suicide 0.00%, 3) ending of life without an explicit request from patient 0.33% (0-0.76), 4) alleviation of symptoms with possibly life shortening effect 32.8% (28.1-37.6), 5) non-treatment decisions 30.3% (26.0-34.6). ELDs 1 and 2 were significantly less frequent than in the Netherlands and Australia; ELD 2 was also less frequent than Switzerland. ELD 3 was less frequent than in Belgium and Australia. Comparison of UK and New Zealand general practitioners showed lower rates of ELDs 4 and 5 in the UK. ELD 5 was more common than in most other European countries. A few doctors attending deaths felt UK law had inhibited or interfered with their preferred management of patients (4.6% (3.1-6.1%) of doctors) or that a new law would have facilitated better management (2.6% (1.4-3.8%) of doctors). Interpretation: The lower relative rate of ELDs involving doctor-assisted dying in the UK, and the relatively high rate of non-treatment decisions, suggests a culture of medical, decision making informed by a palliative care philosophy.

AB Background: The aims of this study were to obtain information about the characteristics of requests for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (EAS) and to distinguish among different types of situations that can arise between the request and the physician's decision.
   Methods: All general practitioners in 18 of the 23 Dutch general practitioner districts received a written questionnaire in which they were asked to describe the most recent request for EAS they received.
   Results: A total of 3614 general practitioners responded to the questionnaire (response rate, 60%). Of all explicit requests for EAS, 44% resulted in EAS. In the other cases the patient died before the performance (13%) or finalization of the decision making (13%), the patient withdrew the request (13%), or the physician refused the request (12%). Patients' most prominent symptoms were "feeling bad," "tiredness," and "lack of appetite." The most frequently mentioned reasons for requesting EAS were "pointless suffering," "loss of dignity," and "weakness." The patients' situation met the official requirements for accepted practice best in requests that resulted in EAS and least in refused requests. A lesser degree of competence and less unbearable and hopeless suffering had the strongest associations with the refusal of a request.
   Conclusions: The complexity of EAS decision making is reflected in the fact that besides granting and refusing a request, 3 other situations could be distinguished. The decisions physicians make, the reasons they have for their decisions, and the way they arrived at their decisions seem to be based on patient evaluations. Physicians report compliance with the official requirements for accepted practice.

   EMERGENCY
AB Deliberate self-harm (DSH) is a major public health problem in many countries and varies by age group, gender, and ethnicity. Having engaged in an act of DSH is the strongest predictor of future suicidal behaviour, both non-fatal and fatal. Development and implementation of effective assessment procedures for DSH patients are required in order to assess risk of repetition and prevent repeated suicidal behaviour. In this chapter we present the outcomes of a review of studies addressing the extent of the problem of DSH and repetition, prediction of factors associated with repeated DSH including age, gender, ethnicity, and assessment procedures for DSH patients presenting to hospital emergency departments.
   The extent of the problem of DSH varies across countries, with relatively high rates in the United Kingdom and Belgium and low rates in Scandinavia. DSH rates are consistently higher in females compared to males. However, recent studies in Ireland indicate that rates of repeated DSH are similar for men and women. Factors predicting repeated DSH vary by age (young, adults, older adults) with some overlap. A history of previous DSH is a predictor for repetition in both young people and adults. Even though most national suicide prevention programmes prioritize the implementation of uniform guidelines for the assessment of DSH patients, there is still considerable variation within and across countries with regard to the types of assessment and aftercare offered to DSH patients. A four-question tool (Manchester Self-Harm Rule) is an example of an evidence-based screening tool for identifying risk of repeated suicidal behaviour (non-fatal and fatal) and is recommended for wider implementation.

AB Introduction: Euthanasia because of unbearable mental suffering (UMS euthanasia) has been legal in Belgium since 2002, under certain circumstances that govern careful practice. Despite the legal framework, there are specific difficulties and concerns regarding UMS euthanasia. Mental health nurses are often involved in the process, but little is known about their attitudes towards UMS euthanasia, their role and their knowledge.
   Aim: To determine the attitudes, role and knowledge of mental health nurses regarding UMS euthanasia.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was performed at a convenience sample of four psychiatric hospitals in Belgium (n = 133) as a pilot study. Self-administered questionnaires were provided to mental health nurses.
   Results: Half the nurses in our sample had been involved at least once in the process of UMS euthanasia. A large majority of mental health nurses were supportive of UMS euthanasia. Nurses show differences in attitudes related to the different psychiatric pathologies of the patients, and in whether or not minors are involved. In some cases, they believed that the mental suffering of psychiatric patients can be unbearable and irreversible and that psychiatric patients can be competent to voluntarily request UMS euthanasia. Nurses stated that they have an important role in the UMS euthanasia process, but also demanded more knowledge and clear guidelines to implement the procedure.
   Discussion: Nurses have a key role regarding UMS euthanasia but face several challenges: the recent process, resistance to a multidisciplinary approach by psychiatrists and an unclear role defined by the legal framework. Nurses do not appear to have a common voice on the topic and the development of clear guidelines appears to be essential. Social recovery can offer a way out of an UMS euthanasia request, but it will not always offer a solution.
   Implications for Practice: Sufficient attention must be paid to how mental health nurses can be involved in the process of UMS euthanasia at various levels: bedside practice, healthcare management, education and policy. A form of systematic cooperation between nurses, physicians and patients can contribute to the utmost careful decision-making process needed in these cases. There is a need for proper training in: knowledge of psychiatric pathologies and remaining treatment options; communication skills; the legal framework and all its difficulties; transdisciplinary and multicultural approaches; ethical reflection and how nurses handle their own emotions.

AB IMPORTANCE Euthanasia or assisted suicide (EAS) of psychiatric patients is increasing in some jurisdictions such as Belgium and the Netherlands. However, little is known about the practice, and it remains controversial.
   OBJECTIVES To describe the characteristics of patients receiving EAS for psychiatric conditions and how the practice is regulated in the Netherlands.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This investigation reviewed psychiatric EAS case summaries made available online by the Dutch regional euthanasia review committees as of June 1, 2015. Two senior psychiatrists used directed content analysis to review and code the reports. In total, 66 cases from 2011 to 2014 were reviewed.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Clinical and social characteristics of patients, physician review process of the patients' requests, and the euthanasia review committees' assessments of the physicians' actions.
   RESULTS Of the 66 cases reviewed, 70%(n = 46) werewomen. In total, 32%(n = 21) were 70 years or older, 44%(n = 29) were 50 to 70 years old, and 24%(n = 16) were 30 to 50 years old. Most had chronic, severe conditions, with histories of attempted suicides and psychiatric hospitalizations. Most had personality disorders andwere described as socially isolated or lonely. Depressive disorderswere the primary psychiatric issue in 55% (n = 36) of cases. Other conditions representedwere psychotic, posttraumatic stress or anxiety, somatoform, neurocognitive, and eating disorders, aswell as prolonged grief and autism. Comorbidities with functional impairmentswere common. Forty-one percent (n = 27) of physicians performing EASwere psychiatrists. Twenty-seven percent (n = 18) of patients received the procedure from physicians new to them, 14 of whomwere physicians from the End-of-Life Clinic, a mobile euthanasia clinic. Consultation with other physicianswas extensive, but 11% (n = 7) of cases had no independent psychiatric input, and 24% (n = 16) of cases involved disagreement among consultants. The euthanasia review committees found that one case failed to meet legal due care criteria.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Persons receiving EAS for psychiatric disorders in the Netherlands are mostly women and of diverse ages, with complex and chronic psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial histories. The granting of their EAS requests appears to involve considerable physician judgment, usually involving multiple physicians who do not always agree (sometimes without independent psychiatric input), but the euthanasia review committees generally defer to the judgments of the physicians performing the EAS.

AB Objectives: Continuous sedation until death (CSD), the removal of consciousness of an incurably ill patient until death, has become a controversial practice. Some consider CSD a palliative treatment, whereas others claim that CSD is frequently used with the intention to hasten death. In nursing homes in Flanders, the rate of CSD has tripled over the past decade, whereas legal euthanasia remains a rare practice. This study wants to investigate to what extent CSD is used to hasten death (CSD+) and to identify possible associated factors.
   Design: Nationwide cross-sectional retrospective survey, conducted in 2012.
   Setting: Nursing homes in Flanders, Belgium.
   Participants: Coordinating and advisory physicians of all nursing homes in Flanders (n = 660).
   Measurements: Physician reports of their most recent patient treated with CSD.
   Results: The response rate was 57.3%, and 159 of the 378 responding physicians reported a case of CSD (42.1%). According to the reported intentions involved, 62.2% of these cases were considered CSD- cases (no life-shortening pursued), whereas 37.8% were labeled CSD+ (life-shortening pursued). Physician factors such as experience in end-of-life care, palliative care training, training in sedation, or knowledge of sedation guidelines did not affect the outcome distribution (CSD- or CSD+). In CSD+, the patient has a longer life expectancy, is more competent, is clearly longing for death, and requests for euthanasia more frequently.
   Conclusions: In nursing homes in Flanders, CSD is frequently used to hasten the patient's death. In some cases, CSD can even be considered a substitute for legal euthanasia. (C) 2014 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

AB This paper reports the findings of a survey that investigated whether Flemish Catholic hospitals and nursing homes had developed written ethics policies on euthanasia and how the role of nurses was described in these policies.
   International research shows undeniably that nurses are confronted with patients requesting euthanasia. Euthanasia has been legal in Belgium since 2002 and in Holland since 2001. Because of the vagueness in formal documents and policies on the role of nurses in euthanasia, there is an increasing need to establish institutional ethics policies that clearly describe the role of nurses in the euthanasia process.
   We used a cross-sectional descriptive mail questionnaire to survey the general directors of Catholic hospitals and nursing homes in Belgium (Flanders). Data were collected between October 2003 and February 2004.
   Of the 298 institutions targeted for survey, 81% of hospitals, 62% of nursing homes returned completed questionnaires. Of these, 79% of the hospitals and 30% of the nursing homes had a written ethics policy on euthanasia. The ethics policies of 87% of the hospitals and 77% of the nursing homes explicitly addressed the role of nurses in the euthanasia process. In the majority of hospitals and nursing homes, the ethics policies addressed the conscientious objections of nurses to euthanasia. Most hospitals and nursing homes voluntarily communicated their ethics policies to the nurses they employed.
   The written ethics policies of most Catholic healthcare institutions give explicit attention to the role of nurses in the euthanasia process. However, the meaning and content of the role of nurses, as indicated in these ethics policies, continue to be an issue. Further research is needed to verify how these policies are actually implemented within the institutions and whether they contribute to better support for nurses and to ethical care for patients.

AB In recent years, the European euthanasia debate has become more intense, and the practice was legalized in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. We aimed to determine the current degree of public acceptance of euthanasia across Europe and investigate what factors explain differences.
   Data were derived from the 2008 wave of the European Values Survey (EVS), conducted in 47 European countries (N = 67,786, response rate = 69 %). Acceptance of euthanasia was rated on a 1-10 scale.
   Relatively high acceptance was found in a small cluster of Western European countries, including the three countries that have legalized euthanasia and Denmark, France, Sweden and Spain. In a large part of Europe public acceptance was relatively low to moderate. Comparison with the results of the previous EVS wave (1999) suggests a tendency towards a polarization in Europe, with most of Western Europe becoming more permissive and most of Eastern Europe becoming less permissive.
   There is roughly a West-East division in euthanasia acceptance among the European public, making a pan-European policy approach to the issue difficult.

   NONCANCER PATIENTS; MEDICAL-PRACTICE; NATIONAL-SURVEY; UNITED-STATES;

AB Purpose
   Because of cancer's high symptom burden and specific disease course, patients with cancer are more likely than other patients to face end-of-life decisions that have possible or certain life-shortening effects (ELDs). This study examines the incidence of ELDs in patients with cancer compared with patients without cancer and the trends in ELD incidence from 1998-2007.
   Patients and Methods A nationwide death certificate study in Flanders, Belgium, was conducted in 2007, analogous to one completed in 1998. Physicians who had signed selected death certificates (n = 6,927) were sent a questionnaire.
   Results
   The response rate was 58.4%. Nonsudden deaths were studied. Intensified symptom alleviation occurred more in patients with cancer than in those without (53.8% v 31.7%; P < .001) as did euthanasia (6.8% v 0.9%; P < .001). There was no difference between groups in nontreatment decisions and life-ending acts without patient's explicit request. Patients with cancer were less involved in the end-of-life decision-making process than patients without cancer (69.7% v 83.5%; P = .001). From 1998 to 2007, ELD incidence has increased in patients with cancer (+6.7%) and even more in patients without cancer (+14.9%) because of an increase in intensified symptom alleviation. In patients with cancer, euthanasia rates increased strongly and life-ending acts without the patient's explicit request decreased.
   Conclusion
   The higher ELD incidence in patients with cancer compared with those without is probably related to differences in disease trajectories and access to end-of-life care. During the period from 1998 to 2007, when euthanasia was legalized and palliative care intensified, overall ELDs increased, including those as a result of symptom alleviation and euthanasia, with a decrease in life-ending acts without explicit request.

AB Background Communication with patients on end-of-life decisions is a delicate topic for which there is little guidance.
   Aim To describe the development of a guideline for GPs on end-of-life communication with patients who wish to die at home, in a context where patient autonomy and euthanasia are legally regulated.
   Design of study A three-phase process (generation, elaboration and validation). In the generation phase, literature findings were structured and then prioritsed in a focus group with GPs of a palliative care consultation network. In the elaboration phase, qualitative data on patients' and caregivers' perspectives were gathered through a focus group with next-of-kin, in-depth interviews with terminal patients, and four quality circle sessions with representatives of all constituencies. In the validation phase, the acceptability of the draft guideline was reviewed in bipolar focus groups (GPs-nurses and GPs-specialists). Finally, comments were solicited from experts by mail.
   Setting Primary home care in Belgium.
   Subjects Participants in this study were terminal patients (n = 17), next-of-kin of terminal patients (n = 17), GPs (n = 25), specialists (n = 3), nurses (n = 8), other caregivers (n = 2) and experts (n = 41).
   Results Caregivers and patients expressed a need for a comprehensive guideline on communication in end-of-life decisions. Four major communication themes were prioritised: truth telling; exploration of the patient's wishes regarding the end of life; dealing with disproportionate interventions; and dealing with requests for euthanasia in the terminal phase of life. Additional themes required special attention in the guideline: continuity of care by the GP; communication on forgoing food and fluid; and technical aspects of euthanasia.
   Conclusion It was feasible to develop a guideline by combining the three cornerstones of evidence-based medicine: literature search, patient values and professional experience.

AB Aim. To describe the communication during the euthanasia care process for mentally competent, terminally ill patients in general hospitals in Flanders, as seen from the perspective of the nurse.
   Background. International literature shows that nurses are involved in the care process surrounding euthanasia, regardless of the legal status of euthanasia in the country being studied. In particular, research shows that communication is an important part of good euthanasia care. However, the actual way nurses' communication contributes to the quality of the euthanasia care process remains unclear.
   Design. A Grounded Theory Design was used.
   Methodology. Analysis of 18 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with nurses from nine different hospitals in Flanders (Belgium). The interviews took place during a 20-month period in 2005-2006.
   Results. The euthanasia care process for mentally competent, terminally ill patients in general hospitals in Flanders is a complex and dynamic process, the connecting thread of which is nurses' communication. During this process, nurses perceive that they communicate often and a lot, with various people, in different contexts, in different ways and with various purposes. This communicative process is intensified by the moral and psychological weight of the theme, and its impact on everyone involved, as well as by the relatively short period of time, during which it all takes place.
   Conclusion. This article adds to the growing body of literature on nursing care for patients requesting euthanasia. The findings suggest that for nurses, communication is a key instrument for realising good-quality euthanasia care.
   Relevance to clinical practice. Being the essence of nursing care for patients requesting euthanasia, nurses' communication requires support and guidance on the level of nursing education, professional guidelines and hospital context.

AB Background: Legal provisions in The Netherlands and Belgium currently allow physicians to actively end a patient's life at his or her request under certain conditions. The term that is used for this is "euthanasia." Discussion: The same term, "euthanasia," was used in Germany during the Nazi regime for a program of cleansing the "German nation" in which untold thousands of persons were denied human empathy or medical care and were thereby condemned to death. The medical profession played a leading role in the planning, administration, and supervision of this "euthanasia" program, with a large proportion of German physicians proactively shirking all moral responsibility and ultimately paving the way for the Holocaust. Conclusion: The term "euthanasia" was so abused during the Nazi regime as a camouflage word for murder of selected subpopulations with the willing participation of physicians, we believe that, regardless of the benevolent goals of current euthanasia practices, for historical reasons the term "euthanasia" must not be used with regards to current end-of-life care.

AB Context. Since 2002, the administration of a lethal drug by a physician at the explicit request of the patient has been legal in Belgium. The incidence of euthanasia in Belgium has been studied, but the process and outcomes of euthanasia requests have not been investigated.
   Objectives. To describe which euthanasia requests were granted, withdrawn, and rejected since the enactment of the euthanasia law in terms of the characteristics of the patient, treating physician, and aspects of the consultation with a second physician.
   Methods. A representative sample of 3006 Belgian physicians received a questionnaire investigating their most recent euthanasia request.
   Results. The response rate was 34%. Since 2002, 39% of respondents had received a euthanasia request. Forty-eight percent of requests had been carried out, 5% had been refused, 10% had been withdrawn, and in 23%, the patient had died before euthanasia could be performed. Physicians' characteristics associated with receiving a request were not being religious, caring for a high number of terminally ill patients, and having experience in palliative care. Patient characteristics associated with granting a request were age, having cancer, loss of dignity, having no depression, and suffering without prospect of improvement as a reason for requesting euthanasia. A positive initial position toward the request from the attending physician and positive advice from the second physician also contributed to having a request granted.
   Conclusion. Under the Belgian Act on Euthanasia, about half of the requests are granted. Factors related to the reason for the request, position of the attending physician toward the request, and advice from the second physician influence whether a request is granted or not.

AB Corrosive chemical substance ingestions are a major problem, especially in developing countries, but also in developed countries such as the United States, France, and Belgium. Ingestions may be deliberate as suicide attempts (mostly in adolescents and adults) or accidental (mostly in children). The results can be devastating in terms of individual suffering and disability, but also in terms of resource utilization and costs. In developing countries, outcomes may be worse because of limited medical/surgical resources. Common sequelae include gastrointestinal (GI) tract (esophagus, stomach, pylorus, and duodenum) stricture formation, GI tract perforation, and hemorrhage. Systemic effects may also occur, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), multi-organ system failure, and sepsis. Various interventions in the acute phase to reduce the severity of injury have been attempted, but there are no large controlled clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy. Dilation therapy in various forms is commonly used for the treatment of strictures and a variety of surgical procedures including esophagectomy and delayed replacement may be required in severe corrosive injury cases.

AB Introduction: With the legalization of active euthanasia in the Netherlands and Belgium in recent years, euthanasia has become a subject of discussion again. It is important that physicians, particularly oncologists express their opinion about euthanasia. The aim of this study was to reveal what pneumologists who worked in oncology clinics thought about euthanasia.
   Materials and Method: A questionnaire was distributed to 110 pneumologists and obtained data were analysed with SPSS.
   Results: The mean age of the pneumologists included in the study was 32.90 +/- 7.01 years. Of the pneumologists, 40.8% were against euthanasia and 46.7% believed that euthanasia was performed in Turkey although it was illegal. Thirty-one point five percent of the pneumologists working in oncology clinics and 14.3% of the pneumologists working in clinics other than oncology clinics faced euthanasia requests.
   Conclusion: The opinions of physicians taking care of terminally ill patients on euthanasia and patient rights are very important. Frequent requests for euthanasia and the physicians' belief that euthanasia is performed secretly in Turkey demonstrate that euthanasia should be discussed openly and attitude and approach towards euthanasia should be investigated.

AB This study examines the use of the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument-Second Version (MAYSI-2) for mental health needs among 1643 youngsters in residential welfare/justice institutions in Europe and the USA, identifying gender differences across countries and settings. Overall, the MAYSI-2 appeared to be a reliable instrument among these youngsters, with only some scales falling (slightly) below the threshold of acceptable internal consistency. Girls (vs. boys) in Belgian/USA justice institutions and Swiss mixed welfare/justice institutions displayed higher scores for the angry-irritable, depressed-anxious, somatic complaints, suicide ideation scales. Also, detained girls from Belgium and Switzerland reported higher scores for traumatic experiences. No gender differences were revealed among adolescents in German welfare institutions. Our findings suggest that the MAYSI-2 may serve as a useful mental health screening instrument among youngsters in welfare/justice institutions and that girls in justice institutions and mixed welfare/justice institutions form a particularly vulnerable population with regard to mental health problems.

AB This international comparative study addresses differences between adolescents who engage in deliberate self-harm (DSH) and who receive help following the DSH episode versus those who do not. A standardised self-report questionnaire was completed by Pupils aged 14-17 in Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, The Netherlands, and Norway (n=30532). An act of DSH in the year prior to the study was reported by 1660 participants. Nearly half (48.4%) had not received any help following DSH, 32.8% had received help from their social network only and 18.8% from health services. Except for Hungary, cross-national comparisons revealed remarkably similar findings. Adolescents who had been in contact with health services following DSH reported more often a wish to die, lethal methods, alcohol/drug problems and DSH in the family compared to those who had not. However, those who received no help or help from their social network only were also heavily burdened. (C) 2008 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB Context. Continuous deep sedation (CDS) until death can form an effective part of palliative care. In The Netherlands and Belgium, CDS is sometimes regarded as an alternative to euthanasia, and the involvement of palliative care specialists is low. Provision of CDS through opioids alone is not recommended.
   Objectives. This study investigates the use of CDS in the United Kingdom.
   Methods. A survey of 8,857 doctors, of whom 3,733 (42%) replied, with 2,923 reporting on their last patient who died.
   Results. In total, 18.7% (17.3-20.1) of the doctors attending a dying patient reported the use of CDS. CDS was more likely when patients were younger or were dying of cancer. Specialists in care of the elderly were least. likely to report the use of CDS; doctors in other hospital specialties were most likely to report its use. CDS was associated with a higher rate of requests from patients or relatives for a hastened death and with a greater incidence of other end-of-life decisions containing some intent to end life by the doctor. Doctors supporting legalization of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide, or who were nonreligious, were more likely to report using CDS. There was palliative care team involvement in half of all CDS cases, and prescription of opioids alone for sedation occurred in one-fifth of the cases but was not reported by specialists in palliative care.
   Conclusion. This study provides baseline data for monitoring future trends in the United Kingdom and highlights the need for a fuller understanding of the circumstances in which CDS occurs in particular care settings.

AB Background
   Unbearable suffering is a key criterion in legally granting patients' euthanasia requests in Belgium yet a generally accepted definition of unbearable suffering remains elusive. The ability to understand and assess unbearable suffering is essential, particularly in patients with psychiatric conditions, as the underlying causes of these conditions are not always apparent. To enable research into when and why suffering experiences incite patients with psychiatric conditions to request euthanasia, and to help explore preventive and curative perspectives, the development of an assessment instrument is needed.
   Aims
   To improve the cognitive validity of a large initial item pool used to assess the nature and extent of suffering in patients with psychiatric conditions.
   Method
   Cognitive validity was established via two rounds of cognitive interviews with patients with psychiatric conditions with (n = 9) and without (n = 5) euthanasia requests.
   Results
   During the first round of cognitive interviews, a variety of issues relating to content, form and language were reported and aspects that were missing were identified. During the second round, the items that had been amended were perceived as sufficiently easily to understand, sensitive to delicate nuances, comprehensive and easy to answer accurately. Neither research topic nor method were perceived as emotionally strenuous, but instead as positive, relevant, comforting and valuable.
   Conclusions This research resulted in an item pool that covers the concept of suffering more adequately and comprehensively. Further research endeavours should examine potential differences in suffering experiences over time and in patients with psychiatric conditions with and without euthanasia requests. The appreciation patients demonstrated regarding their ability to speak extensively and openly about their suffering and wish to die further supports the need to allow patients to speak freely and honestly during consultations.

AB Background: Precise knowledge of the epidemiology of suicidality provides necessary information for designing prevention programs. The aims of the present study were to investigate the prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideas and attempts in the general population of Europe.
   Methods: The European Study on the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMED) is a cross-sectional household survey carried out in a probability representative sample of non-institutionalised adults (aged 18 years or older) of six European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain). The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0) was administered to 21,425 individuals.
   Results: Lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation was 7.8% and of suicidal attempts 1.3%. Being women, younger and divorced or widowed were associated with a higher prevalence of suicide ideation and attempts. Psychiatric diagnoses were strongly related to suicidality. Among them, major depressive episode (Rate ratio 2.9 for lifetime ideas and 4.8 for lifetime attempts), dysthymia (RR 2.0 and 1.6), GAD (RR 1.8 and 2.3 for lifetime), PTSD (RR 1.9 and 2.0) and alcohol dependence (RR 1.7 and 2.5) were the most important. Population attributable risks for lifetime suicidal attempt was 28% for major depression.
   Limitations: Information about suicidal ideas and attempts was self reported, psychiatric diagnoses were made using fully structured lay interviews rather than clinician-administered interviews.
   Conclusions: In spite of meaningful country variation in prevalence, risk factors for suicidality are consistent in the European countries. Population prevention programmes should focus on early diagnosis and treatment of major depression and alcohol abuse and in those individuals with recent appearance of suicidal ideas.

AB Background: End-of-life policies are hotly debated in many countries, with international evidence frequently used to support or oppose legal reforms. Existing reviews are limited by their focus on specific practices or selected jurisdictions. The objective is to review international time trends in end-of-life practices.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review of empirical studies on medical end-of-life practices, including treatment withdrawal, the use of drugs for symptom management, and the intentional use of lethal drugs. A search strategy was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Sociological Abstracts, PAIS International, Worldwide Political Science Abstracts, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences and CINAHL. We included studies that described physicians' actual practices and estimated annual frequency at the jurisdictional level. End-of-life practice frequencies were analyzed for variations over time, using logit regression.
   Results: Among 8183 references, 39 jurisdiction-wide surveys conducted between 1990 and 2010 were identified. Of those, 22 surveys used sufficiently similar research methods to allow further statistical analysis. Significant differences were found across surveys in the frequency of treatment withdrawal, use of opiates or sedatives and the intentional use of lethal drugs (X-2 > 1000, p < 0.001 for all). Regression analyses showed increased use of opiates and sedatives over time (p < 0.001), which could reflect more intense symptom management at the end of life, or increase in these drugs to intentionally cause patients' death.
   Conclusion: The use of opiates and sedatives appears to have significantly increased over time between 1990 and 2010. Better distinction between practices with different legal status is required to properly interpret the policy significance of these changes. Research on the effects of public policies should take a comprehensive look at trends in end-of-life practice patterns and their associations with policy changes.

ID ASSISTED SUICIDE
AB Euthanasia was decriminalized in Quebec in December 2015, and Canada-wide in June 2016. Both the Provincial and Federal legislation have limited the right to medical assistance in dying (MAID) to end-of-life cases; which makes MAID inaccessible to most patients solely suffering from psychiatric illness. While some end-stage anorexia nervosa or elderly patients may meet the end-of-life criterion because of their medical comorbidities or their age (Kelly et al., 2003), repeated suicide attempts or psychotic disorganization would not qualify since they would not be seen as elements of an illness leading to a foreseeable "natural death" (Canada, 2016). This is in contradiction to other jurisdictions, such as Belgium and the Netherlands as well as the eligibility criteria stated in the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Carter v. Canada (Supreme Court of Canada, 2015). Here we analyze three cases of patients who presented to a psychiatric emergency department and requested MAID for psychiatric reasons. While none of the patients were eligible for MAID under Canadian law, we find that their demographics match closely that of patients granted MAID for psychiatric reasons in jurisdictions where that practice is allowed. Based on these cases, we comment on potentially negative consequences that may come from decriminalizing MAID for psychiatric reasons (such as an increased assessment burden on ED staff) and potentially positive consequences (such as encouraging suffering patients who had not consulted to seek care). While it is by no means our intention to take a political or moral stand on this important issue, or to conclusively weigh the negatives and positives of allowing MAID for psychiatric reasons, we do stress the importance of an active voice for psychiatry in this ongoing public debate.

AB There is evidence to suggest that both psychological characteristics and stressful life events are contributory factors in deliberate self-harm among young people. These links, and the possibility of a dose-response relationship between self-harm and both psychological health and life events, were investigated in the context of a seven-country school-based study. Over 30,000, mainly 15 and 16 year olds, completed anonymous questionnaires at secondary schools in Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and Australia. Pupils were asked to report on thoughts and episodes of self-harm, complete scales on depression and anxiety symptoms, impulsivity and self-esteem and indicate stressful events in their lives. Level and frequency of self-harm was judged according to whether they had thought about harming themselves or reported single or multiple self-harm episodes. Multinomial logistic regression assessed the extent to which psychological characteristics and stressful life events distinguished between adolescents with different self-harm histories. Increased severity of self-harm history was associated with greater depression, anxiety and impulsivity and lower self-esteem and an increased prevalence of all ten life event categories. Female gender, higher impulsivity and experiencing the suicide or self-harm of others, physical or sexual abuse and worries about sexual orientation independently differentiated single-episode self-harmers from adolescents with self-harm thoughts only. Female gender, higher depression, lower self-esteem, experiencing the suicide or self-harm of others, and trouble with the police independently distinguished multiple- from single-episode self-harmers. The findings reinforce the importance of psychological characteristics and stressful life events in adolescent self-harm but nonetheless suggest that some factors are more likely than others to be implicated.

AB Background This paper reports the findings of an analytical comparison of several macro indicators collected routinely from institutional sources in Europe. Methods We carried out a review of macro indicators capable of providing a synthetic description of mental health status and the availability of psychiatric care in European countries. These were collected routinely from sources such as WHO, OECD, EUROSTAT, and IMS. The evaluation of temporal trends in each nation permits subsequent comparisons between countries. Results In all European countries, a decreased trend of suicides was observed in the period 1980 - 2000, with the exception of Ireland and ( partially) of Spain. In Ireland, the increased trend was particularly strong, with a high risk in young and adult males. Portugal and Greece had respectively the highest and the lowest rates of undetermined causes of death. Most countries that were high consumers of alcohol in the initial period of observation had a rate above the national mean until 1980, after which consumption decreased. Most nations that were low consumers in 1960 had rates below the mean until 1980, when the rates progressively increased. However, a general decrease of alcohol-related deaths was apparent in all countries. Mortality associated with mental disorder increased, most clearly during the mid 1980s. The number of psychiatrists per 100,000 inhabitants ranged from 3.6 in Spain to 17.5 in Finland; of child psychiatrists, from 0.9 in Germany to 5.1 in Portugal. Psychiatric beds ranged from 0.4 per 1,000 inhabitants in Italy and Spain to 1.3 in Ireland. Nine countries showed a trend towards a reduction in psychiatric beds, whilst in a further five countries no change was observed. Rates of long-stay patients varied from 9.5 in the UK to 84 in Belgium, with a generally decreasing trend. The use of outpatient facilities differed markedly between countries, although there was a general increase over time. Official data were scarce in relation to the sale of psychotropic drugs. IMS data indicated increasing consumption in all European countries for antidepressant and antipsychotic medication. Conclusions The official data resources available for European countries seem to indicate some discrepancies, probably relating to methods of recording. Better co-ordination in the collection of data about mental health status in the European Union and an improvement of the quality in available services is needed.

AB We investigated the drugs used in the alleviation of pain and symptoms (APS) with a possible life-shortening side effect in six European countries' end-of-life care. We sent mail questionnaires to physicians who signed a representative sample of death certificates in each country. APS with a possible life-shortening effect occurred from 19 % of all deaths in Italy to 26 % in Denmark. Physicians usually administered opioids (from 76 % of APS cases in Italy to 96 % in The Netherlands), but the type of opioids and administration Practice differed markedly between countries. The doses of opioids given in the last 24 hours also varied signifcantly and were usually lower than 300 mg oral morphine equivalent (from 83 % of cases in Belgium to 93 % in Sweden). The highly variable results bring into question whether existing guidelines for pain relief were applied appropriately and to what extent unfounded concerns about the possible life-shortening effect of opioids resulted in less than optimal Symptom management in end-of-life care.

TI When unbearable suffering incites psychiatric patients to request
   euthanasia: qualitative study
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID ASSISTED SUICIDE; PERSPECTIVES; NETHERLANDS; BELGIUM; LAW
AB Background
   The concept of 'unbearable suffering' is central to legislation governing whether euthanasia requests may be granted, but remains insufficiently understood, especially in relation to psychiatric patients.
   Aims
   To provide insights into the suffering experiences of psychiatric patients who have made a request for euthanasia.
   Method
   Testimonials from 26 psychiatric patients who requested euthanasia were analysed using QualiCoder software.
   Results
   Five domains of suffering were identified: medical, intrapersonal, interpersonal, societal and existential. Hopelessness was confirmed to be an important contributor. The lengthy process of applying for euthanasia was a cause of suffering and added to experienced hopelessness, whereas encountering physicians who took requests seriously could offer new perspectives on treatment
   Conclusions
   The development of measurement instruments to assess the nature and extent of suffering as experienced by psychiatric patients could help both patients and physicians to better navigate the complicated and sensitive process of evaluating requests in a humane and competent way. Some correlates of suffering (such as low income) indicate the need for a broad medical, societal and political debate on how to reduce the burden of financial and socioeconomic difficulties and inequalities in order to reduce patients' desire for euthanasia. Euthanasia should never be seen (or used) as a means of resolving societal failures.

AB Purpose of reviewThe aim of this review was to present and comment on recent data published on palliative sedation in palliative and end-of-life care. Palliative sedation is a medical procedure used to deal with the refractory symptoms occurring in the advanced stages of cancer. It has clinical, nursing, relational and ethical implications, making it a highly sensitive issue.Recent findingsOver the last 12 months, a number of authors have published interesting new findings on different areas of palliative sedation, that is prevalence, indications, monitoring, duration and choice of drugs. In particular, a clear definition of palliative sedation and of its more pronounced form, deep continuous sedation (DCS), has emerged. It has been confirmed that, when performed in the correct way and with the right aims, palliative sedation does not have a detrimental impact on survival.SummaryRecent findings confirm that palliative sedation is an integral part of a medical palliative care approach and is needed in certain clinical situations. It is a legitimate clinical practice from any ethical point of view. While oncologists should have a basic knowledge of the procedure, its in depth study is a core competency for palliative care physicians.

AB Background: Belgium's law on euthanasia allows only physicians to perform the act. We investigated the involvement of nurses in the decision-making and in the preparation and administration of life-ending drugs with a patient's explicit request (euthanasia) or without an explicit request. We also examined factors associated with these deaths.
   Methods: In 2007, we surveyed 1678 nurses who, in an earlier survey, had reported caring for one or more patients who received a potential life-ending decision within the year before the survey. Eligible nurses were surveyed about their most recent case.
   Results: The response rate was 76%. Overall, 128 nurses reported having cared for a patient who received eutha-nasia and 120 for a patient who received life-ending drugs without his or her explicit request. Respectively, 64% (75/117) and 69% (81/118) of these nurses were involved in the physician's decision-making process. More often this entailed an exchange of information on the patient's condition or the patient's or relatives' wishes (45% [34/117] and 51% [41/118] than sharing in the decision-making (24% [18/117] and 31% [25/118]. The life-ending drugs were administered by the nurse in 12% of the cases of euthanasia, as compared with 45% of the cases of assisted death without an explicit request. In both types of assisted death, the nurses acted on the physician's orders but mostly in the physician's absence. Factors significantly associated with a nurse administering the life-ending drugs included being a male nurse working in a hospital (odds ratio [OR] 40.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 7.37-217.79) and the patient being over 80 years old (OR 5.57, 95% CI 1.98-15.70).
   Interpretation: By administering the life-ending drugs in some of the cases of euthanasia, and in almost half of the cases without an explicit request from the patient, the nurses in our study operated beyond the legal margins of their profession.

AB Background: About half of the persons who die in developed countries are very old (aged 80 years or older) and this proportion is still rising. In general, there is little information available concerning the circumstances and quality of the end of life of this group. Objective: This study aims (1) to describe the incidence and characteristics of medical end-of-life decisions with a possible or certain life-shortening effect (ELDs) and terminal sedation among very old patients who died nonsuddenly, (2) to describe the characteristics of the preceding decision-making process, and (3) to compare this with the deaths of younger patients. Methods: A sample of 5,005 death certificates was selected from all deaths in Flanders (Belgium) in the second half of 2001 (before euthanasia was legalized). Questionnaires were mailed to the certifying physicians. Results: Response rate was 58.9%. An ELD was made for 53.6% very old (aged 80+) patients who died nonsuddenly (vs. 63.3% for the younger patients). Use of life-ending drugs occurred among 1.1% (six times less frequently than in younger patients), with no euthanasia cases, pain and symptom alleviation with a possible life-shortening effect among 27.3% (two times less frequently), and withholding or withdrawing life-prolonging treatments among 25.2% (slightly more frequently). Terminal sedation occurred among 6.9% of the cases, two times less frequently than for the younger patients. ELDs were not often discussed with very old patients. Among competent patients this was less than compared with younger patients. Conclusion: ELDs are less common for very old than for younger patients. Physicians seem to have a more reluctant attitude towards the use of lethal drugs, terminal sedation and participation in decision-making when dealing with very old patients. Advance care planning should increase the involvement of very old competent and noncompetent patients in end-of-life decision-making. Copyright (c) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Context. According to guideline recommendations, barbiturates and neuromuscular relaxants are the recommended drugs for euthanasia.
   Objectives. To describe changes over time in drugs used to perform euthanasia and differences in case characteristics according to the drugs used.
   Methods. Repeated population-based mortality follow-back study among physicians attending a large representative sample of deaths in 1998, 2007, and 2013 in Flanders, Belgium.
   Results. In 1998, we identified 25 euthanasia cases (1.2% of all deaths), 142 cases in 2007 (2.0% of all deaths), and 349 cases in 2013 (4.6% of all deaths). Use of recommended drugs to perform euthanasia increased from 11.9% of euthanasia cases in 1998 to 55.3% in 2007 and 66.8% in 2013 (P < 0.001). In 2013, cases with recommended drugs compared with nonrecommended drugs more often involved requests expressed both orally and in writing (86.8%/14.1%; P < 0.001), consultation with colleague physicians (93.8%/69.1%; P < 0.001), and administration in the presence of another physician (98.3%/54.3%; P < 0.001), and were more often self-labeled by physicians as euthanasia (95.5%/0.9%; P < 0.001) and reported to the euthanasia review committee (92.3%/3.8%; P < 0.001). Between 2007 and 2013, physicians consistently labeled cases in which nonrecommended drugs were used as palliative sedation (72.8%/78.4%; P = 0.791) or alleviation of pain and symptoms (13.2%/15.0%; P > 0.999).
   Conclusion. Physicians in Flanders are increasingly using the recommended drugs for euthanasia. This suggests that guidelines and training regarding the conduct and pharmacological aspects of euthanasia may have had important effects on the practice of euthanasia. However, the declining but persisting use of nonrecommended drugs requires further attention. (C) 2018 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The Voluntary Assisted Dying Act (Vic) will commence operation on 19 June 2019. Doctors were highly visible in the debate which informed the recent law reform process, and Victorian legislators relied considerably on the diverse views of the medical profession. It is important to pay attention to the role played by doctors in the legalisation of assisted dying in Victoria, not only because the current political environment suggests that further reforms may be likely in other Australian jurisdictions, but also because doctors' knowledge and expertise visibly contributed to the outcome of that process in Victoria. This article aims to map the participation of doctors in the recent law reform process to analyse how their professional attributes positioned them in the Victorian assisted dying space. It is suggested that doctors were afforded a place in law reform because of the routine acceptance of doctors as knowledge keepers in matters of life and death and an acknowledgment of the integral role of medical expertise in the legislation. A textual analysis of the Hansard record of the Victorian debate reflects that individual practitioner advocacy for legalisation prevailed over opposition by the national branch of the Australian Medical Association in the deliberations of parliamentarians.

AB The ethical (un) acceptability of euthanasia for severe physical suffering is undoubtedly one of the most controversial topics of our time. Perhaps even more controversial is the debate on whether euthanasia could also be justified for cases of mental suffering, which we understand as suffering without an underlying diagnosable condition or cause. Various widely debated cases from The Netherlands and Belgium have made this issue more than just a philosophical exercise. In this chapter we look into the ethical aspects of seeing mental suffering as a possibly allowable indication for euthanasia. First, we clarify the important concepts-such as 'physical suffering', 'psychological suffering', and 'mental suffering'-that are used throughout this chapter. Next we focus on the following key question: can one consistently claim a right to request euthanasia for patients with diagnosable physical or psychological sources of suffering, while denying the same right to patients with mental suffering without medical diagnosis? We do so by identifying various reasons that could be given to justify why mental suffering is relevantly different from physical or psychological suffering. We will discuss the claims that mental suffering should be seen as special as it: (1) diminishes a person's competence; (2) is a different type of suffering; (3) is undiagnosable; and (4) can never be proven to be incurable. We conclude with two important reasons to remain cautious about allowing euthanasia in cases of mental suffering.

AB Many physicians and patients do not realize that it is legally and medically possible to donate organs after euthanasia. The combination of euthanasia and organ donation is not a common practice, often limited by the patient's underlying pathology, but nevertheless has been performed >40 times in Belgium and the Netherlands since 2005. In anticipation of patients' requests for organ donation after euthanasia and contributing to awareness of the possibility of this combination among general practitioners and medical specialists, the Maastricht University Medical Center and the Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam have developed a multidisciplinary practical manual in which the organizational steps regarding this combined procedure are described and explained. This practical manual lists the various criteria to fulfill and the rules and regulations the different stakeholders involved need to comply with to meet all due diligence requirements. Although an ethicist was involved in writing this paper, this report is not specifically meant to comprehensively address the ethical issues surrounding the topic. This paper is focused on the operational aspects of the protocol.
   After carefully reflecting on ethical and logistic considerations, the authors argue that organ donation after euthanasia is feasible.

AB Background: Requests for physician-assisted death (PAD) in patients with cognitive impairment are complex and require careful consideration. Of particular difficulty is determination of whether the request is voluntary and well considered. Results: Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) are both legal in The Netherlands, Luxemburg, Colombia, and Canada. Euthanasia is legal in Belgium, while PAS is legal in Switzerland and Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont, and California (USA). Upon a PAD request, evaluation of the capacity to consent medical treatment is relevant for the decision-making process, while evaluation of testamentary capacity is appropriate before an advance euthanasia directive is written. Anosognosia assessment throughout the Alzheimer's disease continuum provides essential and relevant information regarding the voluntary and well-considered nature of the PAD request; meanwhile, early assessment of hypernosognosia or subjective cognitive decline assists in formulation of a clinical prognosis. Furthermore, the assessment of physical and psychological suffering should incorporate verbal and nonverbal cues as well as consideration of the psychosocial factors that might affect due care criteria. Conclusion: The clinical approach to a PAD request should consider the legal framework and the decision-making capacity, assess memory deficit awareness and the perception of suffering, and evaluate mental competency when considered pertinent.

AB The debate about euthanasia continues worldwide, with nurses' attitudes becoming increasingly more important. The aim of this study is to investigate gender differences among nurses' perceptions of attitudes toward euthanasia. A nonprobability quantitative, cross-sectional design was carried out among nurses working at a tertiary care center. Data were collected through self-reported questionnaires at their work place. Significant differences were found between men and women to the items such as "Fear of death shows differences due to religious beliefs" (chi(2) = 10.550, p < 0.05), "If patient wants euthanasia, nutrition support should be stopped" (chi(2) = 12.209, p < 0.05), "CPR should not be applied in case of sudden respiration and heart stop" (chi(2) = 9.591, p < 0.05), and "burden for relatives to take care of a patient who is in terminal period and who will die" (chi(2) = 9.069, p < 0.05). The present study depicts that gender plays an important role in euthanasia; hence, the researchers strongly suggest that there is an urgent need to draft uniform guidelines after wide consultation with all the stake holders regarding nurses' role in taking care of patients who request euthanasia, to face these situations effectively and competently within professional boundaries.

AB Background: The age at death from different diseases is a good indicator of their relative importance at the population level.
   Methods: Use was made of the mortality data provided by the Flemish Community of Belgium on all deaths, WHO ICD-10 coded, for the period 2000-2004.
   Results: The mean age at death increases with time for nearly all diseases and for both sexes. This increase is highly significant for all-cause mortality. Deaths due to accidents and suicide cause the greatest loss of life expectancy for the individuals concerned. From the disease groups liver cirrhosis, lung and breast cancer have the greatest impact on life expectancy. Women die at higher ages than men for all diseases except lung cancer. They have a highly significantly greater toss of life expectancy due to lung cancer than men. The mean age at death during the period considered increases markedly for breast cancer (p<0.0001). This suggests an increased efficiency of both treatment and prevention of breast cancer.
   Conclusions: Studying the mean age at death from different pathologies is an efficient and rapid way to evaluate the relative importance of different diseases and the changes in the health situation in a given population. Mortality continues to decline in Flanders.

AB Continuous deep sedation (CDS) is sometimes used to treat refractory symptoms in terminally ill patients. The aim of this paper was to estimate the frequency and characteristics of CDS in six European countries: Belgium, Denmark, Italy, The Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. Deaths reported to death registries were sampled and the reporting doctors received a mailed questionnaire about the medical decision making that preceded the death of the patient. The total number of deaths studied was 20,480. The response rate ranged between 44 % (Italy) and 75 % (The Netherlands). Of all deaths, CDS was applied in 2.5 % in Denmark and up to 8.5 % in Italy. Of all patients receiving CDS, 35 % (Italy) and up to 64 % (Denmark and The Netherlands) did not receive artificial nutrition or hydration. Patients who received CDS were more often male, younger than 80 years old, more likely to have had cancer, and died more often in a hospital compared to nonsudden deaths without CDS. The high variability of frequency and characteristics of CDS in the studied European countries points out the importance of medical education and scientific debate on this issue.

AB Background: Nurses have an important role in caring for terminally ill patients. They are also often involved in euthanasia. However, little is known about their attitudes towards it.
   Objectives: To investigate on a nationwide level nurses' attitudes towards euthanasia and towards their role in euthanasia, and the possible relation with their socio-demographic and work-related characteristics.
   Design and participants: A cross-sectional design was used. In 2007, a questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of 6000 of the registered nurses in Flanders, Belgium. Response rate was 62.5% and after exclusion of nurses who had no experiences in patient care, a sample of 3321 nurses remained.
   Methods: Attitudes were attained by means of statements. Logistic regression models were fitted for each statement to determine the relation between socio-demographic and work-related characteristics and nurses' attitudes.
   Results: Ninety-two percent of nurses accepted euthanasia for terminally ill patients with extreme uncontrollable pain or other distress, 57% accepted using lethal drugs for patients who suffer unbearably and are not capable of making decisions. Seventy percent believed that euthanasia requests would be avoided by the use of optimal palliative care. Ninety percent of nurses thought nurses should be involved in euthanasia decision-making. Although 61% did not agree that administering lethal drugs could be a task nurses are allowed to perform, 43% would be prepared to do so. Religious nurses were less accepting of euthanasia than non-religious nurses. Older nurses believed more in palliative care preventing euthanasia requests and in putting the patient into a coma until death as an alternative to euthanasia. Female and home care nurses were less inclined than male and hospital and nursing home nurses to administer lethal drugs.
   Conclusions: There is broad support among nurses for euthanasia for terminally ill patients and for their involvement in consultancy in case of euthanasia requests. There is, however, uncertainty about their role in the performance of euthanasia. Guidelines could help to make their role more transparent, taking into account the differences between health care settings. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Social and economic policies are inextricably linked with population health outcomes in Europe, yet few datasets are able to fully explore and compare this relationship across European countries. The European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey aims to address this gap using microdata on income, living conditions and health. EU-SILC contains both cross-sectional and longitudinal elements, with nationally representative samples of individuals 16 years and older in 28 European Union member states as well as Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. Data collection began in 2003 in Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Greece, Luxembourg and Austria, with subsequent expansion across Europe. By 2011, all 28 EU member states, plus three others, were included in the dataset. Although EU-SILC is administered by Eurostat, the data are output-harmonized so that countries are required to collect specified data items but are free to determine sampling strategies for data collection purposes. EU-SILC covers approximately 500 000 European residents for its cross-sectional survey annually. Whereas aggregated data from EU-SILC are publicly available [http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/income-and-living-conditions/data/main-tables], microdata are only available to research organizations subject to approval by Eurostat. Please refer to [http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/microdata/eu_silc] for further information regarding microdata access.

AB Background: Mental health problems in college and their associations with academic performance are not well understood. The main aim of this study was to investigate to what extent mental health problems are associated with academic functioning.
   Methods: As part of the World Mental Health Surveys International College Student project, 12-month mental health problems among freshmen (N=4921) was assessed in an e-survey of students at KU Leuven University in Leuven, Belgium. The associations of mental health problems with academic functioning (expressed in terms of academic year percentage [or AYP] and grade point average [GPA]) were examined across academic departments.
   Results: Approximately one in three freshman reports mental health problems in the past year, with internalizing and externalizing problems both associated with reduced academic functioning (2.9-4.7% AYP reduction, corresponding to 0.2-0.3 GPA reduction). The association of externalizing problems with individual-level academic functioning was significantly higher in academic departments with comparatively low average academic functioning.
   Limitations: Limited sample size precluded further investigation of interactions between department-level and student-level variables. No information was available on freshman secondary school academic performance.
   Conclusions: Mental health problems are common in college freshman, and clearly associated with lower academic functioning. Additional research is needed to examine the potentially causal nature of this association, and, if so, whether interventions aimed at treating mental health problems might improve academic performance.

AB Objective: Public opinion and professional organisations dominate the euthanasia debate, and there is a need to understand the opinions of people confronted with euthanasia. The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients and their GPs talk about euthanasia, and if so, how they communicate about this.
   Methods: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were held with 20 GPs and 30 of their patients in primary care in the Netherlands, where euthanasia is legalised. The patients had a life expectancy of less than 6 months, and cancer, heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as underlying disease.
   Results: Many patients did not communicate about euthanasia with their GP. Neither the patient nor the GP were clear in formulating their expectations concerning future decision making.
   Conclusion: The initial patient-GP communication consisted of an exchange of opinions about situations in which euthanasia would be desirable. GPs had different opinions about who should initiate communication, and found it difficult to judge the right moment to talk.
   Practice implications: It is essential to pay attention to education in communication about dying and euthanasia and to train the GPs to gain insight in the patient's end-of-life preferences, and to direct care at the best possible quality of life.

AB Background: Despite the significant role of nurses in end-of-life care, their attitudes towards euthanasia are under-represented both in the current literature and the controversial debate that is ongoing in several countries.
   Research questions: What are the attitudes towards euthanasia among Finnish nurses? Which characteristics are associated with those attitudes?
   Research design: Cross-sectional web-based survey.
   Participants and research context: A total of 1003 nurses recruited via the members' bulletin of the Finnish Nurses Association and social media.
   Ethical considerations: Ethical approval was obtained from the Committee on Research Ethics of the university to which the authors were affiliated.
   Findings: The majority (74.3%) of the participants would accept euthanasia as part of Finnish healthcare, and 61.8% considered that Finland would benefit from a law permitting euthanasia. Most of the nurses (89.9%) thought that a person must have the right to decide on his or her own death; 77.4% of them considered it likely that they would themselves make a request for euthanasia in certain situations.
   Discussion: The value of self-determination and the ability to choose the moment and manner of one's death are emphasized in the nurses' attitudes towards euthanasia.
   Conclusion: A continuous dialogue about euthanasia and nurses' shared values is crucial due to the conflict between nurses' attitudes and current ethical guidelines on nursing.

ID OF-LIFE PRACTICES; PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; NETHERLANDS; BELGIUM;
   DECISIONS; TRENDS
AB The article examines the so-called slippery slope argument (SSA) against the legalization of active voluntary euthanasia (AVE). According to the SSA, by legalizing AVE, the least morally controversial type of euthanasia, we will take the first step onto a slippery slope and inevitably end up in the moral abyss of widespread abuse and violations of the rights of the weakest and most vulnerable patients. In the first part of the paper, empirical evidence to the contrary is presented and analyzed: None of the forecasted regrettable trends can be elicited from the body of existing statistical data. Accordingly, we have no good reason to believe either that we already are, or are sooner or later going to be, sliding into a moral abyss. A related question is then considered: Would it not be wiser and safer to stick to the status quo and preserve the existing legal ban on AVE even if the risk of its abuse is uncertain and may well turn out to be relatively low? It is argued that such an appeal to precautionary reasoning fails to justify an outright legal ban on AVE for at least two reasons: (i) it grossly underestimates the hidden moral costs of current legal arrangements (competent terminal patients suffer both disrespect for their autonomous will and deprivation of the good of a timely death) and (ii) the ban is both too inefficient and disproportionate to qualify as a reasonable measure of precaution.

AB Background: Nursing students who stop their education before obtaining their degree (dropout) is a common problem. Scientific studies on factors influencing academic outcomes amongst nursing students are sparse and difficult to transfer to undergraduate nursing students.
   Objectives: The objective of the present study was to explore in undergraduate nursing students the influence of socio-demographic factors, resilience and stress reducing activities on the academic outcomes: intention to leave, academic success and dropout.
   Design: A cross-sectional design was used.
   Participants/Setting: 554 participants form 6 nursing colleges in the Antwerp region in Belgium were included.
   Methods: Data were collected using SurveyMonkeya. In a second phase, these data were linked to the academic outcomes from the school administration.
   Results: Lower resilience, more destructive and less positive stress reducing activities, having committed a suicide attempt in the past, studying in a densely populated area and starting as a regular student was significantly influenced with higher intentions to leave. Higher resilience significantly predicted academic success. Finally, students that dropped out showed a significantly lower resilience.
   Conclusion: Resilience was the only factor that significantly predicted the three academic outcomes: intention to leave, academic success and dropout. Known predictors of academic outcomes such as young age, gender, previous education, nationality and caring for family members were not confirmed in this study. To study in depth dropout within the undergraduate nursing course, conducting a cohort study might be recommended.

AB The relationship between weather conditions and psychiatric disorders has been a continuous subject of speculation due to contradictory findings. This study attempts to further clarify this relationship by focussing on specific conditions such as panic attacks and non-panic anxiety in relation to specific meteorological variables. All psychiatric emergencies attended at a general hospital in Barcelona (Spain) during 2002 with anxiety as main complaint were classified as panic or non-panic anxiety according to strict independent and retrospective criteria. Both groups were assessed and compared with meteorological data (wind speed and direction, daily rainfall, temperature, humidity and solar radiation). Seasons and weekend days were also included as independent variables. Non-parametric statistics were used throughout since most variables do not follow a normal distribution. Logistic regression models were applied to predict days with and without the clinical condition. Episodes of panic were three times more common with the poniente wind (hot wind), twice less often with rainfall, and one and a half times more common in autumn than in other seasons. These three trends (hot wind, rainfall and autumn) were accumulative for panic episodes in a logistic regression formula. Significant reduction of episodes on weekends was found only for non-panic episodes. Panic attacks, unlike other anxiety episodes, in a psychiatric emergency department in Barcelona seem to show significant meteorotropism. Assessing specific disorders instead of overall emergencies or other variables of a more general quality could shed new light on the relationship between weather conditions and behaviour.

AB Background: In this study we investigated (a) to what extent physicians have experience with performing a range of end-of-life decisions (ELDs), (b) if they have no experience with performing an ELD, would they be willing to do so under certain conditions and (c) which background characteristics are associated with having experience with/or being willing to make such ELDs.
   Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was sent to 16,486 physicians from specialities in which death is common: Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland.
   Results: The response rate differed between countries (39-68%). The experience of foregoing life-sustaining treatment ranged between 37% and 86%: intensifying the alleviation of pain or other symptoms while taking into account possible hastening of death between 57% and 95%, and experience with deep sedation until death between 12% and 46%. Receiving a request for hastening death differed between 34% and 71%, and intentionally hastening death on the explicit request of a patient between 1% and 56%.
   Conclusion: There are differences between countries in experiences with ELDs, in willingness to perform ELDs and in receiving requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. Foregoing treatment and intensifying alleviation of pain and symptoms are practiced and accepted by most physicians in all countries. Physicians with training in palliative care are more inclined to perform ELDs, as are those who attend to higher numbers of terminal patients. Thus, this seems not to be only a matter of opportunity, but also a matter of attitude.

AB Objectives Comorbidity is a common feature of mental disorders. However, needs assessment surveys focus largely on individual disorders rather than on comorbidity even though the latter is more important for predicting suicidal thoughts and behaviors. In the current report, we take a step beyond this conventional approach by presenting data on the prevalence and correlates (sociodemographic factors, college-related factors, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors) of the main multivariate profiles of common comorbid Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV disorders among students participating in the first phase of the World Health Organization World Mental Health International College Student initiative. Method A web-based mental health survey was administered to first year students in 19 colleges across eight countries (Australia, Belgium, Germany, Mexico, Northern Ireland, South Africa, Spain, United States; 45.5% pooled response rate) to screen for seven common DSM-IV mental disorders: major depression, mania/hypomania, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, alcohol use disorder, and drug use disorder. We focus on the 14,348 respondents who provided complete data; 38.4% screened positive for at least one 12-month disorder. Results Multivariate disorder profiles were detected using latent class analysis (LCA). The least common class (C1; 1.9% of students) was made up of students with high comorbidity (four or more disorders, the majority including mania/hypomania). The remaining 12-month cases had profiles of internalizing-externalizing comorbidity (C2; 5.8%), internalizing comorbidity (C3; 14.6%), and pure disorders (C4; 16.1%). The 1.9% of students in C1 had much higher prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors than other students. Specifically, 15.4% of students in C1 made a suicide attempt in the 12 months before the survey compared with 1.3-2.6% of students with disorders in C2-4, 0.2% of students with lifetime disorders but no 12-month disorders (C5), and 0.1% of students with no lifetime disorders (C6). Conclusions In line with prior research, comorbid mental disorders were common; however, sociodemographic correlates of LCA profiles were modest. The high level of comorbidity underscores the need to develop and test transdiagnostic approaches for treatment in college students.

TI Euthanasia requests, procedures and outcomes for 100 Belgian patients
   suffering from psychiatric disorders: a retrospective, descriptive study
SO BMJ OPEN
LA English
DT Article
AB Objectives: To identify patterns in euthanasia requests and practices relating to psychiatric patients; to generate recommendations for future research.
   Design: Retrospective analysis of data obtained through medical file review.
   Setting: Outpatient psychiatric clinical setting in the Dutch-speaking region of Belgium, between October 2007 and December 2011; follow-up at the end of December 2012.
   Participants: 100 consecutive psychiatric patients requesting euthanasia based on psychological suffering associated with psychiatric disorders (77 women, 23 men; mean age 47 years; age range 21-80 years).
   Main outcome measures: Patient sociodemographic characteristics; diagnoses; decisions on euthanasia requests; circumstances of euthanasia procedures; patient outcomes at follow-up.
   Results: Most patients had been referred for psychiatric counselling by their physician (n=55) or by LEIF (Life End Information Forum) (n=36). 90 patients had >1 disorder; the most frequent diagnoses were depression (n=58) and personality disorder (n=50). 38 patients required further testing and/or treatment, including 13 specifically tested for autism spectrum disorder (ASD); 12 received an ASD diagnosis (all Asperger syndrome). In total, 48 of the euthanasia requests were accepted and 35 were carried out. Of the 13 remaining patients whose requests were accepted, 8 postponed or cancelled the procedure, because simply having this option gave them enough peace of mind to continue living. In December 2012, 43 patients had died, including 35 by euthanasia; others died by suicide (6), palliative sedation (1) and anorexia nervosa (1).
   Conclusions: Depression and personality disorders are the most common diagnoses in psychiatric patients requesting euthanasia, with Asperger syndrome representing a neglected disease burden. Further research is needed, especially prospective quantitative and qualitative studies, to obtain a better understanding of patients with psychiatric disorders who request euthanasia due to unbearable psychological suffering.

AB Background This study aimed to examine prevalence and risk factors of deliberate self-harm in Dutch and Dutch-speaking Belgian adolescents. Method A cross sectional survey using an anonymous self report questionnaire was performed in both countries. Data on 4,431 Belgian and 4,458 Dutch 15 16 year-old school pupils were analyzed. Results Results showed a significant difference between the two countries indicating that lifetime and past year prevalence of deliberate self-harm were both 2.8 times higher in Belgian adolescents than in Dutch adolescents. Further analyses identified differences in the prevalence of factors associated with deliberate self-harm, with Belgian adolescents showing significant higher scores on anxiety, less problem-oriented coping and more common use of alcohol and soft drugs. Belgian adolescents were also at higher risk for the experience of several life events in the previous year and before that such as conflicts with peers, parents and partner, being bullied at school or exposure to suicidal behavior in family and friends. In addition, Belgian adolescents showed less communication with family or teachers about their problems and difficulties. Conclusions The results of the study suggest that the increased risk of deliberate self-harm among Belgian adolescents may be associated with an increased reporting of several important life events and with additional ineffective problem-solving such as less problem-oriented coping, more substance use and less communication about their problems. These results support the assumption that sociocultural aspects of nations can influence the risk of deliberate self-harm and are important to consider when developing prevention strategies.

AB Cyberbullying is associated with negative mental health outcomes including adolescent suicidal ideation. This requires effective and accessible preventive efforts. Healthy lifestyles are factors adolescents themselves can modify that may lower their risk of suicidal ideation. The aim of this study was to examine associations between physical activity, (outdoor) sport participation, a healthy diet, higher sleep duration and low levels of smoking and alcohol use, and suicidal ideation when faced with cyberbullying. A cross-sectional survey was administered in 2014-2015 to 1037 adolescents (12-18 years, M age = 15; 50% girls) in Flanders, Belgium. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess direct effects of cyberbullying involvement (victim, perpetrator, bystander) on suicidal ideation, and interaction effects between cyberbullying involvement, healthy lifestyles and suicidal ideation. Results showed that cyberbullying victimization, perpetration and bystanding were associated with higher suicidal ideation, but that the association with cyberbullying perpetration disappeared when corrected for other cyberbullying involvement forms. More physical activity, sleeping longer, more often taking a healthy diet and lower levels of smoking were associated with lower suicidal ideation. Some associations of healthy lifestyles with suicidal ideation disappeared at higher levels of cyberbullying involvement. Low alcohol consumption and (outdoor) sport participation were not associated with suicidal ideation, and sport participation was even associated with higher suicidal ideation at low levels of cyberbullying involvement. These findings suggest a novel approach to suicide prevention may be warranted, by strengthening healthy lifestyles as factors that adolescents themselves can modify to increase their resilience and reduce suicidal ideation.

TI Attitudes of Psychiatric Nurses about the Request for Euthanasia on the
   Basis of Unbearable Mental Suffering(UMS)
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; PALLIATIVE CARE; INVOLVEMENT
AB Introduction
   When psychiatric patients express a wish for euthanasia, this should first and foremost be interpreted as a cry for help. Due to their close day-to-day relationship, psychiatric nurses may play an important and central role in responding to such requests. However, little is known about nurses' attitudes towards euthanasia motivated by unbearable mental suffering.
   Objectives
   The aim of this study was to provide insight into the attitudes and actions taken by psychiatric nurses when confronted with a patient's euthanasia request based on unbearable mental suffering (UMS).
   Method
   A questionnaire was sent to 11 psychiatric hospitals in the Flemish part of Belgium.
   Results
   The overall response rate was 70% (N = 627). Psychiatric nurses were frequently confronted with a request for euthanasia, either directly (N = 329, 53%) or through a colleague (N = 427, 69%). A majority (N = 536, 84%) did not object to euthanasia in a psychiatrically ill population with UMS. Confounding factors were the psychiatric diagnosis and the type of ward where the nurses were working. Most participants acknowledged a lack of knowledge and skills to adequately address the euthanasia request (N = 434, 71%). Nearly unanimously (N = 618, 99%), study participants indicated that dealing with euthanasia requests and other end-of-life issues should be part of the formal training of nurses.
   Conclusion
   The results highlight the need for ethically sound and comprehensive provision of care. Psychiatric nurses play an important role in dealing with the complex issue of requests for euthanasia. There is also a need for education, training and clear guidelines on the level of health care organizations.

AB Study objective The epidemiology, management and cost of emergency department (ED) visits for deliberate self-poisoning (DSP) are described.
   Methods In a retrospective study, the medical records of all DSP patients older than 16 years, who presented to the ED from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2009, were reviewed.
   Results 312 episodes of DSP were included, accounting for 0.6% of all ED visits. 190 patients were women, with a female to male ratio of 1.56:1. Mean patient age was 37 years. More than 60% (n=190) of DSP patients were <40 years of age. Most patients presented to the ED between 18:00 and 23:00. A single drug was ingested in 39% (n=121) of patients. Alcohol was co-ingested by 36% of patients who were mostly middle-aged men. Of the overdoses, 50.8% were due to benzodiazepines, 23.2% were due to antidepressants and 16.4% were due to antipsychotics. Two-thirds of patients were treated with oral activated charcoal and 89% were seen by a psychiatrist. Nearly 90% of patients were admitted to the ED observation ward, with a mean length of stay of 16.7 h. The estimated total cost was (sic); 266 134.89, with an average of (sic); 872.57 per patient.
   Conclusion Self-poisoning cases in Belgium are grossly similar to those in other Western countries. Supportive treatment alone should be considered in the majority of patients presenting with oral drug overdose. Overall, DSP leads to a significant financial burden on the community.

AB As euthanasia has become a widely debated issue in many Western countries, hospitals and nursing homes especially are increasingly being confronted with this ethically sensitive societal issue. The focus of this paper is how healthcare institutions can deal with euthanasia requests on an organizational level by means of a written institutional ethics policy. The general aim is to make a critical analysis whether these policies can be considered as organizational-ethical instruments that support healthcare institutions to take their institutional responsibility for dealing with euthanasia requests. By means of an interpretative analysis, we conducted a process of reinterpretation of results of former Belgian empirical studies on written institutional ethics policies on euthanasia in dialogue with the existing international literature. The study findings revealed that legal regulations, ethical and care-oriented aspects strongly affected the development, the content, and the impact of written institutional ethics policies on euthanasia. Hence, these three cornerstones-law, care and ethics-constituted the basis for the empirical-based organizational-ethical framework for written institutional ethics policies on euthanasia that is presented in this paper. However, having a euthanasia policy does not automatically lead to more legal transparency, or to a more professional and ethical care practice. The study findings suggest that the development and implementation of an ethics policy on euthanasia as an organizational-ethical instrument should be considered as a dynamic process. Administrators and ethics committees must take responsibility to actively create an ethical climate supporting care providers who have to deal with ethical dilemmas in their practice.

AB OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to investigate the attitudes of adolescent cancer survivors toward end-of-life decisions with life-shortening effects, including nontreatment decisions (NTDs), intensified alleviation of pain and symptoms (APS), and euthanasia, and the influence of illness experience on these attitudes.
   METHODS: Adolescent cancer survivors were interviewed with a structured questionnaire using hypothetical case descriptions. The results were compared with a study of 1769 adolescents without experience of chronic illness.
   RESULTS: Eighty-three adolescents, 11 to 18 years of age, were interviewed. In terminal situations, 70% to 90% found requests for NTDs acceptable, 84% requests for APS, and 57% to 64% requests for euthanasia. Requests for end-of-life decisions were less acceptable in non-terminal situations, where 28% found requests for NTDs acceptable, 39% to 47% requests for APS, and 11% to 21% requests for euthanasia. Frequently cited reasons for holding back physicians from administering a lethal drug to a child were the child not being well informed about his or her condition (92%) and the parents' opinion not being asked (92%). Compared with adolescents without experience with chronic illness, cancer survivors were more accepting toward requests for NTDs and APS in terminal situations.
   CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent cancer survivors, like other adolescents, want to be involved in medical decision-making at the end of life. They value autonomous decision-making, without excluding parents from the process. The experience of living through a life-threatening illness can alter adolescents' attitudes toward requests for NTDs and APS. Pediatrics 2009; 124: e1142-e1148

AB The present study examines reasons for adolescent deliberate self-harm. A cross-sectional survey using an anonymous self-report questionnaire was carried out in seven countries (Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway). Data on 30,477 school pupils between the ages of 14-17 were analysed. Past year and lifetime deliberate self-harm were assessed, along with the self-reported reasons for deliberate self-harm. The results showed that 'wanted to get relief from a terrible state of mind' and 'wanted to die' were most commonly reported. Principal component analysis indicated two underlying dimensions in the reasons for deliberate self-harm, i.e. a cry of pain motive and/or a cry for help motive. The majority of self-harmers reported at least one cry of pain motive ('to die', 'to punish myself', and 'to get relief from a terrible state of mind') and an additional cry for help motive ('to show how desperate I was feeling', to frighten someone', 'to get my own back on someone', 'to find out whether someone really loved me', and 'to get some attention'). Females reported more reasons than males. Only females showed an age difference, with girls aged 16-17 more frequently reporting a cry for help motive. There was considerable consistency in choice of motives across countries and genders. Systematic assessment of the reasons for deliberate self-harm can help clinicians to better understand the meaning of self harming behaviour, select appropriate treatment, suggest alternative coping strategies, and hopefully prevent future suicidal behaviour.

AB Objective: To establish the role of psychiatrists and mental disorder in assisted dying practices in countries and states where such practices are legal. Methods: The authors reviewed the Assisted Dying Acts and official statistical reports from Belgium, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, and the states of Washington and Oregon in the USA. The data extracted related to the role of psychiatrists in assisted dying practices, and the relevance of capacity, 'suffering', and mental disorder. Results: A psychiatry referral is recommended or required by all countries and states in certain circumstances. These circumstances include mental disorder 'impairing judgement' in Oregon and Washington, and cases of exclusive mental disorder in European countries. 'Exclusive tnental disorder' refers to those with a mental disorder (e.g., major depression) who apply for assisted dying in the absence of any terminal physical illness. Capacity/competence and necessary suffering must be present. On average, 5.4% (range 4.2%-6.7%) of applicants see a psychiatrist. Patients with exclusive mental disorder can apply for assisted dying in European countries but not in Oregon and Washington; actual figures are low. Conclusions: No country has a blanket policy of mandatory psychiatric review but the specialty contributes in circumstances of exclusive mental disorder or when there is doubt regarding capacity and sound judgement. The absence of a mandatory role for psychiatrists means that reversible psychopathology may be missed. As a result, the patient's decision to end his/her life may be more informed by treatable mental disorder than by his/her lifelong preferences. (Psychosomatics 2012; 53:319-326)

AB Background: We wanted to examine how the acceptance of euthanasia among the general public in Western Europe has changed in the last decades, and we wanted to look for possible explanations. Methods: We analysed data from the European Values Surveys, held in 1981, 1990, and 1999-2000 in 12 West European countries. In each country, representative samples of the general public were interviewed using the same structured questionnaire in all countries. Euthanasia was explained in the questionnaires as 'terminating the life of the incurably sick'. Results: A total of 46 199 respondents participated in the surveys. A significant increase in acceptance of euthanasia could be observed in all countries except (West) Germany. While the average increase in euthanasia acceptance was 22%, the increase was particularly obvious in Belgium, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. Although changes in several characteristics of respondents, such as decrease in religious beliefs, rising belief in the right to self-determination, and (to a lesser extent) rise in levels of education, were associated with growing acceptance of euthanasia, they could only partly explain the increase of euthanasia acceptance over the years. Conclusions: An increase of euthanasia acceptance among the general public took place over the last two decades in almost all West European countries, possibly indicating a growing support for personal autonomy regarding medical end-of-life decisions. If this trend continues, it is likely to increase the public and political debate about the (legal) regulation of euthanasia under certain conditions of careful medical practice in several West European countries.

AB Substancial crop losses occur in each year due to attacks by insect pests or microbial pathogens, the magnitude of which is so great that farmers unable to cope up with the losses and in despair resorted to suicides. Genetic engineering promises to have an enormous impact on the improvement of crop species. Gene transplants can rapidly accelerate development of disease and insect resistant plants. Progress in engineering insect resistance in transgenic plants has been achieved through the expression of the insect toxin gene of Bacillus thuringiensis in plants. The parasporal protein crystals produced as spores by this bacterium have a natural insecticidal effect. Experiments have shown that the region essential for toxicity resides in the N-terminal portion of the protein extending approximately from aminoacid 29 to aminoacid 610. Although disease resistant plants were developed first by a Belgium Biotechnology company in tobacco, now a number of other plants like tomato and cotton for different insect species. The Dept. of Biotechnology India had given permission to US based multinational Monsanto company to test 'Bt' cotton seeds of Bell guard resistance to perfect the technology after field trials which is still in the laboratory stage. Permissin has been given for field trials in different states of India including Andhra Pradesh. Consequently there was tremendous amount of commotion, public protests, destruction of cotton fields in AP and Karnataka fearing that terminator gene blocks germination after one season and this is considered lethal and posed a global threat to farmers, biodiversity, food and ecological security. The pros and cons of development of genetically altered terminator seed for boll guard disase of cotton, its utility in crop improvement, the undesirable side effects, economic and social aspects of the problem are discussed.

AB Objectives To estimate the rate of reporting of euthanasia cases to the Federal Control and Evaluation Committee and to compare the characteristics of reported and unreported cases of euthanasia.
   Design Cross sectional analysis.
   Setting Flanders, Belgium. Participants A stratified at random sample was drawn of people who died between 1 June 2007 and 30 November 2007. The certifying physician of each death was sent a questionnaire on end of life decision making in the death concerned.
   Main outcome measures The rate of euthanasia cases reported to the Federal Control and Evaluation Committee; physicians' reasons for not reporting cases of euthanasia; the relation between reporting and non-reporting and the characteristics of the physician and patient; the time by which life was shortened according to the physician; the labelling of the end of life decision by the physician involved; and differences in characteristics of due care between reported and unreported euthanasia cases.
   Results The survey response rate was 58.4% (3623/6202 eligible cases). The estimated total number of cases of euthanasia in Flanders in 2007 was 1040 (95% CI 970 to 1109), thus the incidence of euthanasia was estimated as 1.9% of all deaths (95% CI 1.6% to 2.3%). Approximately half (549/1040 (52.8%, 95% CI 43.9% to 60.5%)) of all estimated cases of euthanasia were reported to the Federal Control and Evaluation Committee. Physicians who perceived their case as euthanasia reported it in 93.1% (67/72) of cases. Cases of euthanasia were reported less often when the time by which life was shortened was less than one week compared with when the perceived life shortening was greater (37.3% v 74.1%; P<0.001). Unreported cases were generally dealt with less carefully than reported cases: a written request for euthanasia was more often absent (87.7% v 17.6% verbal request only; P<0.001), other physicians and caregivers specialised in palliative care were consulted less often (54.6% v 97.5%; 33.0% v 63.9%; P<0.001 for both), the life ending act was more often performed with opioids or sedatives (92.1% v 4.4%; P<0.001), and the drugs were more often administered by a nurse (41.3% v 0.0%; P<0.001).
   Conclusions One out of two euthanasia cases is reported to the Federal Control and Evaluation Committee. Most non-reporting physicians do not perceive their act as euthanasia. Countries debating legalisation of euthanasia should simultaneously consider developing a policy facilitating the due care and reporting obligations of physicians.

AB In recent years, the world has been rocked repeatedly by terrorist attacks. Arguably, the most remarkable were: the series of four coordinated suicide plane attacks on September 11, 2001 on buildings in New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, USA; and the recent series of two coordinated attacks in Brussels (Belgium), on March 22, 2016, involving two bombings at the departure hall of Brussels International Airport and a bombing at Maalbeek Metro Station located near the European Commission headquarters in the center of Brussels.
   This statement paper deals with different aspects of hospital policy and disaster response planning that interface with terrorism. Research shows that the availability of necessary equipment and facilities (eg, personal protective clothing, decontamination rooms, antidotes, and anti-viral drugs) in hospitals clearly is insufficient. Emergency teams are insufficiently prepared: adequate and repetitive training remain necessary.
   Unfortunately, there are many examples of health care workers and physicians or hospitals being targeted in both political or religious conflicts and wars. Many health workers were kidnapped and/or killed by insurgents of various ideology. Attacks on hospitals also could cause long-term effects: hospital units could be unavailable for a long time and replacing staff could take several months, further compounding hospital operations. Both physical and psychological (eg, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) after-effects of a terrorist attack can be detrimental to health care services. On the other hand, physicians and other hospital employees have shown to be involved in terrorism. As data show that some offenders had a previous history with the location of the terror incident, the possibility of hospitals or other health care services being targeted by insiders is discussed.
   The purpose of this report was to consider how past terrorist incidents can inform current hospital preparedness and disaster response planning.

AB Recent epidemiologic studies of modern air pollution show statistically significant relationships between fluctuations of daily nontrauma mortality and fluctuations of daily ambient particulate mailer (PM) levels at low concentrations. A review of historic smoke-fog (smog) episodes (Meuse Valley, Belgium; Donora, PA; London, UK) was conducted to seek common characteristics of victims of higher concentrations of ambient PM to help identify a susceptible cohort for an effect at lower ambient PILI concentrations. The Meuse Valley episode investigation (Firket, 1931) did nor detail the age and sex of the victims, so we obtained complete death certificates from ail rile Belgian villages in the area over the period of the smog (December 1-7, 1930), and these data on gender and age are reported here for the first time. The results show similar to 50% excess male death rate (36 male, 25 female) consistent with the previously reported excess male deaths in both rile Donora Fog (15 male, 5 female) and the London Fog (autopsied cases; 419 male, 287 female). in ail three episodes, mortality was predominantly amongst the aged, and most of those autopsied presented with preexisting cardiopulmonary lesions. Because the genders, ages, and smoking habits of the populations at risk were unrecorded, ive are unable to adjust for an expectation of more aged females and higher male smoking rates. However, recent studies of PM and mortality have found no statistically significant different risks for smokers and nonsmokers (Pope et ai., 1995). We present data on other causes of death that also have a 50%; male excess death rate. We test an X-linkage generic model that explains the similar to 50% excess male death rate using total U.S. infant mortality data and data on suicides by gas in Paris, and the model cannot De rejected as a reasonable fit. The findings of this study support the hypothesis that males are genetically more susceptible to the effects of ambient PM exposures.

AB Context. Since the legalization of euthanasia, physicians in Belgium may, under certain conditions, administer life-ending drugs at the explicit request of a patient.
   Objectives. To study the attitudes of Belgian physicians toward the use of life-ending drugs and euthanasia law, factors predicting attitudes, and factors predicting whether a physician has ever performed euthanasia.
   Methods. In 2009, we sent a questionnaire to a representative sample of 3006 Belgian physicians who, because of their specialty, were likely to be involved in the care of the dying.
   Results. Response rate was 34%. Ninety percent of physicians studied were accepting of euthanasia for terminal patients who had extreme uncontrollable pain/symptoms. Sixty-six percent agreed that the euthanasia law contributes to the carefulness of physicians' end-of-life behavior; 10% agreed that the law impedes the development of palliative care. Religious beliefs and geographic region were strong determinants of attitude. Training in palliative care did not influence attitudes regarding euthanasia, but trained physicians were less likely to agree that the euthanasia law impedes the development of palliative care than were nontrained physicians. One in five physicians had performed euthanasia; they were more likely to be nonreligious, older, specialist, trained in palliative care, and to have had more experience in treating the dying.
   Conclusion. Most physicians studied support euthanasia for terminal patients with extreme uncontrollable pain/symptoms and agree that euthanasia can be part of good end-of-life care. Although physicians had little involvement in the process of legalizing euthanasia, they now generally endorse the euthanasia law. J Pain Symptom Manage 2011; 41: 580-593.

AB Objective: College entrance may be a strategically well-placed "point of capture" for detecting late adolescents with suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). However, a clear epidemiological picture of STB among incoming college students is lacking. We present the first cross-national data on prevalence as well as socio-demographic and college-related correlates for STB among first-year college students.
   Method: Web-based self-report surveys were obtained from 13,984 first-year students (response rate 45.5%) across 19 colleges in 8 countries (Australia, Belgium, Germany, Mexico, Northern Ireland, South Africa, Spain, and the United States).
   Results: Lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts was 32.7%, 17.5%, and 4.3%, respectively. The 12-month prevalence was 17.2%, 8.8%, and 1.0%, respectively. About three-fourths of STB cases had onset before the age of 16 years (Q3 = 15.8), with persistence figures in the range of 41% to 53%. About one-half (53.4%) of lifetime ideators transitioned to a suicide plan; 22.1% of lifetime planners transitioned to an attempt. Attempts among lifetime ideators without plan were less frequent (3.1%). Significant correlates of lifetime STB were cross-nationally consistent and generally modest in effect size (median adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.7). Nonheterosexual orientation (aOR range 3.3-7.9) and heterosexual orientation with some same-sex attraction (aOR range 1.9-2.3) were the strongest correlates of STB, and of transitioning from ideation to plans and/or attempts (aOR range 1.6-6.1).
   Conclusion: The distribution of STB in first-year students is widespread, and relatively independent of socio-demographic risk profile. Multivariate risk algorithms based on a high number of risk factors are indicated to efficiently link high-risk status with effective preventive interventions.

AB Background: Strongly marked ideological positions on the impact of palliative care and limited hard data plague the debate on physician-assisted death.
   Methods: A national cross-sectional study on the requests to hasten death (RHD) was conducted among 789 French palliative care organisations. Data were collected for all patients with RHD encountered during year 2010. Data on patients' characteristics, medical, psychological and social context, symptoms, nature of palliative management, patient's evolution and palliative care team's interpretation of the request were obtained.
   Findings: A majority of centres responded and 342 teams provided descriptions of 783 RHD, 476 by a patient, 258 by relatives or close friends and 49 by the nursing staff. Cancer was the most frequent pathology (72%) and 68% of the patients had entered terminal stage. Patients rarely appeared with uncontrolled pain (3.7%), but had difficulties with feeding (65%), moving (54%), excretion (49%), or were cachectic (39%); 31% were considered to be anxio-depressive; 79% did not give physical reasons for their request; 37% of RHD were maintained and 24% fluctuated despite provision of regular follow-up by a palliative care team to 83% of all cases; 68% of patients died within a month; the interpretation of RHD by the staff was a wish for relief (69%), patient's inextricable situation (44%), actual desire not to continue living (36%) or to be helped to die (30%).
   Interpretation: The large number of described cases provides, for the first time, comprehensive hard data on the evolution of RHDs in a country that has not legalised euthanasia. Whatever the way RHD are expressed, they are frequently maintained despite adequate palliative care with suitable control of pain and psychological support by specialists. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

DT Article
DE substance abuse treatment; Therapeutic Community; assessment; treatment
   planning; qualitative research; VACT
AB This article describes the different phases of the development and implementation of the Videotaped Addiction Challenge Tool (VACT, initially termed the Video Addiction Challenge Test). This instrument employs a video depicting the 'average life-story' of a resident of a Therapeutic Community for substance abusers. The video film is used as a clinical method for assessment and individual treatment planning, and as a research instrument that gives care-givers a deeper insight into the residents' personal characteristics and treatment requirements at any given moment in the Therapeutic Community. The article reports the results of administering the VACT to 38 residents (31 male and 7 female) at the De Kiem Therapeutic Community in Belgium. Detailed description of the procedure and its principles assures reliability and makes accurate reproduction possible. The validity of the instrument was tested by comparing, characteristic by characteristic, the results of the VACT, life-story and social anamnesis. The correspondence between the VACT and the life-story was 94% and between the VACT and the social anamnesis, 98%. The VACT has also contributed new information not measured by other instruments. Content analysis of this information shows that TC residents are characterised by negative communication between parents, negative communication with father, an unhappy childhood, child maltreatment or abuse, and relational problems due to drug abuse. Residents reported feelings of inferiority and suicidal thoughts and/or suicide attempts. Many new residents also reported sexually related problems such as abortion, sexual abuse, prostitution and shyness. There were no specific female problems; men reported sexual abuse as often as women. The implementation of this new instrument leads to a more methodical approach. It is, however, also more time consuming and can be a problem for staff who tend to give priority to immediate action and direct problem-solving.

AB In the last decade, the number of patients continuously deeply sedated until death increased up to fourfold. The reasons for this increase remain unclear.
   To identify socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of sedated patients, and concurrent possibly life-shortening medical end-of-life decisions.
   Cross-sectional death certificate study in German-speaking Switzerland in 2001 and 2013.
   Non-sudden and expected deaths (2001: N = 2281, 2013: N = 2256) based on a random sample of death certificates and followed by an anonymous survey on end-of-life practices among attending physicians.
   Physicians' reported proportion of patients continuously deeply sedated until death, socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, and possibly life-shortening medical end-of life decisions.
   In 2013, physicians sedated four times more patients continuously until death (6.7% in 2001; 24.5.5% in 2013). Four out of five sedated patients died in hospitals, outside specialized palliative care units, or in nursing homes. Sedation was more likely among patients younger than 65 (odds ratio 2.24, 95% CI 1.6 to 3.2) and those dying in specialized palliative care (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.8) or in hospitals (1.7, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.3). Forgoing life-prolonging treatment with the explicit intention to hasten or not to postpone death combined with intensified alleviation of symptoms was very strongly associated with continuous deep sedation (OR 6.8, 95% CI 4.7 to 9.8).
   In Swiss clinical practice, continuously deeply sedated patients predominantly died outside specialized palliative care. The increasing trend over time appears to be related to changes in medical end-of-life practice rather than to patient's clinical characteristics.

AB Context. The debate on the decriminalization of active assistance in dying is still a topical issue in many countries where it is regarded as homicide. Despite the prohibition, some physicians say they have used drugs to intentionally end a patient's life.
   Objectives. To provide some empirical grounding for the ongoing debate.
   Methods. Using data from the End-of-Life in France survey (a representative sample of 15,000 deaths that occurred in December 2009, questionnaires completed anonymously by the physicians who had certified the deaths), we selected all the cases where the physician had used one or more drugs to intentionally end a patient's life and compared the decisions and decision-making process with the conditions imposed by the French law for decisions to withhold or withdraw life-supporting treatments and by the Belgian law on euthanasia.
   Results. Of the 36 cases analyzed, four situations seemed to be deliberate acts after explicit requests from the patients, and only two seemed to fulfill the eligibility and due care conditions of the Belgian euthanasia law. Decisions made without any discussion with patients were quite common, and we observed inadequate labeling, frequent signs of ambivalence (artificial feeding and hydration not withdrawn, types of drug used), and little interprofessional consultation. Where the patient had requested euthanasia, the emotional burden on the physician was heavy.
   Conclusion. These findings underscore the pressing need for a clarification of the concepts involved among health professionals, patients, and society at large, and better training and support for physicians.

AB Clozapine is an antipsychotic with superior efficacy in treatment refractory patients, and has unique anti-suicidal properties and a low propensity to cause extrapyramidal side-effects. Despite these advantages, clozapine utilization is low. This can in part be explained by a number of potentially lethal side effects of clozapine. Next to psychiatrists nurses play a crucial role in the long-term management of patients with schizophrenia. It is therefore important that nurses know, inform and monitor patients about the specific side-effects of clozapine. A recent study of psychiatrists published in 2011 has shown that there was a gap in the knowledge about side-effects of clozapine. The knowledge about side-effects of clozapine in nurses has never been studied. This cross-sectional study evaluated the knowledge base regarding the safety of clozapine, and its potential mediators, of psychiatric nurses in 3 psychiatric hospitals in Belgium with a specifically developed questionnaire based on the literature and expert opinion (3 clozapine experts). A total of 85 nurses completed the questionnaire. The mean total score was 6.1 of a potential maximum score of 18. Only 3 of the 18 multiple choice knowledge questions were answered correctly by more than 50% of nurses. Only 24.9% of participants passed the test (>50% correct answers). Nurses working on psychosis units were more likely to pass the test (xx.y% vs yy.z%, p = 0.0124). There was a trend that nurses with a lower nursing diploma were more likely to fail the test (p = 0.0561). Our study clearly identifies a large gap in the basic knowledge of psychiatric nurses about clozapine and its side-effects. Knowledge could be increased by more emphasis on the topic in nurse's training curricula as well as targeted onsite training. Only 23.5% of participants indicate that there was sufficient information in their basic nursing training. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   SLIPPERY-SLOPE; GENERALIZED EXPECTANCIES; CULTURAL-FACTORS; ATTITUDES;
   BELGIUM; CARE; HEALTH
AB Background: This study tests how various kinds of trust impact attitudes toward euthanasia among the general public. The indication that trust might have an impact on euthanasia attitudes is based on the slippery slope argument, which asserts that allowing euthanasia might lead to abuses and involuntary deaths. Adopting this argument usually leads to less positive attitudes towards euthanasia. Tying in with this, it is assumed here that greater trust diminishes such slippery slope fears, and thereby increases euthanasia acceptance.
   Methods: The effects of various trust indicators on euthanasia acceptance were tested using multilevel analysis, and data from the European Values Study 2008 (N = 49,114, 44 countries). More precisely, the influence of people's general levels of trust in other people, and their confidence in the health care system, were measured-both at the individual and at the country level. Confidence in the state and the press were accounted for as well, since both institutions might monitor and safeguard euthanasia practices.
   Results: It was shown that the level of trust in a country was strongly positively linked to euthanasia attitudes, both for general trust and for confidence in health care. In addition, within countries, people who perceived their fellow citizens as trustworthy, and who had confidence in the press, were more supportive of euthanasia than their less trusting counterparts. The pattern was, however, not true for confidence in the state and for confidence in the health care system at the individual level. Notably, all confirmative effects held, even when other variables such as religiosity, education, and values regarding autonomy were controlled for.
   Conclusions: Trust seems to be a noteworthy construct to explain differences in attitudes towards euthanasia, especially when drawing cross-country comparisons. Therefore, it should be added to the existing literature on correlates of euthanasia attitudes.

AB Background: Deliberate self-harm among young people is an important focus of policy and practice internationally. Nonetheless, there is little reliable comparative international information on its extent or characteristics. We have conducted a seven-country comparative community study of deliberate self-harm among young people. Method: Over 30,000 mainly 15- and 16-year-olds completed anonymous questionnaires at school in Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway. Study criteria were developed to identify episodes of self-harm; the prevalence of self-harm acts and thoughts, methods used, repetition, reasons given, premeditation, setting for the act, associations with alcohol and drugs, hospitalisation, and whether other people knew, were examined. Results: Self-harm was more than twice as common among females as males and, in four of the seven countries, at least one in ten females had harmed herself in the previous year. Additional young people had thought of harming themselves without doing so. More males and females in all countries except Hungary cut themselves than used any other method, most acts took place at home, and alcohol and illegal drugs were not usually involved. The most common reasons given were 'to get relief from a terrible state of mind' followed by 'to die', although there were differences between those cutting themselves and those taking overdoses. About half the young people decided to harm themselves in the hour before doing so, and many did not attend hospital or tell anyone else. Just over half those who had harmed themselves during the previous year reported more than one episode over their lifetime. Conclusions: Deliberate self-harm is a widespread yet often hidden problem in adolescents, especially females, which shows both similarities and differences internationally.

AB Background: Legislative changes are resulting in assisted death as an option for people at the end of life. Although nurses' experiences and perspectives are underrepresented within broader ethical discourses about assisted death, there is a small but significant body of literature examining nurses' experiences of caring for people who request this option. Aim: To synthesize what has been learned about nurses' experiences of caring for patients who request assisted death and to highlight what is morally at stake for nurses who undertake this type of care. Design: Qualitative meta-synthesis. Methods: Six databases were searched: CINAHL, Medline, EMBASE, Joanna Briggs Institute, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. The search was completed on 22 October 2014 and updated in February 2016. Of 879 articles identified from the database searches, 16 articles were deemed relevant based on inclusion criteria. Following quality appraisal, 14 studies were retained for analysis and synthesis. Results: The moral experience of the nurse is (1) defined by a profound sense of responsibility, (2) shaped by contextual forces that nurses navigate in everyday end-of-life care practice, and (3) sustained by intra-team moral and emotional support. Discussion: The findings of this synthesis support the view that nurses are moral agents who are deeply invested in the moral integrity of end-of-life care involving assisted death. The findings further demonstrate that to fully appreciate the ethics of assisted death from a nursing standpoint, it is necessary to understand the broader constraints on nurses' moral agency that operate in everyday end-of-life care. Ethical considerations: Research ethics board approval was not required for this synthesis of previously published literature. Conclusion: In order to understand how to enact ethical practice in the area of assisted death, the moral experiences of nurses should be investigated and foregrounded.

AB Euthanasia is legal only in the Netherlands and Belgium, but it is on occasion performed by physicians elsewhere. We recruited in France two convenience samples of 221 lay people and of 189 professionals (36 physicians, 92 nurses, 48 nurse's aides, and 13 psychologists) and asked them how acceptable it would be for a patient's physician to perform euthanasia in each of 72 scenarios. The scenarios were all combinations of three levels of the patient's life expectancy (3 days, 10 days, or 1 month), four levels of the patient's request for euthanasia (no request, unable to formulate a request because in a coma, some form of request, repeated formal requests), three of the family's attitude (do not uselessly prolong care, no opinion, try to keep the patient alive to the very end), and two of the patient's willingness to undergo organ donation (willing or not willing). We found that most lay people and health care professionals structure the factors in the patient scenarios in the same way: they assign most importance to the extent of requests for euthanasia by the patient and least importance (the lay people) or none (the health professionals) to the patient's willingness to donate organs. They also integrate the information from the different factors in the same way: the factors of patient request, patient life expectancy, and (for the lay people) organ donation are combined additively, and the family's attitude toward prolonging care interacts with patient request (playing a larger role when the patient can make no request). Thus we demonstrate a common cognitive foundation for future discussions, at the levels of both clinical care and public policy, of the conditions under which physician-performed euthanasia might be acceptable.

TI One-year follow-up and mobility assessment of schizophrenic patients in

AB Objective. The study was aimed at assessing the clinical evolution and mobility of schizophrenic patients within the healthcare network of the Psychiatric Platform of Liege (Belgium) after a one-year follow-up period.
   Material and methods. The study material consisted of a random sample of 184 patients with schizophrenia drawn from the population of schizophrenic patients treated in the Liege psychiatric care network. The characteristics of these patients have been described previously (18). The 184 patients were followed-up for one-year and reassessed at the end of this period. Mobility (ie, changes between psychiatric care institutions, including home) was recorded for each patient within the institutional network. The diagnosis of schizophrenia was based on the DSM I V. Demographic, social and global functioning (GAF scale) data were collected from the << Resume psychiatrique Minimum (RPM)>>, a clinical summary which has been imposed by the Belgian Ministry of Public Health for each psychiatric hospital stay. Symptom components were derived from the Psychosis Evaluation tool for Common Use by Caregivers (PECC).
   Results. Among the 184 patients enrolled in the initial analysis, 6 refused to participate in the follow-up study. The 178 remaining schizophrenic patients included 131 men (74 %) and 47 women (26 %) with a mean age of 43.1 +/- 13.6 and 48.8 +/- 14.9 years, respectively (p < 0.05). The majority of patients (53 %) suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. At baseline, 63 % of the patients were hospitalised full-time, 6 % part-time and 31 % received ambulatory care. During the one-year follow-up period, 4 patients died, including one from suicide. When considering mobility, 48 % of the patients experienced at least one change of institution, whereas 52 % of the patients didn't change at all (see figure 1). The total number of changes over 1 the 1-year period amounted 189, yielding a mean value of 1.1 changes per patient per year. Changes mostly occurred between institutions of similar care setting (see figure 2). Transfers (30 %) were also observed directly between hospital and home. A multivariate Poisson regression analysis showed that the number of changes was unrelated to gender and initial care setting but decreased with age (p < 0.0001). It was also higher for patients with schizo-affective disorders (2.5 +/- 1.9, p < 0.01) or with residual type (1.2 +/- 1.8; p < 0.05) than for patients with other types of schizophrenia (ranging from 0.3 +/- 0.5 to 0.9 +/- 1.4). No association was found with initial GAF or PECC, except for negative symptoms (p < 0.05). After one year, despite the high proportion of institutional changes (48 % of the patients), the distribution of the patients according to care setting remained the same (p = 0.77). However, GAF scores significantly improved from 39.7 +/- 16.1 to 44.4 +/- 16.1 (p < 0.0001) and likewise for total PECC scores (70 +/- 19.1 vs 63.2 +/- 19.4, p < 0.001). Excitatory and disease perception items of the PECC remained unchanged.
   Conclusion. The present study reveals that mobility within the institutional network did affect about half of the schizophrenic patients. Mobility was related to age, type of schizophrenia and disease evolution. Changes occur mainly between psychiatric structures of similar care setting but also directly from hospital to home without passing through an intermediate care structure. Further efforts should be made to provide schizophrenic patients with a more coordinated care provision throughout the course of their disease.

TI The child victim of sexual abuse and his family: Evaluation and
   treatment. Twenty years later?
SO ANNALES MEDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES
LA French
DT Article
DE Sexual abuse; III-treatment; Multidisciplinarity; Perversion; Network
AB Objectives. - Sexual ill-treatment on child remains a complex problem concerning the individual, family, collective and societal levels. In echo, its understanding then its coverage ask for a consideration of the medical, social, psychological and legal levels of every situation. According to countries, the revelation of abuse carried by the child or by the third party will be either << sent to Justice >> or directed to the medico-psychosocial sector. In the light of the epidemiological data collected by the WHO, prevalence of the situations of sexual ill-treatment on child remains very important and in spite of the numerous prevention campaigns, awareness-raising and multiple training programs. In 1997, our work proposed marks and reflections on the aspects of evaluation and the treatment of the child, who is a victim of sexual abuse, and his family. We considered convenient, twenty years later, to realize an updating of the developed aspects by leaving a clinical label which, without being paradigmatic, illustrate the topic.
   Methods. - Since "the Dutroux affair" which shook Belgium and bordering countries in 1996, awareness campaigns, trainings intended for the professionals in the sectors of help and care but also of the legal system were born. Techniques and tools were developed to meet the child in his first interest. However, in twenty years, the number of descriptions reaching the specialized teams "SOS-Enfants" did not stop growing. Sexual ill-treatment to the child exists again and again. Let us call back how much this one constitutes a vulnerable link of the society susceptible to serve as surface of projections, as object of impulsive discharges when the adult experiences ill-being, frustration and need for immediate enjoyment. Whatever the nature of the ill-treatment, whether it is physical, sexual, psychological or in terms of diverse forms of carelessness, the child is left to high risk of enduring multiple effects from the trauma. Without being exhaustive, in the light of the clinical label, the discussion will concern four reflexive axes summarized in the work of 1997. The purpose consists in showing the evolutions of the practice with regard to the transformations intervened on many aspects and points of attention which includes the coverage of the situations of ill-treatment.
   Results. Societies, families, individuals: today ever, sexuality in its diverse declensions occupies the media ground, representing a gigantic market share echoing the mentalities centered on the body and its image. These aspects are interlinked in the incredible advances of the technologies of communication and information, in their dimensions of ease, accessibility and speed. More than ever, the modern man is snatched in a spiral compound of impulsiveness and immediacy. The psychic construction is dependent on the environment just like this one is influenced by the actions and the language of the man. As our communities modify their way of being, as the individual transforms gradually his vision of the world, patterns of interactions and mechanisms of defense. Echoes on the personalities met on the ground emerge from it logically.
   Evaluation. The situations of sexual ill-treatment are complex to dread so much there is good reason considering the speeches, behavior and interactions. The proposed model 20 years ago, which remains relevant, leans on two essential principles. The first one corresponds to the multidisciplinarity and, in corollary, in the co-intervention and in the corporatism. For 30 years, the crossed looks of the various disciplines allow to build the evaluation of the possible materiality of the facts of ill-treatment and their impacts on the young victim and his circle of acquaintances. The second principle includes the methodological aspects of the process given that several diagnostic fields are concerned, each referring to adapted specific tools. Let us browse briefly these by recovering how much the acquired experience during these years showed the relevance of a "flexible and flexible systematization" in the process of investigation. The frame of the care: in twenty year's, the landscape of the authorities and the structures potentially involved in the situations of sexual abuse has become complicated. Concomitantly, the professionals noticed a clogging of the general system of help and care so much that the demands exceed the offers in view of the evolution of the individual, family and societal problems. The treatment: it will depend not only on facts of ill-treatment themselves but the traumatic impact on the concerned child and its circle of acquaintances. In this connection, we are confronted with a diversity of demonstrations ranging from an absence of any symptomatology translating an impact strength of the young victim to the appearance of destructive conducts to oneself and/or to others that can lead to the suicide attempt. To remain coherent in the care, there is good reason to know the indications, the limits of every reserved approach by watching the principle of collective complementarity. It is certainly here about a point of evolution with regard to our reflections of 1997, showing all the interest to mobilize the various therapeutic currents to be connected around the child and around his circle of acquaintances.
   Conclusions. In order to avoid the effects from a social and economic exposure in the public domain as well as the phenomena of stigmatization, Belgium opted for the possibility and not the obligation to call out to the legal system, by setting up multidisciplinary teams reckoned to estimate and handle the situations of ill-treatment on children. Although it is there, we advocate an individual consideration on the basis of a multidisciplinary reflection and within the framework of a work of network. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.
