AB Although previous studies have discussed the risk factors of unplanned suicide behavior in several countries, the unplanned suicide attempt in China was not explored in a large sample. We aim to look into the characteristics of unplanned suicide attempters in China and compare them with those suicide attempters with plans. Subjects were 791 medically serious suicide attempters aged 15-54 years in rural China. The sixth item of Beck's Suicide Intent Scale was used to estimate the planned and unplanned suicide attempt. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the factors related to planned or unplanned suicide attempt. The results showed that the planned suicide attempts were associated with higher education, hopelessness, and previous suicide act. The unplanned suicide attempt tends to be suicide by pesticide and store pesticide at home. A ban of lethal pesticides may be a method for suicide prevention in rural China.

AB Suicide is an important public health problem in China: It is the fifth leading cause of death in China, and suicide in China accounts for over 30% of the world's overall suicide deaths. The substantial burden due to suicide has not been well recognized. This study aims to provide an estimate of the socioeconomic burden of the suicide problem in China in terms of years of life lost (YLL) and to discuss its implications. Suicide rates and the related YLL by age, gender, and region (urban/rural) from 1990 to 2000 were estimated using the most recent data from the Ministry of Health of China. The suicide rate in rural China was three times higher than that in urban areas. Suicide completers in rural areas shared 90% of total YLL. Rural women aged 25-39 years contributed the largest share of YLL. Our results show that some population subgroups contributed a disproportionate share to the disease burden of suicide. National strategies for suicide prevention should include targeted programs in catering the need of these specified subgroups in China.

AB Suicide in mainland China shows unique demographic patterns with age: the over-65 age group has the highest rate of completed suicide, reaching 44.3-200 per 100 000, which is four to five times higher than the Chinese general population. Rural suicide rates among the elderly are three to five times higher than the urban rates. The gender ratio of suicide in the elderly shows a reversal to those younger than 60 years of age in China. In addition, suicide methods and causes are different from those in Western countries. In the present paper, the profile of suicide among the elderly in China is delineated, including the prevalence, characteristics, underlying reasons and measures of preventing it.

AB Objective: The aims of this paper are (i) to describe the specific characteristics of suicide in China and compare it with that in a western country, Denmark; and (ii) to discuss the accuracy of suicide data and the possible explanations for suicide behaviour in China.
   Method: Data for the study are obtained from the World Health Statistics Annual based on official records in China and the Danish Cause-of-Death Register, and standardized according to the age-specified population of China in 1990.
   Results: The specific characteristics of suicide in China differed strikingly from the general pattern of suicide in other western countries as well as in Denmark: suicide rates in females were higher than in males; rural rates were more than three times higher than urban rates; suicide rates peaked for those aged 75+ years, bu; with a minor peak in females for those aged 15-24 years old.
   Conclusion: These specific characteristics of suicide in China may possibly be interpreted in terms of traditional culture, social forces, political environment and economic status.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY

DT Article
ID HONG-KONG; RATES
AB China is the only country in which the suicide rate is higher among women than men. We provide a demographic perspective on the gender differential in suicide in China. This shows that the male/female ratio of suicide increased between 1991 and 2001 and there is reason to believe this trend will continue. Among the population subgroups, only young women living in rural areas had much higher suicide rates than their male counterparts. It is argued that consideration of the gender ratio of suicide in China must take age-, gender-and region-specific suicide patterns and the population structure into account. The increasing urbanisation of China is likely to be associated with more male suicides and we predict that before long the male suicide rate will overtake that of females.

AB Background: The major suicide method in rural China today is ingestion of agricultural pesticides.
   Aim: This study is to investigate the characteristics of Chinese rural young suicides who died of pesticide ingestion.
   Methods: A sample of 392 suicides from rural China was studied using the psychological autopsy method, and data were analysed for demographic characteristics, the suicide method used, mental disorder and psychological characteristics.
   Results: Suicides by pesticide ingestion were enacted more because of impulsiveness and tended to demonstrate less mental illness than those suicides using other means in rural China.
   Conclusions: Accessibility, high toxicity and lethality of the pesticides were risk factors for the suicides of people without a mental disorder in rural China. The use of pesticides is a rational choice and the safe storage of these kinds of farming chemicals should be controlled to prevent certain suicides.

AB Objectives: To characterize suicide in early China, as a means of extending knowledge of this behaviour. Methods: We examined Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and collated and considered relevant details. Results: In early China, loss of authority/status, loved ones and fortune were triggers for suicide. The expression of the intention to suicide, either by word or action, was observed and elicited a placating response. Less frequent, but nevertheless clearly recorded, were accounts of suicide completed to satisfy the wishes of others. Conclusions: The suicide and related behaviour of early China shares many features with late Western societies, but one form (to satisfy the wishes of others) is currently undetected.

AB Background: In mainland China, frequent Internet suicide pacts in recent years have raised strong concerns from several social sectors and the influence of social networks on suicide is constantly growing. Aims: To identify the epidemiological characteristics of media-reported Internet suicide pacts in mainland China. Method: Our study comprised 62 Internet suicide pacts involving 159 victims in mainland China before June 1, 2015. Kendall's randomness test, a trend test, and a circular distribution test were applied to identify the rising or concentrated trends in the time of occurrence of Internet suicide pacts. Results: The overall male-to-female ratio was 2.3:1. Suicide victims were mainly people in their 20s to 30s (84.1%). In all, 87.1% suicide victims completed suicide in sealed hotels or rental housing, and charcoal-burning suicide accounted for 80.6% of cases. Conclusion: People who complete suicide as part of an Internet suicide pact are more likely to be males, aged 20-30 years. Charcoal-burning suicide in sealed hotels or rental housing was the commonest way of dying.

AB China is one of few countries which reported higher female suicide rates in the worldwide. However, little is known about the gender differences among Chinese rural suicide attempters. This study aims to analyze the gender differences among medically serious suicide attempters aged 15-54 years in rural China. Subjects were 791 medically serious suicide attempters and 791 controls aged 15-54 years in rural China. Socio-demographic, psychological and some critical variables were assessed in the interview. The results showed that all of the factors (education years, family suicide history, negative life events, social support, impulsivity and mental disorder) associated with male suicide attempters also could be found for females. Physical disease, mental disorder and pesticide ingestion played more roles on male suicide attempters. Ever married, peasant, religious belief, and less social support played more roles on female suicide attempters. Compared with male suicide attempters, female ones are mainly influenced by social factors. A gender-specific approach should be emphasized in suicide prevention.

Information on 392 completed suicides aged 15-34 years were consecutively collected from 16 counties in three provinces of China. Information on each suicide was obtained from two informants. The results showed ingesting pesticides or other poisons (73.5%) and hanging (10.5%) were the two most common methods of suicide. Suicides happened more in autumn (30.10%) or summer (27.29%), nighttime (68.3%), and at home (73.6%). However, suicides with violent methods were more common in winter and spring and outside of home. Season (autumn or summer), place (at home), and pesticide stored in home were negatively while depression was positively associated with violent methods of suicide. Characteristics of the suicides by violent methods are different from those by nonviolent methods. Investigations into the methods of rural young suicides are necessary for suicide prevention in China.

AB This study was to investigate the relationship among social support, impulsivity, and suicide, so as to test the hypothesis that social support moderates the effect of impulsivity on suicide for the rural young suicides in China. Subjects were 392 consecutively recruited suicides aged 15-34 years and 416 community controls of the same age range sampled in China. The case-control data were obtained using psychological autopsy. The results showed that high social support had the protective effect among individuals with low impulsivity. It can be concluded that impulsivity is a potential area for further study of suicidal behavior. The suicide prevention efforts in rural China may address impulsivity.

TI Suicide by pesticide poisoning remains a priority for suicide prevention

AB Background: Despite recent declines, suicide remains a priority for China. Ease of availability of high-lethality suicide methods, such as pesticides and firearms, contributes to the overall incidence and is an important target for suicide prevention. This study investigates whether changes in the distribution of methods of suicide have contributed to the recent reduction in suicide in China.
   Method: Suicide rates (2006-2013) were calculated using the Chinese Disease Surveillance Points system, stratified by gender, age group, and urban-rural residence, to investigate trends in suicide over the study period. Multilevel negative binomial regression models were used to investigate associations between socio-demographic factors and method-specific suicide.
   Results: The most common method of suicide in China for both males and females was pesticide poisoning, followed by hanging. All methods declined over the study period, with the exception of suicide by jumping in males. Suicide rates for pesticide poisoning and for hanging increased exponentially with age in those aged over >= 45 years in both sexes. Pesticide poisoning declined from 55% to 49% of all suicides, while hanging increased from 27% to 31%.
   Limitations: This was an ecological study of a time series of suicide rates, with risk factor adjustment being limited to population-level point estimates derived from a single census.
   Conclusions: Suicide by pesticide poisoning and hanging remain the leading methods of suicide in China. Changes to the safe use of pesticides and targeted prevention initiatives to restrict access, along with socioeconomic development and urbanisation, are likely contributors to declines in suicide by pesticide poisoning

AB Backgrounds: Whether suicide in China has significant seasonal variations is unclear. The aim of this study is to examine the seasonality of suicide in Shandong China and to assess the associations of suicide seasonality with gender, residence, age and methods of suicide.
   Methods: Three types of tests (Chi-square, Edwards' T and Roger's Log method) were used to detect the seasonality of the suicide data extracted from the official mortality data of Shandong Disease Surveillance Point (DSP) system. Peak/low ratios (PLRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to indicate the magnitude of seasonality.
   Results: A statistically significant seasonality with a single peak in suicide rates in spring and early summer, and a dip in winter was observed, which remained relatively consistent over years. Regardless of gender, suicide seasonality was more pronounced in rural areas, younger age groups and for non-violent methods, in particular, self-poisoning by pesticide.
   Conclusions: There are statistically significant seasonal variations of completed suicide for both men and women in Shandong, China. Differences exist between residence (urban/rural), age groups and suicide methods. Results appear to support a sociological explanation of suicide seasonality. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship among impulsivity, mental disorder, and suicide with a sample of rural young Chinese. Subjects were 392 consecutively recruited male and female suicides aged 15-34 years and 416 community male and female controls of the same age range sampled in rural China. The case-control data were obtained using psychological autopsy with structured and semi-structured instruments. Dysfunctional impulsivity was a significant risk factor regardless of mental disorder in rural China. Dysfunctional impulsivity is a potential area for further study of suicidal behavior. The suicide prevention efforts in rural China may address impulsivity.

TI Suicide rates in China, 1995-99
SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH; WOMEN
AB Background A wide range of suicide rates are reported for China because official mortality data are based on an unrepresentative sample and because different reports adjust crude rates in different ways. We aimed to present an accurate picture of the current pattern of suicide in China on the basis of conservative estimates of suicide rates in different population cohorts.
   Methods Suicide rates by sex, 5-year age-group, and region (urban or rural) reported in mortality data for 1995-99 provided by the Chinese Ministry of Health were adjusted according to an estimated rate of unreported deaths and projected to the corresponding population.
   Findings We estimated a mean annual suicide rate of 23 per 100 000 and a total of 287 000 suicide deaths per year. Suicide accounted for 3.6% of all deaths in China and was the fifth most important cause of death. Among young adults 15-34 years of age, suicide was the leading cause of death, accounting for 19% of all deaths. The rate in women was 25% higher than in men, mainly because of the large number of suicides in young rural women. Rural rates were three times higher than urban rates-a difference that remained true for both sexes, for all age-groups, and over time.
   Interpretation Suicide is a major public-health problem for China that is only gradually being recognised. The unique pattern of suicides in China is widely acknowledged, so controversy about the overall suicide rate should not delay the development and testing of China-specific suicide-prevention programmes.

AB Suicides by young females in rural China contribute substantially to the high rate of suicide and the total number of suicides in China Given the traditional familial structure that remains largely intact in rural China, this research focuses on whether being married is a risk or protective factor for suicide by young women I examined 168 rural female suicides ages 15 to 35 in comparison with 211 rural female controls in the same age range It was found that being married is not a protective factor for suicide in rural China Fertility events are not related to suicide risk for rural young women Social support is stronger for unmarried women than for married women, and risk factors tend to be family-related issues I interpret the findings in light of Durkheim's notion of fatalistic suicide and add the Strain Theory of Suicide to account for the rural young women's suicide in Chinese culture contexts

AB Background: Suicide is a major public health issue in China. Studies of suicide risk factors have reported both inconsistent and inconclusive results. This review aimed to determine suicide risk factors in China.
   Methods: Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) and VIP (Chinese Journal of Science and Technology of VIP) were searched for relevant reports. Two investigators independently assessed the eligibility of identified studies and extracted data. Pooled odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) were calculated for each factor with Revman 5.0.
   Results: Forty-four studies with 192,362 subjects were included. The pooled results indicated that mood disorders and stressful life events (physical illness, suicide of relatives) increased the risk of suicide ideation among the entire population. Socio-family environment (single or remarried parent, study pressure and academic achievement) and unhealthy behaviors (smoking, alcohol drinking, and drug use) were risk factors for suicide ideation among youth. Unhealthy behaviors (smoking and alcohol drinking), mood disorders, and stressful life events (suicide of relatives) were the main risk factors for attempted suicide. Persons living in rural areas, and those with lower education, mood disorders, and/or a history of negative life events had a higher risk of completed suicide. In China, before 2000, females had a significantly higher rate of completed suicide than males, while after 2000, no significant gender difference was found.
   Conclusions: Socio-family environment, lifestyle, life events and psychiatric/psychological factors are associated with suicidal behaviors in China. Further case-control or cohort studies are needed to better understand suicide behaviors in China. Meanwhile, there is an urgent need for comprehensive studies of suicide interventions among high-risk populations.

AB This study aimed to clarify the relationship between functional and dysfunctional impulsivity and attempted suicide in rural China. Data of this study came from the investigation of 407 suicide attempters and their paired non-suicide attempters matched with the same gender, age ( 3 years) and residence area in six counties in rural Shandong, China. Suicide attempters accounted for a lower proportion on high functional impulsivity, but a higher proportion on high dysfunctional impulsivity than non-suicide attempters. Dysfunctional impulsivity in the male denoted a significant risk factor for attempted suicide, even after adjustment for psychiatric disorder and demographic factors. Suicide attempters with high dysfunctional impulsivity had a higher percent of family suicide history than those with low dysfunctional impulsivity. High functional impulsivity was a significant protective factor for attempted suicide in the group aged 35-59 years, but a significant risk factor in the group aged 15-34 years. Suicide attempters with low functional impulsivity had poorer economic status and older age than those with high functional impulsivity. Our findings support the key roles of functional and dysfunctional impulsivity in attempted suicide among rural residents of China.

AB We examine the characteristics of suicide behavior and associated risk factors in the elderly in rural China, compared with the nonelderly. Paired case-control design and psychological autopsy were used for subject recruitment and data collection. The included cases were 104 suicides of the elderly aged 60 years or older, 86 suicides of the nonelderly, and sex- and age-paired controls from the same villages. Although the characteristics of suicide behavior were similar between the two age groups of victims, the elderly who died by suicide had a greater tendency to experience negative life events and not live with a spouse. Suicide of the nonelderly was associated with family history of suicide, poor social support, and impulsivity. The influence of negative life events on the risk of suicide was greater in the elderly. Thus, efforts for suicide prevention must be tailored to the needs of specific age groups.

Methods: Age-, sex-and region-specific PYLL due to suicide in China were determined for victims aged between 1 and 74 years.
   Results: Suicide was found to be the 10th leading cause of death in terms of PYLL, and accounted for 3.06% of all PYLL in China. There were three age peaks for PYLL due to suicide in rural areas (20-24, 35-44 and 50-59 years), and two peaks for PYLL due to suicide in urban areas (20-24 and 35-44 years). PYLL due to suicide in rural areas was approximately two-fold higher than PYLL due to suicide in urban areas.
   Conclusions: Suicide is a major public health problem in China. This needs to be controlled, especially in rural areas. (C) 2015 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Physical illness is linked with an increased risk of suicide; however, evidence from China is limited. Aims: To assess the influence of physical illness on risk of suicide among rural residents of China, and to examine the differences in the characteristics of people completing suicide with physical illness from those without physical illness. Method: In all, 200 suicide cases and 200 control subjects, 1:1 pair-matched on sex and age, were included from 25 townships of three randomly selected counties in Shandong Province, China. One informant for each suicide or control subject was interviewed to collect data on the physical health condition and psychological and sociodemographic status. Results: The prevalence of physical illness in suicide cases (63.0%) was significantly higher than that in paired controls (41.0%; chi(2) = 19.39, p < .001). Compared with suicide cases without physical illness, people who were physically ill and completed suicide were generally older, less educated, had lower family income, and reported a mental disorder less often. Physical illness denoted a significant risk factor for suicide with an associated odds ratio of 3.23 (95% CI: 1.85-5.62) after adjusted for important covariates. The elevated risk of suicide increased progressively with the number of comorbid illnesses. Cancer, stroke, and a group of illnesses comprising dementia, hemiplegia, and encephalatrophy had a particularly strong effect among the commonly reported diagnoses in this study population. Conclusion: Physical illness is an important risk factor for suicide in rural residents of China. Efforts for suicide prevention are needed and should be integrated with national strategies of health care in rural China.

AB Increasing help-seeking behavior was one of the effective methods for suicide prevention. However, help-seeking behavior was less explored in rural China. In this study, we aimed to analyze the factors which were associated with help-seeking behavior among medically serious suicide attempters in rural China. Subjects were 791 medically serious suicide attempters aged 15-54 years in rural China. A face-to-face interview was conducted to evaluate the age, gender, education years, marital status, occupation, religious belief, living alone, physical disease, pesticide at home, family suicide history, negative life events, social support, impulsivity, mental disorder, prior suicide act, suicide intent and suicide method for the attempters. The results supported that there were 29.2% of attempters seek help before suicide behavior, and factors that male (OR = 1.45), experiencing negative life events (OR = 1.12), impulsivity (OR = 1.05), suicide intent (OR = 0.92) and suicide by pesticide (OR = 0.68) were associated with increased help-seeking behavior. It is helpful for us to understanding the features of suicide attempters who do not seek help before suicide behavior, and we also should pay more attention on people with these factors in Chinese suicide prevention.

AB This study explores 63 homicide-suicide cases that include two or more homicide victims, in the People's Republic of China. This is the first study to examine homicide-suicide in the Chinese context, following calls to develop a research strategy outside of the USA and Europe. Data are derived from a content analysis of Chinese news sources from 2000 to 2014. Findings show homicide-suicide offenders are likely to be married males living in rural cities who kill their intimate partners and/or children inside a residence using knives. Intimate partner conflict and extramarital affairs are precipitating factors in almost half of the incidents. Patterns of homicide-suicide in China are comparable to those in high-income countries, except that firearms are not the primary means in China and there is no evidence of "mercy killing" among older persons, as described in western homicide-suicide studies. Findings are related to the social and economic structure of Chinese society. Clinical and policy implications include the need for greater transparency and a nationwide homicide and suicide tracking system in China, stricter domestic violence laws, postmortem studies of the brains of homicide-suicide offenders, and psychological autopsies on homicide-suicide perpetrators.

ID RISK-FACTORS; GENDER; INSTRUMENTS; INFORMANTS; CULTURE
AB Background. Patterns of suicide rates in China differ in many ways from those in the West. This study aimed to identify the risk factors characteristic for young rural Chinese suicides.
   Method. This was a case-control psychological autopsy (PA) study. The samples were suicides and living controls (both aged 15-34 years) from 16 rural counties of China. We interviewed two informants for each suicide and each control with pretested and validated instruments to estimate psychosocial, psychiatric and other risk factors for suicides.
   Results. The prevalence of mental disorders was higher among the young Chinese who died by suicide than among the living controls, but was lower than among suicides in the West. Marriage was not a protecting factor for suicide among young rural Chinese women, and never-married women who were involved in relationships were about three times more likely to commit suicide than single women who were unattached. Religion/religiosity was not a protecting factor in Chinese suicide, as it tended to be stronger for suicides than for controls. Impulsivity was significantly higher for suicides than for controls. Psychological strain, resulting from conflicting social values between communist gender equalitarianism and Confucian gender discrimination, was associated significantly with suicide in young rural Chinese women, even after accounting for the role of psychiatric illness.
   Conclusions. Risk factors for suicide in rural China are different from those in the West. Psychological strain plays a role in suicide. Suicide prevention programs in China should incorporate culture-specific considerations.

SO HARVARD REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Review
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; SOCIAL-CHANGE; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Suicide is a complex phenomenon-arguably a social and a moral deed-occurring within associated psychological, biological, and cultural contexts. We present data on suicide rates in China for 1988, 1990, and 1992 and provide an analysis of their social context. These figures, from the Chinese Public Health Annuals, have never before been publicly reported. These and other recent data indicate that suicide rates in China, although reportedly low in the past, are by global standards alarmingly high among certain demographic groups. They also reveal distinctive epidemiological patterns of suicide in China that contrast with the patterns characteristic of Western societies-for example, higher rates in rural than in urban areas and, among some demographic groups, higher among women than among men. As in the West, however, suicide among the elderly is a major problem in China. The sociocultural context of these data is examined as a means toward understanding their distinctive patterning.

   control and prevention; Suicide; Surveillance
ID GLOBAL BURDEN; LIFE LOST; DISEASE; DEATH
AB Background: The decreasing suicide rate in China has been regarded as a major contributor to the decline of global suicide rate in the past decade. However, previous estimations on China's suicide rates might not be accurate, since often they were based on the data from the Ministry of Health's Vital Registration ("MOH-VR") System, which is biased towards the better-off population. This study aims to compare suicide data extracted from the MOH-VR System with a more representative mortality surveillance system, namely the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Disease Surveillance Points ("CDC-DSP") System, and update China's national and subnational suicide rates in the period of 2004-2014.
   Methods: The CDC-DSP data are obtained from the National Cause-of-Death Surveillance Dataset (2004-2014) and the MOH-VR data are from the Chinese Health Statistics Yearbooks (2005-2012) and the China Health and Family Planning Statistics Yearbooks (2013-2015). First, a negative binomial regression model was used to test the associations between the source of data (CDC-DSP/MOH-VR) and suicide rates in 2004-2014. Joinpoint regression analyses and Kitagawa's decomposition method are then applied to analyze the trends of the crude suicide rates.
   Results: Both systems indicated China's suicide rates decreased over the study period. However, before the two systems merged in 2013, the CDC-DSP System reported significantly higher national suicide rates (IRR = 1.18, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.13-1.24) and rural suicide rates (IRR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.21-1.38) than the MOH-VR System. The CDC-DSP System also showed significant reversing points in 2011 (95% CI: 2006-2012) and 2006 (95% CI: 20062008) on the rural and urban suicide trends. Moreover, the suicide rates in the east and central urban regions were reversed in 2011 and 2008.
   Conclusions: The biased MOH-VR System underestimated China's national and rural suicide rates. Although not widely appreciated in the field of suicide research, the CDC-DSP System provides more accurate estimations on China's suicide rates and is recommended for future studies to monitor the reversing trends of suicide rates in China's more developed areas.

LA English
DT Article
DE Asian; Chinese; older; international; suicide; prevention; ageism
AB Objective: To verify in a systematic study if the Chinese tradition of venerating older people results in lower suicide rates compared to other countries.
   Method: The ratio between suicide rates in the older population and total population were calculated and used to compare 40 countries.
   Results: The highest male suicide ratios in the world were found in Urban China, Singapore, Rural China and Hong Kong. Singapore, Urban China and Hong Kong had the worst female suicide ratios. The highest rate of suicide among females was in Rural China, which also had the highest suicide rate among older people.
   Conclusion: These findings raise questions about the adequacy of support to older Asian people. It is surprising that high suicide rates are found in Hong Kong, Korea, Japan and Singapore, which are affluent societies. The possibility of this being the result of ageism is discussed. Country-specific research is needed to improve suicide prevention measures, especially for older people.

AB As the relationship between global functioning and young suicide remains unclear in rural China, this study was aimed to explore the relationship between them. Data of 391 rural suicides and 416 controls, all aged 1534 years in three provinces in China were used for this study. The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale was adopted to assess global functioning of suicides and controls. The results showed that GAF score was stronger than mental illness in predicting suicide in China. Different correlates of GAF score were found between suicides and controls. Unsurprisingly, GAF score was significantly correlated with mental illness in both suicides and controls. Different characteristics were also found among three types of suicide which were classified using GAF score. Assessing global functioning is useful and GAF scale should be regularly used in suicide prevention practice.

DE Suicide rate; Economic growth; China; Culture; Strain Theory of suicide
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; MODERNIZATION
AB Objectives: It is to estimate the trend of suicide rate changes during the past three decades in China and try to identify its social and economic correlates.
   Methods: Official data of suicide rates and economic indexes during 1982-2005 from Shandong Province of China were analyzed. The suicide data were categorized for the rural / urban location and gender, and the economic indexes include GDP, GDP per capita, rural income, and urban income, all adjusted for inflation.
   Results: We found a significant increase of economic development and decrease of suicide rates over the past decades under study. The suicide rate decrease is correlated with the tremendous growth of economy.
   Conclusion: The unusual decrease of Chinese suicide rates in the past decades is accounted for within the Chinese cultural contexts and maybe by the Strain Theory of Suicide. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI The Foxconn suicides and their media prominence: is the Werther Effect
   applicable in China?
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID COVERAGE; RATES; GUIDELINES; TAIWAN; IMPACT; RISK
AB Background: Media reporting of suicide and its relationship with actual suicide has rarely been investigated in Mainland China. The "Foxconn suicides" is a description referring to a string of suicides/attempts during 2010, all of which were related to a giant electrical manufacturing company, Foxconn. This study aimed to examine the clustering and copycat effects of the Foxconn suicides, and to investigate temporal patterns in how they were reported by the media in Mainland China, Hong Kong (HK), and Taiwan (TW).
   Methods: Relevant articles were collected from representative newspapers published in three big cities in Mainland China (Beijing (BJ), Shenzhen (SZ), and Guangzhou (GZ)), HK, and TW, together with searching intensity data on the topic conducted using the Baidu search engine in Mainland China. The temporal clustering effects of the Foxconn suicides and their media prominence were assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The media reports of the Foxconn suicides' temporal patterns were explored using a nonparametric curve estimation method (that is, the local linear method). The potential mutual interactions between the Foxconn suicides and their media prominence were also examined, using logistic and Poisson regression methods.
   Results: The results support a temporal clustering effect for the Foxconn suicides. The BJ-based newspapers' reporting and the occurrence of a Foxconn suicide/attempt are each found to be associated with an elevated chance of a further Foxconn suicide 3 days later. The occurrence of a Foxconn suicide also immediately influenced the intensity of both Baidu searching and newspaper reporting. Regional diversity in suicide reporting tempo-patterns within Mainland China, and similarities between HK and TW, are also demonstrated.
   Conclusions: The Foxconn suicides were temporally clustered. Their occurrences were influenced by the reporting of BJ-based newspapers, and contagion within the company itself. Further suicide research and prevention work in China should consider its special media environment.

AB Background: Chinese suicide samples have provided opportunities to study the differences between suicides with and without psychiatric diagnoses. Aims: To examine the differences between suicides with and without mental disorders. Methods: Sixty-six suicides and 66 living controls were studied with psychological autopsy interviews in rural China. Those who died by suicide with (n = 45) and without (n = 21) mental disorders were compared on demographic characteristics, suicidal behavior, social support, life events, and depressive symptoms (as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, HAMD). Results: Suicides with and without psychiatric diagnoses had significant differences in many demographic and social factors. In comparison with suicides with psychiatric diagnoses, suicides without psychiatric diagnoses were younger, were better educated, had higher income, were more likely to kill themselves using pesticides or other poisons, were less likely to have a history of prior suicide attempt, had less long-term life events and more recent life events, and scored lower on HAMD. Conclusions: These two groups might be from two different populations. This finding has important implications for more effective and targeted suicide prevention strategies in China.

ID MORTALITY SURVEILLANCE; JOINPOINT REGRESSION; TRENDS; INCREASE; JAPAN
AB Background: The overall suicide rate in China has dropped substantially since the 1990s, with patterns changing significantly. This study aims to further explore the latest changes in suicide rates in China.
   Methods: Data on gender-age-specific suicide rates for rural and urban residents aged 15 years and above were retrieved from official records. Joinpoint regression analyses were applied to analyze time trends of suicide rates.
   Results: Overall, suicide rates in China dropped significantly from 2002 to 2015. However, the national suicide rates have decreased at a slower pace since 2006. Joinpoints on time trends of suicide rates were also observed among rural males, rural females and urban males in 2005, 2006 and 2008, respectively. Declines in suicide rates of a majority of groups aged 25-54 slowed around 2007, and even reversed among males aged 25-34 in both areas and rural males aged 45-54. Male suicide rates were increasingly higher than females' after 2006. Rural suicide rates were about twice those of urban groups in recent years.
   Limitations: Data on suicide is based on a large-sampled surveillance system, which may suffer from some quality flaws. Improvements in the quality of suicide rate data may lead to bias. Information on other potential differences in suicide rates over time is not available.
   Conclusions: Although the suicide rate in China dropped significantly from 2002-2015, a slowdown in the decrease and even a reversing trend was observed in some certain groups, which highlights the urgent need for targeted suicide prevention programs.

AB Objective Previous studies have implied that there were many Chinese suicide attempters who did not want to die by suicide. In the current study, we explored the factors which were associated with low levels of suicide intent. We also examined features for medically serious suicide attempters who do not have a strong intent to die in rural china.
   Design Cross-sectional study.
   Setting The interviews occurred between May 2012 and July 2013 in 13 rural counties in Shandong and Hunan provinces, China.
   Participants Subjects were 791 medically serious suicide attempters whose injury and wounds were so serious they required hospitalisation or immediate medical care.
   Results The results supported that less years of education (=-0.11, p=0.037), religious beliefs (=1.20, p=0.005), living alone (=1.92, p=0.017), negative life events (=0.29, p=0.003), low levels of impulsivity (=-0.10, p=0.013) and mental disorders (=2.82, p<0.001) were associated with higher levels of suicide intent.
   Conclusion Results imply that there are some medically serious suicide attempters with a higher education and/or exhibit impulsivity who do not want to die by suicide. These findings can inform practice to prevent suicide in rural China.

AB PurposeIn global forensic practice, some suicides were misclassified as undetermined deaths, leading to suicide underreporting. In this study, we aimed to explore the influence of undetermined deaths on suicides in Shanghai, China.MethodsThe police records on suicide verdicts and undetermined deaths in Pudong, Shanghai, from 2004 to 2016 were used. In this study, undetermined deaths have been classified into three levels of suicide possibilities namely, probable, possible, and highly unlikely. Probable suicides were presumed as misclassified suicides. Poisson regression was used to calculate the rate ratio (RR) of probable suicides compared to suicide verdicts. Poisson regression was also used to calculate the annual percentage change (APC) of the original suicide rates (crude suicide rates based on the suicide verdicts) and adjusted suicide rates (crude suicide rates based on the suicide verdicts and probable suicides).ResultsAmong the 1,318 underdetermine deaths, 560 (42.5%) were classified as probable suicides. The overall RR was 0.23 (95% CI 0.21-0.26): 0.15 (0.13-0.17) for the locals' RR and 0.22 (0.19-0.26) for the migrants' RR. The APCs of the original and adjusted suicide rates were -2.0 (-3.1 to -0.9) and -2.9 (-3.8 to -2.0), respectively, for the overall population.ConclusionsThe number of suicides could be 23% higher than the reported cases. Suicides were more likely to be underreported in migrants than in the locals. Thus, it is important to improve suicide monitoring and the surveillance systems in China.

The proxy sample consisted of 382 completed suicides and 414 community living controls, all aged 15-34 years. Logistic regression analyses showed that among the Chinese youths (1) the Confucian ethic of filial piety was negatively associated with suicide; (2) the Confucian ethic of harmony moderated the estimated net effect of negative life events on suicide; and (3) the Confucian ethic of female subordination was positively linked with suicide. We also discussed implications of our study for future research.

ID RISK-FACTORS; MENTAL-DISORDERS; PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSY; PREDICTORS;
   SEVERITY; SAMPLE
AB Background
   There are meagre data on Axis II personality disorders and suicidal behaviour in China.
   Aims
   To describe the prevalence of Axis II personality disorders in suicides and suicide attempts in China and to estimate risk. for these outcomes associated with personality disorders.
   Method
   People who died by suicide (n = 151), people who attempted suicide (n = 118) and living community controls (n = 140) were randomly sampled from four Chinese counties and studied using the Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) and Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II). We also determined the prevalence of subthreshold versions of ten DSM-IV personality disorders.
   Results
   Axis II personality disorders were present in 7% of the suicide group, 6% of the suicide attempt group and 1% of the control group. Threshold and subthreshold personality disorders had adjusted odds ratios (point estimates) in the range of 2.7-8.0 for suicide and for suicide attempts.
   Conclusions
   Axis II personality disorders may confer increased risk for suicidal behaviour in China, but their low prevalence in the community and among people with suicidal behaviour suggests that other personality constructs such as select dimensional traits may be a more fruitful avenue for understanding and preventing suicide in China.

AB In China, the gender ratio of suicide rates did not match the Western patterns, which was higher for females than males. However, the rural men were at relatively high risk of suicide in Liaoning province. Impulsivity was an important factor of suicide behaviors, but there was a lack of studies in China. This research aimed to study the relationship between impulsive personality traits and suicidal behavior among Chinese rural youths. Suicides were consecutively sampled from six randomly selected counties in Liaoning Province in China. Between 2005 and 2007, a total of 162 suicide victims were enrolled in the study along with 162 community controls matched for age, gender, and location. The psychological autopsy method was used to collect data from informants knowledgeable about the selected suicide victims and controls. The results showed the suicide victims in the study were more likely to demonstrate dysfunctional impulsivity and less likely to demonstrate functional impulsivity compared with the controls. Mental disorders, acute negative life events, and dysfunctional impulsivity contributed to the risk of suicide; educational and functional impulsivity were protective factors. Suicide prevention efforts in rural China may address impulsivity.

AB Background China accounts for more than 30% of the world's suicides and displays a unique pattern of suicide rates. Prior research had established the link between macrosocial changes and suicide. Comprehensive surveillance system of suicide in this rapidly developing country is much needed. This paper examined the trends of national-, region-, gender-, and age- specific suicide rates, and male to female ratios in suicide in China for the period of 1991 - 2000, which was a time that rapid economic and social changes took place.
   Methods A regression model was used to detect any variations in national-, region-, gender-, and age- specific suicide rates and gender ratios reported by the most recent mortality statistics from China's Ministry of Health.
   Results National, urban, and rural suicide rates for both men and women decreased significantly for the period of 1991 - 2000; age- specific suicide rates, however, showed that there were different patterns of changes in suicide rates in rural and urban areas. Although elderly suicide rates showed the most significant decrease in urban areas, younger women showed the largest decrease in rural areas; male to female gender ratio in suicide increased significantly in the urban areas, but no significant change was found in rural areas.
   Conclusions Possible explanations that may account for the downward trends in suicide rates and increase in male to female gender ratio in urban area were provided. Longer historical studies are needed to reveal the relationship between macrosocial changes and the pattern of suicide.

Data of 386 suicides and 416 living controls aged 15-34 years were used to analyze psychometric characteristics of SIS with 6 items. SIS with 6 items had high reliability and validity. Different characteristics were found between suicides with high intent and low intent. Hopelessness, depression, impulsivity, and approach coping skill were common factors of suicide with high and low intent. Education years, marriage, social support, and mental disorders were specific factors of suicide with low intent. High intent suicides had different characteristics from low intent suicides. SIS with 6 items is suitable for use in young rural China.

AB In the past decades, many studies have discussed the topic of suicide acceptability. However, there is no empirical study which identified that suicide acceptability is associated with suicide attempt worldwide. In the present study participants were 791 medically serious suicide attempters and controls aged 15 to 54 years in rural China. Suicide acceptability was evaluated by four questions in the General Social Survey and some social psychological variables were collected in a face-to-face interview. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association between suicide acceptability and suicide attempt. After controlling some social psychological variables, suicide acceptability was still associated with suicide attempt (odds ratio, 2.85; p < 0.001). Tired of living was the most acceptable reason for the medically serious suicide attempters (32.7%). Suicide acceptability should be assessed when we evaluate an individual's suicide risk. The results contribute to our understanding about suicide acceptability, and they may also be translated into practice in suicide prevention.

AB PurposeDistinctive and dramatic changes in the history of China with a rapid suicide decline in recent years present an opportunity to investigate the risk of suicide. In this study, we investigated suicide risk with a historical perspective with archived data to inform suicide research and prevention policies and strategies.MethodDocumented age-specific suicide mortality rates in 1987-2012 were decomposed into age, period, and cohort effect using APC-modeling method and intrinsic estimator (IE) technique. The estimated effects were further analyzed by numerical differentiation.ResultsThe data satisfactorily fit the constructed APC models. Cohort effect indicated that suicide risk in China fluctuated at very high levels during 1903-1967, followed by a sharp decline during 1968-1977, and reached the lowest level in 1983-1987 before increased again. Period effect confirmed the declining trend since 1987. Three sunny cohorts with reduced suicide risk and four cloudy cohorts with increased risk were, respectively, associated with significant cultural, social, political, and economic events in China since the 1900s.ConclusionsThe mega trends in the suicide risk at the population level are closely related to significant historical events in China. Suicide is anticipated to increase because of the growing risk for the young cohorts (particularly young females) as the country further develops. Study findings suggest the significance of national strategies for suicide prevention and control, including maintenance of social harmony and stability, provision of more opportunities for development, enhancement of social integration, and restriction of suicide facilitating factors.

AB IntroductionThis study attempts to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of online broadcasts of suicidality in China.
   MethodsA total of 193 incidents were identified by systematically searching for relevant news reports on the internet. A content analysis on these news reports was conducted to obtain information on the characteristics of each individual incident.
   ResultsOf these incidents, the ratio of males to females was 1:1.7 (age: 24.66.1years old). Approximately 45.4% and 70.8% of incidents were located in the region of Eastern China and Southern China, respectively, and 15.7% of incidents were unemployed. The most common suicide method was wrist cutting (57.5%), and the most common suicide location was at home (35.2%). Instant messaging apps (52.8%) were most frequently used for broadcasting suicidal thoughts and actions. Relationship breakup (61.1%) was reported as the leading cause of suicide. Furthermore, of the 193 incidents, 19 indicated that they suffered from a mental disorder, and 12 revealed that they had a history of suicide attempts. There were significant gender, age, regional, and occupational differences across the categories.
   DiscussionThis study indicates that in China, suicide prevention programmes need to target internet users.

AB Objective To compare the characteristics of suicides in the four main demographic groups: urban males, urban females, rural males and rural females in order to help clarify the demographic pattern of suicides in China. Methods A detailed psychological autopsy survey instrument was independently administered to 895 suicide victims in family members and close associates from 23 geographically representative locations from around the country. Results Pesticide ingestion accounted for 58% (519) of all suicides and 61% (318/519) of deaths were due to unsuccessful medical resuscitation. A substantial proportion (37%) of suicide victims did not have a mental illness. Among the 563 victims with mental illness, only 13% (76/563) received psychiatric treatment. Compared to other demographic groups, young rural females who died from suicide had the highest rate of pesticide ingestion (79%), the lowest prevalence of mental illness (39%), and the highest acute stress from precipitating life events just prior to the suicide. Conclusion Many suicides in China are impulsive acts of deliberate self-harm following acute interpersonal crises. Prevention of suicides in China must focus on improving awareness of psychological problems, improving mental health services, providing alternative social support networks for managing acute interpersonal conflicts, limiting access to pesticides, and improving the resuscitation skills of primary care providers.

AB Psychological strains are hypothesized to precede a suicidal intent that may lead to suicide, where psychological strains can be considered a function of social structure embedded with negative life events. This study aimed to test the potential relationship between psychological strains and suicidal intent in Chinese rural suicide attempters. Data regarding medically serious suicide attempters (N = 791) were gathered from county-level emergency rooms in randomly selected counties in rural China (15-54 years of age). Face-to-face interview data were obtained with semistructured instruments. Results showed that the strain variables interacted with gender in predicting degree of suicide intent in Chinese rural suicide attempters. Specifically, aspiration strain and coping strain were associated with suicide intent in Chinese male suicide attempters, whereas value strain was associated with suicide intent in Chinese female suicide attempters. This study supported the strain hypothesis in Chinese rural suicide attempters.

AB This study aimed to compare the mental disorders, psychological factors, and suicidal intent between high- and low-impulsivity Chinese rural young suicides. Rural young women and men aged 15 to 34 years who died by suicide and various risk factors were examined. The data were obtained using psychological autopsy method with instruments as Dysfunctional Impulsivity Scale, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R, Beck Hopeless Scale, Social Support Index, Coping Response Inventory, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and Beck Suicide Intent Scale. Compared with low-impulsivity suicides, the high-impulsivity suicides were younger, had less mental disorders, owned less social support, scored lower on approach coping and higher on avoidance coping, and scored a lower score on the Suicide Intent Scale. Characteristics of high-impulsivity suicides differed significantly from low-impulsivity suicides in rural China. It was important to develop different prevention and intervention strategies to reduce the suicide rate in China.

AB Objective: Previous research has shown a high rate and a unique pattern of suicide in China. We aim to present the current suicide rates and patterns in the Yunnan province, a multi-ethnic region in Southwestern China. Methods: This is a descriptive study based on the 3rd Chinese national mortality survey. We reported the suicide rates by sex, 5-year age group, region (urban or rural), and minority group from 2004 to 2005 in the Yunnan province. Results: We estimated a mean annual suicide rate of 19.82 per 100,000 and a total of 8751 suicide deaths per year. Sex-specific rate estimates were 21.09 per 100,000 and 18.46 per 100,000 for males and females, respectively. The male/female ratio was 1.14. Region-specific rate estimates were 20.60 per 100,000 and 19.18 per 100,000 for rural and urban regions, respectively. The rural-to-urban ratio was 1.07. Suicide accounted for 4.83% of all deaths in the Yunnan province and represented the fifth leading cause of death. In minority groups, the highest suicide rates were found in the Li su minority (50.75 per 100,000), the Jing po minority (36.38 per 100,000), the Meng gu minority (32.65 per 100,000) and the Miao minority (30.75 per 100,000). The lowest rates were found in the Hui minority (0.96 per 100,000) and the Ha ni minority (1.64 per 100,000). Conclusions: The suicide characteristics of this multi-ethnic region of China are different from those of the rest of China and the world, which indicates that the development of a special intervention strategy in multi-ethnic areas for suicide prevention is needed.

AB Suicide prevention has become a public health issue of great concern. Previous studies proved that ambient temperature had an impact on suicide death, but few studies focus on regional studies in large cities. We aimed to estimate the association between ambient temperature and suicide in 31 capital cities in China during 2008 similar to 2013. Distributed lag non-linear model was used to explore the relationship between ambient temperature and suicide, adjusting for long-term trend, seasonality, and humidity confounders. Multivariate meta-analysis was used to pool the city-specific estimates to explore the overall relative risk in China. High temperature had a significant impact on suicide death. The country-level relative risk of high temperature on suicide was 1.37 (95% CI, 0.96 similar to 2.57), and the RR was higher in male and age < 65-year-old group than that in female and age 65-year-old group. There has no consistent pattern of associations in city-level with sex and age. The high temperature has a greater impact on suicide in south region compared with north region. We found the positive association between ambient temperature and suicide in China.

AB Public media reports about suicide are likely to influence the population's suicidal attempts and completed suicides. Irresponsible reports might trigger copycat suicidal behaviors, while responsible reports may help reduce suicide rates. The World Health Organization (WHO) released recommendations to encourage responsible suicide reports in 2008. However, little is known about whether these recommendations are reflected in the suicide news for most countries, including China. In this study, we assessed the responsibility of suicide stories published in the most influential newspaper and Internet media sources in China from 2003 to 2015, using the media reporting recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO). In total, 3965 and 1836 eligible stories from newspaper and Internet-based media, respectively, were included in the study. Newspapers and Internet-based media performed similarly in applying WHO recommendations to report suicide news. Three recommendations were applied in over 88% of suicide stories. However, four recommendations were seldom applied, including offering information about where to seek help and linking the suicide event to mental disorders. Government and the journalism industry should work together to improve media reporting of news about suicide in China.

AB A subjective sense of burdensomeness toward loved ones has been posited as a marker for high risk of suicide. The present study applied the burdensomeness model of suicide to a sample of suicide notes from the People's Republic of China. High levels of burdensomeness toward loved ones was significantly and negatively correlated with lethality of suicide method among suicide notes, In addition, males were more likely than females to employ more lethal means of suicide. Theoretical explanations for these findings are discussed, highlighting potential cultural influences.

TI Suicide and the unique prevalence pattern of schizophrenia in mainland

SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article
ID PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSY; RISK-FACTORS; SEX; HEALTH
AB Background Unlike almost every other country in the world, the prevalence of both schizophrenia and suicide in China is higher in women than in men. Schizophrenia and suicide are important public-health problems for China that might be related to each other. We present prevalence data for schizophrenia and estimate relative and attributable risk of suicide in people with schizophrenia in mainland China.
   Methods We used data from the national psychiatric epidemiology study, the Ministry of Health's mortality registry, the census, and the national psychological autopsy study to estimate frequencies and rates of schizophrenia, suicide, and suicide in people with schizophrenia aged 15 years and older in mainland China during 1995-99.
   Findings We estimated 4.25 million people with schizophrenia in China, and 284 614 suicides and 28 737 suicides in people with schizophrenia yearly. Prevalence of schizophrenia was higher in women than men (relative risk 1.77 [95% CI 1.15-2.72]), and greater in urban than rural areas (1.62 [1.10-2.40]). Risk of suicide was greater in women than men (1.22 [1.20-1.23]) and in rural than urban areas (3.61 [3.56-3.66]). Relative risk of suicide in individuals with schizophrenia compared with those without was 23.8 (18.8-30.2); the proportion of all suicides attributable to schizophrenia was 9.7% (7.7-12.1). Relative risk of suicide in rural residents with schizophrenia versus those without was higher in men than in women (ratio of two relative risks 2.02 [1.13-3.63]), but in urban residents with schizophrenia the ratio was lower in men than women (0.56 [0.21-1.49]).
   Interpretation Risk factors for suicide vary in people with different mental disorders, so identification of illness-specific risk profiles would improve prediction of suicide and help tailor prevention efforts. The difference in suicide rates by sex and residential location in individuals with schizophrenia might be one of several contributing factors to the unique epidemiological pattern of schizophrenia in China.

AB Chinese suicide rates have been reported in various studies in the past two decades, but few of them were based on national data. The most recent mortality data (2002-2011) provided by the China Ministry of Health and the detailed census data provided by the National Population Census were used in this study. We calculated the age-, gender-, and region-specific suicide rates and their trends in the past 10years between 2002 and 2011. The overall suicide rates in China decreased during the study period. The rural/urban ratio of the suicide rates has been significantly reduced from the ratio in the 1990s, and male suicide rates have exceeded those of females. Age was positively associated with suicide rates without the two peaks found in the suicide rates over 20years ago. The Chinese suicide rates have significantly declined in the past decade, with withering of the unique suicide rate patterns previously found in Chinese suicides about 20years ago.

Results indicated that the SSI had high internal reliability and high item-total correlations. The SSI was highly correlated with measures of trait anxiety, hopelessness, and favorable attitude towards suicide. These findings indicated that the Chinese version of the SSI has excellent psychometric properties for measuring suicidal ideation in Chinese populations.

AB Objective
   This study aimed to examine the association between negative life events (NLEs) and attempted suicide in rural China.
   Methods
   Six rural counties were selected from disease surveillance points in Shandong province, China. A total of 409 suicide attempters in rural areas between October 1, 2009, and March 31, 2011, and an equal number of matched controls were interviewed. We compared negative life events experienced within 1 month, 1-3 months, 3-6 months, and 6-2 months prior to attempted suicide for cases and prior to interview for controls. We used multivariate logistic regression to examine the association between NLEs and attempted suicide.
   Results
   Suicide attempters experienced more NLEs within the last year prior to suicide attempt than controls prior to interview (83.1% vs. 33.5%). There was a significant dose-response relationship between NLEs experienced within the last year and increased risk of attempted suicide. Timing of NLEs analysis showed that NLEs experienced in the last month and 6-12 months prior to suicide attempt were significantly associated with elevated risk of attempted suicide, even after adjusting for mental disorders and demographic factors. Of NLEs, quarrelling with spouse, quarrelling with other family members, conflicting with friends or neighbors, family financial difficulty, and serious illness were independently related to attempted suicide.
   Conclusion
   NLEs are significantly associated with increased risk for attempted suicide in rural China. Stress management and intervention may be important to prevent suicidal behavior in rural China.

TI Information Accessibility of the Charcoal Burning Suicide Method in
   Mainland China
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MEDIA GUIDELINES; HONG-KONG; RATES; PREVENTION; TAIWAN; TRENDS; IMPACT
AB Background
   There has been a marked rise in suicide by charcoal burning (CB) in some East Asian countries but little is known about its incidence in mainland China. We examined media-reported CB suicides and the availability of online information about the method in mainland China.
   Methods
   We extracted and analyzed data for i) the characteristics and trends of fatal and nonfatal CB suicides reported by mainland Chinese newspapers (1998-2014); ii) trends and geographic variations in online searches using keywords relating to CB suicide (2011-2014); and iii) the content of Internet search results.
   Results
   109 CB suicide attempts (89 fatal and 20 nonfatal) were reported by newspapers in 13 out of the 31 provinces or provincial-level-municipalities in mainland China. There were increasing trends in the incidence of reported CB suicides and in online searches using CB-related keywords. The province-level search intensities were correlated with CB suicide rates (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.43 [95% confidence interval: 0.08-0.68]). Two-thirds of the web links retrieved using the search engine contained detailed information about the CB suicide method, of which 15% showed pro-suicide attitudes, and the majority (86%) did not encourage people to seek help.
   Limitations
   The incidence of CB suicide was based on newspaper reports and likely to be underestimated.
   Conclusions
   Mental health and suicide prevention professionals in mainland China should be alert to the increased use of this highly lethal suicide method. Better surveillance and intervention strategies need to be developed and implemented.

AB Background. Acts of suicide differ widely in the amount of planning preceding the act. Correlates of completed suicide in China identified in a previous investigation were re-examined to identify those that may be especially relevant to low-planned (impulsive) and high-planned suicidal behavior. The association of planning and method in completed suicide was also assessed.
   Method. A psychological autopsy study of 505 suicide decedents aged >= 18 years sampled to be representative of suicides in China was conducted. Multinomial regression analyses compared three levels of suicide planning (low, intermediate, high).
   Results. Women and younger individuals were more likely to carry out low-planned and intermediate-planned than high-planned acts of suicide. Greater acute stress distinguished low-planned from high-planned suicides. Ingestion of pesticides stored in the home was a more commonly employed method in low-planned than high-planned suicides.
   Conclusions. Low-planned suicides are more common in women, in younger individuals, and among those who are experiencing acute stress. Prevention strategies targeted at restricting access to pesticides may preferentially lower the rate of low-planned suicides.

ID SEASONAL-VARIATION; NEW-ZEALAND; HONG-KONG; AUSTRALIA; AGE;

AB Background: Many epidemiological studies indicate suicide rates are higher for males than females and for urban than rural, Here we re-examine gender, urban and rural differentials in suicide in Australia and Beijing (China). More specifically, to test the two hypotheses (i) that the male to female ratio is larger than one; (ii) that the urban suicide rate is higher than the rural in both places. Methods: Suicide data with information of gender, rural and urban regions for Australia and Beijing (China) for the period of 1991-1996 were used. Ratios between the gender-specific urban and rural suicides rates with the associated confidence intervals were constructed to examine gender, urban and rural differentials in Australia and Beijing. Results: The rural suicide rate in Beijing for both genders was higher than for their urban counterparts. Further, the elderly had the highest suicide rate followed by women aged 20-29. Also, the male to female ratio in China was less than one. In Australia, the rural male suicide rate was higher than the urban whereas the urban female suicide rate was higher than the rural. The male to female ratio was 4 to 1. The differences in rural to urban and male to female ratios between Australia and Beijing are statistically significant. Conclusions: In contrast to the west, male suicide rates are not higher than female rates in China. Urban rates are not necessarily higher than rural rates - not even in a western setting. Cultural factors and regional differences in socio-economic situation are significant in explaining the low gender ratio and the relatively higher suicide rates in rural China. Limitations: The suicide rate in the Beijing region might not exactly reflect the same for the whole of China. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BackgroundChina has an unusual pattern of suicides, with overall suicide rates in rural areas higher than urban areas. While suicide rates have decreased dramatically, older people increasingly contribute to the overall burden of suicide. However, it is unclear if elderly people within rural areas experience greater suicide risk than those in urban areas. We aimed to systematically review the incidence of suicide in rural and urban China among the elderly (aged over 60years), with a view to describing the difference in rates between rural and urban areas and trends over time.MethodsChinese and English language articles were searched for using four databases: EMBASE (Ovid), MEDLINE (Ovid), PsycINFO (EBSCOhost) and CNKI (in Chinese). Articles describing completed suicide among elderly people in both rural and urban areas in mainland China were included. The adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess risk of bias. One reviewer (ML) assessed eligibility, performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias, with areas of uncertainty discussed with the second reviewer (SVK). Random effects meta-analysis was conducted. Suicide methods in different areas were narratively summarised.ResultsOut of a total 3065 hits, 24 articles were included and seven contributed data to meta-analysis. The sample size of included studies ranged from 895 to 323.8 million. The suicide rate in the general population of China has decreased in recent decades over previous urban and rural areas. Suicide rates amongst the elderly in rural areas are higher than those in urban areas (OR=3.35; 95% CI of 2.48 to 4.51; I-2=99.6%), but the latter have increased in recent years. Insecticide poisoning and hanging are the most common suicide methods in rural and urban areas respectively. Suicide rates for these two methods increase with age, being especially high in elderly people.ConclusionsThe pattern of suicide in China has changed in recent years following urbanisation and aging. Differences in suicide rates amongst the elderly exist between rural and urban areas. Addressing the high suicide rate amongst the elderly in rural China requires a policy response, such as considering measures to restrict access to poisons.

AB Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a known major risk factor for suicide due to the high suicide mortality. However, studies comparing the characteristics of suicide attempters with major depressive disorder and those with no psychiatric diagnosis in China are very limited. This study examined and compared the sociodemographic and psychological characteristics of suicide attempters with MDD and those with no psychiatric diagnosis in emergency departments of general hospitals to better understand the risk factors for suicide attempts in China.
   Methods: All subjects were enrolled in the study between June 2007 and January 2008. A total of 127 suicide attempters-54 with MDD and 73 with no psychiatric diagnosis-were enrolled. The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were compared between two groups using the statistical analysis performed using frequency distribution, Student's t test, Chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test and a logistic regression model.
   Results: Suicide attempters with MDD were more likely to be more depressive, older, divorced or separated, unemployed, and living alone, and more likely to write a suicide note, have suicide ideation, and be motivated by reducing pain and burden. Suicide attempters with no psychiatric diagnosis were more likely to be younger and more impulsive, have self-rescue, and be motivated by threatening or taking revenge on others. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the following independent predictors of suicide attempts in individuals with MDD: a lower score on the quality of life scale, more years of education, and suicide ideation.
   Conclusions: The present study found both similarities and differences in the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of suicide attempters with MDD and those with no psychiatric diagnosis in the emergency departments of general hospitals in China. These findings will help us to recognize the characteristics of suicide attempters in both groups and develop specific interventions for the two types of suicide attempters to prevent future suicide in China. For example, the suicide attempters with MDD in the emergency departments must be advised to the psychological clinic.

AB ObjectiveIn the present study, we aim to test whether the approach or the avoidance coping skill can be a moderator between negative life events and suicide, and to test the deficient coping strain in the strain theory.
   MethodThis sample comprised 392 suicide cases and 416 community living controls, aged 15-34 years, from 16 rural counties in China. An established psychological autopsy method and a case-control design were used in this study. The 48-item Coping Response Inventory evaluated the degree of coping skills of the people who died by suicide.
   ResultsResults indicated that the avoidance coping skill, but not the approach coping skill, can moderate between negative life events and suicide.
   ConclusionThe low level of the avoidance coping skill may represent a promising variable for screening for suicide risk in rural China.

AB Reports on Chinese rural youth suicide indicated patterns different from those of the West. Only about 30% to 70% young victims had had diagnoses of psychiatric illnesses (Phillips et al., Lancet 359: 835-840, 2002; Xiao et al., Chin J Psychiatry 36: 129-131, 2003), and more than 60% of them used pesticides as suicide means (Wang et al., Lancet 372: 1765-1773, 2008). To prevent suicides in rural China, it is important to know the choice of means by Chinese young suicide victims with and without mental disorders. Data on suicide cases in China's rural areas gathered from a big psychological autopsy study were studied for demographic characteristics, suicide methods, and the presence of mental disorders. The findings in the suicide victims with and without mental disorders showed significant differences in suicide method selecting. Victims with mental disorders tended to select violent methods compared with those without mental disorders (31.4% vs. 16.2%). Hanging is method more likely chosen by the mentally disordered victims (13.3%) than those without a mental disorder (7.8%). Mental status affects the means choice among the Chinese rural young suicide victims. Among them, the female victims without mental disorders tended to act on impulsivity and used nonviolent means such as pesticide consumption for suicide. This study informs suicide prevention measures in both China and rest of the world.

AB Objective: To analyze the factors associated with recent suicide attempts including socio-demographic and clinical characteristics in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients in China.
   Methods: The data were from a nationwide sample from 13 major psychiatric hospitals or the psychiatric units of general hospitals in China, from September 1, 2010 to February 28, 2011. Melancholic features and suicide attempts in the past month were defined according to the melancholic feature module and the suicide module of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between MDD patients with and without recent suicide attempts. Further analyses regarding the factors associated with recent suicide attempts in MDD patients were performed via multivariate logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Among 1,172 MDD patients, 57 (4.9%) were reported to have made a suicide attempt in the past month. Compared to the MDD patients without recent suicide attempt, significantly higher percentage of patients in the recent suicide attempters group had previous suicide attempts (chi(2) = 171.861, p < 0.001) and depressive episodes with melancholic features (chi(2) = 22.837, p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis indicated that previous suicide attempts (OR = 20.81, 95% CI: 11.12-38.94, p < 0.001) and depressive episodes with melancholic features (OR = 4.43, 95% CI: 2.09-9.43, p < 0.001) were independently associated with recent suicide attempts in MDD patients.
   Limitations: Cross-sectional design, retrospective recall of suicide attempt data.
   Conclusion: Recent suicide attempts are associated with melancholic features and previous suicide attempts in MDD patients in China. These data may help clinicians to identify MDD patients at high risk of suicide attempt behavior.

TI Predictors of low-intent and high-intent suicide attempts in rural China
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID YOUTH SUICIDE; RISK-FACTORS; LETHALITY; RATES
AB Objectives. Acts of suicide are heterogeneous with respect to level of intent. Data on correlates of intent are overwhelmingly from Western samples. We sought to identify correlates of low-intent and high-intent suicide attempts in China.
   Methods. We compared 277 adult case patients who presented to the emergency department in a rural hospital because of attempted suicide to 277 community control individuals, pair-matched for age, gender, and location of residence. Attempted suicides were stratified into 3 levels of suicide intent: low, intermediate, and high. Paired logistic regression analyses were used to analyze the data.
   Results. High-intent acts of suicide were associated with major depression, chronic stress, and a relative or associate who had a history of suicidal behavior. These correlates were not associated with low-intent acts of suicide.
   Conclusions. High-intent acts of suicide in China are the culmination of long-standing difficulties or symptoms including depression, chronic stress, and previous exposure to suicidal behavior. Prevention of high-intent acts of suicide should include a focus on these domains.

AB Suicide in college students has become an important public health issue in China. The aim of this study was to identify the differences between suicide attempters and suicide ideators based on a cross-sectional survey. Our results indicate that although female gender, positive screening for psychiatric illness, positive family history of suicide, elevated overall impulsivity, and elevated motor impulsivity were correlated with suicidal ideation, only positive family history of suicide and high motor impulsivity could differentiate suicide attempters from suicidal ideators. Future research with a longitudinal and prospective study design should be conducted to confirm these findings. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide is one of the leading causes of inmate death, and many studies have explored suicidal risks among inmates in Western countries. Such studies, however, have been extremely rare in China. Because of China's unique cultural and social conditions, suicide displays many distinctive features and one of them is the greater percentage of women (than men) who commit suicide. With data collected from three adult prisons in China, this study tests gender differences on prison inmates' suicidal risk factors and explores the correlation of gender's impact with other factors. Findings show that male and female inmates present distinctive patterns of suicidal ideation, although gender fails to exert a significant direct impact on the outcome. The results call for different approaches and treatments toward both gender groups for suicide prevention in Chinese correctional facilities.

AB Background The population of left-behind children is growing rapidly in China in recent years. Without parents' company, left-behind children may develop severe emotional problems, which can trigger extreme behaviours such as self-harm and suicide. Previous literature suggests that mindfulness-based intervention could effectively alleviate a variety of sufferings such as anxiety and suicide ideation. The current study sought to examine the effectiveness of mindfulness-based intervention on suicide ideation among left-behind children in China. Methods This study investigated the effects of an 8-week mindfulness training programme on suicide ideation of left-behind children in China. Forty-nine left-behind children completed a pretest and posttest on mindfulness level, social anxiety, self-esteem, and suicide ideation, with 21 in the mindfulness training group and 28 in the waitlist control group. Results Adjusting for pretest differences analyses of covariance found that, compared with waitlist control group, the mindfulness training group showed a significant improvement in mindfulness level and decreases in social anxiety and suicide ideation after the 8-week mindfulness training. Conclusion The findings from this study support that the use of mindfulness-based intervention can effectively reduce the suicide ideation and social anxiety of left-behind children in China.

AB This paired case-control study aimed to compare characteristics between suicide attempters with high and low suicide intent in rural China. We evaluated 409 suicide attempters and their paired controls who were matched with the same gender, age (a difference of no more than 3 years), and similar residence. Compared to paired control, suicide attempt with high and low suicide intent shared the 3 common risk factors of negative life event, high depression score, and low social support score. In addition, mental disorder was an independent risk factor of suicide attempt with high intent. Having a low education level and occupation as a farmer were risk factors of suicide attempt with low intent. Mental disorder and depression were associated with a significantly increased risk of suicide attempt with high intent compared to low intent. Depression was found to be related to suicide attempt with high intent compared to low intent in the subgroups of male or female aged 35-54 or 55-70 years. Distinct characteristics were found in the suicide attempters with different intent. These findings are important and the aim is to transform them into concrete ideas for the prevention of suicide attempt in rural China.

AB Objective The objective of this meta-analysis is to estimate the pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in the general population of Mainland China.
   Methods A systematic literature search was conducted via the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, China Journals Full-Text Databases, Chongqing VIP database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, and Wan Fang Data. Statistical analysis used the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis program.
   Results Eight studies met the inclusion criteria for the analysis; five reported on the prevalence of suicidal ideation and seven on that of suicide attempts. The estimated lifetime prevalence figures of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts were 3.9% (95% confidence interval: 2.5%-6.0%) and 0.8% (95% confidence interval: 0.7%-0.9%), respectively. The estimated female-male ratio for lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts was 1.7 and 2.2, respectively. Only the difference of suicide attempts between the two genders was statistically significant.
   Conclusion This was the first meta-analysis of the prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in the general population of Mainland China. The pooled lifetime prevalence of both suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are relatively low; however, caution is required when assessing these self-report data. Women had a modestly higher prevalence for suicide attempts than men. The frequency for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in urban regions was similar to those in rural areas.

LA English
DT Article
DE suicide; risk factors; adolescent; young adult
ID RATING-SCALE; RATES; AGE; CHILD
AB Background: In China, suicide is one of the major causes of death among adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 34 years. Aim: The current study examines how risk factors vary by age groups in rural China, referring to those aged 15 to 24 years and those aged 25 to 34 years. Method: A case-control psychological autopsy (PA) study is conducted in sixteen counties from three Chinese provinces, including 392 suicide cases and 416 community living controls in the sample. Results: In China, young adults aged 25 to 34 years have a higher risk for suicide than adolescents aged 15 to 24 years, and it holds true even controlling for relevant social factors. In addition, age-related factors such as education, marital status, whether having children, status in the family, physical health, and personal income all have varying degrees of impact on suicide risks for rural youth. Conclusions: This study shows that there are some age-related risk factors for suicide at certain life stages and emphasizes that young adults in rural China aged 25 to 34 years have an increased risk of suicide as a result of experiencing more psychological strains with age.

TI Case-Control Study in China of Risk Factors for Suicide in Men With

LA English
DT Article
ID PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSY; COMPLETED SUICIDE; AXIS I
AB Objective: This secondary analysis of China's National Psychological Autopsy Study assesses the risk factors for suicide among men with alcohol use disorders (AUDs)-the second most common psychiatric diagnosis among suicide decedents in China. Method: Based on data collected from family members and close associates, the characteristics of 68 men with AUDs who died by suicide and 51 men with AUDs who died of other injuries at 23 geographically representative locations in China were compared using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Interactions between AUDs and other risk factors for suicide were explored using data from 448 male suicide decedents and 521 men who died from accidental injuries. Results: After adjusting for covariates, risk factors for suicide among men with AUDs were history of previous suicide attempts (odds ratio [OR] = 46.72, 95% Cl [4.70, 464.89]), acute negative life events in the 2 days before death (OR = 18.92, 95% CI [3.32, 107.88]), and comorbid major depressive disorder (OR = 14.65, 95% Cl [2.93, 73.31]). These three factors accounted for 54.3% of the variance in outcome. There was a statistically significant interaction between AUDs and major depression; the association between major depression and suicide risk was weaker in men with AUDs than in men without AUDs. Conclusions: Among men with AUDs in China, prior suicidal behavior, acute life events, and major depression confer risk for suicide. However, the risk associated with depression in men with AUDs is somewhat less than the risk of suicide associated with depression in men without AUDs. (J Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 73, 15-20, 2012)

AB Background: Suicide intervention programs have been guided by findings that attitude towards suicide and suicidal behavior may be causally linked. These findings also make it imperative to identify the factors that influence attitudes towards suicide. However, there has been little research on attitudes towards suicide among the general population, especially in low-income and middle-income countries. This population-based, cross-sectional study investigated the associated factors of attitudes towards suicide among a representative sample of urban and rural adult residents in China.
   Methods: A multi-stage, stratified random sampling approach was implemented to select participants. Data were collected by a survey using the Scale of Public Attitudes about Suicide ( SPAS). The survey also collected some socio-demographic factors and suicidal history of participants. Statistical tests were conducted to identify associated factors that account for variations in attitudes towards suicide.
   Results: The residents in China generally hold a neutral attitude towards suicide. Attitudes towards suicide among Chinese residents were associated with age, duration of formal education, marital status, job and suicidal ideation. Different attitudinal subscales seemed not to share the same risk factors. However, gender, ethnicity, religious belief, housing style and economic status might not influence residents' attitudes towards suicide. Attitudes towards suicide among Chinese urban and rural residents generally had no statistical difference with one notable exception: opinions on whether or not suicides and suicide attempts are different phenomena.
   Conclusions: Age, duration of formal education, marital status, job and suicidal ideation seem to have an impact on attitudes towards suicide among residents. Urban and rural residents have similar attitudes towards suicide with the only statistically significance difference being their opinions on whether or not suicides and suicide attempts are different phenomena.

AB The strain theory of suicide postulates that suicide is usually preceded by psychological strains. A strain can be a consequence of any of four conflicts: differential values, aspiration and reality, relative deprivation, and lack of coping skills for a crisis. This study, with a blend of psychiatric and social predictors of suicide, identified correlates of suicide that are relevant to Chinese culture and tested the strain theory of suicide with Chinese data. We sampled 392 suicides and 416 living controls (both aged 15-34 years) from 16 rural counties in China in 2008 and interviewed two informants for each suicide and each control. We found that marriage and religion/religiosity did not distinguish the suicides from the living controls among Chinese rural young women. Religion/religiosity tended to be stronger for suicides than for controls. Psychological strains in the forms of relative deprivation, unrealized aspiration, and lack of coping skills were significantly associated with suicide, even after accounting for the role of mental illness. The strain theory of suicide forms a challenge to the psychiatric model popular in the West, at least in explaining the Chinese suicide. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Suicide is the fifth most important cause of death in China and the leading cause of death among young adults aged 15-34 years. The suicide rate in rural China is three times higher than the urban suicide rate, and the rate in women is higher than in men.
   Methods: Sixteen counties from three provinces were selected as sampling sites in which 392 suicide cases and 416 community living controls were obtained. For each suicide case and control there were two informants who provided the target person's information. A structured questionnaire including demographics, social and familial environments, and personal characteristics was administered to the informants.
   Results: Mental disorders and high hopelessness were found to be strongly related to suicide among Chinese rural young adults. Other suicide risk factors among this population were negative life events, never married but dating, suicide history in family, lack of positive coping skills, lack of social support, dysfunctional impulsivity, and not being a Communist Party/League member.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of mental disorders, although the strongest risk factor among rural young adult suicides in this study, was markedly lower than that in Western countries. Some of the risk factors found in the comprehensive analyses are specific to Chinese culture. "Being a Communist Party/League member" as a protective factor for suicide among Chinese rural youths requires further study and appropriate interpretation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objectives: The objective of this study was to estimate the features of suicide rate and its association with economic development and stock market during the past decade in the People's Republic of China.
   Methods: Official data were gathered and analyzed in the People's Republic of China during the period 2004-2013. Nationwide suicide rate was stratified by four year age-groups, sex, urban/rural areas, and regions (East, Central, and West). Annual economic indexes including gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and rural and urban income per capita were all adjusted for inflation. Variation coefficient of market index (VCMI) was also included as an economic index to measure the fluctuation of the stock market. Negative binomial regression was performed to examine the time trend of region-level suicide rates and effects of sex, age, urban/rural area, region, and economic index on the suicide rates.
   Results: Suicide rates of each age-group, sex, urban/rural area, and region were generally decreased from 2004 to 2013, while annual GDP per capita and rural and urban income per capita were generally increased by year. VCMI fluctuated largely, which peaked around 2009 and decreased after that time. Negative binomial regression showed that the decreased suicide rate in East and Central rural areas was the main cause of the decrease in suicide rate in the People's Republic of China. Suicide rate in the People's Republic of China for the study period increased with age and was higher in rural than in urban area, higher in males than in females, and the highest in the Central region. When GDP per capita increased by 2,787 RMB, the suicide rate decreased by 0.498 times. VCMI showed no significant relationship with suicide rate in the negative binomial regression.
   Conclusion: Suicide rate decreased in 2004-2013; varied among different age-groups, sex, urban/rural areas, and regions; and was negatively associated with the economic growth in the People's Republic of China. Stock market showed no relationship with suicide rate, but this finding needs to be verified in a future study.

AB Objective We aimed to test the association of polymorphisms in HTR2A, TPH1, and TPH2 genes with attempted suicide in rural China.
   Participants and methods On the basis of a case-control study, we recruited 1200 pairs of participants from Shandong Province, China. The blood samples of 712 suicide attempters and 739 nonsuicide attempters were collected finally. We tested seven single nucleotide polymorphisms: rs6313 and rs6311 in HTR2A, rs4537731, rs1800532, and rs1799913 in TPH1, and rs4448731 and rs4641527 in TPH2.
   Results In univariate analysis, allele C of rs4537731 was associated negatively with attempted suicide among total and male samples; however, the association was not statistically significant in multivariate analysis after adjusting for other potential confounding factors. No association between other six single nucleotide polymorphisms and attempted suicide was found in the total, male, or female samples.
   Conclusion This study did not support the effect of these seven serotonergic gene polymorphisms on attempted suicide in rural China. Copyright (C) 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives
   As only about 50% of Chinese suicides have mental disorders, nonpsychiatric factors such as social environment and personality may account for the variance that is not explained by mental problems. We try to explore the effects of impulsivity on Chinese suicides and the role impulsivity plays in the relationship between negative life events (NLEs) and suicidal behavior.
   Method
   A total of 392 suicide cases (178 female and 214 male, aged 15-34 years) and 416 community controls (202 males and 214 females) of the same age range were sampled in China. The case-control data were obtained using psychological autopsy method with structured and semistructured instruments.
   Results
   Impulsivity was an important predictor of Chinese rural young suicides and it was a moderator between NLEs and suicide.
   Conclusions
   Findings of the study may be translated into practical measures in suicide prevention in China as well as elsewhere in the world.

AB The prevalence of various mental disorders and their age and gender specific characteristics among suicide attempters remains unclear in rural China. This study using 1:1 paired case-control design included 409 suicide attempters and 409 paired controls matched on age, gender and place of residence. Mental disorders were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders. The prevalence of mental disorders was 32.3% for suicide attempters and 4.9% for paired controls. Mental disorder constituted a significant risk factor for suicide attempt with an adjusted odds ratio of 7.16 (95%Cl: 3.65-14.04). The prevalence of mental disorders was higher among male than female suicide attempters. Major depressive disorder was most common in female suicide attempters while alcohol use disorder was most common in the males. The prevalence of mental disorders seemed to increase with age. Suicide attempters of higher ages were more prone to have mood disorders, especially a major depression. Suicide attempters with mental disorders differed from those without mental disorders on a number of socio-economic characteristics and suicidal behavior features. These insights should be taken into account in strategies and efforts to improve mental health care and ultimately to reduce suicidal behavior among residents in rural China.

AB Background: The number of older adults (OAs) is growing rapidly and the elderly suicide rate (ESR) is highest among all age-groups in China. Examining the epidemiology of elderly suicide (ES) may facilitate population-specific suicide prevention efforts, however, little is known about the patterns of ES in China. Objective: To describe the rates and characteristics of ES in China during 2013-14.
   Methods: Suicide mortality data by gender, quinquennial age-group, residence (urban/rural) and geographic location (east/central/west) were obtained from China's Integrated National Mortality Surveillance System for 2013-14. Crude ESRs of OAs aged 65 years or above were standardized to the 2010 China's Census population and adjusted for under-reporting.
   Results: While OAs comprised 8.9% of the Chinese population, they represented 38.2% of suicide deaths. The average annual ESR in China was 34.5 per 100000 in 2013-14. ESRs varied widely across OA subgroups, with the highest rates in central rural men (67.1) and women (53.1), and the lowest rate in eastern urban women (13.6). Male gender (incident rate ratio [IRR]=1.47), every five-year increase in age (IRR=1.33), rural residence (IRR=1.83), and geographic location of central China (IRR=1.93) were significantly associated with increased number of ESs.
   Limitations: Information on means of ES are lacking in the data source.
   Conclusions: ESs disproportionately account for a large portion of China's current total suicides, and ESR, particularly in central rural OAs, is very high in China. Prevention of ES should be given priority as an important public health issue in China. Central rural OAs are key target population for current ES prevention. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Aims. Suicide-related behaviours are common in schizophrenia and are significantly associated with premature death. The objective of this meta-analysis study was to estimate the pooled prevalence of suicide-related behaviours in schizophrenia patients in China. Methods. The relevant literature was searched systematically via the relevant electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Databases and Chinese Biological Medical Literature Database) from their inception until 14 September 2016. Only original studies that reported the prevalence of suicide-related behaviours including suicidal ideation (SI), suicide plan, suicide attempt (SA) and completed suicide were selected. Results. Nineteen articles met the inclusion criteria and were analysed. The pooled lifetime prevalence of SI and SA were 25.8% (95% CI 14.7-41.1%) and 14.6% (95% CI 9.1-22.8%), respectively. The 1-month prevalence of SI was 22.0% (95% CI 18.2-26.4%). Subgroup analyses of lifetime SI and SA showed that gender, sample size, survey year, study location and source of patients have no significant mediating effects on the results. Conclusions. Suicide-related behaviours are common in Chinese schizophrenia patients. Due to the high mortality risk, regular screening and effective suicide prevention programmes are warranted.

AB The suicide rate of females is very close to that of males in China, in contrast to Western societies, in which the rates of male suicide outnumber those of females by three to four times. This study investigated the prevalence of suicidal ideation and prosuicide attitude (acceptability) among females of childbearing age. With the Chinese version of the Scale for Suicide Ideation and the General Social Survey questionnaire, we examined the demographic and psychological risk factors of suicide among Chinese rural young females aged 15 to 34 years. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the factors related to suicidal ideation and suicide acceptability. The prevalence rates of suicidal ideation and suicide acceptability among the sampled females are 22.5% and 3.8%, respectively. Education, depression, social support, hopelessness, and negative life events were significantly associated with suicidal ideation. Ethnicity, education, abortion, and depression were significantly associated with suicide acceptability. There is statistical difference between suicide ideation and acceptability. The results indicate that mental disorder remains a major risk factor of suicidal ideation. Sociodemographic and psychological characteristics are associated with suicide acceptability.

AB Objective: Previous research on sociocultural factors for Chinese suicide have been basically limited to single case studies or qualitative research with ethnographic methodology. The current study examines the major risk factors and some cultural uniqueness related to Chinese rural suicide using a quantitative design.
   Method: This is a case control study with 66 completed suicides and 66 living controls obtained from psychological autopsy interviews in rural China.
   Results: Both bivariate analyses and the multiple regression model have found that the Chinese rural suicide patterns are basically similar to those in most other cultures in the world: strong predictors of rural Chinese suicide are the psychopathological, psychological, and physical health variables, followed by social support and negative and stressful life events. Other significant correlates include lower education, poverty, religion, and family disputes.
   Conclusion: Culture has an important impact on suicide patterns in a society.

ID INTERNET; BEHAVIOR
AB Objective: This study analyzed the online suicide-related contents of Chinese-language Web sites compared with contents observed in an American study that considered English-language Web sites, so as to examine what differences there might be between Chinese online information and its English counterpart.
   Method: Online contents were generated by entering 4 suicide-related search queries into 5 popular search engines (Google China, Yahoo! China, Live search, Baidu, and Sogou) in mainland China in September 2008. The search queries were simplified Chinese translations of terms used in a 2008 American study that used similar methodology: Zi Sha (suicide), Ru He Zi Sha (how to commit suicide), Zen Yang Zi Sha (how to kill yourself), and Zi Sha Fang Fa (suicide method). Three coders from mainland China reviewed the first 3 pages of results from each search and rated their contents in terms of the attitude toward suicide reflected therein (pro-suicide, anti-suicide, neutral, not a suicide site, or error [page would not load]). Other characteristics of the Web sites were analyzed. The results were then compared with those of the earlier study of English-language Web sites.
   Results: Of the Chinese Web sites, a smaller proportion carried pro-suicide information compared with the corresponding results obtained from the study of English-language Web sites (4.2% vs 11.7%), whereas the proportion of anti-suicide Web sites in both languages was almost the same (32.3% vs 34.9%). Anti-suicide Web sites in Chinese, however, provided less information on seeking help, and there were fewer government or professional mental health Web sites in Chinese (1.3% vs 13.3%). The pro-suicide information on Chinese Web sites was mostly found in personal blogs or online forums.
   Conclusion: Psychiatrists and public health researchers dealing with suicide prevention in China should be aware of the differences between online suicide-related information in the Chinese and English languages.

AB Suicide attempts are more frequent than suicides, and suicidal ideation has been identified as an important precursor of both attempted and completed suicide. In this study, we compare the characteristics of suicide attempters with suicidal ideation and suicide attempters without suicidal ideation who were treated in the emergency departments of general hospitals in China. We identified 166 people as having suicidal ideation and 73 people who did not have suicidal ideation. The suicide attempters with suicidal ideation were more likely to be more depressed, older, have a lower score on life quality, female, divorced and unemployed, report having religious beliefs, have a suicide attempt history and a psychiatric diagnosis, and intend to reduce pain as motives. However, the suicide attempters without suicidal ideation were more likely to have a more self-rescue ideation and were more impulsive, and to threaten or intend revenge on others as motives. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the following independent predictors of suicidal ideation in the suicide attempters: a higher score on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, religious beliefs, non-impulsive suicide attempts, and a psychiatric diagnosis. The results indicate the importance of developing different interventions for the two groups to prevent future suicide in China.

AB The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11) is an important tool for measuring impulsivity in suicide research. This study aimed to assess psychometric characteristics of Chinese version of BIS-11 in suicides and controls of rural China. Data of 200 pairs of suicide cases and living controls were collected by psychological autopsy method. The Cronbach's alpha coefficients of BIS-11 were 0.936 for suicides, and 0.892 for living controls. Convergent validity analysis demonstrated a significantly positive correlation between the scores of BIS-11 with the scores of Beck Hopelessness Scale and Trait Anxiety Inventory. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that the BIS-11 structure was basically suitable in rural China. With its high reliability, few items in BIS-11 may need a modification in order to further improve the construct validity of this instrument for suicide research in rural China.

AB To estimate the effect of social factors in the neighborhood environment on suicide risks, we studied 392 suicides and 416 controls, all aged 15-34 years, consecutively and randomly selected from 16 rural counties in three provinces of China. The social factors in the village neighborhood were measured by the WHO scale of Community Stress and Problems. The individual scores as well as the sum scores of the Community Stress Problems were compared between the suicides and the controls, and multilevel logit regressions were performed for the social structural stresses and community behavioral problems and other confounding variables to test the roles of community stress and problems in Chinese rural young suicide risks. It is found that neighborhood stresses and problems increase rural Chinese suicide risks, while certain problems, such as in health care, alcohol abuse, job security, family dispute, and transportation, play more important roles than others to increase rural Chinese suicide risks. Social risk factors such as the community stresses and problems can be another area to work on for the suicide prevention.

AB Background: Although late-life suicide in rural China is a matter of concern, research is scarce addressing the association between capability of daily living activities, family function, and late-life suicide. We conducted this psychological autopsy study to explore associations between disability in daily living activities, family dysfunction, and late-life suicide in rural China. Methods: Using a 1:1 matched case-control design, we collected data from 242 elderly suicide cases and 242 living community controls in rural China using the psychological autopsy method. We used Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (SCID), Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADL), and Family Adaptive, Partnership, Growth, Affection and Resolve scale (APGAR) to assess the presence of mental disorders, capability of daily living activities, and family function, respectively. Results: Compared with the living controls, suicide cases presented more severe impairment in capability of daily living activities and poorer family function. After controlling for all other factors, capability of daily living activities and family function remained in the final model. The results of the multivariate analysis also show that the presence of a mental disorder, lower levels of social support, and increased number of life events in the last year were significantly associated with elevated suicide risk. Conclusions: Disability in daily living activities and family dysfunction are associated with elevated risk of late-life suicide in rural China. It is warranted to design programs, including family interventions, peer-support groups, and community programs, to help the rural elderly improve activities of daily living and obtain the social support they need to prevent suicidal behaviors.

AB Background. Suicide in China has declined since the 1990s. However, there has been limited investigation of the potential spatiotemporal variation and social determinants of suicide during subsequent periods.
   Method. Annual suicide counts from 2006 to 2012 stratified by county, 5-year age group (515 years) and gender were obtained from the Chinese Disease Surveillance Points system. Trends and geographic differentials were examined using multilevel negative binomial regression models to explore spatiotemporal variation in suicide, and the role of key socio-demographic factors associated with suicide.
   Results. The suicide rate (per 100 000) in China decreased from 14.7 to 9.1, 2006-2012. Rates of suicide were higher in males than females and increased substantially with age. Suicide rates were higher in rural areas compared with urban areas; however, urban-rural disparities reduced over time with a faster decline for rural areas. Within both urban and rural areas, higher rates of suicide were evident in areas with lower socio-economic circumstances (SEC) [rate ratio (RR) 1.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-2.62]. Suicide rates varied more than twofold (median RR 2.06) across counties, and were highest in central and southwest regions of China. A high proportion of the divorced population, especially for younger females, was associated with lower suicide rates (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46-0.79).
   Conclusions. Geographic variations for suicide should be taken into account in policy making, particularly for older males living in rural areas and urban areas with low SEC. Measures to reduce disparities in socio-economic level and alleviate family relation stress are current priorities.

SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article
AB Background Suicide is the fifth most important cause of death in China, but the reasons for the high rate and unique pattern of characteristics of those who kill themselves are unknown.
   Methods We pretested, and then administered a comprehensive interview to family members and close associates of 519 people who committed suicide and of 536 people who died from other injuries (controls) randomly selected from 23 geographically representative sites in China.
   Findings After adjustment for sex, age, location of residence, and research site, eight significant predictors of suicide remained in the final unconditional logistic regression model. In order of importance they were: high depression symptom score, previous suicide attempt, acute stress at time of death, low quality of life, high chronic stress, severe interpersonal conflict in the 2 days before death, a blood relative with previous suicidal behaviour, and a friend or associate with previous suicidal behaviour. Suicide risk increased substantially with exposure to multiple risk factors: none of the 265 deceased people who were exposed to one or fewer of the eight risk factors died by suicide, but 30% (90/299) with two or three risk factors, 85% (320/377) with four or five risk factors, and 96% (109/114) with six or more risk factors died by suicide.
   Interpretation Despite substantial differences between characteristics of people who commit suicide in China and the west, risk factors for suicide do not differ greatly. Suicide prevention programmes that concentrate on a single risk factor are unlikely to reduce suicide rates substantially; preventive efforts should focus on individuals exposed to multiple risk factors.

   We summarized the main reasons for the suicide of Chinese doctors from 2004 to 2017, and the main causes included clinical working stress, Job title promotion requirements stress, tension between the doctors and patients, and shying away from necessary treatment of their illness.
   It is a cruel fact that more and more physicians died of suicide in China. We hope that suicide among Chinese doctors could be recognized so that it could be concerned with the understanding of human societies.

AB The aims of this study were: (1) to present the time trend of suicide rate among people aged 15 or above in China over the period 2002-2011 and (2) to examine the current profile of completed suicides during 2009-2011.
   Data on suicide rate in 2002-2011 were provided by the Chinese Ministry of Health (MOH). The trends of region-, gender-, and age-specific suicide rates were examined using Poisson regression models. The mean number of completed suicides for each cohort during 2009-2011 was calculated and a mean national suicide rate was estimated.
   The overall suicide rate decreased significantly over the past decade, but rates in young males and rural older adults did not reduce and in fact increased among older adults in both urban and rural areas towards the end of the study period. For 2009-2011, 44 % of all suicides occurred among those aged 65 or above and 79 % among rural residents. The estimated mean national suicide rate was 9.8 per 100,000 and was slightly higher for males than females.
   The benefits of economic growth, such as higher employment and more educational opportunities for the rural population in particular, may have contributed to the reduced suicide rate in China. However, the recent rapid changes in socioeconomic conditions could have increased stress levels and resulted in more suicides, especially among the elderly. Despite the significant reduction reported here, the latest figures suggest the declining trend is reversing. It will be important to continue monitoring the situation and to examine how urbanization and economic changes affect the well-being of 1.3 billion Chinese.

AB Objectives: Identify distinguishing characteristics of subgroups of suicides classified according to different patterns of alcohol use prior to death.
   Methods: Three groups of suicide decedents from a representative sample of 454 male suicides in China identified in a national psychological autopsy study were classified and compared: decedents with an alcohol use disorder during the year prior to death, those without an alcohol use disorder who used alcohol acutely at the time of suicide, and those with neither an alcohol use disorder nor acute use.
   Results: Compared with suicides unrelated to alcohol, those with an alcohol use disorder were more likely to have made previous suicide attempts (adjusted OR, 95%Cl = 1.94, 1.07-3.53). and suicides with acute alcohol use were less likely to have poor overall functioning in the month before death (0.36, 0.20-0.63).
   Conclusions: The characteristics of male suicide decedents with an alcohol use disorder, using alcohol acutely but without an alcohol use disorder, and with no alcohol involvement are somewhat different, suggesting the potential value of tailored prevention strategies.

AB Background: Suicide rates in China are among the highest in the world, although there has been a decreasing trend in the past few years. One practical approach to study this characteristics and risk factors of suicide is to interview the suicide attempters. It was to compare completed suicides with serious attempters that may shed lights on suicide prevention strategies.
   Method: This is a combination of two case control studies for suicide completers and suicide attempters respectively. After a sample of suicides (n=392) and community living controls (n=416) were obtained and studied in rural China, we collected in the same rural areas data of suicide attempt and studied 507 medically serious attempters and 503 community counterparts.
   Results: Characteristics and previously observed risk factors were compared between the suicides and the attempters, and we found that the demographic characteristics and risk factors for the suicides were also for the medically serious attempters but at some lesser degrees for the attempters than for the suicides. It was especially true of suicide intent, deficient coping, negative life events, and impulsivity. While most of the demographic characteristics were not significantly different between the suicides and the attempters, most of the clinical variables could distinguish the two groups.
   Conclusions: The suicide victims and the serious attempters could be of the same group of people who were at the edge of fatal self-injury, and the same clinical risk factors but of different degrees have divided them into the life and death groups. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB Depression is a well-established predictor of suicidal behaviors, yet its effects among Chinese rural suicide attempters are understudied. In this study, we examined the role of depressive symptoms with other common risk factors, such as impulsivity, among medically serious suicide attempters. A case-controlled study was conducted in 13 rural counties in China. Medically serious suicide attempters (n = 791) and 791 nonsuicidal controls matched for sex and age range (+/- 3 years) in the same location were recruited and interviewed to obtain information with regard to demographics, depressive symptom severity, and psychological strain measures. Both depressive symptoms, assessed with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and psychological strains predicted suicide attempt risk, and psychological strains significantly predicted depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms fully mediated the relations between value strain, deprivation strain, and suicide attempt risk, and partially mediated the associations among aspiration strain, coping strain, and suicide attempt risk. The reduction of psychological strains may help decrease both depression and suicidal behaviors.

AB This study aims to explore the impact of negative life events (NLEs) on attempted suicide in a Chinese cultural setting. The sample comprised 791 suicide attempters and an equal number of controls matched on age, sex, and location from selected rural counties in China. Conditional logistic regression model was used to examine the association between NLEs and suicide risk. The impact of NLEs on attempted suicide was further examined using regression-based method to explore its mediation effect. The types of NLEs that were most likely to precede a suicide attempt in rural sample included the events in marriage/love, family/home, and friend/relationship. Rural women were more likely to experience more interpersonal conflicts than rural men. Approximately 75.6% of suicide attempters had experienced at least one NLE, and NLEs were strongly associated with attempted suicide. Total effect (0.676), direct effect (0.501), and the total indirect effect (0.301) of NLEs on suicide attempts were significantly mediated by hopelessness and depression. NLEs play a crucial role in predicting suicidal attempt in rural China, and they are mediated by depression and hopelessness.

AB Objective Suicide is the fifth leading cause of death in China and the leading cause of death among adults aged 15 to 34 years. Thus, it is important to identify psychometrically sound instruments that can be successfully used to assess risk and protective factors for suicide in Chinese populations. Method Using the psychological autopsy method, we explored the possibility of applying 4 psychological scales (Dickman Impulsivity Instrument, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Duke Social Support Index) developed and commonly used in the West to Chinese culture. Sixteen counties from three provinces in China were selected as sampling sites in which 392 suicide cases and 416 community living controls aged 15 to 34 years were obtained. Results Significant differences were found between the suicide victims and living controls on all four measures and their respective subscales indicating that the instruments are useful tools in identifying suicidal individuals through proxy data in rural China. Conclusions These findings may have important implications for the development and enhancement of more effective suicide prevention strategies in China.

AB Objective: There has been no large-scale survey of suicide-related behaviours including suicidal ideations, plans and attempts in China involving both rural and urban areas and using standardized assessment tools. The aim of the present study was to determine the lifetime prevalence of suicide-related behaviour and its relationship with sociodemographic factors and psychiatric disorders in the rural and urban regions of Beijing, China.
   Methods: A total of 5926 subjects were randomly selected in Beijing and interviewed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Basic sociodemographic and clinical data and data on suicide-related behaviour were also collected.
   Results: The overall lifetime prevalence estimates of suicidal ideation, plans and attempts were 2.3%, 1.4%, and 1.0%, respectively; the corresponding figures were 2.8%, 1.6%, and 1.3% in the rural sample, and 1.8%, 1.3%, and 0.9% in the urban sample. Age (> 25 years), female sex, unmarried status, lower education level, lower (< RMB500 month(-1)) or higher (> RMB2000 month(-1)) monthly income and presence of major medical disorders were significantly associated with increased risk of suicide-related behaviour. 36.2% of subjects with suicide-related behavior consulted a medical practitioner and 20.7% consulted a psychiatrist.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of lifetime suicide-related behaviour in Beijing is lower than in Western countries, but the low percentage of subjects treated for suicide-related behaviour indicates a major public health problem that should be addressed. National surveys are needed to further explore the prevalence of suicide-related behaviour in China.

AB Suicide has become a major public health problem worldwide. For every suicide there are six suicide survivors, a term referring to family members or friends of a person who has died by suicide. Within the literature there has been ongoing debate regarding the bereavement process and if it differs in survivors of suicide as opposed to survivors of those who have died from accidental death. There are scarcely any published reports on comparison between these two groups of survivors in China. In this study, we aimed to explore the difference of mental health status between suicide survivors and survivors of accidental deaths in China. We used a cross-sectional study design to collect data of survivors. Consecutive sampling was used and 92 suicide survivors and 64 survivors of accidental deaths were interviewed. The Symptom Checklist-90-Revised was used to assess the survivors' mental health status. After controlling for demographic variables and time interval between death and interview, no significant differences were found on mental health status between these two groups of survivors. Several explanations might account for the lack of differences. Further studies employing qualitative measures and suicide-specific instruments are needed to explore the bereavement of Chinese suicide survivors.

AB The aim of this study was to test the Three-Step Theory (3ST) of suicide in a sample of college students in China (N = 1,097). All participants completed a battery of questionnaires indexing psychological pain, hopelessness, connectedness, suicide capacity, suicide ideation, and suicide attempt. The prevalence of suicide ideation and suicide attempt among the sample were 21.42% and 3.83%, respectively. The hierarchical regression analysis showed that psychological pain and hopelessness interacted to predict suicide ideation, and that connectedness was the most protective against ideation in those high on both pain and hopelessness. Suicide capacity differentiated attempters from ideators above and beyond current suicide ideation. These findings provide preliminary evidence for the validity of 3ST of suicide within Chinese contexts. Implications for suicide prevention and intervention and future research directions are also discussed.

LA English

ID RISK-FACTORS; ADOLESCENT SUICIDE; VICTIMS; UNIVERSAL; GENDER; AGE
AB As China opens its door to the world, suicide research is making rapid progress using methods and instruments developed in the West. This is a feasibility study of the psychological autopsy methodology applied in China, with its emphasis on the social and cultural environments. With samples of 66 completed suicides and 66 community normal living controls, the authors found that it is feasible to interview at least two informants for each suicide case and each control, between 2 and 6 months after the suicide. With the Chinese-cultivated contacting method of recruiting cases, the refusal rate is nearly zero. The Western-developed methodology per se proved to be valid in the Chinese culture. Ethical considerations in the context of Chinese culture are as important as in the West. Psychological autopsy technique is shown to be an equally applicable method for the study of completed suicides in Chinese culture as it is in the West. Future epidemiological research on Chinese suicide should use the psychological autopsy method to collect data from larger samples in order to increase our understanding of the risk factors for Chinese suicides.

Our cases were 90 rural suicides with major depression with victims aged 15 to 34 years and living matched controls of the same gender, age (within 3 years), and county of residence. Confucian values appear to be a protective factor for men but a risk factor for women with regard to suicide with major depression. More attention should be paid to Confucian values in suicide prevention efforts.

AB Background: Previous studies on the Chinese suicide found some life events prior to the suicide different from those in the West, but there is a lack of summary of the Chinese life event patterns to better understand the effects of the social structure on Chinese suicide.
   Aim: We tried to identify the life events that precede the Chinese rural youth suicides and compare them with what are found in the West, so as to find the patterns that are particularly true in the Chinese culture contexts.
   Methods: Suicide cases were investigated with a psychological autopsy study in rural China, and local community living controls were also interviewed with the same protocol. Results: We collapsed 64 negative life events into six categories: (1) Marriage/Love, (2) Family/Home, (3) Work/Business, (4) Health/Hospital, (5) Law/Legal, (6) Friend/Relationship. About 92.3% of the suicides studied had experienced at least one type of negative life events. The three most common negative life events categories in the past one year were Family/Home (60.7%), Health/Hospital (53.8%) and Marriage/Love (51.3%) in the rural young suicide victims.
   Conclusions: Among the negative life events, those related to family relations, love affairs, and marital issues were most likely to precede a suicide of rural suicides in China, and it is especially true of rural young women. Family is an important social institution in rural China for suicide prevention efforts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide is a leading cause of death in individuals 15-34 years of age in China. Highly lethal pesticides are a common method used for suicide in Chinese rural areas. This case-control study aimed to test hypotheses concerning the suicide risks associated with pesticide access. Subjects included 370 rural completed suicides aged 15-34 years and 370 living controls matched on age, gender and residence (rural/urban location). Data were collected by a psychological autopsy design with proxy respondents. Pesticide access was a significant risk factor for suicide even after controlling for other known risk factors in social and psychiatric domains, such as education level, living situation, marital status, family annual income and mental disorder. Increased risk was accounted for by access to insecticide rather than other types of pesticides. Suicide intervention in China should focus on restricting access to pesticides, especially highly toxic insecticide, improving the resuscitation skills of rural primary-care health providers, promoting psychological and social support networks in rural areas and educating the general public about the suicide risk of having pesticides stored at the households.

ID MALPRACTICE; NURSES; PEOPLE
AB Background: Attitudes and knowledge about suicide may influence psychiatrists' management of suicidal patients but there has been little research about this issue in China.
   Methods: We used the Scale of Public Attitudes about Suicide (SPAS) - a 47-item scale developed and validated in China - to assess knowledge about suicide and seven specific attitudes about suicide in a sample of 187 psychiatrists from six psychiatric hospitals in Shanghai. The results were compared to those of 548 urban community members (assessed in a previous study).
   Results: Compared to urban community members, psychiatrists were more likely to believe that suicide can be prevented and that suicide is an important social problem but they had more stigmatizing beliefs about suicidal individuals and felt less empathy for them. The belief that suicide can be prevented was more common among female psychiatrists than male psychiatrists but male psychiatrists felt more empathy for suicidal individuals. Only 37% of the psychiatrists correctly agreed that talking about suicide-related issues with an individual would not precipitate suicidal behavior and only 41% correctly agreed that those who state that they intend to kill themselves may actually do so.
   Conclusions: Many psychiatrists in Shanghai harbor negative attitudes about suicidal individuals and are concerned that directly addressing the issue with patients will increase the risk of suicide. Demographic factors, educational status and work experience are associated with psychiatrists' attitudes about suicide and, thus, need to be considered when training psychiatrists about suicide prevention.

AB Background: Previous studies have thoroughly investigated the prevalence and risk factors for completed suicide. In marked contrast is the lack of a better understanding of attempted suicide in the elderly. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of attempted suicide in the elderly and examine the associated factors.
   Methods: Using a multi-stage cluster sampling approach, a cross-sectional survey of 8,399 elderly house-dwelling residents was conducted in Shanghai, China.
   Results: The two-week prevalence of attempted suicide in the elderly was 0.75%. In the bivariate analysis, having no caregivers, depressive, anxiety, sad, fear, obsessive-compulsive and anger symptom, and lower scores on the Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living and the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale were significantly associated with an increased risk of attempted suicide in the elderly. In the multivariate analysis, sad and fear symptoms were significantly and independently associated with a higher risk of attempted suicide in the elderly.
   Conclusion: The two-week prevalence of attempted suicide in the elderly is relatively high when compared with the annualized or lifetime prevalence reported in China and foreign settings. Elderly individuals with certain mental symptoms should be targeted for suicide prevention and provided with timely mental health support.

AB Objective: We aimed to identify gender-specific characteristics of suicide attempters admitted to general hospital emergency departments in urban China.
   Methods: The Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV, the Suicide Ideation Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and a quality of life measure were administered to 239 suicide attempters who were treated consecutively in the emergency departments of four general hospitals randomly selected in Shenyang, China.
   Results: Among the 239 enrolled subjects, 53 (22.2%) were men, and 186 (77.8%) were women. Compared to women, men were more likely to be a minority, live with their families and/or suffer from substance-related disorders. Men were less likely to be living alone or cohabitating. Women were more likely to express suicide ideation compared with men. Thirty-seven (69.8%) men and 129 (69.4%) women had mental illness. The prevalence of psychiatric diagnosis was not significantly different between men and women (chi(2)=.004, df=1, P=.95).
   Conclusion: The rate of attempted suicide is higher among women than among men in the emergency departments of urban China. Except for race, living situation and suicide ideation, there are few gender differences regarding socio-demographic and clinical characteristics in the current study that are not consistent with reports from other countries. However, similar to other studies, men are more likely to suffer from substance-related disorders than are women. The unique, gender-specific characteristics pertaining to suicide attempters in urban China emphasizes the need for gender-specific interventions in future clinical treatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Suicide is one of the top 10 causes of death in many countries. Although there are many studies on mental disorders, few studies have examined mortality in suicide population and mentally ill population. This study examined the association between mortality and mental disorders using data on suicides and mental disorders in China. Data from China's Health and Family Planning Statistical Yearbook for 2000 to 2014 were used to analyze the relationship between mortality associated with suicide and mental disorders. The analyses found that mortality among people with mental disorders dropped from 5.42/10 million in 2000 to 2.68/10 million in 2014, decreased more among females than males, and differed between urban and rural areas; that suicide mortality dropped from 10.79/10 million in 2000 to 6.79/10 million in 2014; the decrease was greater in women than in men, with suicide being highest among male residents of cities; and no significant correlation was found between mortality among persons with mental disorders and suicide mortality. There was no correlation between suicide mortality and mental-disorder mortality during 2000 to 2014; however, overall mortality decreased more among females than males during this period.

AB Background: China has one of the highest suicide rates in the world; however, the recent trends in suicide have not been adequately studied. This study aimed to examine the potential changes in the rates and characteristics in a Chinese population.
   Methods: Data on suicide deaths in 1991-2010 were extracted from the Shandong Disease Surveillance Point (DSP) mortality dataset based on ICD-10 codes. The temporal trend in age-adjusted suicide rates for each subpopulation was tested using log-linear Poisson regression analysis.
   Results: From 1991 to 2010, there was a marked decrease in the overall suicide rate in Shandong, with an average reduction of 8% per year. The decrease trend was stronger in rural than in urban areas and more evident in females than in males. Similar decreases were observed for all age groups. Pesticide ingestion and hanging remained the top two methods for suicide.
   Limitations: There are likely quality concerns in the morality data, such as underreporting and misclassification, as well as low accuracy in determining the underlying causes of deaths. The representativeness of the DSP system may also be problematic due to the rapid changes in economy and demography.
   Conclusions: Completed suicides in Shandong have sharply declined over the past 20 years. Higher rates in females versus males and in rural versus urban areas, which were previously considered to be distinguishing features of suicide in China, are becoming less pronounced.

TI Prevalence of Suicide Attempts among College Students in China: A
   Meta-Analysis
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article

AB Background
   Suicide is the leading cause of death among 15-34 year olds in China, but no national data are available on the suicide and suicide attempts rates of college students, a sub-group of youth with 23 million. Several studies have reported the prevalence of suicide attempts among college students, however, no meta-analysis pooling the prevalence of suicide attempts is found.
   Objective and Methods
   This study aims to estimate the pooled prevalence of suicide attempts among college students in China. The relevant studies up to August 2014 were systematically searched via electronic databases (PubMed-Medline, Embase, Chinese Wanfang database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and Chinese VIP database). We only selected original articles that either reported the prevalence of suicide attempts or sufficient data for calculating the prevalence.
   Results
   A total of 29 eligible studies, with 88,225 college students, were finally included. The maximum and minimum reported prevalences of suicide attempts among college students in China were 0.4% and 10.5%, respectively. The pooled prevalence of suicide attempts was 2.8% (95% CI: 2.3%-3.3%). Subgroup analyses showed that the pooled estimate of prevalence of life time suicide attempts was 2.7% (95% CI: 2.1%-3.3%), and 12-month suicide attempts was 2.9% (95% CI: 2.0%-3.8%). The prevalence for males was 2.4% (95% CI: 1.8%-3.0%), and for females was 2.7% (95% CI: 1.9%-3.7%). The prevalences among college students in grade 1 through 4 were 2.8% (95% CI: 1.7%-3.8%), 1.8% (95% CI: 1.2%-2.3%), 2.0% (95% CI: 0.8%-3.1%), and 2.9% (95% CI: 0.1%6.7%), respectively. The prevalences among college students from rural and urban areas were 5.1% (95% CI: 2.8%-7.5%) and 3.7% (95% CI: 1.4%-5.9%), respectively.
   Conclusions
   2.8% prevalence of suicide attempts and more than 600,000 suicide attempters among college students indicate that suicide attempt among college students is an important public health problem in China. More attention should be paid to the current situation.

AB Purpose: To determine the prevalence and associated family factors of suicide attempts among junior and/or senior high school students, so as to provide bases for preventive measures of suicide in China.
   Methods: A total of 13,512 students from 32 junior and/or senior high schools in grades 7 to 11 in eight cities of China participated in a self-administered anonymous survey to report their frequency of suicide attempts during the past year. Sociodemographic characteristics, tobacco, and alcohol use in the past 30 days were asked. Stressful family life events were used to evaluate the subjects' family characteristics.
   Results: Overall, 2.7% (338/12,470) in-school adolescents reported a suicide attempt during the past year, girls significantly more often than boys. Considered independently, all stressful family life events were strongly associated with increased risk for self-reported suicide attempts. When taking sociodemographic characteristics, life style, and all the five family factors selected from factor analysis into consideration, there was a significant independent impact of three family factors on increasing suicide attempts risk among adolescents. The most notable risks were derived from improper parental rearing behavior, separation from parents, and social problems of the family members. However, neither poor material conditions of family life nor family member's adversity contribute significantly to the risk.
   Conclusions: This study not only indicates that suicide attempt is a significant public health issue among in-school adolescents in China, but also confirms that adolescents with family problems commonly manifest suicide attempts, which highlights the importance of considering family environmental factors when assessing suicide risk.

AB Background: Community attitudes about suicide and their relationship to suicidal behavior have not been adequately investigated in low-and middle-income countries. Aims: To compare the acceptability of suicide in different population cohorts in China, identify factors that affect the degree of acceptability, and assess the relationship of cohort-specific acceptability of suicide and suicide rates. Methods: A multistage stratified random sample of 608 rural residents, 582 urban residents, and 629 college students were administered a 25-item scale studying the likelihood they would consider suicide (on a 5-point Likert scale) if they experienced a variety of stressors ranging from "being disciplined at work" to "developing a chronic mental illness." The internal consistency and test-retest reliability for the scale are excellent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92, ICC = 0.75). Results: College students had the most permissive attitudes about suicide, and urban residents were significantly more accepting of suicide as a response to serious life stressors than were rural residents. Multivariate analysis found that the overall acceptability score was higher in women, decreased with age, and increased with years of education. Conclusions: There was no clear relationship between cohort-specific acceptance of suicide and reported rates of suicide, highlighting the complexity of the relationship between attitudes about suicide (of which acceptability is only one component) and suicidal behavior.

AB Suicide rates in the Beijing region increase with age. The rural suicide rate is about two to five times of the urban in various age-sex groups. The elderly suicide rate is very serious, especially in the rural area. The average suicide rate for the Beijing region for the period 1987-1996 was 9.8 per 100,000 (6.0 and 17.3 for urban and rural areas, respectively. A low male-to-female ratio was also observed. The female suicide rate for the 15-34 age group was higher than that of its male counterparts, which is unique in other areas of the world. These phenomena can be explained by some of the distinct cultural and economic traits of China. Also, suicides rates in the Beijing region were shown to be on a decreasing trend among the teenaged and the old-age groups. Our findings suggest that the suicide rate in China should not be as high as the estimated rate (31.0 per 100,000), suggested in the Global Health Statistics by Murray and Lopez (1996b, p. 824).

AB Objective The study empirically quantifies the contributions of age composition and urbanisation to changes in the suicide rate in China over the periods 1990-2000 and 2000-2010.
   Methods A decompositional method was used to quantify the absolute and relative contributions of the age structure; the age-specific proportion of the urban population and the suicide rate of each age-specific, gender-specific and urban/rural cohort to the overall suicide rates in the two 10-year intervals.
   Results In the period between 1990 and 2000, a significant decline in the suicide rate among younger age groups (especially young rural women) was identified as the main driving force of the downward trend in the overall suicide rate. In 2000-2010, the rate of decline in suicide was predominantly explained by the drop in the suicide rate among all age groups in rural areas, with the exception of those aged over 80. The positive impact of urbanisation on the decline of the suicide rate has gradually diminished relative to the earlier period.
   Conclusion As the positive impact of urbanisation on suicide rates is diminishing, further urbanisation and rapid change in society may induce stress and adjustment problems that are not conducive to the promotion of well-being. Furthermore, as China is facing the prospects of slower economic growth and a rapidly ageing population, suicides among older adults may also be elevated, particularly among those in rural areas with insufficient healthcare and social support. In order to maintain the decreasing trend of suicide in China, it is important for the Chinese government to pay more attention to the mental well-being of the population and to mitigate the stress of urban life and to provide timely support to older adults especially in rural areas.

   TRENDS
AB Background: This study aims to describe the specific characteristics of completed suicides by violent methods and nonviolent methods in rural Chinese population, and to explore the related factors for corresponding methods.
   Methods: Data of this study came from investigation of 199 completed suicide cases and their paired controls of rural areas in three different counties in Shandong, China, by interviewing one informant of each subject using the method of Psychological Autopsy (PA).
   Results: There were 78 (39.2%) suicides with violent methods and 121 (60.8%) suicides with non-violent methods. Ingesting pesticides, as a non-violent method, appeared to be the most common suicide method (103, 51.8%). Hanging (73 cases, 36.7%) and drowning (5 cases, 2.5%) were the only violent methods observed. Storage of pesticides at home and higher suicide intent score were significantly associated with choice of violent methods while committing suicide. Risk factors related to suicide death included negative life events and hopelessness.
   Conclusions: Suicide with violent methods has different factors from suicide with non-violent methods. Suicide methods should be considered in suicide prevention and intervention strategies.

AB Neuroticism and extraversion are potentially important markers of personality vulnerability to suicide. Whereas previous studies have examined these traits independently, we examined their combined effects. Data were collected from family members and/or friends of individuals 18 years or older who died by suicide (n = 64) in rural China and from age-, sex-, and geographically matched controls (n = 64). Personality was assessed with the NEO-Five Factor Inventory. Individuals with a personality style characterized by high neuroticism and low extraversion were at 3.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.44-6.55) times greater risk for suicide than were individuals without this personality style; in contrast, a style characterized by low neuroticism and high extraversion conferred decreased suicide risk (odds ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 1.44-6.55). We conclude that it may be clinically inadequate to conceptualize neuroticism, by itself, as a risk marker for suicide. However, when the negative affect characteristic of neuroticism is combined with the joylessness, pessimism, and hopelessness characteristic of low extraversion, risk for suicide is elevated.

ID RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; POSTCARDS; COUNTRIES; EDGE
AB Background: In China, where follow-up with hospitalized attempters is generally lacking, there is a great need for inexpensive and effective means of maintaining contact and decreasing recidivism. Aims: Our objective was to test whether mobile telephone message contacts after discharge would be feasible and acceptable to suicide attempters in China. Methods: Fifteen participants were recruited from suicide attempters seen in the Emergency Department in Wuhan, China, to participate in a pilot study to receive mobile telephone messages after discharge. All participants have access to a mobile telephone, and there is no charge for the user to receive text messages. Results: Most participants (12) considered the text message contacts an acceptable and useful form of help and would like to continue to receive them for a longer period of time. Conclusions: This suggests that, as a low-cost and quick method of intervention in areas where more intensive follow-up is not practical or available, telephone messages contacts are accessible, feasible, and acceptable to suicide attempters. We hope that this will inspire future research on regular and long-term message interventions to prevent recidivism in suicide attempters.

AB The gender (male to female) ratio of the Chinese suicide rates is different from those found in the rest of the world. None of the other societies with known suicide data has had female suicide rates higher than those for the males. While we investigate the factors that contribute to the relatively high suicide rates for Chinese women, we also need to ask what makes the relatively low suicide rates for Chinese men. In this study we try to examine some social and cultural variables in rural Chinese youths in order to identify the factors that account for the relatively low rate for men and relatively high rate for women. In rural China, 392 suicides (both men and women) aged 14-35 years consecutively sampled from 16 counties of three provinces were studied with 416 community living controls of the same age range and from the same locations. Case-control psychological autopsy method was used for the data collection. It is found that believing in Confucianism and being married are both protecting the rural young men from suicide, while the two same variables are either risk or non-protecting factors for the Chinese rural young women's suicide. In rural China, social structure and culture may play an even more important role determining a society's suicide rates as well as the gender ratios. Thus, suicide prevention may need to include culture specific measures.

AB Background. Suicide is the most common cause of death among youth in China. Method. A case-control psychological autopsy study in 23 geographically representative disease surveillance points around China collected information from family members and close associates of 114 persons aged 15-24 years who died by suicide (cases) and 91 who died of other injuries (controls).
   Results. Among the 114 suicides 61% were female, 88% lived in rural villages, 70% died by ingesting pesticides (most commonly stored in the home), 24% previously attempted suicide, and 45% met criteria of a mental illness at the time of death. Multivariate logistic regression identified several independent risk factors: severe life events within 2 days before death (OR 31.8, 95% CI 2.6-390.6), presence of any depressive symptoms within 2 weeks of death (OR 21.1, 95 % CI 4.6-97.2), low quality of life in the month before death (OR 9.7, 95% CI 2.8-34.1), and acute stress at time of death (moderate: OR 3.1, 95 % CI 0.8-11.9; high: OR 9.1, 95 % CI 1.2-66.8). A significant interaction between mental illness at time of death and gender indicated that diagnosis was an important predictor of suicide in males (OR 14.0, 95% CI 2.6-76.5) but not in females (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.0-3.6). Prior suicide attempt was related to suicide in the univariate analysis (OR 57.5) but could not be included in the multivariate model because no controls had made prior attempts.
   Conclusions. Suicide prevention efforts for youth in China must focus on restricting access to pesticides, early recognition and management of depressive symptoms and mental illnesses, improving resiliency, and enhancing quality of life.

   POPULATIONS; RELIABILITY; DEPRESSION; VALIDITY; AUTOPSY
AB Background: Various factors contribute to suicide. Psychological strains are hypothesized to precede suicidal thought and attempt. Life satisfaction can be a measure of relative deprivation strain and aspiration reality strain. Aims: This study was to compare the suicide attempters with various levels of life satisfaction and find out how life satisfaction affects the degree of suicide intent among medically serious suicide attempters.
   Methods: Subjects for study were recruited in some rural counties in China. Interview data were from hospital emergency rooms with medically serious attempters of suicide (n = 791). The subjects were aged between 15 and 54 years and 293 males and 498 females. Face to face interview was conducted for each suicide attempter with a semi-structural protocol including life satisfaction, physical health, demographic, sociological, and psychological measures, as well as psychological strains.
   Findings: The multiple linear regression analysis showed that mental disorder, aspiration strain and relative deprivation strain were significant risk factors for high intent of suicide among suicide attempters. The interaction between the two psychological strains also indicated that both failed aspiration and self-perceived low economic status in village play an important role in suicidal intent.
   Conclusion: Low level of life satisfaction is associated with strong intent for suicide. Lack of life satisfaction is exemplified by relative deprivation perceived by the individuals and the discrepancy between an individual's aspiration for life and his/her reality. The findings from the suicide attempt data in rural China support the Strain Theory of Suicide. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Suicide is a major public health and social problem in contemporary societies. Previous studies showed that the older the seniors were, the more likely it was that they would experience disability, chronic disease, or both. The objective of this study was to examine the joint effects of chronic disease and physical disability on suicide ideation while controlling for psychological distress among the rural elderly living in Shandong Province, China. Method: A total of 5514 rural elderly individuals (60+) living in Shandong Province, China were included in this study. Suicidal ideation was assessed by using questions from the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS). Multiple logistic analyses were performed to examine the factors associated with suicide ideation. A path analysis was conducted to test the direct and indirect effects of chronic disease and of activity of daily living (ADL) limitation on suicide ideation while controlling for psychological distress. Results: The prevalence of suicide ideation among the rural elderly in Shandong, China was 11.0%. Psychological distress had the strongest direct ( = 0.392) and total effect ( = 0.392), chronic disease ( = -0.034; = -0.063) had both direct and indirect impacts, and ADL ( = 0.091) had indirect impacts on suicide ideation. Psychological distress was a mediator between chronic disease, ADL limitation, and suicide ideation. Conclusions: Psychological distress was the greatest influencing factor of suicide ideation among the rural elderly, followed by chronic disease and disability. Effective intervention measures should be taken to facilitate the early detection of psychological distress in clinical practice among the rural elderly.

AB Background: Men who have sex with men (MSM) have become a high-risk group of HIV infection in China. To date, little is known regarding the psychological characteristics in Chinese MSM, especially the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts.
   Methods: A questionnaire survey was conducted on 2,250 MSM recruited from gay bars in 9 large cities in mainland China. Data on the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts as well as the underlying causes in the respondents were analyzed.
   Results: A total of 1530 MSM responded to the question regarding previous suicidal ideation and attempts. Of these respondents, 26.01% had ever considered suicide and 12.55% actually attempted suicide at least once. Romantic gay relationship breakup was the number one cause of suicide behaviors, followed by self-objection to homosexuality, difficulties in finding gay partners or in getting used to heterosexual marriage life, sudden emotional hurts from unexpected events, illegal status of gay marriage in China and disclosure of homosexuality.
   Conclusions: The survey study has led to a better understanding of the factors contributing to suicide behaviors of MSM in China, which may have significant implications in developing preventive strategies against suicide behaviors in this unique group of individuals.

AB The authors recruited 401 suicide attempters from general hospitals and 409 matched non-attempters to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) in rural China. All participants completed the BHS, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and Trait Anxiety Inventory (TAI). Suicide attempters had higher BHS scores than non-attempters. Cronbach's alpha coefficients were satisfactory and BHS scores significantly correlated to CES-D and TAI scores. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a four-factor model for suicide attempters and a five-factor model for non-attempters. The BHS is satisfactory in assessing hopelessness among suicide attempters in rural China.

AB Objective: The suicide pattern in China is changing to a predominance of older people. However, little is known about the impact of suicide on the family members of elderly decedents. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the suicidal death of rural older adults in China increases the odds of depression or suicidal ideation among their relatives and to explore the associated risk factors.
   Methods: In a national psychological autopsy study in China, consecutive samples of suicide decedents aged 60 or above and matched living controls were enrolled in rural areas of three provinces. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore the occurrence and correlates of depression and suicidal ideation among relatives of elderly suicide decedents.
   Results: A total of 242 suicide decedents and 242 living controls were identified. We enrolled 245 relatives of suicide decedents and 205 relatives of living controls. No significant differences in depression or suicide ideation were found between the relatives of suicide decedents and living comparisons after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics (depression: 26.5% vs. 21.5%; suicide ideation: 5.7% vs. 2.9%). A mood disorder diagnosis in the suicide decedent (OR = 1.93, 95% CI 1.12-3.52) and a spouse relationship (OR = 3.62, 95% CI 1.40-9.34) were independent risk factors for depression among relatives of suicide decedents. Spouses (OR = 5.91, 95% CI 1.49-23.38) were more likely to have suicidal ideation than other relatives.
   Limitations: there are methodological limitations in psychological autopsy studies.
   Conclusions: It seems that the suicide of an older adult 2-6 months ago has no significant impact on depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in their relatives. Proactive support should be provided for spouses of suicide decedents and those whose relatives have a mood disorder diagnosis.

AB Background: Attempted suicide, a deliberate self-directed behavior situated within the unique social world of an individual, is a major risk factor for suicide. Efforts aimed at addressing female suicide must be based on understanding their perceived causes and the meaning of this behavior. Aims: This study describes the perceived causes of suicidal behaviors to determine preventive measures of female suicide in China. Methods: An in-depth interview about the process and causes of suicidal behavior as well as a detailed structured and a standardized diagnostic interview were administered to 244 female attempters treated at general hospitals and, separately, to their relatives. Results: The perceived three most frequent causes of the attempts were interpersonal conflict (87%), psychological problems (33%), and conflict between others that affected the subject (27%). On average 2.2 causes were identified for each case. The identification in the in-depth interviews of psychological problems as a cause of the attempt was concordant with the results of the independent psychiatric exam identifying a current DSM-IV mental disorder in 38% of cases (Kappa = 0.64). Conclusions: Preventive measures of improving interpersonal and problem-solving skills should be developed and assessed for addressing female suicide in China besides expansion of psychiatric services.

AB Many individuals who die by suicide or attempt suicide have no pre-existing psychiatric record. In these cases determination of the presence of mental illness at the time of the suicidal act depends on diagnostic interviews with different informants, but the reliability of such interviews is unknown. To address this issue, the current study from northern China conducted independent diagnostic interviews (by different psychiatrists) with a co-resident family member and another associate of 151 suicide decedents, with 120 individuals who attempted suicide, and with two proxy informants for each suicide attempter. In the suicide decedent group, 56% of interviews with family members and 50% with other associates resulted in one or more psychiatric diagnosis; the concordance (kappa) of these two respondents for the presence of any current psychiatric disorder, any mood disorder and any other psychiatric disorder were 0.35, 0.32 and 0.41, respectively. In the suicide attempt group, 47% of interviewers with suicide attempters, 31% with family members, and 15% with other associates resulted in a psychiatric diagnosis; the concordance for any current psychiatric disorder, any mood disorder and any other psychiatric disorder between the interview with the suicide attempter and the combined result of the two separate proxy informant interviews were 0.31, 0.34 and 0.39, respectively. We conclude that the concordance of the presence and type of psychiatric diagnosis of individuals with suicidal behavior based on independent structured interviews by psychiatrists with different informants is low to fair and that using multiple informants will increase the identification of psychiatric disorders.

AB It is considered that people from poor countries get depressed which ultimately leads to suicide. It is estimated that one million people commit suicide every year worldwide. It is considered from statistics that global annual suicide fatalities could rise to 1.5 million by 2020. Economically and culturally the most influential countries of East Asia are China, Japan and South Korea. To find the underlying causes for such a high suicide rate was the basic purpose of this article. We selected 100 suicide research articles as well as World Health Organisation's statistics related to suicide in East Asian countries. Stress and insecurity, whether related to employment or in relationship, are the basic causes which ultimately take an individual to the verge of suicide. Some people also find suicide a mean to get rid of life due to some lethal diseases. Aged persons consider themselves out of life so they adopt suicide. The government has already taken serious steps to minimise the death rate caused by suicide. Stress in education institutions has to be negotiated by taking some steps in education policy. Consistent efforts should be made to cope with this problem.

AB Background Suicide attempt is a major public health problem and are associated with genetic factors. This paired case-control study examined the association between the COMT gene rs4680 polymorphism and suicide attempts.
   Methods A case-control study of 369 (117 men, 31.7%; mean age=44.1+/-13.3 years) suicide attempters and an equal number of controls without a lifetime history of suicide attempt matched on sex, age, and residence was carried out in rural Shandong, Eastern China. Demographics and psychiatric history were obtained through face-to-face interviews. Blood samples were collected during interviews and the COMT gene rs4680 polymorphism was analyzed using the ligation detection reaction method.
   Results The G/G genotype was significantly more prevalent in female suicide attempters than their matched controls. Conditional logistic regression showed that the G/G genotype was significantly associated with an increased risk of suicide attempts only for women (odds ratio=2.3; 95% confidence interval: 1.2-4.2).
   Conclusion The findings support an association between the COMT gene rs4680 polymorphism and suicide attempts only in women. Further research with larger samples is needed to explore the interactions of the COMT gene rs4680 polymorphism and sex and psychiatric disorders on suicide attempts.

AB This case control study examined the relationship between psychopathological profiles and self-reported suicide attempts among rural adolescents of China. Cases consisted of 142 adolescents who reported a suicide attempt in the past 6 months in a questionnaire survey (n = 1,365). An equal number of adolescents without reporting a suicide attempt, matched on age, gender, and school class, were selected from the same survey sample as controls. The Youth Self Report (YSR) was used to assess psychopathological profiles for suicide attempters and matched controls. Results indicated that 73% of suicide attempters had at least one behavioral/emotional syndrome, significantly higher than in controls (30%). Logistic regression analyses showed that anxiety/depression (OR = 3.68) and aggression (OR = 5.02) were each significantly associated with increased risk of suicide attempts after controlling for other behavioral problems. These findings demonstrated the independent contribution of anxiety/depression and aggression to suicide attempts in Chinese adolescents.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WELFARE

DT Article
DE Chinese cultures; collective memory; coping skills; female suicide;
   in-law conflicts; suicide; rebellion; empowerment; wife abuse
AB The current literature on suicide in China shows that the female suicide rate is extraordinarily higher than the rate for males. Many studies have been conducted on the prevalence and perpetrating factors for suicidal incidents. Few have attempted to understand women's suicide acts. In this article, the ethnographic data are used to explore the special meaning of the suicide act in a Chinese family and its impact on the other family members. Research has shown that suicide may have a different meaning in the Chinese context, especially for women with an inferior status within the family. Suicide is taken as an act of revenge in a moral and spiritual sense. The act of suicide is very powerful; it grants the woman so much power that she may achieve what she could not during her lifetime. The suicide event remains in the collective memory of the relatives and other people who knew the person. Its powerful meaning is related to the memory of the transgressive event of taking one's own life as well as to the collective and personal guilt connected with the event.

AB This study aimed to examine the association between sleep disturbance and attempted suicide in rural China. The study group included 409 suicide attempters from six rural counties in Shandong Province, China and an equal number of controls matched on age, sex, and residency. Sleep disturbance was assessed by the item "sleep restless" in the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Sleep disturbance was reported more frequently in suicide attempters than in controls (1-2 days/week, 9.0% vs. 4.4%; 3-4 days/week, 11.5% vs. 2.4%; >= 5 days/week, 30.3% vs. 7.5%, chi(2) = 128.72, p < 0.001). Suicide risk was significantly associated with increased frequency of sleep disturbance (OR = 3.98, 95% CI = 1.62-9.74 for 1-2 days/week; OR = 3.28, 95% CI = 1.21-8.84 for 3-4 days/week; OR = 2.41, 95% CI = 1.26-4.60 for >= 5 days/week) even after adjusting for potential psychosocial confounding factors and mental disorders. This finding may have important implications for early intervention and prevention of suicide.

ID PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSY; STRAIN THEORY; RISK-FACTORS; RELIABILITY;

AB The strain theory of suicide postulates that psychological strains usually precede mental disorders including suicidal behavior. Lack of coping skills is one of the four strains. This article focuses on the effect of lack of coping skills on individual mental disorders and suicide. Data including 392 suicide cases and 416 community-living controls were from a large psychological autopsy study conducted in rural China. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R were used for the diagnosis of mental disorders. Coping skills were measured by the Coping Response Inventory. The logical analysis and cognitive avoidance coping skills were negatively associated with mental disorders, whereas the taking problem-solving action and acceptance/resignation coping skills were positively associated with mental disorders. This study supports the hypothesis that lack of coping skills to certain strains is likely to lead to mental disorders and suicidal behavior. Improving people's coping strategies may be an effective way to lower the prevalence of mental disorders and suicide.

AB China is the only country in the world where the suicide rate for women is higher than that for men. In particular there is current concern about a high suicide rate for women living in rural areas. In this study, two samples of young women ages 20 to 35, one from rural China (n = 52) and one from rural United States (n = 52) were interviewed as to suicide ideation and suicide risk, as related to psychosocial variables of self-esteem, coping, social support, and attitudes toward suicide. Significant mean differences were obtained between samples on all eleven variables. The pattern of intercorrelations between variables showed both similarities and differences in the two samples. A stepwise multiple-regression analysis indicated that the same four variables, albeit in different order, were predictive of suicide: these variables were self-esteem, instrumental support, the attitude that suicide is morally bad, and an overall rating of coping.

AB This study aims to investigate the potential triggering of negative life events (NLEs) on suicide attempt in rural China. A case-crossover design was used to study 1200 suicide attempters aged 15-70 years. NLEs were assessed by a modification of Paykel's Interview for Recent Life Events. NLEs had significant triggering effects on the day of and month of suicide attempt. Marriage/love, family/home, and friend/relationship were the types of NLEs found to trigger suicide attempt when occurring on the day and month of suicide attempt. Specifically, increased risk of suicide attempt was associated with quarreling with a partner or family member on the day and month of suicide attempt. Being disappointed in a love affair, fighting with a partner, family poverty and loss of face during the month of attempts were linked to increase odds of suicide attempt. Further, when month of suicide attempt was assigned as the case period, the impact of NLEs on suicide attempt was greater among those who were younger and without mental disorders. These findings provide knowledge of the triggering of NLEs on suicide attempt, especially among the young and those without mental disorders. Further, family conflicts should be a greater focus of attention in suicide prevention.

From the connections of this event in the male-female cultural interactions emerged different female disqualification strategies that were related to suicide, whether, discursive and behavioral strategies. So, we can consider that female suicide is a social event and intrinsically related to the issue of women's identity in the two cultures.

However, only a small proportion of the variance in suicide risk can be explained by these variables if a linear paradigm is used as guidance. In this study, we tested a nonlinear cusp catastrophe modeling. Participants (N = 523) were PLWH selected through a risk venue-based method in Wuhan, a provincial capital city in China. Suicidal ideation post HIV+ diagnosis and in the past 30 days and suicide plan and attempt were assessed. Data were collected using self-report questionnaire and were analyzed using both the direct and multivariate stochastic cusp catastrophe modeling methods with social capital as asymmetry variable and HIV-related stigma as bifurcation variable. The analysis was executed using R, including nls() function for the direct method and "cusp" package for the stochastic modeling. Results from stochastic cusp modeling analysis indicated that social capital was significantly associated with risk of suicide after controlling for key covariates; the association was significantly bifurcated by HIV-related stigma. The data fit the cusp model better than the alternative linear model (R-2 =.483 vs. .127). Findings of this study indicate suicide behaviors among Chinese PLWH follow a nonlinear dynamic system. In addition to enhancing our understanding of suicide risk, findings of this study underscore the significance in social capital enhancement and stigma reduction for suicide prevention among PLWH in China.

AB Objective: To understand how physiological markers of men and women characterize the differences in suicide attempt, we hypothesize that attempted suicides have higher level of testosterone than their non-suicidal counterparts, which should be true of both men and women.
   Methods: In Shandong Province of China, 245 rural suicide attempters aged 16-50 years were consecutively recruited from October 1, 2009 to March 31, 2011. They were compared with 245 age and gender matched community controls. Blood sample was extracted at the time of interview for both patients and controls, and the plasma testosterone level was tested for comparisons.
   Results: The testosterone level was significantly-higher for male suicide attempters than for their community counterparts, with the OR of 1.211 (95%CI: 1.055-1.391), even when some other factors were adjusted, such as education years, family SES, marital status, coping skills, impulsivity, and psychiatric disorders. There was also a tendency that high testosterone level was related to female suicide attempt, with the OR being 1.209 (95%CI: 0.719-2.031).
   Conclusions: Testosterone, as a form of physiological marking, is somewhat another predictor of attempted suicide. Besides other factors, it might be the testosterone, not gender, which explains the suicide risks and the gender ratio of the rates. The lack of sample size limited this current study to establish a significant and positive relationship between testosterone and suicide risk in women as found in men. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Background: In exploration of the risk factors of the Chinese rural young suicide, previous researchers found low prevalence of mental problems, high degree of impulsivity, and great proportion of lethal pesticide consumption. It noticed that some of the young suicides in rural China did not intend to die from the suicidal behavior which was only instrumentally used for certain gains.
   Aims: This study aims to look into the characteristics of those young suicides who did not really intend to die and compare them with those young suicides who had a strong intent to die.
   Methods: Subjects were 386 suicides aged 15-34 years in the rural areas of three provinces in China. The data were obtained by psychological autopsy method. The degree of suicidal intent of the subjects was evaluated by the first 8 items of Beck's Suicide Intent Scale (SIS).
   Results: It was found that those suicides that had a strong intent of death were more likely to have higher age, more years of education, live alone, and suffer mental disease. On the other hand, the low intent suicides were more likely to have pesticides at home and to be impulsive. In other words, pesticides and impulsivity killed some Chinese rural young men and women who did not really want to die by suicide.
   Conclusion: Findings of the study may be translated into practical measures in suicide prevention in China as well as elsewhere in the world. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts have been found to be predictors of suicide. This study aims to estimate the suicidal behaviors in rural China. We studied 784 respondents as informants of suicide and 1,247 respondents as informants of community living controls, with the NCS-R measures on suicidal behaviors. The lifetime prevalence of ideation, plans, and attempts among the informants of suicide was 18.1, 4.1, and 1.7%, and the 12-month prevalence was 12.1, 2.2, and 0.4%, respectively. The prevalence scores were higher for the family members than for friends of suicide. The risk factors for suicidal behaviors include being parents or spouse of the suicide, female gender, low education level, and being never married. As suicidal behaviors are more observed among those who have a suicide death in the family or among close friends, suicide screening and intervention efforts should be focused on this type of population.

AB Background: The most frequently used means of committing suicide was pesticide poisoning in rural China, yet little is known about the characteristics and risk factors for suicides committed with pesticides compared to those committed via other means in older adults. Methods: The participants were 242 older adults (aged 60 or older) who had committed suicide in the rural areas of 3 provinces (Shandong, Hunan, and Guangxi) in China. This study was conducted using the psychological autopsy (PA) method. Results: In univariate analyses, no statistically significant differences were found between those who committed suicide with pesticide or with other means in terms of demographic and clinical variables except age, prevalence of mental disorders, suicidal intent, number of recent life events, social support, hopelessness, impulsivity, and depressive symptoms (P > .05); age, history of suicide attempts, having pesticides available at home, the total number of life events, and the number of long-term life events were significantly different (P < .05) between the 2 groups. In multivariate logistic regression model, the factors associated with committing suicide with pesticides were the availability of pesticides at home (odds ratio [OR] = 3.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.99-6.08) and the number of long-term life events (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.78-0.97). Conclusion: The older adults who committed suicide by pesticides and those using other means are probably the same population. The main determinant of choosing pesticides as suicide means was likely the availability of pesticides at home. Suicide risk among older adults might be reduced by placing appropriate restrictions on access to pesticides.

AB Suicide is a leading cause of premature death among people with schizophrenia. Some studies indicate that increased difficulties in functioning are associated with suicidality in persons with schizophrenia. We conducted a secondary analysis of 74 suicides (cases) and 24 accidental deaths (controls) among persons with schizophrenia identified in a national psychological autopsy study in China. Between cases and controls, we compared the effect of schizophrenia on work, daily activities, emotions, social relationships and self-care at the time the illness was most severe. There was no difference in the overall maximum dysfunction associated with the illness between groups. None of the 5 measures (work, activities, emotions, relationships, self-care) were different between the two groups. This study of individuals with DSM-IV schizophrenia who died by suicide in a non-western culture only partially supports findings from clinical studies in western cultures.

AB Objective: The aim of the current study was to compare the sociodemographic and psychological characteristics of impulsive suicide attempters with those of nonimpulsive suicide attempters in the emergency departments of general hospitals in Shenyang, China.
   Methods: A total of 239 consecutive suicide attempters, who were treated in the emergency departments of four randomly selected general hospitals from Shenyang city, were evaluated by the following measurements: a detailed structured questionnaire, Beck Suicide Ideation Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, a quality of life scale and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders. The patients were categorized as "impulsive suicide attempts" (<= 2 h) and "nonimpulsive suicide attempts" (>2 h) based on the hours it takes for a patient to consider suicide before acting, and the characteristics of the two groups of patients were compared.
   Results: One hundred seven (44.8%) patients were categorized as impulsive attempters. Compared to nonimpulsive suicide attempters, the impulsive suicide attempters had significantly more self-rescue ideation, their motive was more likely to threaten or express anger at others, and they scored much lower on the intensity of suicidal ideation and depression but higher on life quality; they also had a lower prevalence of psychiatric diagnosis but a higher rate of substance-related disorders. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the following independent predictors of impulsive suicide attempts among suicide attempters: having religious beliefs [odds ratio (OR)=4.435, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.545-12.736], a lower score on the Suicide Ideation Scale (OR=0.952, 95% CI=0.936-0.969) and a lower score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (OR=0.949, 95% CI=0.911-0.989).
   Conclusions: The characteristics of impulsive suicide attempters differed significantly with those of nonimpulsive suicide attempters in emergency departments of urban China. It is important to develop different kinds of interventions for the two types of suicide attempters to prevent more future suicide attempts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB China's rapid aging has caused widespread concern, but it seems that the situations and consequences of rapid aging are not adequately acknowledged. This study analyzed the problem of ageing in China from the aspects of elderly people's health status, income source, daily care, suicide, the weak social security system in terms of pension, health expenses, and long-term care costs as well as incoming accelerating ageing process in China. All these factors indicate that it is difficult for China to afford the issue of a rapidly aging population.

AB Recent global estimates of deaths from poisoning suggest that more than 150,000 deaths occur each year in China from pesticide poisoning alone. One response from the Chinese government has been to set up Poison Control Centers in each province to improve management. Unfortunately, the epidemiology of poisoning in China is still unclear and there are no specialist clinical toxicologists to take the lead in dealing with the massive loss of life. The objective of this article is to survey the situation of clinical toxicology in China and give some suggestions for its development.

AB Previous studies have tried to account for the uniqueness of gender ratios in Chinese suicide through physiological and psychological differences between men and women, and the means employed in the fatal act. From the point of view of the socio-psychological traits, this study examines the effects of religion (religiosity), superstition, and perceived gender inequality among Chinese women on the degree of their suicide intent. A four-page structured interviews were performed to the consecutively sampled serious attempters of suicide hospitalized to emergency rooms immediately after the suicidal act in Dalian areas, China. Both univariate analyses and the multiple regression model have found that the higher the degree the religiosity and superstition on metempsychosis, the stronger the suicide intent Chinese women had. The perceived gender inequality is positively correlated with suicide intent, and it is especially true for Chinese women. The socio-psychological traits and traditional Culture values and norms have important impacts on suicide patterns in Chinese societies.

AB Purpose: Despite high rates Of Suicide in rural Youths Of China, little is known about file epidemiological characteristics of suicidal behaviors among this group Of Population. This Study examined the prevalence and correlates Of suicidality among Chinese adolescents.
   Methods: An epidemiological survey was conducted in it sample of 1,362 adolescents from 5 high schools in it prefecture of Shandong, China. We obtained data using it structured questionnaire asking about Suicidal behaviors, life stress, locus of control, depression, aggression, and individual and family characteristics. Data were analyzed using logistic regression models.
   Results: Overall, 19% of the sample reported having suicidal ideation, and 7% reported having made it Suicide attempt during the past 6 months. The prevalence rates Of suicidal behaviors significantly increased over age. Female adolescents were more likely to report suicidal ideation than males. and older females (ages 16-18) were more likely to report suicide attempts than older Males. multivariate logistic repression models showed that female gender, older age, boarding in school, life stress, depression, and external locus of control were significantly associated with increased risk for suicidal ideation, while older age, life stress, external locus Of Control, Pool-academic performance, depression, and aggression were related to Suicide attempts.
   Conclusions: Suicidal behaviors are common problems in rural adolescents of China. Female adolescents are Particularly prone to report Suicidal ideation and Suicide attempts as they age. Multiple psychosocial factors are associated with suicidal behaviors, and psychopathology and life stress may play major roles ill Suicidal behaviors among rural adolescents of China.

AB Insomnia has been reported as a risk factor of suicidal behaviors, but few studies have examined the association among insomnia, mental disorder and suicide, especially among Chinese populations. In this study, we examined the effect of insomnia symptoms on completed suicide in a large sample of suicides and their controls in Chinese rural youths. Subjects were 388 consecutively recruited suicides and 416 community living controls aged 15-34 years in the rural areas of three provinces in China. Established psychological autopsy method was used for data collection. Insomnia symptoms were assessed with sleep questions in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) about insomnia, including difficulty initiating sleep (DIS), difficulty maintaining sleep (DMS) and early morning awakening (EMA). The results showed that DIS (OR=12.01, P<0.001), DMS (OR=12.82, P<0.001) or EMA (OR=12.08, P<0.001) was significantly associated with increased risk of suicide even after mental disorder was controlled for. Our study showed that insomnia can be an independent risk factor for suicide. Mental disorders mediated the association between insomnia and suicide. Insomnia should be assessed and treated for individuals at risk of suicide.

AB Introduction China has undergone massive social change over the past four decades. Since national estimates became available in 1987, the overall fatal injury rate has decreased. This paper investigates targeted interventions and sociodemographic factors that may have contributed to fatal injury rate changes particularly for road traffic fatality (RTF), suicide and drowning.
   Aims (1) To review the recent epidemiology of injury in China. (2)To investigate factors influencing trends in overall and specific cause injury mortality rates.
   Methods Published injury mortality statistics and related literature were reviewed. Factors potentially influencing trends were investigated in the context of rapid development based on literature reviews of targeted interventions, macrolevel and microlevel contextual factors and changes specific to RTF, suicide and drowning.
   Results Overall estimated national injury mortality rates in China decreased between 1987 and 2015, despite a rapid rise in RTF. Suicide and drowning rates decreased significantly and falls displaced drowning among the leading causes. The higher female to male suicide ratio reversed. Differences were observed in frequencies and proportions of deaths by major cause by age group and over time.
   Discussion Economic and structural development and related social change in this period include: urbanisation, changes in demographics, life choices (eg, internal migration), education, poverty alleviation, health insurance and relevant regulations/legislation. These factors potentially explain much of the change in fatal injury rates in China. Data limitations persist. Increased investment in data and research would provide realistic opportunities for accelerated progress in implementing effective targeted interventions to further reduce China's injury burden.

AB This is a pilot study whose objective was to collect data on attempted suicide in 5 districts of Shanghai and to test the feasibility of introducing an ongoing monitoring of attempted suicide. Data on a total of 363 cases were collected. The mean age of the patients was 33 years, 67% being female. Ingesting drugs or other chemical substances was the main method used for self-harm. Reasons for attempted suicide in these districts of Shanghai often appear to be related to family conflicts and unemployment. In spite of methodological limitations, the recorded data allow some preliminary conclusions regarding the characteristics of patients in districts of Shanghai admitted after a suicide attempt. Continuous monitoring of attempted suicide in this urban area of China should be established and data collection improved to raise awareness in health professionals and to develop preventive measures geared toward the needs of these patients.

AB Suicide rates in England and Wales have declined in recent years. A better understanding of age-associated trends in different ethnic groups may inform strategies to sustain this decline.
   This study examines suicide rates and age-associated trends in England and Wales by country of birth (used as a proxy for ethnicity) using the latest available national mortality data.
   The main findings were (a) suicide rates were generally higher in males than females in all age bands in all country of birth groups except the China group, where suicides rates were higher in females than males in the older age bands; (b) male suicide rates increased with ageing in the Indian sub-continent group and female suicide rates increased with ageing in the Africa and China groups; (c) male standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were generally higher in the younger age bands in the Eastern Europe and Caribbean groups and generally lower in the Australasian, Middle East and Western Europe groups; (d) male SMRs were generally higher in the older age bands in Eastern Europe, Caribbean, Australasian and Western Europe groups and lower in all age bands in the Indian sub-continent group, and (e) female SMRs were generally higher in the older age bands in the China, Africa and Caribbean groups.
   There is a need for epidemiological data on suicides in BME groups, including age-associated trends, trends over time, risk and protective factors and methods of suicide to inform suicide prevention strategies.

AB This study investigated the prevalence of suicidal behavior and psychological distress in university students across 12 nations. A total of 5,572 university students from 12 countries were surveyed about suicide ideation, suicide attempts, and psychological distress by means of a self-administered questionnaire. Almost 29% of the samples reported having contemplated suicide and 7% reported attempting suicide. Of the total sample, 51.1% scored above the General Health Questionnaire-123 cut-off points, 41.6% above the GHQ-124 cut-off points, and 33.8% scored above the GHQ-125 cut-off points. While odds of suicide ideation were elevated in Austria and the UK, reduced ORs were detected for China, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Turkey. Similarly, while odds of suicide attempt were high in Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, and to some extent in Turkey, reduced ORs were observed for Austria, China, Italy, Japan and the United States. Elevated ORs for psychological distress were seen in Japan, Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Turkey but reduced ORs were noted in Austria, China, Iran, Italy, and the United States. Psychological distress was strongly associated with reports of suicide ideation and attempts. Suicide ideation, suicide attempt, and psychological distress are common in university students but their rates vary depending on the sociocultural context. Due attention should be devoted to the mental health needs of young adults enrolled in higher educational institutions and more cross-cultural research is warranted to better understand the etiology of the observed intersocietal variations in suicidal behavior and psychological distress.

AB Asia is the world's largest continent, occupying approximately half the earth's land mass and containing half the world's population. Although ethnically, culturally, economically, and religiously diverse, there are a number of factors common to all Asian countries, as well as some important differences. It is estimated that suicides in Asia contribute 60% to the global one million suicides annually, with three Asian countries (viz. China, India, and Japan) accounting for more than 40% of this figure. Other Asian countries with high suicide rates include Kazakhstan, Sri Lanka, and South Korea. The majority of people dying by suicide in Asia are young, and pesticides are one of the most common methods used. In many Asian countries, the male to female ratio is much narrower and in China it is reversed. Given that there are 10-20 attempts for every completed suicide and at least six people are directly affected by a suicide or a serious attempt, there may be as many as 60 million people in Asia suffering from the consequences of a suicidal act every year, but postvention remains a neglected area in Asia. Due to a variety of legal, socio-cultural, and religious factors suicide rates in many Asian countries are grossly underestimated and there are huge research and knowledge gaps. A fifth of Asian countries either do not collect national mortality statistics on suicide or even if they do, they do not report them to the World Health Organization (WHO). To reduce the enormous burden of suicide in Asia, there is a need for more and better research to inform policy and establish culturally relevant suicide prevention programmes.

AB Background. Suicide rate among rural elderly is the highest among all age groups in China, yet little is known about the suicide risks in this rapidly growing vulnerable population.
   Methods. This matched case-control psychological autopsy study was conducted during June 2014 to September 2015. Consecutive samples of suicides aged 60 or above were identified in three provinces (Shandong, Hunan, and Guangxi) in China. Living comparisons were 1:1 matched with the suicides in age (3 years old), gender, and living location. Risk factors included demographic characteristics, being left-behind, mental disorder, depressive symptoms, stressful life events, and social support.
   Results. A total of 242 suicides and 242 comparisons were enrolled: 135 (55.8%) were male, mean (s.d.) age was 74 (8) years. The most frequently used suicide means were pesticides (125, 51.7%) and hanging (95, 39.3%). Independent risks of suicide included unstable marital status [odds ratio (OR) 4.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.61-10.92], unemployed (compared with employed, OR 4.43, 95% CI 1.09-17.95), depressive symptoms (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.21-1.48), and mental disorder (OR 6.28, 95% CI 1.75-22.54). Structural equation model indicated that the association between being left-behind and suicide was mediated by mental disorder, depressive symptoms, stressful life events, and social support.
   Conclusions. Unstable marital status, unemployed, depressive symptoms, and mental disorder are independent risk factors for suicide in rural elderly. Being left-behind can elevate the suicide risk through increasing life stresses, depressive symptoms, mental disorder, and decreasing social support. Elderly suicide may be prevented by restricting pesticides, training rural physicians, treating mental disorders, mitigating life stress, and enhancing social connection.

AB The purpose of the present study was to investigate attitudes toward suicide and suicide prevention among psychology students in Ghana by means of a qualitative analysis of open-ended questions about causes of suicide and how suicide best can be prevented. The students mainly saw the causes as intra-personal and almost all of them believed that suicide can be prevented. The results indicated a huge impact of religion on the attitudes toward suicide as well as some lack of distinction between their religious and professional roles and responsibilities.

AB In the context of rapid ageing, understanding the time-trend of elderly suicide (ES) could inform China's efforts on suicide prevention. We examined time-trends in Chinese ES rates (ESRs) from 1987 to 2014, a period of profound social changes. Suicide rates by residence (rural/urban), gender, and 5-year age-group (65+) in 1987-2014 were provided by the Chinese Ministry of Health. Time-trends were analyzed with joinpoint analysis. The time-trend of national ESRs was downward (average annual percent change [AAPC] = -3.7, P < 0.001): 76.6/100000 in 1987 and 30.2/100000 in 2014. However, the time-trend of corresponding percentages of ESs among the total suicides was monotonically increasing (AAPC = 3.4, P < 0.001): 16.9% in 1987 to 41.2% in 2014. The time-trends in ESRs of both rural and urban men and women were decreasing, but only the rural trends were significant (P < 0.001). Rural-urban and male-female differences in ESRs were decreasing over time (slope = -4.2 and -3.0, P = 0.006), but the rural-urban and male-female ESR differences in 2014 remained large (16.3/100000 and 9.8/100000, P < 0.001). While national ESRs decreased significantly during the past three decades, the current ESR remains high in China. Further, the age-pattern of Chinese suicide is transitioning to elderly predominance. ES, particularly rural ES, should be a public health priority in China.

AB Few studies on the validation of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) in Chinese have been conducted in the samples from rural area, whereas the mental health problems among rural Chinese deserve more attention. For instance, the suicide rate in rural China is about 3 times that of the urban rate. This study aimed at assessing reliability and validity of the CES-D in 2 special adult samples in rural China, with data obtained by face-to-face interviews. One sample consisted of the proxy informants for subjects who committed suicide, and the other was of the proxy informants for living controls. For each person who committed suicide and each control, a family member and close friend served as informants. This study focused on informants themselves (not the persons who committed suicide or the living control himself/herself). Suicide informants (n = 781) who had experienced the suicide of a relative or close friend in the past 6 months were compared with the control informants (n = 832) who had no such experience. Internal reliability was satisfactory (Cronbach coefficients were .949 for suicide informants and .880 for control informants). Good concurrent validity and criterion validity were found by analyzing the relations to negative life events and the Scale for Suicide Ideation. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that 3-factor structure (positive affect, interpersonal problems, depressive mood and somatic symptoms combined) had good fit in rural Chinese. These findings suggested that the CES-D had good reliability and validity when applied in these 2 adult samples in rural China. Factor structure analyses of the CES-D indicated that "somatization" process of expressing depressive symptoms still existed among rural Chinese. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background Suicide is a global health concern. Therefore, studying suicide behaviour and identifying the early roots of suicide are critical. To address these issues, the present study examined (i) the association between peer relationships and suicide ideation and attempts among Chinese adolescents; and (ii) whether such associations were moderated or mediated by feeling of loneliness. We hypothesized that problems in peer relationships were positively associated with suicide ideation and attempts, and that feeling of loneliness would moderate and mediate such associations.
   Methods The sample included 8778 Chinese adolescents from a large survey. Measures of peer relationships, suicide ideation and attempts, and feeling of loneliness were obtained through adolescents' self-reports.
   Results Results from multivariate logistic regressions suggested that specific problems in peer relationships, such as lack of peer association and being victimized by bullying, were significantly related to suicide ideation and attempts. In addition, the moderating effects of feeling of loneliness on the association between peer relationships and suicide ideation and attempts were found. Finally, some gender effects were also found.
   Conclusions The present study provided strong evidence that suicide ideation and attempts were serious problems among adolescents in China, to which peer relationships played an important role. Further, feeling of loneliness acted as a moderator affecting the association between peer relationships and suicide ideation and attempts. Finally, there were some gender differences that have important implications.

AB Background: There has been much literature on schizophrenia, but very little is known about the characteristics of suicides with schizophrenia in comparison with the suicides with other diagnosed psychiatric disorders and without psychiatric disorders.
   Methods: Thirty-eight suicides with schizophrenia, 150 suicides with other psychiatric disorder, and 204 suicides without a psychiatric disorder were entered in current study. Psychological autopsy (PA) was applied to collect information of the suicides. Social demographic factors and clinical characteristics of the suicides were measured. The well validated standard scales were applied: Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Landerman's Social Support Scale (DSSI), Dickman's Impulsivity Inventory (DII), Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD). Suicide intents were appraised by the Beck Suicide Intent Scale (SIS). The SCID based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) was applied to assess the psychiatric status of individuals. Demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, method of suicide and suicide intents of suicides were compared among the three groups (schizophrenia group, other psychiatric disorders group, and none psychiatric disorders group).
   Results: There were 9.7% of suicides who suffered schizophrenia. The current study found that being female was the risk factor for suicides with schizophrenia in rural China, which was opposite to the previous studies. The suicides with psychiatric disorder scored higher on hopelessness, anxiety, and depression, but lower on social support and impulsivity than suicides without psychiatric disorder. The suicides with psychiatric disorder were less impulsive than none psychiatric disorders group, too. The schizophrenia group did not show more violence than other psychiatric disorders group.
   Conclusions: This research compared the demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, method of suicide and suicide intents among the suicides with schizophrenia, with other diagnosed psychiatric disorder and without psychiatric disorders. The result indicated that each groups showed their unique characteristics, which gave us new viewpoints to control and prevent the prevalence of suicides according to their different characteristics.

AB Background: Suicide is an important public problem, the mechanism of which has not been clarified. Many studies have focused on the molecular, biological and genetic mechanisms of suicide. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) G196A is one of the most leading loci in recent studies, but the results are inconsistent. Methods: We conducted a 1:1 age-and sex-matched case-control study in rural areas of Shandong Province, China. A total of 365 pairs of cases and controls were finally recruited into our study. The adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of BDNF 196G/G and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multivariate conditional logistic regression models. Results: No association between BDNF polymorphisms and attempted suicide was found in the overall population. However, the BDNF 196G/G genotype was significantly related to attempted suicide in the elderly population (AOR = 7.85, 95% CI: 1.12-54.90, p = 0.038), while the associations were not significant in young and middle-aged groups. Conclusion: Our study suggests that the BDNF 196G/G genotype increases the risk of attempted suicide in elderly people. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB There have been few reports on the effect of suicide death on family members' attitudes toward suicide. lit order to estimate the extent to which suicide death affects attitudes toward suicide among family members of suicides, data of 264 informants from a case-control psychological autopsy study were analyzed. The results showed that there were no significant differences in attitudes toward suicide, measured by the General Social Survey's (GSS) four questions, between informants of suicides and informants of living controls, between family members of suicides and family members of living controls, or between family members of suicides and non-family members of suicides. Our findings did not support the hypothesis that suicide death affects the attitudes toward suicide in suicides' family members. However, some factors were found to be related to the pro-suicide attitudes measured by the four questions included in the GSS.

TI Case-control study of the relationship of depressive symptoms to suicide

AB Background: Suicide is the leading cause of premature death among people with schizophrenia. Most studies on suicide and schizophrenia report an associated depression history, but they are based on clinical samples from mostly western countries.
   Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of 74 suicides (cases) and 24 accidental deaths (controls) among persons with schizophrenia identified in a national psychological autopsy study in mainland China using the Chinese version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. A 'depression symptom severity score' based on number, severity, and persistence of depressive symptoms 2 weeks before death was derived from psychiatric interviews with 2 informants; determination of a 'dysfunction due to depressive symptoms score' was based on informants' reports about effects of depressive symptoms on decedents' functioning in the month before death. In addition, the mean number of negative life events was determined along with the effect of the events on the decedent. Comparison of the measures made for cases and controls were made by univariate analysis followed by adjustments using the False Discovery Rate.
   Results: Compared to persons with schizophrenia who died by accident, those who died by suicide were more likely to have a recent DSM IV diagnosis of major depression, the symptom of depressed mood, thoughts of death and a prior suicide attempt. In addition, those who died by suicide were more likely to have a higher overall depression severity score and greater dysfunction due to depressive symptoms.
   Discussion: This community-based study of individuals with DSM-IV schizophrenia who died by suicide in a non-western culture extends findings from clinical studies in western cultures providing data on the importance of depressive symptoms as risk factors for suicide in schizophrenia in a low income rural setting. These findings underline the importance of routine screening for depressive symptoms among patients with schizophrenia. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Cohort-specific risk of suicide for different mental disorders in China
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID SCHIZOPHRENIA; PREVALENCE; INPATIENTS; MORTALITY; ILLNESS; PEOPLE
AB Background
   The effect of gender, age, and urban versus rural residence on suicide risk among people with different mental disorders is unknown.
   Aims
   To estimate cohort-specific risk of suicide among people with different types of mental disorders using data from China's National Psychological Autopsy Study.
   Method
   Logistic regression models estimated adjusted odd ratios (OR) in 895 suicides and 701 injury deaths.
   Results
   The adjusted risk of suicide for mood disorders was highest (OR=44.2) followed by that for other mental disorders(OR=10.7), anxiety disorders (OR=10.2), psychotic disorders (OR=7.4), substance use disorders (2.7) and organic mental disorders (OR=1.2). Risk of suicide among urban residents with any mental disorder was more than double that of rural residents (OR=15.5 v. 7.6, P=0.008).
   Conclusions
   The suicide risk associated with mental illness varies by type of illness and by demographic cohort. Lower risk of suicide among rural residents with mental disorders highlights the importance of non-mental health approaches to the prevention and management of suicidal behaviour in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries.

AB Most of the previous researches indicated depression and anxiety were potential risk factors for suicide, and they were also highly correlated. However, few studies have explored their combined effects on suicide and the dimensions which really work. A total of 392 suicide cases aged 15-34 years and 416 community controls of the same age range were investigated. The results showed that after controlling confounding factors, people with low depression and high anxiety, with high depression and low anxiety, with high depression and high anxiety were at 2.46, 26.32, 54/7 times more risk for suicide (all P < 0.05), compared with subjects with low depression and low anxiety. Only two of seven dimensions of depression (including cognitive disturbance, helplessness, excluding anxiety dimension) and one of two dimensions of STAI anxiety (anxiety dimension, not depression dimension) were risk factors for suicide (all OR > 1). Our main findings was that combined effects of depression and anxiety on suicide were complicated, and the effects of anxiety dimension of depression and depression dimension of anxiety must be cautiously evaluated, avoiding overlapping inclusion.

AB The aim of this study is to explore the long-term trends of suicide mortality in China. We implemented the age-period-cohort (APC) framework, using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013. Our results showed that the net drift of suicide mortality was -4.727% (95% CI: -4.821% to -4.634%) per year for men and -6.633% (95% CI: -6.751% to -6.515%) per year for women, and the local drift values were below 0 in all age groups (p < 0.01 for all) for both sexes during the period of 1994-2013. Longitudinal age curves indicated that, in the same birth cohort, suicide death risk increased rapidly to peak at the life stage of 20-24 years old and 15-24 years old for men and women, respectively, and then showed a decelerated decline, followed by a rise thereafter after 54 years old for men and a slight one after 69 years old for women. The estimated period and cohort RRs were found to show similar monotonic downward patterns (significantly with p < 0.01 for all) for both sexes, with more quickly decreasing for women than for men during the whole period. The decreasing trend of suicide was likely to be related to the economic rapid growth, improvements in health care, enhancement on the level of education, and increasing awareness of suicide among the public in China. In addition, fast urbanization and the effective control of pesticides and rodenticides might be the special reasons behind these trends we observed in this study.

AB Background suicide is a major public health issue in China. However, research on the impact of absolute and relative economic stats on suicide is scarce among the Chinese population, particularly rural young adults. Using a case-control psychological autopsy study design, we aimed to investigate the effect of family absolute and relative income on suicide among Chinese rural young adults and to further explore the potential mediating mechanism under these associations.
   Method the information of 393 suicide cases and 416 community living controls were collected for this study. A Binary Choice Model was used to analyze the association between family absolute and relative income and suicide risk, as well as potential mediating factors for these associations.
   Results a much stronger association was found between relative income and suicide than between absolute income and suicide. Social support was a dominant mediator for the association between family relative income and suicide among both female and male young adults. Coping strain emerged as a mediating factor within the link between absolute income and suicide for males.
   Conclusions public health interventions to reduce suicide should pay more attention to relative income in addition to absolute income as potential targets for intervention, and how social support and coping strain act as mediating factors.

ID RISK-FACTORS; IMPULSIVITY; RATES
AB Background: Previous studies have examined the prevalence of psychological strains among various suicide populations. However, it is still unexamined whether psychological strains can predict suicide intent directly.
   Aims: We planned to explore the prevalence of psychological strains and analyze the relationship between psychological strains and suicide intent among Chinese rural young suicides.
   Methods: Psychological autopsy method was used to investigate the environmental and other factors of rural young suicides. Psychological strains were identified from in-depth interviews by the proxy informants of each suicide. The first 8 items of Beck's Suicidal Intention Scale (SIS) were used to estimate the suicide intent.
   Results: Results showed that 96.6% of the suicides had at least one type of strain, and those suicides who had more strains tended to score higher on the suicide intent scale.
   Conclusion: The study further supports that suicide intent can be predicted by psychological strains in Chinese rural young suicides. The scanning of psychological strains can be used for suicide prevention in Chinese rural young suicides.

DE Schoolchildren; Suicide Issues; Analysis of Cause
AB Currently, the suicide of schoolchildren has become an increasingly prominent social issue. Based on media reports of the suicide cases of schoolchildren in 2013, this paper briefly summarizes the basic characteristics of the suicide cases and attempts to classify the causes of the suicides from four aspects, namely, the confrontation between teachers and students, family conflicts, study pressure, and suicide pacts. A deeper analysis reveals, however, that the suicide of schoolchildren is not caused by the fragile mental states of individuals, but by highly intense study pressure that leads to general breakdowns. The fundamental cause lies in China's overly-competitive examination-oriented education system. Radical changes need to take place in the country's education system so that the suicides of schoolchildren can be reduced and prevented.

AB Background We investigated the current temporal trends of suicide in Zhejiang, China, from 2006 to 2016 to determine possible health disparities in order to establish priorities for intervention. Methods We collected mortality surveillance data from 2006 to 2016 from the Zhejiang Chronic Disease Surveillance Information and Management System from the Zhejiang Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. We estimated region-specific and gender-specific suicide rates using joinpoint regression analyses to determine the average annual percentage change (AAPC) and its 95% CI. Results The crude suicide rate declined from 9.64 per 100 000 people in 2006 to 4.86 per 100 000 in 2016, and the age-adjusted suicide rate decreased from 9.74 per 100 000 in 2006 to 4.14 per 100 000 in 2016. During 2006-2013, rural males had the highest suicide rate, followed by rural females, urban males, and urban females, while after 2013, urban males suicide rates surpassed rural female suicide rates, and became the second highest suicide rate subgroup. The rate of suicide declined in all region-specific and/or gender-specific subgroups except among urban males between 20 and 34 years of age. Their age-adjusted suicide rate AAPC greatly increased to 28.39 starting in 2013 compared with an AAPC of -13.47 from 2006 to 2013. Conclusions The suicide rate among young urban males has been alarmingly increasing since 2013, and thus, researchers must develop targeted effective strategies to mitigate this escalating loss of life.

AB Sri Lanka has the one of highest rates of suicide. Important factors associated with suicide were determined via the psychological autopsy approach (which had not been carried out previously in Sri Lanka). Over a 3-month period, in a catchment area, 31 suicides among Sinhalese were identified and 27 were investigated. Males were more likely to commit suicide and alcohol abuse and domestic violence were reported as contributory factors. We found it possible to use psychological autopsy methods to obtain information which can inform planned prevention measures.

AB In 2010, 18 employees working for Foxconn in China attempted suicide. These shocking events focused the world's attention on the manufacturing supply chains of China's export industry and the experience of working within them. What had driven these young, migrant, assembly line workers to commit such a desperate act? This article provides a first-hand account of the experiences of one of those who survived a suicide attempt, 17-year-old Tian Yu. Her personal narrative is embedded within the broader context of labour process, work organisation and managerial practice at Foxconn, the Taiwanese-owned multinational that provides products and components for Apple and others. The factory conditions are further shaped by the company trade union and Chinese government policies. The paper concludes with additional contextualisation indicating the emergence of an alliance of workers, students, scholars and transnational labour movement activists who are campaigning for Chinese workers' rights.

AB Background: This study investigated suicide risk and its correlates among major affective disorder patients in China and examined possible risk factors for future suicide among individuals with major affective disorder to inform appropriate interventions and management approaches to minimize and prevent suicide.
   Methods: A total of 1478 major affective disorder patients were consecutively examined in 13 mental health centers in China. The patients' socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded using a standardized protocol and data collection procedure. DSM-IV diagnoses were established using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), and suicide risk was assessed by the suicide risk module of the MINI.
   Results: Of the patients, 963 (65.2%) were in the nonsuicidal risk group and 515 (34.8%) were in the suicidal risk group. Compared to major depressive disorder patients, bipolar disorder patients had higher suicide risk levels (chi(2) =10.0, df = 1, P = 0.002); however, there were no statistically significant differences (chi(2) =2.6, df = 1, P =0.1) between bipolar disorder -1 and bipolar disorder II patients. Suicide risk factors were associated with 6 variables in major affective disorder patients, as follows: male gender, unemployed, more frequent depressive episodes ( > 4 in the past year), depressive episodes with suicidal ideation and attempts, depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms, and no current antidepressant use.
   Limitations: Most of the data were retrospectively collected and, therefore, subject to recall bias.
   Conclusions: This study suggested that bipolar disorder patients have a higher suicide risk than major depressive disorder patients. The factors that were significantly associated with suicide risk may aid in identifying major affective disorder patients who are at risk for future suicidal behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: To determine the prevalence of suicide behaviors and the associations between aggression and suicide behaviors among a nationwide school-based sample of adolescents in rural China.
   Methods: A total of 16,271 students from 24 junior and 23 senior high schools in five provinces of China participated in a self-administered anonymous survey to report suicide ideation, plans, attempts, aggression and other related information. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations between aggression and the risks of suicide behaviors while controlling for potential confounders.
   Results: The prevalence of suicide ideation, plans, and attempts during the past one year was 15.1%, 7.2%, and 3.5% respectively. In the fully adjusted model, participants with high level of total aggression had 4.31 times (95% CI, 3.69-5.05), 4.10 times (95% CI, 3.26-5.11), and 3.29 times (95% CI, 2.62-4.93), higher risk of suicide ideation, plans, and attempts, respectively, compared with subjects who had low level of total aggression. Moreover, high levels of all the five dimensions of total aggression also had positive associations with suicide behaviors.
   Limitations: This study was cross-sectional. Hence, the causal link between aggression and suicide behaviors should be verified in the future studies.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that aggression may be a risk factor for suicide behaviors among rural Chinese adolescents. Our findings highlight the importance of aggression treatment in suicide prevention programs. Further longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these associations.

AB Background: Premature death from suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide. However, the pattern and risk factors for suicide and other external cause injuries are not well understood. This study investigates mortality from suicide and other injuries and associated risk factors in China.
   Methods: A prospective cohort study of 169,871 Chinese adults aged 40 years and older was conducted. Mortality due to suicide or other external cause injuries was recorded.
   Results: Mortality from all external causes was 58.7/100,000 (72.3 in men and 44.4 in women): 14.1/100,000 (14.2 in men and 14.2 in women) for suicide and 44.6/100,000 (58.1 in men and 30.2 in women) for other external cause injuries. Transport accidents (17.2/100,000 overall, 23.4 in men and 10.8 in women), accidental poisoning (7.5/100,000 overall, 10.2 in men and 4.8 in women), and accidental falls (5.7/100,000 overall, 6.5 in men and 5.0 in women) were the three leading causes of death from other external cause injuries in China. In the multivariable analysis, male sex (relative risk [RR] 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-2.38), age 70 years and older (2.27, 1.29-3.98), living in north China (1.68, 1.20-2.36) and rural residence (2.82, 1.76-4.51) were associated with increased mortality from suicide. Male sex (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.95-3.20), age 60-69 years (1.93, 1.45-2.58) and 70 years and older (3.58, 2.58-4.97), rural residence (2.29, 1.77-2.96), and having no education (1.56, 1.00-2.43) were associated with increased mortality from other external cause injuries, while overweight (0.60, 0.43-0.83) was associated with decreased risk of mortality from other external cause injuries.
   Conclusions: External cause mortality has become a major public health problem in China. Developing an integrated national program for the prevention of mortality due to external cause injuries in China is warranted.

TI Suicide and mental disorders in Asia

ID RISK-FACTORS; BIPOLAR; SCHIZOPHRENIA
AB Sixty one percent of the suicides in the world occur in Asia. The suicide rate of Asia has been calculated as 12.6/100,000. This is an underestimate as data is unavailable for 20.7% of the Asian population. Population-based studies on suicide in Asia reveal that 68-97% had diagnosable psychiatric disorders. Only 35-40% of suicides in India and China received the diagnosis of depression. The association between depression and suicide is less pronounced in Asia. Demographic and socio-cultural risk factors for suicide in Asia are different from Western countries but clinical factors appear to be more similar than different. Suicide is a major public and mental health problem in Asia and there is an urgent need to develop effective national suicide prevention strategy in Asian countries.

AB Background The suicide rate in China is estimated to be around three times the global average, with women in the 15- to 24-year-old age group particularly vulnerable. Despite this, there is a dearth of information on the prevalence and predictors of depression and suicide ideation in Chinese adolescents. The specific aims of the study were, therefore., to quantify the rates and severity of self-reported depression and suicide ideation in middle-school students, to examine the relationship between depression and attempted suicide, and to identify sociodemographic associations. Methods A cross-sectional survey using self-completion questionnaires was carried out in six middle schools (predominant age range 13-17 years) in an urban and a rural setting in Zhejiang Province in eastern China. Results There were 1,576 completed questionnaires. One-third of the students had suffered symptoms of severe depression, with 16% admitting to suicide ideation and 9% to actually having attempted suicide. Factors independently associated with severe depression were female gender, poor self-reported academic performance and rural residence. Similar factors were associated with suicide ideation and attempted suicide. Depression was less common in those without siblings. Patterns of help-seeking showed reliance on friends and parents, with very low levels of professional help-seeking (around 1%) and 30% having sought no help from any source for psychological problems. Conclusion The results of the study contributed to service developments and the addition of psychological issues to the school health education curriculum.

AB Suicide is a major problem worldwide, and suicides in Asian countries account for as much as 60% of all suicides in the world. There are many unique features in suicides within this ethnically-diverse continent, from the methods used, to the putative risk factors. Much research still needs to be done to guide efficacious and culturally relevant interventions in suicide prevention; existing literature suggests a strong focus for programmes that address restricting access to pesticides, increasing crisis counseling activities, improving the accessibility and delivery of mental health services, and promoting responsible media reporting of suicide and related issues. There is a need for coordinated national suicide plans to be developed that are sensitive to the socioeconomic and cultural factors in the local context.

AB There are few long-term studies on suicide in psychiatric settings in China. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long term suicide risk and its associated factors after the initial psychiatric assessment. Demographic and clinical data of adult subjects receiving psychiatric assessment between 1996 and 2000 in a district hospital in Hong Kong were retrieved from the hospital computer system. Data were matched with completed suicides before June 30 2015 as recorded by the Coroner's Office. From a total of 4078 subjects identified, there were 152 (3.7%) recorded suicides; one-fifth of suicides occurred within one year, and half within 5 years. Cox regression analysis revealed that the risk of suicide after the initial psychiatric assessment was positively associated with deliberate self-harm (Hazard ratio = 2.1; 95%CI = 1.5-3.0; p < 0.001), and negatively associated with 'no psychiatric disorder' (Hazard ratio = 0.4; 95%CI = 0.2-0.6; p = 0.001). The overall suicide risk for those diagnosed to have a psychiatric disorder was 4.4%; 4.5% for men and 4.3% for women. Deliberate self-harm and having a psychiatric disorder at the time of assessment are significant risk factors of suicide. Appropriate treatment of psychiatric disorders and comprehensive management of deliberate self-harm are important for suicide prevention.

AB Introduction: The aim of this study is to examine the association between suicidal behavior and mental health status of south Chinese people, and explore the mediating effect of help-seeking behaviors. Methods: The study participants were 10,757 persons aged 18 years and older from the mental health survey of Xiamen city. Data on suicidal behavior and help-seeking behavior were collected by trained psychiatric nurses through face-to-face interviews. Mental health status was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Multiple logistic regression and general linear model were used in statistical analysis. Results: In the entire study sample, 236 study participants reported suicide ideation (2.19%, 95% CI: 1.92-2.47%), and 59 reported at least one suicide attempt (0.55%, 95% CI: 0.41-0.69%). Individuals with suicide attempt and suicide ideation had higher GHQ scores than those without suicidal behavior. The majority of study participants with suicide ideation or suicide attempt did not seek any help (77.5% and 79.7%, respectively). Among participants with suicidal behavior, seeking help from mental health professional was associated with a better mental health status (OR = 4.04, 95% CI: 1.17-10.16). Discussion: Only a small proportion of individuals with suicide behavior in south China had ever sought help. Seeking help was associated with a better mental health status.

AB A statistical association between ambient air pollution and suicide mortality has been recently reported in Environmental Health, which seems not to be scientifically supported by their data. In this article, very low (unrealistic) suicide rate is reported, which is subjected to selection bias. Their justification is also flawed as high exposure to ambient air pollution in rural areas is lower as compared to urban residents. Weekends, holidays, time of death. are also both air pollution and suicide rate related. Reported statistical association of air pollution and suicide in this study is heavily confound.

AB Background: Depression is an important public health problem and is closely associated with suicidal behavior in the population. Although the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) is widely used for assessment of depression, the psychometric characteristics of this scale have not been explored in studies of suicide attempters and local residents in rural areas.
   Methods: In this study, reliability and validity of CES-D were assessed in 409 suicide attempters and 409 comparison residents from rural China and through internal consistency analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).
   Results: Cronbach's alpha values of the CES-D were 0.940 and 0.895 in, respectively, suicide attempters and comparison residents. CES-D scores were significantly correlated with the scores of Trait Anxiety Inventory (TAI) and Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) in both the suicide attempters and the comparison residents. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that 3-factor structure (positive affect, interpersonal problems, depressive mood and somatic symptoms combined) with 14 items (excluding items 9, 10, 13, 15, 17, and 19) had the best fit in these two populations.
   Conclusions: The CES-D scale has satisfactory reliability and validity when used for assessing depression in suicide attempters and comparison residents in rural China.

AB Objective: This is the first community-based epidemiological study examining the prevalence of suicidal behaviors, their transitional pathways, and their relationship with mental disorders in metropolitan China.
   Method: Suicidal behaviors, including ideation, plans, and attempts were assessed by face-to-face household interviews among 5201 respondents in Beijing and Shanghai in 2001-2002. Lifetime prevalence and risk factors were examined using multivariate discrete-time survival models.
   Results: The lifetime prevalence estimates of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts were 3.1%, 0.9%, and 1.0% respectively. Among suicide ideators, the conditional probability of ever making a plan and an attempt was 29.5% and 32.3% respectively. Progression from ideation to plan and attempt was the highest during the first year after onset. Suicide attempt was predicted by young adulthood, being unmarried, recent onset of ideation and plan, and the presence of mental disorders, especially mood disorder.
   Conclusion: Suicidal behaviors in metropolitan China exhibit a low prevalence and an epidemiological profile resembling that found in Western countries.

AB Objective: Compare the sociodemographic and psychological characteristics of suicide attempters admitted to emergency departments of general hospitals in China that do and do not meet diagnostic criteria for mental disorders.
   Methods: The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Suicide Ideation Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and a quality of life measure were administered to 239 consecutive suicide attempters who were treated in the emergency departments of four randomly selected general hospitals in Shenyang.
   Results: Among the enrolled subjects, 166 (69.5%) met diagnostic criteria for a current mental disorder. Among these 166 subjects, 62.7% had mood disorders, 14.5% had anxiety disorders, 10.8% had psychotic disorders and 3.6% had substance use disorders. The 73 suicide attempters without a mental disorder were younger, had higher levels of impulsiveness and were more likely to have ideas about being rescued. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the following independent predictors of having a current psychiatric disorder in the suicide attempters: female gender (OR=3.67, 95% CI= 1.23-10.91), more than 6 years of formal education (OR=1.19, 95% CI=1.04-1.36), a higher score on the suicide ideation scale (OR=1.01, 95% CI=1.00-1.03), a higher score on Hamilton depression rating scale (OR=1.26, 95% CI=1.16-1.37) and a lower score on the quality of life scale (OR=0.75, 95% CI=0.63-0.90).
   Conclusion: The prevalence of psychiatric disorders in suicide attempters in emergency departments of urban China is lower than that reported in most western countries. Suicide attempters with and without mental illnesses are distinct on a number of important dimensions. Mental health assessment and appropriate discharge planning for patients treated in emergency departments for suicide attempts are crucial components of comprehensive suicide prevention efforts.

AB This study aimed to examine the prevalence and correlates of lifetime suicide attempts and current suicidal ideation in community-dwelling schizophrenia patients in China.
   A sample of 540 schizophrenia patients was randomly selected in Beijing, China. All subjects were interviewed using standardized assessment instruments and their basic socio-demographic and clinical data including history of suicide attempts were collected.
   The prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts and the point prevalence of suicidal ideation were 12.0 %, and 21.1 %, respectively. In multiple logistic regression analyses, the presence of lifetime suicide attempt was independently associated with rural residence, having major medical conditions and better social functioning, while higher likelihood of current suicidal ideation was associated with past suicide attempt, the severity of overall psychopathology and depressive symptoms and lower psychological quality of life (QOL).
   Among Chinese outpatients with schizophrenia, increased current symptoms and poorer QOL were correlated with current suicidal ideation, while demographic factors and indicators of greater social support were mostly correlated with lifetime suicide attempts. This study may help to identify important subgroups of patients with schizophrenia at particularly high risk of suicidal behavior.

AB Suicide may be moralistic in naturea response to conduct the perpetrator defines as deviant. Moralistic suicide can be explained with a general theory of social control. Donald Blacks theories of social control explain the handling of grievances with their social structureor geometryas defined by the social characteristics and relationships of those involved in a conflict. Here I draw on Blacks paradigm of pure sociology and theories of social control to identify the social structure of moralistic suicide. For example, moralistic suicide varies directly with social closeness and is greater in an upward direction than in a downward direction. This theory is simple, general, testable, and explains variation not addressed by previous theories of suicide.

AB As Beck's Suicide Intent Scale (SIS) gains popularity in various areas in the world, we are not sure whether the scale is an optimal measure of suicide intent in the Chinese culture. This study is to provide evidence to support the use of the Chinese shortened version of SIS (C-SIS) in Chinese societies. The data were from applying the C-SIS in a psychological autopsy (PA) study of 66 suicides in Dalian, China. Reliability and validity tests were performed on the C-SIS data. Internal consistency analysis showed excellent correlation coefficients for all items but one. Inter-rater reliability tests showed statistically significant correlations between each pair of informants for each item and for the total scores. Criterion validity analysis demonstrated a relatively high correlation between the scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and C-SIS. Factor analysis produced three factors accounting for 66.77% of the total variance. The study suggested that C-SIS should be an appropriate instrument for detecting and measuring suicide intent in Chinese societies.

AB Background: Preventing suicide is a global imperative. Although the effects of social and individual risk factors of suicide have been widely investigated, evidence of environmental effects of exposure to air pollution is scarce. We investigated the effects of ambient air pollution on suicide mortality in Guangzhou, China during 2003-2012.
   Methods: A conditional logistic regression analysis with a time-stratified case-crossover design was performed to assess the effects of daily exposure to three standard air pollutants, including particulate matter less than 10 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM10), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), on suicide mortality, after adjusting for the confounding effects of daily mean temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and sunshine duration. Further analyses were stratified by season, gender, age group, educational attainment and suicide type.
   Results: Between 2003 and 2012, there were a total of 1 550 registered suicide deaths in Guangzhou. A significant increase in suicide risk were associated with interquartile-range increases in the concentration of air pollutant, with an odds ratio of 1.13 (95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 1.27) and 1.15 (95 % CI: 1.03, 1.28) for PM10 and NO2 at lag 02, and 1.12 (95 % CI: 1.02, 1.23) for SO2 at lag 01, respectively. The suicide risks related to air pollution for males and people with high education level were higher than for females and those with low education level, respectively. Significant air pollution effects were found on violent suicide mortality and in cool season but not on non-violent suicide mortality or in warm season.
   Conclusions: Suicide risk was positively associated with ambient air pollution levels. This finding would provide important information for the health impact assessment of air pollution and for the development of effective strategies and interventions for the prevention of suicide.

DE assisted suicide; euthanasia; international; suicide
AB Suicide, assisted suicide and euthanasia are elusive and controversial issues worldwide. To discuss such issues from only one perspective may be limiting. Therefore, this paper was written by authors from various regions, each of whom has been asked to reflect on the issues. The countries/cultures are: Australia, China, Cuba, Ireland, India, Japan, Russia, South Africa, The Netherlands, North America (Turtle Island) and United States. Historically and today, suicide is viewed differently. Assisted suicide and euthanasia are equally seen from multifarious perspectives. Highlighting development in the Netherlands, Australia's Northern Territory and Japan (ie. the famous Yamanouchi Case), the review shows growing re-examination of the right to die. There appear, however, to be no uniform legal and ethical positions. Further debate and discussion globally is needed to avoid myopic perspectives.

TI Evaluating the effectiveness of platform screen doors for preventing

LA English
DT Review
DE Metro suicide; Suicide prevention; Platform screen door; China
ID PHYSICAL BARRIERS; RAILWAY SUICIDES; SUBWAY SYSTEM; DIFFERENCE;
   PATTERNS; ACCIDENTS; BEHAVIOR; DRIVERS; ACTS
AB Background: Metro suicide can cause tremendous effects on the general public. Platform screen doors (PSDs) have been identified as one of the most effective methods of suicide prevention at metro stations. However, there are few studies focusing on their effectiveness in preventing suicides. In particular, the effect of types of PSDs, including full-height and half-height PSDs, has rarely been assessed and compared.
   Methods: Based on the suicide data provided by the Shanghai metro operator, the effectiveness of installing different types of PSDs for preventing metro suicides was investigated using a Poisson regression model. Ten-year monthly panel data for 94 metro stations from 2008 to 2017 were used in this study.
   Results: The number of metro suicides declined by 90.9% after the PSDs were installed at metro stations. In addition, different types of PSDs had different effects on decreasing the number of suicides, and a higher half-height PSD was more effective in preventing suicides. Specifically, full-height PSDs could eliminate metro suicides by completely preventing passengers from entering the track area, while half-height PSDs that were 1.5 m and 1.2 m high could decrease the number of suicides by 79.2% and 60.2%, respectively. Moreover, there was no significant indication that the installation of PSDs at metro stations displaced suicides to railway stations without PSDs (p = 0.706).
   Limitation: The potential economic benefits of different types of PSDs were not considered in our study. In addition, we did not examine whether suicide attempters would try to take their own lives by using other methods of suicide.
   Conclusion: The installation of PSDs, especially full-height PSDs, could be very effective in preventing suicides at metro stations. Although half-height PSDs are less effective than full-height PSDs, increasing the height of half-height PSDs could be an effective way of enhancing their effectiveness in reducing the number of suicides.

AB Objective: This study aimed to compare the similarities and differences between suicide completers and attempters in rural China.
   Methods: Two paired case control studies of completed suicide and suicide attempts were conducted in rural Shandong, China. This analysis included 409 suicide attempters (SA) with a mean age of 43.90 (SD = 13.31), 117 suicide completers (SC) with a mean age of 50.38 (SD = 13.02) and their controls matched by gender, age (within 3 years), and residence. Logistic regression models were used to examine risk factors of suicide attempts and completed suicide and the differences between SA and SC.
   Results: Compared to their matched controls, suicide attempters and completers shared the following common risk factors: low levels of education (middle school or under) (OR, 95% CI: 2.79, 1.40-5.55 for SA and 16.98, 1.59-181.60 for SC), negative life events (OR, 95% CI: 7.37, 4.73-11.50 for SA and 21.08, 4.74-93.71 for SC), and mental disorders (OR, 95% CI: 7.52, 3.85-14.69 for SA and 22.39, 2.65-189.60 for SC). Compared to suicide attempts, completed suicide was associated with the following risk factors: male gender (OR, 95% CI: 1.75, 1.06-2.90), advancing age (OR, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.00-1.04), poor family economic status (OR, 95% CI: 6.74, 3.22-14.13), prior suicide attempts (OR, 95% CI: 2.43, 1.18-4.97), family suicide history (OR, 95% CI: 2.59, 1.33-5.06), high suicide intent (OR, 95% CI: 1.15, 1.05-1.27), and highly lethal methods (OR, 95% CI: 13.65, 6.51-28.59).
   Conclusions: Although suicide completers and attempters share some common risk factors, suicide completers are more likely to have prior suicide attempts, family suicide history, and higher suicidal intent, and to use highly lethal methods in rural Chinese.

AB Background: We are not aware of any of impulsivity trait for Chinese rural youths. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of Dickman Impulsivity Instrument in suicide cases and living controls in rural China.
   Methods: The participants, 392 suicide victims and 416 controls were respectively selected, and the psychological autopsy method was used to collect information. The Exploratory Factor Analysis was processed to evaluate the construct validity. The Cronbach's alpha was computed to evaluate the internal consistency, and the Spearman rank correlation coefficients between STAI Trait Anxiety Inventory, Coping Responses Inventory and Dickman Impulsivity Instrument were calculated to evaluate the convergent validity.
   Results: Dysfunctional and Functional impulsivity were extracted for both samples. The mean of DI scores in suicide cases was larger than that in controls, but it was reversed for FI. There were no significant differences between DI and FI in suicide cases, but in controls the mean of DI scores was significantly smaller than that of FI. The Cronbach's alpha was around .863 and .779 respectively for DI and FI scales in suicides, and it was around .746 and .680 in controls. The DI and FI were significantly correlated with each other. Both the DI and FI were correlated with Approach and Avoidance Coping Response Inventory, and both of the scales were grossly independent with Trait Anxiety Inventory in two samples.
   Conclusion: The results indicated that the Dickman Impulsivity Instrument was adequate to measure impulsivity trait for suicide victims and living controls through proxy data in rural China. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB College students committing suicide is a very conspicuous problem in recent years, many scholars conducted research on the cause of this phenomenon. From the perspective of culture, this article analyzes the reasons behind the causes of the phenomenon of college students committing suicide and holds the viewpoint that in Chinese traditional culture and modern culture, some contents praised and esteemed by some people have essentially promoted the college students to commit suicide, so it is necessary to re-evaluate these cultural contents.

AB Under the background of social transition in China, this paper takes the Social Mutual-constitution Theory as its analysis framework, follows the specific analysis route, "social transition-government reform-officials' pressure bearing-suicide behaviors", and constructs the mechanism and the logical relationship of officials' suicide behaviors, which is to help us reproduce and analyse the internal logic of officials' suicide behaviors. It shows that the suicide behaviors are owed to the macro society and the meso organization which force the micro officials' personality structure. So the main reason why the officials commit suicide is the reverse mutual-construction relationship among society, government and officials.

AB Purpose: Despite robust empirical and theoretical evidence for higher rates of suicide among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youths, little is known about the relationship between suicide and sexual orientation among Asian youths. This study examined differences in prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts between LGB and heterosexual youths in the cities of Hanoi, Shanghai, and Taipei, China.
   Methods: The data are from a community-based multi-centre cross-sectional study conducted from 2006 to 2007, with a sample of 17 016 youths aged 15-24 years from Hanoi, Shanghai, and Taipei. Chi-square test and logistic regression were used to evaluate correlates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.
   Results: The overall prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in the preceding 12 months in LGB youths were both higher than in heterosexual youth (12.8% vs. 8.1% and 4.0% vs. 2.4%, respectively). Stratified by city, the prevalence of suicidal ideation was lowest in Hanoi (2.2%), followed by Shanghai (8.0%) and Taipei (17.0%). Similar trends were observed in the prevalence of suicide attempts, which was lowest in Hanoi (0.3%), followed by Shanghai (1.2%) and Taipei (2.5%). Of note, however, multivariate logistic regression results revealed that LGB youth were at a higher risk for suicidal ideation than heterosexual youth only in Taipei (odds ratio 1.65).
   Conclusions: Suicidality is common among Asian youth, with higher prevalence observed in urbanized cities. LGB youths are at greater risk of suicidal ideation than their heterosexual counterparts in Taipei than in the other two examined cities.

TI Creating a Chinese suicide dictionary for identifying suicide risk on
   social media
SO PEERJ

DT Article

AB Introduction. Suicide has become a serious worldwide epidemic. Early detection of individual suicide risk in population is important for reducing suicide rates. Traditional methods are ineffective in identifying suicide risk in time, suggesting a need for novel techniques. This paper proposes to detect suicide risk on social media using a Chinese suicide dictionary.
   Methods. To build the Chinese suicide dictionary, eight researchers were recruited to select initial words from 4,653 posts published on Sina Weibo (the largest social media service provider in China) and two Chinese sentiment dictionaries (HowNet and NTUSD). Then, another three researchers were recruited to filter out irrelevant words. Finally, remaining words were further expanded using a corpus-based method. After building the Chinese suicide dictionary, we tested its performance in identifying suicide risk on Weibo. First, we made a comparison of the performance in both detecting suicidal expression in Weibo posts and evaluating individual levels of suicide risk between the dictionary-based identifications and the expert ratings. Second, to differentiate between individuals with high and non-high scores on self-rating measure of suicide risk (Suicidal Possibility Scale, SPS), we built Support Vector Machines (SVM) models on the Chinese suicide dictionary and the Simplified Chinese Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (SCLIWC) program, respectively. After that, we made a comparison of the classification performance between two types of SVM models.
   Results and Discussion. Dictionary-based identifications were significantly correlated with expert ratings in terms of both detecting suicidal expression (r = 0.507) and evaluating individual suicide risk (r = 0.455). For the differentiation between individuals with high and non-high scores on SPS, the Chinese suicide dictionary (t1: F-1 = 0.48; t2: F-1 = 0.56) produced a more accurate identification than SCLIWC (t1: F-1 = 0.41; t2: F-1 = 0.48) on different observation windows.
   Conclusions. This paper confirms that, using social media, it is possible to implement real-time monitoring individual suicide risk in population. Results of this study may be useful to improve Chinese suicide prevention programs and may be insightful for other countries.

AB To estimate the prevalence of suicide attempts and explore the shared and unique factors influencing suicide risk in left-behind children (LBC) and non-left-behind children (NLBC) in rural China, this study collected data using a multi-stage cluster random sampling method from 13,952 children including 6,034 LBC and 7,918 NLBC. Sociodemographic characteristics, suicide attempts, neglect and physical abuse, negative life events, and loneliness were measured by self-reported questionnaires. Data were analyzed using logistic regression models. Gender and mother's education level were unique influential factors for NLBC while family structure type was a unique influential factor for LBC. The study provides two novel findings regarding NLBC specifically: 1. Children with optimal family socioeconomic status are more likely to report suicide attempts (odds ratio OR = 1) than are those in the general children population, OR 0.52 (95% Cl: 0.39-0.70), and 2. Children with higher mother's education level are subject to higher suicide rates in high school, OR 1.67 (95% Cl: 1.13-2.46), and post-secondary education, OR 2.14 (95% Cl: 1.37-3.37). The unique characteristics of LBC and NLBC in China suggest that investigating risk factors and determining the factors that might be targeted in intervention programs are urgently needed currently.

AB Background
   Little is known about gender differences in the long-term outcomes of people with schizophrenia living in the community.
   Aims
   To explore gender differences in the 14-year outcome of people with schizophrenia in rural China.
   Method
   A 14-year follow-up study among a 1994 cohort (n = 510) of participants with schizophrenia was conducted in Xinjin County, Chengdu, China. All participants and their informants were followed up in 2004 and 2008 using the Patients Follow-up Schedule.
   Results
   Compared with female participants, male participants were significantly younger, had significantly higher rates of mortality, suicide and homelessness, and poorer family and social support. There was no significant gender difference in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores, previous suicide attempts, those never treated, previous hospital admission or inability to work. Longer duration of illness was associated with functional decline and comparatively poorer family economic status.
   Conclusions
   The long-term outcomes of men with schizophrenia is worse than those of women with the disorder in rural China. Higher mortality, suicide and homelessness rates in men may contribute partly to the higher prevalence of schizophrenia in women in China. Policies on social and family support and gender-specific intervention strategies for improving long-term outcomes should be developed for people with this disorder.

AB Introduction: Ingestion of pesticides is the most common method of suicide, particularly in China, Sri Lanka and India. Reported pesticide suicides in India numbered 22,000 in the year 2006.z
   Method: Four villages in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India that had stopped using chemical pesticides in favour of non-pesticide management (NPM) were visited to assess any change in suicide incidence before and after discontinuation of chemical pesticides. Four similar villages in the same region that continued to use chemical pesticides were used as controls for comparison.
   Results: In the pesticide-free villages there were 14 suicides before introduction of NPM and only three suicides thereafter. The percentage of suicides not reported to authorities was 47%.
   Conclusion: Restriction of pesticide availability and accessibility by NPM has the potential to reduce pesticide suicides, in addition to psychosocial and health interventions.

   Method: Data from five East Asian jurisdictions and five English-speaking Western countries were obtained from national offices responsible for collection of statistics. Data were graphed to demonstrate differences between East Asian and Western age patterns of suicide. Relevant literature was reviewed, including observations concerning suicide rates in various non-English-speaking European countries.
   Results: Age patterns and rates of suicide differ between East and West and across time, but with Japan's and the United States patterns progressively becoming more similar.
   Conclusions: Sociocultural factors affect suicide patterns and rates; choice of method and cohort effects affect rates. Strategies for prevention of suicide should give attention to culture-related precipitants of suicide.

AB Background: Studies on the effects of interventions in patients who have attempted suicide in China have not reported so far. Aims: To describe the basic situation surrounding the interventions and follow-up of patients who have attempted suicide and to determine whether the interventions would be effective in reducing repeat suicide attempts. Method: 239 patients who had attempted suicide were evaluated in the emergency departments of four general hospitals. They were randomized into three groups: cognitive therapy group, telephone intervention group, and control group. Postintervention the participants were evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months separately by the following measurements: a detailed structured questionnaire, Beck Suicide Ideation Scale (SIS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD), and a quality-of-life scale. Results: After 12 months, the cumulative dropout rate was 69.5% (n = 57) for the cognitive therapy group, 55.0% (n = 44) for the telephone intervention group, and 64.9% (n = 50) for the control group. One patient (1.2%) in the cognitive therapy group, one patient (1.3%) in the telephone intervention group, and five patients (6.5%) in the control group made at least one subsequent suicide attempt. The rates of repeated attempted suicide among the three groups were not significantly different (chi(2) = 5.077, p = .08). Five patients (6.1%) received cognitive therapy, and 60 patients (75.0%) received telephone intervention. There were no differences regarding the score of HAMD, a quality-of-life scale, and the rates of subsequent suicide attempt and suicide ideation among the three groups at follow-up. Conclusions: The dropout rates were higher than those reported in developed countries. Most participants in the cognitive therapy group refused to receive cognitive therapy so that the effect of cognitive therapy for these patients cannot be evaluated. The participants in the telephone intervention group had good compliance, but the effect of telephone intervention could not be confirmed, so that more studies are needed in the future. Consequently, interventions cannot be evaluated accurately in their preventing suicide attempts for patients who have attempted suicide in China at present.

AB This study investigated the lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts (SA) and independent demographic and clinical correlates in stabilized schizophrenia inpatients. A cross-sectional study was conducted in three psychiatric hospitals in Anhui province, an agricultural province located in east China. Psychopathology and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), respectively. A total of 315 stable schizophrenia inpatients were interviewed prior to discharge. The lifetime prevalence of SA was 22.2%. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender (P < 0.001, OR = 3.4, 95%CI: 1.9-6.0), being married (P = 0.02, OR = 2.2, 95%CI: 1.1-4.4) and having more severe depressive symptoms (P = 0.014, OR = 1.2, 95%CI: 1.01-1.3) were independently and significantly associated with higher risk of SA. Lifetime SA is common among hospitalized schizophrenia patients living in agricultural areas of China. For suicide prevention, regular assessments, appropriate interventions and clinical management should be integrated into a community-based psychiatric service model for this population.

AB Introduction: Over the past 20 years the WHO has considerably improved world mortality data. There are still shortcomings but more countries now report data and world-wide estimates are regularly made. Methods: Data about mortality have been retrieved from the WHO world database. Worldwide injury mortality estimates for 2008 as well as trends of the suicide rate from 1950 to 2009 were analysed. Results: Suicides in the world amount to 782 thousand in 2008 according to the WHO estimate, which is 1.4% of total mortality and 15% of injury mortality. The suicide rate for the world as a whole is estimated at 11.6 per 100,000 inhabitants. The male-female rate ratio of suicide is estimated to be highest in the European Region (4.0) and the lowest in the Eastern Mediterranean region (1.1). Among males the highest suicide rate in the 15-29 age group is in the SE Asian region, in the 45-59 age group in European males and for ages above 60 in the Western Pacific region. Females from SE Asia have a remarkably high suicide rate among 15-29-year-olds and from age 45 in the Western Pacific region. The leading country is currently Lithuania, with a suicide rate of 34.1 per 100,000 inhabitants. Also among males the suicide rate is the highest in Lithuania at 61.2. Among females South Korea with 22.1 is at the top of world suicide rates. Conclusions: During the past six decades, according to the WHO Japan, Hungary, and Lithuania have topped the list of world countries by suicide rate, but if the current trends continue South Korea will overtake all others in a few years. The heart of the problem of suicide mortality has shifted from Western Europe to Eastern Europe and now seems to be shifting to Asia. China and India are the biggest contributors to the absolute number of suicides in the world.

AB Background: Suicide is one of the leading causes of prisoners' death, and, as a group, inmates have higher suicide rates than their community counterparts. However, the prevalence of suicidal ideation among Chinese inmates and their risks of suicide remain unknown. Aims: This study investigates the prevalence of suicidal ideation among Chinese incarcerated populations and its risk and protective factors. Methods: We randomly selected three types of prisoners (N = 690) and a sample of college students (n = 248) from four correction facilities and a police academy in China. A self-report questionnaire with standardized scales translated from the West was administered to the samples. Results: The prevalence of suicidal ideation among Chinese inmates is similar to that found among inmates in the West. The correlates of suicidal ideation for the Chinese inmates are also in line with what has been found in general populations. Conclusions: It is suggested that Chinese inmates have the same risk factors and protective factors for suicidal ideation as the general population in China. Suicide prevention in Chinese prisons can learn from and inform suicide prevention work for the general population.

AB Objective To analyse suicides occurring in Turkey between 1990 and 2010 according to sex, age, reason and method.
   Methods Data concerning suicides occurring in Turkey between 1990 and 2010 were obtained from annual records published by the Turkish Statistical Institute. Data were analysed according to sex, age, reason for suicide and suicide method.
   Results The crude suicide rate was 2.42 per 100 000 population in 1990 and 4.02 per 100 000 population in 2010. The highest number of suicides was seen in those aged 15-24years. In this age group, the number of suicides in females was significantly higher than in males. The most common suicide method in Turkey was hanging. Men used firearms more frequently than women. All the reasons for suicide occurred in a higher number of males than females; however, the difference between males and females was more significant for economic problems, relationship problems and educational failure. The leading reason for suicide in females was relationship problems.
   Conclusion Detecting population subgroups with a high suicide risk and obtaining regional demographic data are of great importance for future studies on suicide prevention.

AB This study examined the reliability and validity of the instruments as used in the psychological autopsy method in China. With data from 130 informants on 66 completed suicides and 130 informants on 66 normal community controls and 66 controls themselves, the validity was examined by comparing the responses of informants and the responses (gold standards) of the target participants in the control group. All the tested instruments were shown to be reliable, and proxy respondents were generally good judges of targets' suicidal intention, social support, depression, life events, personality traits, and mental disorders. Additionally, interrater reliabilities of the five interviewers were very good on selected scales. This study has laid a partial foundation for future psychological autopsy projects to be held in Chinese culture.

AB Objective: This study was to explore the main influencing factors of attempted suicide and establish an early warning model, so as to put forward prevention strategies for attempted suicide.
   Method: Data came from a large-scale case-control epidemiological survey. A sample of 659 serious suicide attempters was randomly recruited from 13 rural counties in China. Each case was matched by a community control for gender, age, and residence location. Face to face interviews were conducted for all the cases and controls with the same structured questionnaire. Univariate logistic regression was applied to screen the factors and multivariate logistic regression was used to excavate the predictors.
   Results: There were no statistical differences between suicide attempters and the community controls in gender, age, and residence location. The Cronbach's coefficients for all the scales used were above 0.675. The multivariate logistic regressions have revealed 12 statistically significant variables predicting attempted suicide, including less education, family history of suicide, poor health, mental problem, aspiration strain, hopelessness, impulsivity, depression, negative life events. On the other hand, social support, coping skills, and healthy community protected the rural residents from suicide attempt.
   Conclusions: The excavated warning predictors are significant clinical meaning for the clinical psychiatrist. Crisis intervention strategies in rural China should be informed by the findings from this research. Education, social support, healthy community, and strain reduction are all measures to decrease the likelihood of crises.

ID GENDER; AGE; ILLNESS; OLD
AB Objective: Asian culture venerates elderly people. It was hypothesized that elderly suicides would be proportionately lower in Asian societies than in English-speaking countries (ESC).
   Method: Elderly (i.e. aged 75 years or more) to general population suicide ratios were compared for six Asian societies and six ESC. based upon the latest 5-year suicide rates.
   Results: Males: The general population suicide rate was highest in rural China (227 per million) and third highest in Japan (217 per million), but other countries with high rates were all ESC (ranging from 224 to 198 per million). Asian countries had the six highest elderly suicide rates, 1327-1373 per million, whilst the highest ESC elderly rate was in the United States (507 per million). Asian societies had the widest range of elderly/general ratios, ranging from 6.62 to 2.6. Females: The overall suicide rates were higher in Asian countries (5795 per million) than in ESC (40-56 per million). Asian elderly suicide rates differed (932 per million in rural China to 154 per million in Korea) but the highest ESC rate was in Australia (76 per million). The Asian countries elderly/general ratios ranged from 5.82 : 1 to 2.70 : 1, but the widest ESC ratio was 1.71 : 1, in the United Kingdom.
   Conclusion: There is a need for country-specific prevention measures in elderly people, and particularly for older women in Asian countries.

AB This aim of this study was to identify unique characteristics of serious suicide attempters across different age groups. Face to face interviews were conducted with medically serious suicide attempters in rural hospitals in two provinces in China (n = 791). The sample included three age groups: 15-24,25-34, and 35-45. While there were some consistent patterns that emerged across the age groups, there were also some significant age-related patterns that emerged. Serious suicide attempters aged 15-24 were more likely to be well educated, never married, hold Party membership, and impulsive, and to be least likely to perceive social support and be in a peasant occupation. This category also had the highest proportion of males, although still predominantly female. Those aged 24-25 were more likely to have a family history of suicide, somewhat educated, and moderately likely to be married. Those aged 35-45 were more likely to have limited education, to be ever married, to have mental disorders, to store pesticides in their home, and the least likely to be impulsive. These results highlight age-specific intervention strategies in addressing suicide.

TI Inpatient suicide in a Chinese psychiatric hospital

DT Article
ID RISK-FACTORS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DISORDERS; BEHAVIOR
AB Little is known about the risk factors for suicide among psychiatric inpatients in China. In this study we identified the risk factors of suicide among psychiatric inpatients at Guangzhou Psychiatric Hospital. All psychiatric inpatients who died by suicide during the 1956-2005 period were included in this study. Using a case-control design, 64 inpatients with schizophrenia who died by suicide were compared with a matched 64 controls. The results indicate that the rate of suicide was 133.1/100,000 admissions (95%CI 103.4-162.9). There were no significant differences in the method, location, or time of suicide between mate and female inpatients. The number of hospitalizations was significantly larger in the suicide group than that in the control group. In logistic regression analyses, guilty thought, depressive mood, and suicidal ideation and suicide attempt 1 month before hospital admission were identified as independent predictors of suicide among inpatients with schizophrenia. The findings of risk factors for schizophrenic inpatient suicide should be taken into account when developing interventions to prevent suicide among these patients.

AB Objective: According to World Health Organization, for every committed suicide there were 20 suicide attempts at least. In the last decade, despite the increasing awareness on suicide attempts among adolescents in China, there has been no comprehensive system reporting vital statistics. Consequently, the prevalence of suicide attempts reported in some studies ranged variedly. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to provide the first meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies of suicide attempts to fill this gap.
   Methods: Two reviewers independently screened potentially relevant cross-sectional studies of suicide attempts through PubMed-Medline, Embase, Wanfang Data, Chongqing VIP and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases using the core terms 'suicid*'/'suicide attempt*'1' attempted suicide' and adolescen*'/' youth' /'child*'/' student*' and 'China'/'Chinese' in the article titles, abstracts and keywords. Chi-square based Q test and I-2 statistic assessed the heterogeneity. Forest plot was used to display results graphically. Potential publication bias was assessed by the funnel plot, Begg's and Egger's test.
   Results: In total, 43 studies with 200,124 participants met the eligibility criteria. The pooled prevalence of suicide attempts among Chinese adolescents was 2.94% (95% CI: 2.53%-3.41%). Substantial heterogeneity in prevalence estimates was revealed. Subgroup analyses showed that the prevalence for males was 2.50% (95% CI: 2.08%-3.01%), and for females was 3.17% (95% CI: 2.56%-3.91%).
   Conclusions: In sum, abstracting across the literatures, the prevalence of suicide attempts among Chinese adolescents was moderate compared with other countries around the world. Necessary measures should be set out prevent them in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DE Chinese; elderly suicide; trend
ID RECENT TRENDS; TAIWAN; RATES
AB Introduction: Studies on suicide rate in the elderly have shown vast differences in different regions. This review summarizes the literature on the elderly suicide trend in Chinese populations, namely China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, comparing these data to those in the USA and the UK. Methods: We reviewed 22 articles which we retrieved from a computerized search on elderly suicide in Chinese population from the above four regions. Results: These studies reported a general downward trend in elderly suicide, with higher rates in the Asian Chinese population. These studies also reported a higher rate of elderly male suicide compared to elderly female, with hanging being the most common method in urban areas. Discussion: Looking into suicide prevention programs and their relationship with the suicide trend, we hope to bring across a strong message that suicide is preventable. We also hope to encourage more research in this field, especially in preventive medicine, targeting at-risk individuals in the community.

TI Fearless Love, Death for Dignity: Female Suicide and Gendered
   Subjectivity in Rural North China
SO CHINA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSY; RISK-FACTORS; RESISTANCE; RATES; WORKERS
AB While the high rates of female suicide in rural China have attracted much scholarly attention, previous studies have not addressed the psychological processes by which individual women in rural areas decide to attempt suicide. Based on ethnographic research in Hebei villages, this article examines different types of gendered subjectivity that lead some rural women to make fatal decisions. Suicidal behavior is an important form of female agency that asserts rural women's moral aspiration for freedom and individual rights, but this form of agency does not highlight their ability to resist. Rather, it points to their powerless positions in the community. From these findings, I argue that neither the concept of resistance nor that of subjection can properly represent the complex realities and inner voices of rural women who attempt suicide.

   SHAME; RATES; RISK; PSYCHIATRY; EUTHANASIA
AB In many Western countries, the criminalization and stigmatization of suicide has given way to a biomedical approach aimed at destigmatizing suicide and treating underlying mental illness. By contrast, in many East Asian countries, suicide has never historically been criminalized or stigmatized. High rates of suicide in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have recently led policy makers in those countries to pursue innovative suicide-prevention strategies. The intentional denormalization of harmful behaviors has been discussed in the public health and ethics literatures, particularly with regard to smoking cessation, and could represent a novel mechanism for preventing suicides in East Asia. Using examples from the sociocultural, historical, and legal discourses surrounding suicide in Western and East Asian contexts, we suggest that denormalization can be a justified, culturally relevant suicide-prevention strategy, but that care must be taken to avoid shaming or stigmatizing suicidal individuals. Specifically, we propose the term weak denormalization to refer to an ethically permissible strategy at the mildest end of a spectrum of denormalizing approaches-milder than the reintegrative shaming described in the criminal justice literature, and diametrically opposed to outright stigmatization, which is generally considered ethically impermissible. Given the severe stigma of mental illness in East Asia, adopting the dominant Western view of suicide as solely a psychiatric concern would not be justified. Weak denormalization strategies in East Asia should be culturally tailored and rigorously tested on a small scale. They should include social supports, praise for the bravery of those of who seek help, and strategies to reduce shame regarding perceived social failure.

AB This qualitative inquiry examined the unique experiences of members in religious groups in the US and China to inductively derive a theory of what protects against suicide. Twenty-one non-religious group members (NRGMs), 21 religious group members (RGMs), and four from both types of groups completed interviews which were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Results suggest that while both NRGMs and RGMs convene around a shared common goal, the RGMs goal was to live a life of faith together. Both NRGMs and RGMs experienced community, but RGMs' valued vulnerable sharing and prayer as vital to growing their faith. Results are most consistent with the theory that religion protects against suicide because it shapes beliefs which enable a suicidal person to resist suicidal thinking. RGMs from China reported limited resources including few mature, experienced people who can provide spiritual guidance.

AB Rates, methods and some of the risk factors of suicide seem to depend on geographical and cultural differences, which involve conducting research in specific high-risk areas facing the implementation of preventive strategies. This study seeks to determine the risk and protective factors of suicide in the region of Antequera-Malaga (Spain). Is performed on a case-control study using the psychological autopsy of 40 cases of suicide and 80 population controls matched on gender, age and area of residence. The multivariate model found is composed of the following factors: the antecedents of suicide and mental disorders aggregate in families, a diagnosis of personality disorder and family conflict in the month prior to suicide. These factors discriminate risk populations facing the implementation of preventive programs.

   Methods: Transgender Men (TM) and Women (TW) were investigated through a cross-sectional survey. A structured questionnaire was used to investigate participants' demographic information, perceived sexuality conflicts, childhood adversity and mental health conditions. Logistic regression models were utilized to investigate risk factors associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in these groups. We also conducted a quasi-meta-analysis in order to compare the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempted suicide between general and transgender populations in China.
   Results: A total of 1309 participants across 32 provinces and municipalities in China took part in this survey, out of 2060 valid questionnaires. In this transgender population, the lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and an attempt at suicide were 56.4% and 16.1%, respectively. This estimated prevalence rate is far greater than in Chinese community samples. For all transgender people, disliking birth-assigned sex, seeking sex reassignment surgery, having intense conflicts with parents, lifetime history of suffering from major depressive disorder, a recent episode of depression, self-harm, and seeking mental health services were significantly associated with increased risk of suicidal ideation. An education level of high school or equivalent, being married and/or separated/divorced, having intense conflicts with parents, or self-harm and seeking mental health services were all significantly associated with increased risk of suicide attempt. Although most risk factors for TM and TW were equivalent across groups, differences were observed in both suicidal ideation and suicide attempt models.
   Limitations: The cross-sectional study design and lack of follow-up data are limitations of this study.
   Conclusions: This is the first study to examine suicide within a Chinese transgender population. The clinical implications of these findings for Chinese mental health professionals are discussed. Also, the evidence from this study can be used to inform the practices of suicide prevention workers, and policy makers working with the transgender population.

AB The prevalence and odds ratios of different suicide risk factors were compared in three pairs of decedents: 80 suicides and 25 injury decedents with blood relatives with suicidal behavior history (biologically exposed); 259 suicides and 126 injury decedents with unrelated acquaintances with suicidal behavior history (socially exposed); and 471 suicides and 523 injury decedents with neither relatives nor acquaintances with suicidal behavior history (unexposed). Negative life events and high psychological stress were more common in socially exposed suicides than in other suicides. The adjusted odds ratios of most established suicide risk factors were higher in unexposed decedents than in biologically or socially exposed decedents, suggesting that the predictive value of established risk factors wanes in individuals who have been exposed to suicidal behavior in family or friends.

AB Background: The distinctive epidemiologic profile of suicide in China, with notably high rates among rural young adult females, invites examination of possible underlying risk factors. Although there are accumulating data regarding the epidemiology of suicide among youth and young adults in China, there are meager data on suicidal ideation and attempts despite its importance.
   Methods: Our study in 2005-06 sought to identify all potentially suitable rural participants, aged 16-34 years, from 10 representative villages in rural Sichuan Province. We conducted structured interviews regarding a range of socio-demographic characteristics and suicidal morbidity.
   Results: 1654 of a potential 3008 participants participated; lifetime and one-year prevalence were: suicidal ideation (18.8% and 5.2%), serious ideation (8.6% and 23%), planning (5.8% and 1.5%), and attempt (2.7% and 0.5%). Comparisons among strata of socio-demographic characteristics showed more prevalent suicidal ideation associated with: female gender, lower education, poorer financial perception, greater rurality of residence, and marital status of "never married" or "others". Suicidal attempt was associated with: female gender and a marital status of "others". Limitations: The study was carried out in one province and caution is required when considering other rural regions of China. There were a substantial number of unapproachable subjects because of their migrant work at distant sites.
   Conclusions: Our results revealed an apparently higher prevalence for suicide ideation and planning compared with residents of other countries, but a lower prevalence for attempts. These data suggests that the relatively high rate of suicide in rural China reflects an elevated case fatality ratio due to chosen methods. The results also revealed unique patterns for correlates with the occurrence of ideation and attempts. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to determine whether there is a difference between men and women in terms of suicide age, suicide method and suicide reason in Turkey. This study recruited 17,327 cases that had committed suicide between 1990 and 2000. Of all the cases who committed suicide during a period of 11 years, 61. 1 % were men, 38.9% women. The highest suicide score fell into the age group 15-24 (P < 0.001). The most frequently used methods for suicide were self-hanging (48.2%) and use of firearms (19.2%) (P < 0.001). The proportion of those committing suicide taking chemicals (drugs, etc.) was higher in women than in men (P < 0.001). The most frequently seen reasons for suicide were illness and (33.8%) unsatisfactory relationships (33.0%) (P < 0.001, each one). Women committed suicide much more because of unsatisfactory relationships, whereas for men it was due to illness (20.8% and 14.6%, respectively). There were significant differences between men and women in terms of suicide age, suicide method and suicide reason in Turkey. When evaluating suicide cases it is essential that the differences between sexes be taken into consideration. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Psychiatric disorders exhibited in 13% suicidal drownings in Southwestern Croatia and 63% in Milan, but in China is unknown. This study is committed to outline the feature of a suicidal drowning with psychiatric disorder, show mental status and reveal key factor to high incidence in China. Immersed corpses were handled by SPSBMPH in its jurisdiction range. Half of immersed corpses were suicidal, and nearly half of suicides had psychiatric disorders. 104 suicidal drownings with psychiatric disorders cases from 2010.1 to 2014.6 were reviewed (21.5% of all immersed corpses, 42.1% of suicides). Most victims clothed normally, and only 2 fastened attached weights. Male victims were more and younger than female. Psycho were prone to commit suicidal drowning in warm and hot season. Psycho were prone to choose familiar area to commit suicide, 45 decedents were found in their familiar areas. Suicidal drowings were occult without suicide attempts, suicide note or abnormal clothing, but showed abnormal mental or behavior changes prior to suicide. The three leading psychiatric disorders were depression (33.7%), depression status (30.8%) and schizophrenia (20.2%). Only 44.2% decedents had visited psychiatric disorder specialist, and merely less than 10% patients could adhere to regular medication. No regular medication on psychiatric disorder was the key factor contributing to high incidence of suicide in psycho. Professional psychiatric and psychological intervention should be taken as soon as possible when they had psychiatric symptoms or suffered misfortune. Guardians should be alert to patients' abnormality to detect their suicidal ideation and intervene, especially in warm season.

AB Background: There is a lack of evidence for the role of loneliness on suicide using psychological autopsy method, and the validity of proxy informants' reports on loneliness is not well established. This study aimed to investigate the validity of proxy respondent reports on loneliness, and the reliability and validity of the University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale-6 (ULS-6) as used in psychological autopsy method with rural elderly people in China.
   Methods: Two hundred forty-two suicide cases and 242 normal community controls were selected, and the psychological autopsy method was utilized to collect information. Data from proxy respondents of the living controls were compared with data reported by the targets (gold standards).
   Results: Subject-proxy concordance for ULS-6 was fair (ICC = 0.447) in the living controls. The suicide cases were more likely to have a higher score of ULS-6 than the living controls. Additionally, our data supported that ULS-6 had adequate psychometric properties in both suicide and control groups: factor analyses yielded one-factor component solution; Cronbach's alpha (both > 0.90) demonstrated excellent internal consistency; the Spearman correlation analysis indicated that the ULS-6 score was positively correlated with depression; and negatively correlated with QOL and social support.
   Conclusions: Results support proxy-based data on loneliness in research of suicide in older adults in rural China, and the ULS-6 is a psychometrically sound instrument for measuring loneliness in psychological autopsy studies.

AB This study evaluated the characteristics of suicidal behavior (suicide attempt or suicidal ideation) among 230 consecutively admitted inpatients with schizophrenia and mood disorders in a university hospital in China. The rate of lifetime suicidal behavior was found to be significantly higher in patients with mood disorders (62.4%) than in patients with schizophrenia (38.6%). The rate of suicidal behavior was significantly higher in patients with major depressive disorder (86.8%) than those with bipolar disorders (42.6%). Patients with schizophrenia attempted suicide for the first time earlier in life than the patients with mood disorders. Mood disorder patients, especially those with major depressive disorder, had more and more serious suicide attempts than the patients with schizophrenia.

AB Suicide is one of the important public health concerns among adolescents. Previous research has demonstrated that family discord plays important roles in adolescent suicidality. However, little is known about the associations between interparental conflict and adolescent suicide ideation and suicide attempts, as well as the mediating mechanisms underlying these associations. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationships between interparental conflict and Chinese adolescents' suicide ideation and suicide attempts, as well as the mediating role of peer victimization underlying these relations. A total of 2758 middle school students (M (age) = 13.53 years; 46% males) from 10 middle schools in southern China participated in this study. They completed anonymous questionnaires regarding interparental conflict, peer victimization, and suicide ideation and suicide attempts. The results indicated that after controlling for demographic variables, interparental conflict positively predicted both suicide ideation and suicide attempts. Additionally, peer victimization partially mediated the relations between interparental conflict and suicide ideation and suicide attempts. Finally, although the direct and indirect effects of interparental conflict on suicide ideation and suicide attempts were found for both boys and girls, there were interaction effects for gender. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

AB Background: Suicide was investigated in the urban setting of Kampala, Uganda.
   Objectives: Firstly, to explore the use of two research methodologies, a retrospective review of patient records and the psychological autopsy methodology in suicide research in Uganda. Secondly to investigate the characteristics and correlates of urban suicide in Uganda.
   Results: A male to female ratio of suicide of 3.4:1 and a peak age of suicide in the 20-39 years age group were found. The main methods of suicide were hanging and ingestion of poison (organophosphates). Problems with social networks, negative life events, higher psychological distress and lower quality of life were associated with suicide at univariate analysis. It was only psychological distress that retained significance at multivariate analysis.
   Conclusion: The retrospective review of records at Mulago hospital was beset by incomplete records whereas a pilot psychological autopsy study was well accepted and might contribute valuable data in African settings.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify associations between suicide ideation and indicators of psychological distress and health behaviors in Chinese and Philippine adolescents. Method: Global School Health Surveys consisting of 9015 Chinese and 7338 Philippine students aged 11 to 17 years were analyzed using logistic regression to determine demographic, psychosocial, and health/risk behavioral determinants of suicide ideation. Results: In both samples, suicide ideation was associated with substance use, physical activity, feelings of loneliness, hopelessness/sadness, and worrying. Chinese girls were more likely to than boys to report suicide ideation and suicide planning, whereas Philippine girls were more likely to report suicide planning. Overweight status and sedentary behaviors were associated with increased risk of suicide ideation in Chinese adolescents, but the same influences were observed to be protective for Philippine adolescents. Conclusions: Psychosocial, demographic, and health/risk behaviors factors appear to impact suicide ideation and suicide planning in both of these youth populations.

TI Assessing depressive symptoms in persons who die of suicide in mainland
   China
SO JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
LA English
DT Article
DE depression; suicide; diagnostic instruments; psychological autopsy;
   China
ID COMMUNITY; RISK
AB Background: The potential insensitivity to depression of translated diagnostic instruments makes it difficult to assess the relationship of depressive symptoms to suicide in non-Western cultures.
   Methods: Addition of culturally sensitive probes and other modifications were made to the depression section of the Chinese version of the SCIDI- the standard SCID probes and the expanded-probes are separately used to assess each symptom of depression, the resultant diagnoses and the overall severity of depression. This modified SCID was included in the psychological autopsy interviews with family members and, separately, close associates of 887 suicides and 72 1 non-suicidal decedents from 23 regions of mainland China.
   Results. Compared to the standard inter-view, the expanded-probe method increased reported prevalence of major depressive episode among suicide decedents from 26.4% (234/887) to 40.2% (357/887) and for other deaths from 1.0% (7/721) to 2.1% (15/701). The additional 131 cases identified using the expanded-probe method had substantial social impairment and a greatly elevated risk of suicide compared to those with no depressive symptoms (OR=37.0, 95% CI=17.6-77.6). Inter-observer reliability for major depressive episode between the two independent interviews was greater for the expanded probe method (ICC=0.77 vs. 0.67, P < 0.001). For both interview methods there was a strong dose-response relationship between suicide risk and the number and severity of depressive symptoms.
   Limitations: This study uses proxy informants to obtain information about the psychological status of deceased subjects; the value of this expanded-probe method for the diagnosis of depression in non-Western Cultures needs to be confirmed with living subjects.
   Conclusions: Adding culture-appropriate probes about depressive symptoms to standardized diagnostic instruments identifies many Chinese subjects with unrecognized depression. Dimensional measures of depressive symptoms are more powerful predictors of suicide risk than categorical diagnoses. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

LA English
DT Article
ID RISK-FACTORS
AB Characteristics of four age groups of patients with medically serious suicide attempts from nine general hospitals in China (N = 617) were compared. There were no significant age-group differences by residence (rural vs. urban), method of attempt, proportion with prior attempts, or level of family functioning. Attempters <= 20 years of age were less likely to use alcohol at the time of the attempt. Attempters age 20-44 years had less regular contact with family members but were more likely to make the attempt in the presence of someone else. And attempters >= 45 years were more likely to have high suicidal intent, lower quality of life, mood disorders, and substance abuse disorders. These results highlight the need for age-specific intervention programs for suicide attempters.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the characteristic features of suicides in Thailand between 1998 and 2003. Collected data during 1998-2003 from the Bureau of Policy and Strategy, Ministry of Public Health were analyzed to reveal the mortality from suicide according to age, gender, rate and methods of suicides. Suicide rates were found to have increased to a peak of 8.6 per 100 000 (5290 suicides) in 1999 and then to have decreased to 7.1 per 100 000 in 2003. The average suicide rate during 1998-2003 was 7.9 per 100 000 with a male to female ratio of 3.4:1. Male suicide reached a peak for those aged 25-29 years (21.9 per 100 000) while female suicide showed less variation with age. Hanging was the most common method used, followed by ingestion of agricultural toxic substances. Suicide was most prevalent in upper northern region where HIV infection might be related to the high prevalence. Suicide prevention program should focus on males in early adulthood, and particular measures should be conducted to reduce risk factors related to HIV infection among people in northern Thailand.

LA English
DT Article
DE Aspiration; Suicide; Depression; Mental disorder; China
ID PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSY; SOCIAL SUPPORT; STRAINS; CHINESE
AB Background: The Strain Theory of Suicide postulates that psychological strains usually precede suicide mental disorders including suicidal behavior. The four sources of strain are basically (1) differential value conflicts, (2) discrepancies between aspiration and reality, (3) relative deprivation, and (4) lack of coping skills. This paper focuses on the effect of perceived failed life aspiration on the individual's mental disorder and suicide risk.
   Method: Data for this study were from a large psychological autopsy study conducted in rural China, where 392 suicides and 416 community living controls were consecutively recruited. Two informants (a family member and a close friend) were interviewed for each suicide and each control. Major depression was assessed with HAM-D and the diagnosis of mental disorder was made with SOD.
   Results: It was found that individuals having experienced failed aspiration were significantly more likely than those having not experienced a failed aspiration to be diagnosed with at least one disorder measured by the SCID and major depression measured by HAM D, and to be a suicide victim, which is true of both suicides and controls.
   Conclusion: This study supports the hypothesis that the discrepancies between an individual's aspiration and the reality is likely to lead to mental disorder including major depression and suicidal behavior. Lowering a patients unrealistic aspiration can be part of the of psychological strains reduction strategies in cognitive therapies by clinicians' and mental health professionals.

AB Background: Epidemiologic studies have reported conflicting results relating smoking to suicide risk. We conducted a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to evaluate the association of cigarette smoking with completed suicide.
   Methods: Eligible prospective cohort studies were identified from PubMed and EMbase databases (from 1966 to May 2011) and the reference lists of retrieved articles. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Study-specific risk estimates were pooled using random-effects model and generalized least squares trend estimation was used to assess dose-response relationship.
   Results: Fifteen prospective cohort studies involving 2395 cases among 1,369,807 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Our data suggested that cigarette smoking significantly increased the risk of completed suicide. Compared with never smokers, the pooled RR was 1.28 (95% CI: 1.001-1.641) for former smokers, and 1.81 (95% CI: 1.50-2.19) for current smokers, respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the increased suicide risk among current smokers appeared to be consistent, although there was heterogeneity among studies of current smoking (p < 0.001). Significant dose response relationship was found between smoking and suicide, and the risk of suicide was increased by 24% for each increment of 10 cigarettes smoked per day (RR, 1.24; 95% CI: 1.20-1.28).
   Conclusions: Our meta-analysis robustly demonstrates that cigarette smoking is associated with an increased risk of completed suicide, consistent with a dose response relationship. This conclusion has an important public health message for countries with high smoking prevalence and high suicide rate such as China. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Disability, which has been proved to be associated with suicide and suicidal ideation, has received little attention in relation to suicidal attempts among the elderly. The aim of this study was to explore the influence of disability on attempted suicide within this demographic.Method: A multi-stage cluster sample of 8399 residents aged 60 or more was investigated from 15 communities in Shanghai, China. Disability was measured using the Lawton instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scale.Results: The prevalence of attempted suicide in the elderly was 0.75%. Specific IADL disabilities, including shopping (OR = 3.01, 95% CI = 1.56-5.81), preparing meals (OR = 4.12, 95% CI = 2.12-8.00), housekeeping (OR = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.01-6.06), doing laundry (OR = 2.82, 95% CI = 1.09-7.35), using transport (OR = 3.10, 95% CI = 1.36-6.99) and medical care (OR = 4.41, 95% CI = 2.10-9.17), were significantly and independently associated with attempted suicide in the elderly. The presence of at least one such disability was associated with an almost threefold increase in the attempted suicide rate, and the presence of five or more IADL disabilities was associated with an approximate fivefold increase in the attempted suicide rate.Conclusion: Specific IADL disabilities, such as preparing meals or dealing with medical care, may be significant predictive factors for risk of suicidal attempts among the elderly. Therefore, elderly people with certain disabilities should be considered for suicide prevention interventions and should be supported in IADL as much as possible.

AB Medical college students are a high-risk population of suicidal ideation, plan and attempt. However, few studies discuss the effect of parental characteristics on suicidal ideation, plans and attempts among medical college students in China. A total of 2198 respondents answered the questionnaires referring social-demographic characteristics, psychological conditions, parental characteristics, suicidal ideation, plan and attempt. The prevalence of suicidal ideation, plan and attempt among the subjects were 17.9%, 5.2% and 4.3%, respectively. The results of multiple logistic regression showed that male, mother's education level, mother's parenting style, relationship in parents and psychological condition were associated with lifetime suicidal ideation. Male, mother's vocation, mother's parenting style, relationship in parents and psychological conditions were associated with suicide plan. Male, relationship in parents and psychological condition were associated with suicide attempt. Those imply that mother may play more roles on suicidal ideation and plan than father among medical college students in China. Psychological condition has a very strong association with suicidal ideation, plan and attempt.

AB This study explores the effects of social psychological factors on suicidal intent among suicide attempters in rural China. Suicide attempters were identified by the county-level Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) and interviewed by the research team. A path analysis was conducted with physical illness, social support, and negative life events as exogenous variables, and life satisfaction, depressive emotions, and suicidal intent as endogenous variables. Beginning with a saturation model, a best model was obtained after removing the paths that were not significant. In the final model, depressive emotions and life satisfaction were directly associated with suicidal intent, and the standardized effect estimates were 0.3007 (p < 0.001) and -0.1182 (p = 0.0368). Physical illness, social support, and negative life events did not directly affect suicidal intent but had indirect effect. Depressive emotions may be the most important and direct predictor of suicidal intent; physical illness, negative life events, and social support affect suicidal intent through life satisfaction and depressive emotions.

AB Background. The objectives were to assess thoughts about suicide, plans to commit suicide and suicide attempts in the community, to investigate the use of health services following a suicide attempt, and to describe basic socio-cultural indices of the community.
   Method. The community survey was one component of the larger WHO multisite intervention study on suicidal behaviours (SUPRE-MISS). In each site, it aimed at randomly selecting and interviewing at least 500 subjects of the general population living in the catchment area of the emergency department where the intervention component of the study was conducted. Communities of eight SUPRE-MISS sites (in Brazil, China, Estonia, India, Iran, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam) participated plus two additional sites from Australia and Sweden conducting similar surveys.
   Results. Suicide attempts (0(.)4-4(.)2%), plans (1(.)1-15(.)6%), and ideation (2(.)6-25(.)4%) varied by a factor of 10-14 across sites, but remained mostly within the ranges of previously published data. Depending on the site, the ratios between attempts, plans, and thoughts Of Suicide differed substantially. Medical attention following a suicide attempt varied between 22% and 88% of the attempts.
   Conclusions. The idea of the suicidal process as a continuous and smooth evolution from thoughts to plans and attempts of suicide needs to be further investigated as it seems to be dependent on the cultural setting. There are indications, that the burden of undetected attempted suicide is high in different cultures; an improved response from the health sector on how to identify and support these individuals is needed.

AB Background: In western countries, imprisoned females are at high risk for suicide, but the risk in Chinese imprisoned females has not been well established. The aim of this study was to clarify the suicide risk and its correlates among imprisoned females in China.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, subjects were recruited from the Female Prison of Hunan province, China. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic and criminological data. The Suicidality module of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) 5.0 and 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) were used to assess suicide risk and mental health problems, respectively. Ordinal logistic regressions were used to identify independent factors associated with increased suicide risk.
   Results: A total of 2,709 imprisoned females completed the survey questionnaire. Twenty percent were rated as presenting suicide risk. Mental health problems [odds ratio (OR) = 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.00-1.47], self-reported help-seeking for mental health problems (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.11-2.56), violent offending (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.37-2.09), history of drug use (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.15-1.84), family history of mental disorders (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.10-2.23), marital status (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.05-1.58), and low educational level (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.11-1.67) were independently associated with increased suicide risk.
   Conclusion: One fifth of the imprisoned females are at risk for suicide. This study highlights the importance of assessing mental health status for suicide prevention among female prisoners.

AB This study was conducted to examine differences in proximal risk factors and suicide methods by sex and age in the national suicide mortality data in Korea. Data were collected from the National Police Agency and the National Statistical Office of Korea on suicide completers front 2004 to 2006. The 31 711 suicide case records were used to analyze suicide rates, methods, and proximal risk factors by sex and age. Suicide rate increased with age, especially in men. The most common proximal risk factor for suicide was medical illness in both sexes. The most common proximal risk factor for subjects younger than 30 years was found to be a conflict in relationships with family members, partner, or friends. Medical illness was found to increase in prevalence as a risk factor with age. Hanging/Suffocation was the most common suicide method used by both sexes. The use of drug/pesticide poisoning to suicide increased with age. A fall from height or hanging/suffocation was more popular in the younger age groups. Because proximal risk factors and suicide methods varied with sex and age, different suicide prevention measures are required after consideration of both of these parameters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

SO BMJ OPEN

DT Article
ID RATES; GENDER; AGE
AB Objectives: To estimate the incidence of serious suicide attempts (SSAs, defined as suicide attempts resulting in either death or hospitalisation) and to examine factors associated with fatality among these attempters.
   Design: A surveillance study of incidence and mortality. Linked data from two public health surveillance systems were analysed.
   Setting: Three selected counties in Shandong, China.
   Participants: All residents in the three selected counties.
   Outcome measures: Incidence rate (per 100 000 person-years) and case fatality rate (%).
   Methods: Records of suicide deaths and hospitalisations that occurred among residents in selected counties during 2009-2011 (5 623 323 person-years) were extracted from electronic databases of the Disease Surveillance Points (DSP) system and the Injury Surveillance System (ISS) and were linked by name, sex, residence and time of suicide attempt. A multiple logistic regression model was developed to examine the factors associated with a higher or lower fatality rate.
   Results: The incidence of SSAs was estimated to be 46 (95% CI 44 to 48) per 100 000 person-years, which was 1.5 times higher in rural versus urban areas, slightly higher among females, and increased with age. Among all SSAs, 51% were hospitalised and survived, 9% were hospitalised but later died and 40% died with no hospitalisation. Most suicide deaths (81%) were not hospitalised and most hospitalised SSAs (85%) survived. The fatality rate was 49% overall, but was significantly higher among attempters living in rural areas, who were male, older, with lower education or with a farming occupation. With regard to the method of suicide, fatality was lowest for non-pesticide poisons (7%) and highest for hanging (97%).
   Conclusions: The incidence of serious suicide attempts is substantially higher in rural areas than in urban areas of China. The risk of death is influenced by the attempter's sex, age, education level, occupation, method used and season of year.

AB Background: Agricultural pesticide poisoning is a major contributor to the global burden of suicide. Over the last decade there has been a marked decrease in the incidence of suicide worldwide. It is unclear whether pesticide poisoning still plays a significant role in the global incidence of suicide.
   Methods: WHO method-specific suicide data were supplemented by a systematic review of the literature between 2006 and 2015, including searches of thirteen electronic databases and Google, citation searching and a review of reference lists and personal collections. Our primary outcome was the proportion of total suicides due to pesticide poisoning. Weighted estimates were calculated for seven WHO regional and income strata.
   Results: We identified data from 108 countries (102 from WHO data, 6 from the literature). A conservative estimate based on these data indicates that there were approximately 110,000 pesticide self-poisoning deaths each year from 2010 to 2014, comprising 13.7% of all global suicides. A sensitivity analysis accounting for under-reporting of suicides in India resulted in an increased estimate of 168,000 pesticide self-poisoning deaths annually, that is, 19.7% of global suicides. The proportion of suicides due to pesticide self-poisoning varies considerably between regions, from 0.9% in low-and middle-income countries in the European region to 48.3% in low-and middle-income countries in the Western Pacific region.
   Limitations: High quality method-specific suicide data were unavailable for a number of the most populous countries, particularly in the African and Eastern Mediterranean regions. It is likely we have underestimated incidence in these regions.
   Conclusion: There appears to have been a substantial decline in fatal pesticide self-poisoning in recent years, largely driven by a reduction in overall suicide rates in China. Nonetheless, pesticide self-poisoning remains a major public health challenge, accounting for at least one-in-seven suicides globally.

AB This study evaluated the validation of STAI Trait-Anxiety Scale in suicide cases and community living controls in rural China. The participants were 392 suicides and 416 controls. Cronbach's Alpha was computed to evaluate the internal consistency. The Spearman Correlation Coefficient between Trait-Anxiety Scale and other instrument was calculated to evaluate the external validity, and the Exploratory Factor Analysis was used to evaluate the construct validity. The results showed the Cronbach's Alpha was .891 and .787 respectively in case and control groups. Most of the correlations between instruments were significant. We found 2 factors in cases and 3 factors in controls. We could cautiously infer that the Trait Anxiety Scale was an adequate tool to measure trait anxiety through proxy data in suicide victims and living controls in rural China.

ID CELEBRITIES; WOMEN; RISK; GAP
AB Background: Extensive media reporting of suicide events has been indicated as a contributing factor to the upsurge in suicide rates in Taiwan in the past decade. Aims: The study compares gender differences in sociodemographic profiles and method of suicide selectively reported in the newspapers and all suicide cases registered in official death records. It also identifies gender differences in media reports of suicides. Methods: Articles reporting suicide news from four major newspapers in Taiwan (China Times, United Daily, Liberty Times, and Apple Daily) in 2009 were retrieved and analyzed. Gender differences in sociodemographic profiles of suicides reported in the newspapers and official records of all suicide deaths were compared. Any gender differences in newspaper depictions of contributing factors of suicide and situations surrounding the suicidal acts were compared. Results: Newspapers in Taiwan tended to overreport unusual methods of suicide among men and extended suicide among women. The reasons for suicide in men were more frequently portrayed as work-related or after legal problems, whereas in women suicide was more frequently framed as due to mental illness or relationship problems. The news media tended to underreport mental illness as a reason for suicide in men. Limitation: The analysis was based solely on news reporting in the four major newspapers during the year 2009. Conclusions: Media representation of suicide generally follow societal-gendered assumptions of acceptable/unacceptable behaviors. Media professionals should be more careful and responsible in reporting suicide news and avoid any gender bias in their framing of suicide stories. Sensitive rather than sensational reporting should be promoted in order not to reinforce the myths of suicides in the community.

ID MENTAL-HEALTH; RATES
AB This article reports on a sample of 147 women under age 35 living in rural areas in China who had attempted suicide and were treated in the emergency room of hospitals in four different locations. The interview instrument took 2 to 3 hours to complete and included audiotaped in-depth interviews with the patient and family members (separately); detailed evaluation of the circumstances surrounding the attempt, life events, and the fan-lily environment; and a formal psychiatric evaluation by an attending-level psychiatrist. Overwhelmingly, the method used by the attempters was poisoning with highly lethal pesticides and organic fertilizers. The women's suicidal behavior was characterized by high levels of impulsivity; little effort to seclude themselves before and after ingesting poison; and low rates of mental illness, including depression. Detailed suggestions are made about ways to implement suicide prevention strategies within the particular social and economic context of China.

AB Suicide is a serious public health issue worldwide, with multiple risk factors, such as severe mental illness, alcohol abuse, a painful loss, exposure to violence, or social isolation. Environmental factors, particularly chemical and meteorological variables, have been examined as risk factors for suicide, but less evidence is available on whether air pollution is related to suicide. In this issue of the Journal, Bakian et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2015; 181(5): 295-303) publish findings from a study that found a short-term increased risk of suicide associated with increased air pollution. This study bolsters a small body of research linking air pollution exposure to suicide risk. If the association between air pollution and suicide is confirmed, it would broaden the scope of the already large disease burden associated with air pollution.

AB There is mixed evidence of a relationship between suicide rates in the general population and urbanization, and a paucity of studies examining this relationship in the elderly. A cross-national study With curve estimation regression model analysis, was undertaken to examine the a priori hypothesis that the relationship between elderly suicide rates and urbanization would be curvilinear and follow an inverted U-shaped Curve. There was a curvilinear relationship between male suicide rates both the elderly age-bands and the percentage of the population living in urban areas, but this was not observed in females. A three-stage sequential model was developed to explain the observed relationship between suicide rates in elderly males and urbanization. The relationship between suicide rates in elderly females and urbanization.

AB Objectives and methods: The epidemiology of suicide in Austria, 1990-2000, was investigated.
   Results: In comparison with 1980-1990, an overall decrease in the incidence of suicide was found. The annual averages for male, female, and total suicide rates were 32.2, 11.0, and 21.3, respectively, representing decreases of 17.6%, 25.7%, and 19.3%. Decreases were observed in all age groups except for males aged 80-84 years, where the suicide rate was 123.5 (15.1% increase), and for males aged 85 years or over, where the rate was 148.9 (25.4% increase). Hanging is still the most frequently used suicide method in Austria, despite steady decreases during recent decades. During the 1990s, hanging was used in 47.5% of male suicides and 34.8% of female cases. Shooting is the next most common method for male suicides (23.5% of cases) and has become more frequent for both sexes.
   Conclusions: The main findings reveal that the decrease in suicide incidence in Austria is greater for females than for males, reflecting the increased suicide risk within the oldest male age groups. This population subgroup should thus be a particular target for suicide-prevention efforts in Austria. A further aim within a national strategy for suicide prevention should be to stop the increased use of shooting as a suicide method.

SO LANCET

ID RISK-FACTORS; SUICIDE; MORTALITY
AB The May 2008 earthquake in Wenchuan drew attention to the important but largely unrecognised public-health problem of injury-related mortality and morbidity in China. Injuries account for more than 10% of all deaths and more than 30% of all potentially productive years of life lost due to premature mortality in China. Traffic-related injuries (mainly among cyclists and pedestrians), suicide, drowning, and falls account for 79% of all injury deaths. Rural injury death rates are double those of urban rates and male rates are double those of female rates. Despite an 81% increase in the traffic-related mortality from 1987 to 2006-associated with rapid motorisation-the overall injury mortality decreased by 17%, largely due to a surprising (and unexplained) 57% reduction in the suicide rate. Low-cost prevention measures that are most likely to produce large reductions in injury deaths include enforcement of laws for drinking and driving and for seat belt and helmet use, restriction of access to the most potent pesticides, and teaching children to swim. China needs to improve monitoring of fatal and non-fatal injuries, promote intersectoral collaboration, build institutional capacities, and, most importantly, mobilise community support and political will for investment in prevention.

AB Suicide is a serious public health problem worldwide. The suicide rate, i.e. the number of suicides per 100,000 of population, is considered to be an important indicator of national mental health and general well-being of society. The prevalence of suicide is often underestimated due to cultural, political and economic circumstances. The number of suicides in the world was estimated to be 804,000 in 2012, according to the WHO global suicide report. The age-standardized global suicide mortality rate was 11.4 per 100,000, accounting for 1.4% of all deaths. The highest crude suicide rate was in South Korea (36.6). In developed countries, male suicides have traditionally outnumbered female suicides. In 2012, the highest male-to-female suicide rate ratios (over 5.0) were found in Eastern Europe and the lowest in China (under 1.0). The risk to die by suicide increases with age. Notably, however, females in the age group 15-29 years had the highest suicide rate of all age groups in India and Latin America. The WHO estimates that for each adult suicide there may have been more than 20 others attempting suicide. Suicide risk is much higher in individuals who previously made a suicide attempt and research shows that suicide attempt is the single most important predictor of death by suicide. In suicide prevention work, strategies can be directed to the health care services or at the general population. A great need for preventive strategies for young people has been identified by the WHO. Therefore, an evidence school-based preventive method called Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) directed towards the entire classroom was developed in the EU-funded project 'Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe'.

AB Background: The epidemiology of suicide within the elderly is unique to each cultural setting. In most countries, despite the higher rate of suicide attempts among adolescents and young people, the rate of suicide deaths in the elderly is higher than other age groups. The purpose of this study was to investigate the suicide rates among persons 65 years and above in Fars, Iran.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we investigated suicide cases (65 years and older) during 2011-2016 in Fars, Iran. The data were collected from the Mental Health and Suicide Surveillance Systems of Fars province, using filled forms that included suicide and demographic information. After eliminating duplications, suicidal rates were calculated.
   Results: Of 299 suicide attempts, 64.9% were men, and 69.6% were urban residents. The rate of suicide attempts and deaths were 21.47 and 4.52 per 100,000 population, respectively; and the case fatality rate (CFR) of suicide was 21.07% during the study period. The rate of suicide attempts and deaths in this population showed an increase during the study years.
   Conclusions: Considering the increasing trend of suicide rates in the elderly in Fars, Iran, measures should be taken to facilitate the access of this group to the mental health care system and psychological counseling.

AB Background. The relative contribution of psychosocial and clinical risk factors to suicide among Chinese populations is an important issue. In Hong Kong, this issue requires vigorous examination in light of a 50% increase in suicide rate between 1997 and 2003.
   Method. Using a case-control psychological autopsy method, 150 suicide deceased were compared with 150 living controls matched by age and gender. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the next-of-kin of the subjects. Data were collected on a wide range of potential risk and protective factors, including demographic, life event, clinical and psychological variables. The relative contribution of these factors towards suicide was examined in a multiple logistic regression model.
   Results. Six factors were found to significantly and independently contribute to suicide: unemployment, indebtedness, being single, social support, psychiatric illness, and history of past attempts.
   Conclusions. Both psychosocial and clinical factors are important in suicides in Hong Kong. They seem to have mediated suicide risk independently. In addition, socio-economic adversities seem to have played a relatively important role in the increasing, suicide rate in Hong Kong.

AB Background: The reported decline in elderly suicide rates in England may have been, in part, due to prompt and successful resuscitation of those who attempt suicide. This study examines the impact of prompt and successful resuscitation of those who attempt suicide on elderly suicide rates in England.
   Methods: Possible changes in rates of attempted suicides in elderly age-bands over a nine-year period and the correlation between rates of attempted suicide and suicide in elderly age-bands in England were examined using nationally collected data.
   Results: There was a significant increase in the rates of attempted suicide over the study period in the age-band 60-74 years, but not in the age-band 75+ years. There was a positive correlation between rates of attempted suicide and suicide in the age-band 75+ years, but not in the age-band 60-74 years.
   Conclusions: The findings of this study were unable to confirm conclusively that prompt and successful medical resuscitation of those who attempt suicide makes a contribution to the decline in elderly suicide rates and requires further study. Public health initiatives should be designed to reduce not only suicide rates but also rates of attempted suicide; otherwise they are failing in the prevention of mental illness and suicidal behavior, early identification and treatment of those with mental illness and those at risk of suicide, and systematic follow-up of those recovering and recovered from mental illness.

AB Objective: There has been no large-scale survey of schizophrenia in China involving both rural and urban areas using standardized assessment tools and diagnostic criteria. This study aimed to determine the lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia and its socio-demographic correlates in Beijing, China.
   Methods: A total of 5926 subjects were randomly selected in Beijing and interviewed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 1.0). Basic socio-demographic and clinical data were collected during the interviews.
   Results: The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia was 0.49%, and 0.44% and 0.55% for men and women, respectively. Unmarried status, lower monthly income, urban abode and positive family history were associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia; 9.7% of the subjects with lifetime schizophrenia reported a history of suicide attempts. The percentage of subjects with schizophrenia who were receiving treatment and their preference to seek treatment from mental health professionals were 58% and 29%, respectively.
   Conclusions: National surveys are urgently needed to further explore the prevalence of schizophrenia in China. The low percentage of subjects treated for schizophrenia is a serious public health issue that should be addressed in the near future. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed to understand the current inclinations toward depression and compulsion for members of four different religious groups, and to predict religious beliefs along the suicide path through analyzing the lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts for members of these religious groups. Participants in this cross-sectional study, which adopted purposive sampling, were members of Christianity, Catholicism, Buddhism, and Taoism in northern Taiwan. In the case of suicide experiences, suicides among people one knows, and tendency toward compulsion and depression, there are statistical differences between the four religions. According to the results, some people with suicidal tendency will attend religious activities; therefore, we predict that religious beliefs play an important role in suicide prevention.

ID CHARCOAL-BURNING SUICIDES; CELEBRITY SUICIDE
AB Objectives To assess changes in the intensity of suicide news reporting in Taiwan's local newspapers after the arrival of a daily tabloid-type newspaper, Apple Daily (AD), and evaluate the impact of suicide news reporting on actual suicides and possible mutual causation.
   Methods A counting process was used to estimate the intensity of daily suicide news items reported in the China Times (CT) and United Daily (UD) before and after the arrival of AD (2002-05). Poisson regression models were used to assess the impact of the intensity of suicide news reporting on the actual number of next day suicides. Granger's causation model was used to assess mutual causation between suicide news reporting and actual suicides.
   Results There was a significant increase in reporting intensity of suicide news in the UD soon after the entry of the AD into Taiwan's media market, while a delayed increase of approximately 1 year was observed in the CT. After the arrival of the AD, the reporting intensity in the UD was significantly related to the occurrence of actual suicides (p<0.05), even after controlling for social variables, whereas no significant correlation was previously observed. Mutual causation between suicide news reporting and actual suicides was also observed.
   Conclusions The presence of the AD in Taiwan has fuelled competitive reporting of suicide news among traditional newspapers. This increase in the intensity of suicide news reporting has consequently had an impact on the actual number of suicides. This provides further empirical support for improving media reporting as a key element in suicide prevention.

AB The objectives of the study were to investigate the association between the parental absence and suicide ideation and to examine the roles of emotional disorders in the aforementioned relationship. Four thousand five hundred and thirteen children from rural areas in Jiangsu Province, China, participated in the study. Among the participants, 2416 were nonleft- behind children (children living with both parents) and 1997 were left-behind children (children living with the absence of at least one parent). All participants responded to the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children, the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, and a question regarding respondents' suicide ideation. Results indicated that as compared with non-left-behind children, the left-behind children with bothparents absence were statistically more likely to show suicide ideation. Furthermore, all the three types parental absence D father absence, mother absence, and both-parents absence were significantly associated with negative emotional outcomes. Moreover, depression, social anxiety, and physical anxiety were shown to be significant mediators in the relationship of parental absence and suicide ideation of children. The stress of parental absence and its negative impact on children's mental health are discussed.

   IDEATION; CHINA; AGE
AB Around the world girls and women have higher rates of suicidal ideation and behavior but lower rates of suicide than boys and men. There is, however, significant variability in gender patterns and meanings suicidal behavior within and across cultures. For example, in the United States, suicide is most common among older "White" men. and is typically considered masculine behavior. Women who kill themselves are viewed as acting like men, and therefore deviant. By contrast, in other societies, including China, suicide is viewed as an act of the powerless, and is most frequent in young women. In these societies, men who kill themselves are considered weak and effeminate. The cultural diversity in gender patterns and interpretations of suicidal behavior challenges essentialist perspectives on gender and suicidal behavior. It also challenges the assumption, common in industrialized countries, that women are protected from suicide as long as they stay "feminine" and subsumed within the family. This cultural diversity also points to the pitfalls of theorizing about clinical phenomena as if they were culture-free, and calls for culturally grounded theory, research. and practice.

AB Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death in China, and so suicide intervention on social media is an important issue in the field of public health. Sina Weibo (Weibo) is an emerging surveillance tool that may provide online assistance for users at the risk of suicide.
   Materials and Methods: Keyword-based methods and supervised classifiers were employed to conduct this research. A control group was established to explore the differences between Weibo users with suicidal ideation (USI) and the general population.
   Results: A total of 114 USI were detected from 1 million active Weibo users. By studying the negative postings of these USI, disclosure of the reasons for their bad moods was the most common theme. The emotions of USI tend to be particularly down between 05: 00 pm and midnight. Use of the first-person pronoun by Weibo USI is significantly frequent.
   Conclusions: Our findings may help to identify individuals with suicidal ideation who are not identified by the traditional clinical approach. Consequently, detecting and helping individuals who may be at risk of committing suicide may become more efficient.

AB Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects multiple organs. Because of double damages of body and mind, SLE patients are in a potential risk of suicide. Many factors may contribute to the occurrence of suicide in SLE: socioeconomic factors, medical factors, mental health, family support and coping style. This study aims to investigate the prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation in SLE inpatients in China in order to determine whether they had risk of suicide, and if so, what factors should be paid more attention to prevent suicide in wards. A total of 285 SLE patients were interviewed with questionnaires on suicidal ideation and socio-demographic characteristics, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Family APGAR and Trait Coping Style Questionnaire (TCSQ). Disease activity was assessed with SLE Disease Activity Index. The other medical information was collected from the patients' medical records. In total, 34.4% of SLE patients had current suicidal ideation. Significant individual risk factors for current suicidal ideation in SLE patients included having religious belief, heavy self-reported financial burdens, long duration of SLE, low level of family functioning and negative coping style. And in the presence of these risk factors, being separated, divorced or widowed, having premorbid suicidal ideation and depression were independent predictors of suicidal ideation. In summary, the rate of suicidal ideation in SLE patients in China is higher than that in other countries. Factors that contribute to risk of suicidal ideation include social and cultural domains and physical and psychological health. Although the association of suicidal ideation to religions and medical factors is still to be investigated, these findings may give some references to suicide prevention efforts for SLE patients in China.

ID RISK
AB Suicide is the act of a human being intentionally causing his. or her own death. More than 1 million people commit suicide every year. It is the 13th leading cause of death worldwide, with China, India, and Japan accounting for almost half of all suicides. In less than 50 years, the rate of suicide among Sri Lankans has risen from a modest level to one of the highest in the world (118 per 100000). Suicide is a major preventable cause of premature death. It is influenced by psychosocial, cultural, and environmental risk factors. The impact of suicide can be devastating for all concerned. It is common in people who are living with chronic mental illness. Individuals with severe clinical depression and alcohol use disorders are at highest risk if untreated. On an interpersonal level, friends and families of suicide victims require social support: On a national level, governments need to recognize the causes of suicide and protect those most vulnerable. If governments commit to defining national responses to prevent suicide, significant progress can be made. On a global scale, research and health organizations can identify global trends and encourage the sharing of information in effective prevention activities. In September 2010, World Suicide Prevention Day, with a theme of "Many Faces, Many Places: Suicide Prevention across the World," encouraged public awareness worldwide to unite in commitment and action to promote understanding about suicide and removal of stigmatization.(1) There is compelling evidence that adequate prevention and awareness can reduce suicide rates.

AB Background: Method-specific suicide trends varied across countries, and studies of the trends in different countries can contribute to the understanding of the epidemiology of suicide. The purpose of this study was to examine the changes in suicide trends by sex, age and method in the years 1971 to 2005 in Taiwan.
   Methods: Mortality data files of suicide and undetermined deaths for the years 1971-2005 were obtained for analyses. Age-, sex- and method-specific suicide rates were calculated by four age groups (15-24, 25-44, 45-64 and 65 and above) and five suicide methods (solids/liquids poisoning, other gases poisoning, hanging, jumping, and others).
   Results: Both sexes experienced downward trends from 1971 to 1993, and then an upward trend since 1993. People aged 65 years and above had the highest suicide rates throughout the study periods. However, males aged 25-64 years experienced the steepest increasing trends. As to suicide methods, an annual increase, since 1991, of people jumping from heights to commit suicide, and a marked increase, since 1998, of people completing suicide by poisoning with other gases (mainly charcoal-burning) were observed.
   Conclusion: Suicide by means of charcoal-burning and jumping from heights has become a serious public health problem in Taiwan. Preventive measures to curb these increasing trends are urgently needed.

TI The waterfall pattern of suicide mortality in Inner Mongolia for
   2008-2015
SO JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS

DT Article
DE Suicide; Mortality; Inner Mongolia
ID CHINA
AB Aim: This study aims to determine the characteristics and severity of suicide mortality in Inner Mongolia between 2008 and 2015.
   Methods: The death data between 2008 and 2015 was collected from the Death Registry System,(1) and the suicide mortality were calculated. Suicide mortality for total of eight years and two periods (2008-2011 and 2012-2015) were tested by the X-2-test. Logistic regression analysis was used to test the risk of suicide between these two observation periods by gender and region. The age-specific suicide mortality was displayed through a semi-logarithmic line chart using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Then, the prohibited pesticides and proportion of organophosphorus pesticides were calculated.
   Results: The suicide mortality (7.20/10(5)) in 2008-2011 was higher than the suicide mortality (4.84/10(5)) in 2012-2015 (X-2 = 62.28, P = 0.00). Intentional self-poisoning by and exposure to pesticides(2) and intentional self-harm by hanging(3) were the two main ways of suicide, accounting for nearly 80%. The all-cause suicide mortality increased with age (r = 0.837, P = 0.005) in 2008-2011 and (r = 0.863, P = 0.003) in 2012-2015, and suicide mortality was higher in males than in females.
   Limitation The DRS did not provide the pesticides used by people who committed suicide by pesticide poisoning.
   Conclusion: Suicide mortality dropped like a waterfall in Inner Mongolia between 2008 and 2015, and the most obvious drop was pesticide suicide.The general drop in suicide mortality, especially the drop in pesticide poisoning suicide mortality, may be attributable to social policies that benefited the residents and the prohibition of selected pesticides. Favorable policies can effectively decrease suicide mortality.

AB Introduction. Broadcasting a suicide attempt on social media has become a public health concern in many countries, particularly in China. In these cases, social media users are likely to be the first to witness the suicide attempt, and their attitudes may determine their likelihood of joining rescue efforts. This paper examines Chinese social media (Weibo) users' attitudes towards suicide attempts broadcast on Weibo.
   Methods. A total of 4,969 Weibo posts were selected from a customised Weibo User Pool which consisted of 1.06 million active users. The selected posts were then independently coded by two researchers using a coding framework that assessed: (a) Themes, (b) General attitudes, (c) Stigmatising attitudes, (d) Perceived motivations, and (e) Desired responses.
   Results and Discussion. More than one third of Weibo posts were coded as "stigmatising" (35%). Among these, 22%, 16%, and 15% of posts were coded as "deceitful," " pathetic," and " stupid," respectively. Among the posts which reflected different types of perceived motivations, 57% of posts were coded as " seeking attention." Among the posts which reflected desired responses, 37% were " not saving" and 28% were " encouraging suicide." Furthermore, among the posts with negative desired responses (i.e., " not saving" and " encouraging suicide"), 57% and 17% of them were related to different types of stigmatising attitudes and perceived motivations, respectively. Specifically, 29% and 26% of posts reflecting both stigmatising attitudes and negative desired responses were coded as " deceitful" and " pathetic," respectively, while 66% of posts reflecting both perceived motivations, and negative desired responses were coded as " seeking attention." Very few posts " promoted literacy" (2%) or " provided resources" (8%). Gender differences existed inmultiple categories.
   Conclusions. This paper confirms the need for stigma reduction campaigns for Chinese social media users to improve their attitudes towards those who broadcast their suicide attempts on social media. Results of this study support the need for improved public health programs in China and may be insightful for other countries and other social media platforms.

TI Gender differences in athletic performance and their implications in

SO OMEGA-JOURNAL OF DEATH AND DYING
LA English
DT Article
ID TESTOSTERONE LEVELS
AB This article attempts to understand the unique gender ratio in Chinese suicide from a physiological perspective. While Chinese women have been performing notably better than Chinese men in international sport competitions, it is suggested that sport achievements and suicide risks are both related to masculinity and aggression. To test the hypothesis that the gender difference in Chinese sports records is smaller than that found in U.S. sports records, both Chinese and U.S. national athletic records were analyzed for field, track, and swimming events. With the hypothesis supported by the data, the findings suggest a new explanation for the high suicide rate by Chinese women and low suicide rate by Chinese men. Future research is needed on physical, psychological, and biological factors that may be associated with gender differences in Chinese suicides.

AB After the launch of governmental financial support for the development of a regional suicide prevention programme, 'Emergency Fund to Enhance Community-Based Suicide Countermeasure' in 2009, suicide mortality rates in Japan have decreased from 25.7 (in 2009) to 16.5 (in 2018) per 100,000 population. Therefore, to explore the effects of governmental financial support on suicide mortality rates in Japan, the present study determined the relationship between the trends of empirical Bayes standardised Mobile Ratio of suicide mortality ratio in all 47 Japanese prefectures (EBSMR-RR) and the execution amounts of 10 sub-divisions of 'Emergency Fund to Enhance Community-Based Suicide Countermeasure' using stepwise multiple regression analysis. The female EBSMR-RR was only significantly/inversely related to the municipal 'development of listeners and leaders', whereas male EBSMR-RR was significantly/inversely related to prefectural 'enlightenment', and 'intervention models', but significantly/directly related to prefectural 'personal consultation support'. The present findings suggest the inverse relationship between financial support and the suicide mortality rates in Japan. Furthermore, the independent factors in the reduction of suicide mortality rates between males and females provide important information for planning a scientifically evidence-based and more cost-effective regional suicide prevention programmes.

AB Suicide is a significant global health concern; identification of modifiable risk factors can guide future research and prevention efforts. A systematic literature review was undertaken to summarize whether disrupted sleep, which has garnered increased attention as a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, has continued to be associated with suicide in recent years. The search resulted in 1,806 abstracts with 188 identified for full text review. Limiting studies to 2012-2015 publications with adult participants and an interpretable relationship between sleep and suicide outcomes left 36 articles for the review. Five new articles focused on suicide decedents, eight on veteran/military populations, but relatively few were longitudinal studies (n = 4) and none assessed sleep apnea. A majority of studies used statistical methods to control for psychopathology, strengthening the overall finding that recent work lends further support for disrupted sleep as an important risk factor, and potential warning sign, for suicide.

SO JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID HOPELESSNESS; DEPRESSION; MEDIA; ADOLESCENTS
AB Background: The short-term effect of celebrity suicide on the overall suicide rate is widely known, but long-term effects remain unclear.
   Objective: To examine whether celebrity suicide is associated with suicidal ideation over a longer period.
   Design: This is a study on the effect of the suicide of a famous Hong Kong entertainment celebrity, who committed suicide on 1 April 2003, on suicide thoughts of the community. A population-based survey was conducted between December 2003 and July 2004. Respondents were asked about their suicidal ideation, psychological well-being, life events, and whether or not they had been affected by celebrity suicide.
   Setting: Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the People's Republic of China. Participants: 2016 respondents aged between 20 and 59 years.
   Results: After controlling for some known suicide risk factors, celebrity suicide was shown to be independently associated with suicidal ideation. People who had indicated to have been affected by celebrity suicide were 5.93 times (95% CI 2.56% to 13.72%, p = 0) more likely to have severe level of suicidal ideation (Adult Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire score >= 31) than people who had not been affected. Respondents having greater anxiety symptoms, less reason for living and more focus on irrational values were also found to have had their suicide ideation affected by celebrity suicide.
   Conclusions: Celebrity suicide is a risk factor for suicidal ideation over a short term as well as over a long term. Raising awareness of the possible negative effect of celebrity suicide through suicide prevention programmes in the community is needed.

AB Suicide rates of young people are increasing in many geographic areas. There is a need to recognize more precisely the role of specific mental disorders and their comparative importance for understanding suicide and its prevention. The authors reviewed the published English-language research, where psychiatric diagnoses that met diagnostic criteria were reported, to reexamine the presence and distribution of mental disorders in cases of completed suicide among young people worldwide. The number and geographical distribution of cases were limited (N = 894 cases). The majority of cases (88.6%) had a diagnosis of at least I mental disorder. Mood disorders were most frequent (42.1%), followed by substance-related disorders (40.8%) and disruptive behavior disorders (20.8%). Those strategies focusing exclusively on the prevention and treatment of depression in young people need to be reconsidered. A comprehensive suicide prevention strategy among young people should target mental disorders as a whole, not depression alone, and consider contextual factors.

DE Media; Mutual causation; Reporting intensity; Suicide
ID CELEBRITY SUICIDE; HONG-KONG; TAIWAN; RATES
AB Background: Little research has been done on the complex relationships between the effect of news reporting on suicide incidence and vice versa (i.e., mutual causation). Furthermore, few studies have examined whether the entry of a new media outlet into a market changes the media dynamics in that market.
   Methods: A recursive two-way feedback model was used to test for mutual causation between suicide reporting and suicide incidence on a daily basis. We applied the model to examine the effect of the arrival of the Apple Daily (AD) newspaper in Taiwan and whether its suicide reporting affected the suicide incidence and suicide reporting of two other newspapers, the United Daily (UD) and the China Times (CT).
   Results: The AD's entry into Taiwan led to a major shift in the relationship between suicide incidence and suicide reporting. The AD stimulated more suicide coverage by the UD and the CT the following day; conversely, the UD and the CT had no such impact on the AD. Before the entry of the AD, there was little correlation between daily suicide incidence and suicide reporting, but the suicide reporting of the UD and CT correlated significantly with daily suicide incidence after the entry of the AD.
   Limitations: Media impact was assessed by number of news items; detailed content analysis of the reporting was not conducted.
   Conclusions: The vicious business competition facing new dailies in Taiwan's media market has changed the mass media ecology. Efforts to prevent suicide by regulating the media should closely monitor not only the behavior of newcomers, but also the established news media's reaction to new competitors. (C) 2012 Elsevier By.

TI Characteristics of Chinese suicide attempters: An emergency room study
SO DEATH STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSY; RISK-FACTORS
AB Studying the characteristics of attempted suicide is helpful in knowing the background of some completed suicides and improving prevention or intervention strategies. This current study analyzed data of 74 suicide attempters and 92 accident injured patients admitted to 6 hospital emergency rooms in an area of Northeastern China and found both similarities and differences between Chinese and Western suicide attempters. The data show that more women than men attempted suicide. Perhaps because of the unavailability of firearms to Chinese civilians, pesticide was the most lethal means of suicidal behavior. The stressful life events that account for the majority of suicidal incidents were mostly familial or marital problems. Compared with accident victims, these Chinese suicide attempters were younger, poorer, more likely to believe in a religion/superstition, more likely to perceive gender inequality, and less likely to experience support from either family or community. The traditional culture downplaying the status of women coupled with a belief in the transmigration of life may play an important role in the suicide of Chinese young women.

SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English

ID HONG-KONG; CHINA; PEOPLE; HEALTH; OLDER
AB Background: The suicide rate in Bali has significantly increased in recent years. However, to date, there have been no case-control studies investigating risk factors for suicide.
   Methods: A psychological autopsy study was conducted comparing 60 suicide cases and 120 living controls matched in age, sex, and area of residence.
   Results: Multiple logistic regression analysis identified the following risk factors for suicide: at least one diagnosis of axis-I mental disorder (OR: 14.84 CI: 6.12 - 35.94); low level of religious involvement (OR: 7.24 CI: 2.28 - 22.95); and severe interpersonal problems (OR: 3.86 CI: 1.36 - 11.01). Forty-eight (80.0%) of the suicide cases were diagnosed with mental disorders; however, only 16.7% visited a primary care health professional and none received psychiatric treatment during the 1 month prior to death.
   Conclusion: Clinical, religious, and psychosocial factors were associated with suicide. These results highlight the significance of early recognition and treatment of mental disorders, religious activities, and interpersonal problem-solving strategies for suicide prevention in Bali.

TI Elderly suicide rates: cross-national comparisons and association with
   sex and elderly age-bands
SO MEDICINE SCIENCE AND THE LAW
LA English
DT Article
ID ENGLAND; TRENDS; WALES; INEQUALITY; CONTACT; CHINA
AB Suicide rates generally increase with age. Examination of cross-national variations in elderly suicide rates may allow the generation of aetiological hypotheses.
   Suicide rates for males and females in the age-bands 65-74 years and 75+ years were ascertained from the World Health Organisation website for all the listed countries. Cross-national variations were examined by segregating different countries into four quartiles of elderly suicide rates. Suicide rates between males and females and between the two age-bands were compared across different countries.
   The main findings were: (i) there is wide cross-national variation in elderly suicide rates; (ii) elderly suicide rates were the lowest in Caribbean, central American and Arabic countries, and the highest in central and eastern European, some oriental and some west European countries; (iii) suicide rates were higher in men compared to women for both the age-bands; and, (iv) suicide rates were higher in the age-band 75+ years compared to the age-band 65-74 years for males and females.
   Potential explanations for regional and crossnational variations in elderly suicide rates include cross-national differences in genetic and environmental factors, prevalence of mental illness in the elderly, life expectancy, socio-economic deprivation, social fragmentation, cultural factors, the availability of appropriate healthcare services, and public health initiatives to improve the detection and treatment of mental illness, mental health and suicide prevention.

AB This paper utilizes existing statistics on adolescent suicide to examine adolescent suicide trends and patterns in Hong Kong for the period of 1980 to 2003. Several trends and patterns are revealed from the analyses. First, there was a gradual rising trend where adolescent suicide rates in the 1990's and the early 2000's were higher than those in the 1980's. Second, suicide rates for adolescents aged 10-24 years were lower than those of other adult age groups. Third, although adolescent suicide rates in Hong Kong were lower than those reported in some English-speaking countries and Mainland China, the figures were higher than those reported in Taiwan. Fourth, suicide rates among teenagers in early adolescence were lower than those among adolescents in late adolescence. Fifth, although male adolescent suicide rates were in general higher than female adolescent suicide rates (10-24 age group), gender differences in suicide rates appeared to be moderated by age. Sixth, there was a gradual rising trend in adolescent proportional mortality rates for suicide since the 1990's. Seventh, proportional mortality rates for suicide among teenagers in early adolescence were lower than those among adolescents in late adolescence. Finally, although jumping from a height was a common method of adolescent suicide, there was a rising trend of using other methods, such as taking drugs, hanging and charcoal burning. The observed adolescent suicide phenomena are discussed in this study with reference to the socio-cultural context of Hong Kong.

AB Background: High-risk strategies would only have a modest effect on suicide prevention within a population. It is best to incorporate both high-risk and population-based strategies to prevent suicide. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of suicide prevention between high-risk and population-based strategies.
   Methods: A Markov chain illness and death model is proposed to determine suicide dynamic in a population and examine its effectiveness for reducing the number of suicides by modifying certain parameters of the model. Assuming a population with replacement, the suicide risk of the population was estimated by determining the final state of the Markov model.
   Results: The model shows that targeting the whole population for suicide prevention is more effective than reducing risk in the high-risk tail of the distribution of psychological distress (i.e. the mentally ill).
   Conclusions: The results of this model reinforce the essence of the Rose theorem that lowering the suicidal risk in the population at large may be more effective than reducing the high risk in a small population.

AB Objective Accurate information about preferred suicide methods is important for devising strategies and programmes for suicide prevention. Our knowledge of the methods used and their variation across countries and world regions is still limited. The aim of this study was to provide the first comprehensive overview of international patterns of suicide methods.
   Methods Data encoded according to the International Classification of Diseases (10th revision) were derived from the WHO mortality database. The classification was used to differentiate suicide methods. Correspondence analysis was used to identify typical patterns of suicide methods in different countries by providing a summary of cross-tabulated data.
   Findings Poisoning by pesticide was common in many Asian countries and in Latin America; poisoning by drugs was common in both Nordic countries and the United Kingdom. Hanging was the preferred method of suicide in eastern Europe, as was firearm suicide in the United States and jumping from a high place in cities and urban societies such as Hong Kong Special, Administrative Region, China. Correspondence analysis demonstrated a polarization between pesticide suicide and firearm suicide at the expense of traditional methods, such as hanging and jumping from a high place, which lay in between.
   Conclusion This analysis showed that pesticide suicide and firearm suicide replaced traditional methods in many countries. The observed suicide pattern depended upon the availability of the methods used, in particular the availability of technical means. The present evidence indicates that restricting access to the means of suicide is more urgent and more technically feasible than ever.

AB Purpose
   This study examined trends in the suicide rates of persons with foreign background in Japan.
   Methods
   Using the nationwide death records in the Vital Statistics of Japan, we first reported the age-adjusted suicide rates of 8 foreign nationals (Brazil, China, Korea, Peru, the Philippines, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States) in Japan by sex from 1980 to the mid-2010s. We also computed rate ratios to compare the suicide rate of each group with those of the Japanese population. Second, we focused on Koreans, who had the highest suicide rate in Japan. We compared the suicide rates of Koreans in Japan with Koreans in South Korea to examine whether their suicide rates were more closely related to those of their country of origin or those of their host country.
   Results
   We found that the suicide rates of Koreans and Chinese in Japan were similar to or higher than those of Japanese, while other groups tended to show lower suicide rates. Most notably, Koreans displayed consistently high suicide rates from 1980 to the mid-2010s, which were nearly twice as high as those of the Japanese population. Korean males and females in Japan had higher suicide rates than those in South Korea.
   Conclusions
   Immigrants in Japan were not necessarily influenced by the suicide rates of the host country. The high suicide rates among Korean residents in Japan might be explained by various disadvantages and adversities that they face in Japan.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the role of different aspects of psychological strain in Chinese rural young suicides, so as to test the strain theory of suicide with the Chinese samples. A Psychological Autopsy (PA) was conducted on 105 suicides in rural China. The background and deep reasons for suicide were obtained from in-depth interviews with survivors and close friends. For each suicide, a story is composed out of the provided information, and the stories were content-analyzed with the SPSS Text Analysis for Surveys. Depression or other mental disorders were observed for less than half of the sampled suicides (42.9%). All suicides (100%) had experienced at least one type of the four strains: conflicting values; aspiration and reality; relative deprivation; and coping deficiency. While 24.9% of all suicides experienced only one type of strain, 36.2 experienced two types of strains, 32.4% experienced three types of strains, and only 6.7% of the suicides experienced all four types of strains. Males are more likely than females to experience aspiration and deprivation strains, and the younger suicides (15-22 years of age) were more likely than the older suicides (23-29 years of age) to experience coping strain. Psychological strains are more prevalent than mental disorders among Chinese rural young suicides. Mental illness might be a function of strain resulting from some negative life events, and future studies need to disentangle the relationship between strain and mental disorders.

TI Psychological Tensions Found in Suicide Notes: A Test for the Strain
   Theory of Suicide
SO ARCHIVES OF SUICIDE RESEARCH

DE China; Strain theory; suicide notes
ID CRIME
AB As a comprehensive and parsimonious theory explaining the socio-psychological mechanism prior to suicidal behavior, strain theory of suicide postulates that conflicting and competing pressures in an individual's life usually precede a suicide. The theory proposes four sources of strain leading to suicide: ( 1) value strain from conflicting values, ( 2) aspiration strain from the discrepancy between aspiration and reality, ( 3) deprivation strain from relative deprivation such as poverty, and ( 4) coping strain from deficient coping skills in the face of a crisis. This research has content-analyzed 40 suicide notes ( 20 by suicide completers and 20 by suicide attempters) and found strong support for the strain theory of suicide. Although little difference is found in the number and pattern of strains between the completers and attempters, both groups have many aspirations and coping strains and few value and deprivation strains. Also, the older a suicidal victim is, the more he/she feels deprived and lacks coping skills and feels less bothered with value conflicts. Although the study has offered some support for the new theory, future research with more rigorous quantitative data needs to be conducted to further test the theory on a more comprehensive level.

AB Objective: This study expanded knowledge about the development of suicide ideation and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) among adolescents by investigating (a) peer experiences as predictors of trajectories of suicide ideation and NSSI, (b) the joint development of suicide ideation and NSSI, and (c) the risk for suicide attempts (SA) across joint trajectories of suicide ideation and NSSI. Method: At baseline, 565 tenth-grade Chinese adolescents (48.3% males) reported depressive symptoms and friend support. Moreover, peer victimization and friendships were assessed using a sociometric procedure. After baseline, participants completed measures of suicide ideation, NSSI, and SA every 3 months for 2 years. Results: Three similar trajectories of suicide ideation and NSSI were identified. After accounting for depressive symptoms, peer victimization differentiated adolescents in the high trajectory of suicide ideation and NSSI from those in the low and moderate trajectories of suicide ideation and NSSI, respectively. Friend support and friendlessness distinguished between the high and low and the moderate and low NSSI trajectories, respectively. Joint trajectory models revealed a strong overlap between the course of suicide ideation and NSSI: Adolescents in the chronically high suicide ideation trajectory were at the highest risk to follow a chronically high NSSI trajectory and vice versa. Finally, adolescents in the joint chronically high trajectory were approximately 5 times more likely to report SA than were their peers, above and beyond prior SA. Conclusions: Findings highlight the role of negative peer experiences as risk factors for NSSI and suicide ideation, which, in turn, can potentially increase risk for SA.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence and predictors of suicide ideation among primary, middle and high school students. We used multilevel modelling to investigate suicide ideation among 12,733 Chinese children and adolescents aged 9-18years from wide range of areas across China. Approximately, 32.09% of children and adolescents reported suicide ideation, with females were more likely to report suicide ideation than males (38.09% vs. 29.95%). Our results showed that the risk factors in primary school students were different from middle and high school student groups, whereas significant risk factors for middle and high school students were similar. The city's standard of living as indicated by the Engel coefficient and the city's divorce rate were positively associated with the prevalence of suicide ideation; in contrast, the school's pupil-to-teacher ratio was negatively correlated with elevated suicide ideation. Significant risk factors for suicide ideation included study anxiety, self-accusation tendency, impulsive tendency, terror tendency and physical symptoms. These results have important implications for the prevention of suicide, suggesting that both contextual (city-level) and compositional (individual-level) factors could be important targets for prevention and intervention for children and adolescents at risk of suicide ideation.

AB Major depressive disorder (MDD) is defined as a state of depressed mood, loss of volition and interest, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, sleep problems, poor appetite, loss of energy, and poor concentration, which causes disability in personal and social activities. Lifetime prevalence of MDD is 6.7% (4.8% in men and 9.1% in women), and has increased by 0.2% annually for the last decade. The risk factors for suicide are MDD, severity of the MDD episode, psychotic symptoms, first episode, and being male. The suicide rate was 31.2 per 100,000 persons in the 2010 report on Death and Causes of Death in Korea, which is the seventh highest incidence in men and first in women among 105 nations from the WHO report. The lifetime rate of suicide attempts in Korea is 3.2% according to the Epidemiological Survey of Mental Disorders in Korea 2011, which is higher than the rate of China, Japan, and Western countries. It is estimated that 1,200,000 persons in Korea have attempted suicide at some point within their lifetime. Seasonal variations in suicide indicate the association between suicide and MDD. Both rates of suicide and suicide attempts are the highest in May, when a total of 52.8% of those attempting suicide were diagnosed with MDD. Forty percent of recent suicide attempts are associated with MDD, and 73.7% with MDD or alcohol use disorder in the general population. In conclusion, suicide and suicide attempts are closely associated with MDD. Suicide is a medical condition that is treatable and preventable, and suicide rates can be reduced through early diagnosis and treatment for MDD and alcohol use disorder in Korea.

AB Background: It is still unknown whether many well-identified risk factors of suicide could be applied to the elderly Chinese patients with schizophrenia.
   Methods: 1-month suicidal ideation and lifetime suicide attempts together with their sociodemographic and clinical associates were analyzed by retrospective data on 263 elderly patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders at the Kangning Hospital, Shenzhen, China. T-tests and Chi-square tests were used to examine the differences between patients with and without suicidality. Backward stepwise logistic regression was performed to identify the associated factors.
   Results: Among the selected patients, 17.87% had 1-month suicide ideation and 7.60% had lifetime suicide attempts. It was further observed that the elderly patients with schizophrenia who had 1-month suicide ideation were more likely to report lifetime suicide attempts, suffer from severe hopelessness and negative symptoms, and have no pension. However, the backward stepwise logistic regression analyses revealed that lifetime suicide attempts and negative symptoms were most significantly associated with 1-month suicide ideation. In contrast, lifetime suicide attempters were more likely to be men, receive a pension, display symptoms of hopelessness, have longer duration of illness and poor family relationships. The regression analyses also indicated that only hopelessness, relatively long duration of schizophrenia, and poor family relationships were the most significantly associated with lifetime suicide attempts.
   Limitations: The retrospective design do not allow for causal inferences.
   Conclusions: Early interventions designed to decrease hopelessness, control negative symptoms, and improve family relationships may result in reduced risks of suicide among elderly Chinese patients with schizophrenia.

AB Background: Suicidal behaviors are common in major depressive disorder (MDD) and contribute significantly to premature death. The objective of this meta-analysis is to estimate the pooled prevalence of suicidal behaviors in patients with MDD in China.
   Methods: The relevant databases in English (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library) and Chinese (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang and Chinese Biological Medical Literature) were systematically and independently searched from their inceptions until January 23, 2017. Original studies that reported the prevalence of suicidal behaviors including suicidal ideation (SI), suicide plan (SP), suicide attempt (SA) and completed suicide (CS) were included.
   Results: Thirty three articles that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. The pooled lifetime prevalence of SI, SP and SA were 53.1% (95% CI: 42.4-63.4%), 17.5% (95% CI: 5.8-42.3%) and 23.7% (95% CI: 19.9-28.0%), respectively. One-month prevalence of SI and SA were 27.7% (95% CI: 15.4-44.5%) and 20.3% (95% CI: 12.1-32.2%), respectively. The pooled prevalence of SA during hospitalization and after onset of MDD were 17.3% (95% CI: 12.4-23.7%) and 42.1% (95% CI: 26.1-60.0%), respectively. Subgroup analyses revealed significant differences in both lifetime prevalence of SI and SA between genders, and between outpatients and inpatients with MDD.
   Conclusion: Suicidal behaviors are common in MDD patients in China. Regular screening and effective intervention for suicidal behavior in MDD patients are warranted.

AB Ingestion of pesticides is the most common suicide method worldwide, accounting for one third of all suicides, predominantly in Asia, Africa, Central and South America. Case fatalities are high, particularly in rural areas. This high case fatality may explain the similar numbers of male and female suicides in Asia, since more women die from their attempts. In Asia, pesticide suicides are mostly impulsive acts with little advance planning and they are less often associated with mental illness than in Western countries. Pesticides are generally chosen for their easy access. Prevention strategies include treating the problems leading to suicidal behaviors involving pesticides; changing attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs about pesticides; controlling access to dangerous pesticides, including developing secure storage practices (which are currently being evaluated); and improving the medical treatment of poisonings. More research is needed to better understand suicides involving pesticides in their cultural contexts and to evaluate the effectiveness of intervention programs, including assessment of possible substitution of methods. Also, more knowledge about protective factors may help suggest innovative prevention strategies.

TI Suicide prevention through means restriction: Impact of the 2008-2011
   pesticide restrictions on suicide in Sri Lanka
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article

AB Objective
   To investigate the effect of 3-year phased bans of the pesticides dimethoate and fenthion in 2008-2010, and paraquat in 2009-2011, on suicide mortality in Sri Lanka.
   Methods
   Age-standardised overall, sex-specific, and method-specific suicide rates were calculated using Sri Lankan police data (1989-2015). Using negative binomial regression models, we estimated the change in the rate and number of suicide deaths in post-ban years (2011-15) compared to those expected based on pre-ban trends (2001-10).
   Findings
   Overall suicide mortality dropped by 21% between 2011 and 2015, from 18.3 to 14.3 per 100,000. The decline in pesticide suicides during this same period was larger than for overall suicides: from 8.5 to 4.2 per 100,000, a 50% reduction. This was accompanied by a smaller concurrent rise in non-pesticide suicide mortality with a 2% increase (9.9 to 10.1 per 100,000). In 2015, the ratio between the observed and expected pesticide suicide rates was 0.49 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40, 0.62), corresponding to an estimated 937 (95% CI 574, 1389) fewer pesticide suicides than expected from pre-ban suicide rates. Findings were similar in sensitivity analyses using 2008 or 2012 as commencement of the post intervention period.
   Conclusion
   Bans of paraquat, dimethoate and fenthion in Sri Lanka were associated with a reduction in pesticide suicide mortality and in overall suicide mortality despite a small rise in other methods. This study provides further evidence for the effectiveness of pesticide regulation in limiting the availability of highly hazardous pesticides and thereby reducing the number of global suicides.

AB Background: Epidemiologic studies show that low fish intake is a risk factor of suicidality; however. there are no case-control studies investigating suicide attempt risk and tissue n-3 fatty acid levels.
   Methods: We recruited 100 suicide-attempt cases and another 100 control patients injured by accidents who were admitted to three hospitals affiliated with Dalian Medical University in Dalian, China. Case and control subjects were matched for age, gender and smoking status. Those who were inebriated at the time of hospitalization were excluded. Blood was sampled immediately, after admission to a hospital. Washed red blood cells (RBCs) were obtained. and the fatty acid composition of the total RBC phospholipid fraction was analyzed by gas chromatography.
   Results: Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) levels in RBC in the case subjects were significantly lower than those of the control subjects (.74 +/- .52% vs. 1.06 +/- .62%, p < .0001). When the highest and lowest quartiles of EPA in RBC were compared, the odds ratios of suicide attempt was .12 in the highest quartile (95016 confidence interval: .04-36, p for trend = .0001) after adjustment for possible confounding factors
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that low n-3 fatty acid levels in tissues were a risk factor of suicide attempt. Further studies including intervention with fish oil are warranted.

AB Objective To determine whether brief intervention and contact is effective in reducing subsequent suicide mortality among suicide attempters in low and middle-income countries.
   Methods Suicide attempters (n = 1867) identified by medical staff in the emergency units of eight collaborating hospitals in five culturally different sites (Campinas, Brazil; Chennai, India; Colombo, Sri Lanka; Karaj, Islamic Republic of Iran; and Yuncheng, China) participated, from January 2002 to October 2005, in a randomized controlled trial to receive either treatment as usual, or treatment as usual plus brief intervention and contact (BIC), which included patient education and follow-up. Overall, 91 % completed the study. The primary study outcome measurement was death from suicide at 18-month follow-up.
   Findings Significantly fewer deaths from suicide occurred in the BIC than in the treatment-as-usual group (0.2% versus 2.2%, respectively; chi(2) = 13.83, P<0.001).
   Conclusion This low-cost brief intervention may be an important part of suicide prevention programmes for underresourced low-and middle-income countries.

Synthesizing the strain theory of suicide and self-determination theory, this research tested a multiple mediator model linking psychological strain with suicidal ideation via three basic psychological need satisfaction. Data from 750 professional employees in China support for the partially mediated effects of psychological strain via need satisfaction of competence and relatedness. These findings contribute to understanding Chinese employees' suicidal ideation from positive psychology perspective that is distinct from what is known from psychopathology.

AB Since Durkheim's classic work on suicide, sociologists have sought to shed light on the linkage between social context and individual susceptibility to suicidal thoughts and attempts. Though suicide is a worldwide phenomenon, however, the existing scholarship primarily focuses on adult populations in Western countries. Moreover, despite the fact that suicide inducing and suicide-inhibiting factors operate at both individual and collective levels, many studies do not rely on multilevel analysis. This study contributes to the literature by investigating the relationship between parent-child relations and friendship size, and suicidality among a random sample of urban Chinese youths. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) shows that when it comes to thinking about committing suicide, parent-mediated integration, and regulation are significantly associated with lower odds at individual (student) and collective (classroom) levels. Friendship ties, however, have no effect. Concerning suicide planning, parental involvement and peer network are both related to lower probability at the individual level, while at the collective level, only the parent involvement matters.

AB Suicide is a global public health problem, but very few theories have been developed for its etiology and effective prevention. Presented in this article is a comprehensive and parsimonious theory explaining the socio-psychological mechanism prior to suicidal behavior. Strain, resulting from conflicting and competing pressures in an individual's life, is hypothesized to precede suicide. The strain theory of suicide (STS) proposes four sources of strain leading to suicide: (1) value strain from differential values; (2) aspiration strain from the discrepancy between aspiration and reality; (3) deprivation strain from the relative deprivation, including poverty; and (4) coping strain from deficient coping skills in the face of a crisis. This new model is built on previous notions of anomie (Durkheim, 1897/1951), strain theories of deviance (Merton, 1957) and crime (Agnew, 1992), although suicide is not a major target for explanation in those theories. Future research with rigorous quantitative data needs to be conducted to further test STS on a more comprehensive level.

AB The lifetime risk of suicide in patients with schizophrenia is estimated to be 4.9-13%. While there are many known risk factors for suicide in schizophrenia, the relationship between cognitive function and suicide risk is unclear, particularly in non-Caucasian populations. In our cross-sectional study, we administered the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) to 316 Han Chinese chronic inpatients with schizophrenia and compared the performance of those who had attempted suicide (n=25) to non-attempters (n=291). The lifetime suicide attempt data were collected from medical records and interviews with patients and their family members. We found a lifetime suicide attempt rate of 7.9%. Suicide attempters were more likely to be single, but showed no significant differences in other demographic factors such as age, gender, or living arrangements. Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no significant relationship between performance on the RBANS test and lifetime risk of suicide attempts in Han Chinese inpatients with schizophrenia. The literature remains mixed on this topic. Culturally influenced differences in suicidal behavior may have affected the outcome of this study and further investigation of this topic is necessary.

AB The present study explored the validity of Joiner's interpersonal theory of suicide in a sample of 439 Chinese university students 17 to 24 years of age. The results indicated that the three elements of the theory (thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and acquired capability for self-harm) were associated with current suicidal ideation in the total sample of students. For men, only thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness predicted suicidal ideation, whereas all three elements of the theory predicted suicidal ideation for women. Multiple regression analyses, controlling for other variables, supported the role of burdensomeness and acquired capability for suicide, but not thwarted belongingness.

AB This study examined the association between non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicide attempts among Chinese adolescents and college students.
   Methods: A total sample of 2013 Chinese students were randomly selected from five schools in Wuhan, China, including 1101 boys and 912 girls with the age ranging between 10 and 24 years. NSSI, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and depressive symptoms were measured by self-rated questionnaires. Self-reported suicide attempts were regressed on suicidal ideation and NSSI, controlling for participants' depressive symptoms, and demographic characteristics.
   Results: The self-reported prevalence rates of NSSI, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts were 15.5%, 8.8%, and 3.5%, respectively. Logistic regression analyses indicated that NSSI was significantly associated with self-reported suicide attempts. Analyses examining the conditional association of NSSI and suicidal ideation with self-reported suicide attempts revealed that NSSI was significantly associated with greater risk of suicide attempts in those not reporting suicidal ideation than those reporting suicidal ideation in the past year.
   Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of NSSI as a potentially independent risk factor for suicide attempts among Chinese/Han adolescents and college students.

AB Background: The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) has been widely used for late-life depression, but it lacks validation in psychological autopsy research. This study aimed to assess the validity and establish the optimal cut-off values of the GDS-30 and the GDS-15 with proxy-based data in rural China.
   Methods: We applied psychological autopsy to collect data from 242 consecutive suicide cases and 242 paired living community controls.
   Results: Subject-proxy concordance for the GDS-30 (ICC = 0.590) and the GDS-15 (ICC = 0.539) were fair in the living controls. Based on proxy-data, we found that the suicide cases had higher scores of depression than the living controls did; the values of Cronbach's alpha demonstrated good internal consistency of the GDS-30 and the GDS-15; the Spearman correlation analysis indicated that the GDS scores were correlated with hopelessness, loneliness, and quality of life. For suicide cases, the GDS-30 showed the highest Youden's index as 34.86% with a cut-off value at 22, when its sensitivity and specificity was 0.78 and 0.56, respectively; the score of 12 on the GDS-15 showed the highest Youden's index of 31.39%, and its sensitivity and specificity was 0.74 and 0.58, respectively.
   Limitations: This study is limited to its generalizability to Chinese urban elderly with psychological autopsy method.
   Conclusions: The GDS-30 and the GDS-15 were both valid tools for measuring the severity of depressive symptoms rather than screening for major depression in psychological autopsy research in rural China. The GDS-15 can be considered as a good substitute for the GDS-30.

AB The tendency to express emotional distress in physical rather than mental terms is much stronger in China than in most Western cultures. This may help to explain why mental disorders are diagnosed less frequently in China and could have implications for understanding the alarmingly high suicide rate. Many epidemiologists have reported low rates of depression and other mood disorders in China, however the reason for this may be that the modes of detection are based on Westerners experience of mental illness rather than how they may manifest in Eastern culture.

AB Objective This study analyzed patterns of suicide and suicide attempts by poisoning as reported through a national poison control system for the purpose of improving intervention and prevention. Methods During the period of 2000 to 2006, 6440 cases of poisoning suicide were reported to the telephone consultation service system of The National Center for Poisoning Control (Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention). Among these records, 4728 cases had completed data for this analysis in terms of age, sex, trend of time and location, and type of poisons. Results There were 60.6% female cases with the age from 10 to 90 years old. The age of cases from 20 to 39 years accounted for 54.5% of all age groups. Both the numbers and percentage in record related to poisoning consultation of oral poisoning suicide showed an increasing tendency during the 7 years. In particular, there was a drastic increase from 2004 to 2006. In addition, the high frequency of cases occurred from May to October. Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui Provinces had the highest number of cases. Pesticide poisonings were the most common method in these cases of consultation for suicide and suicide attempts. Conclusion This study describes epidemiological characteristics in the oral poisoning suicide cases and provides scientific basis for suicide prevention interventions.

AB The affective effect of suicide on people around is assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and some correlates are examined to identify characteristics of the bereaved individuals who score high on depression. We used the informants of 66 suicides as subjects for study and the informants of 66 living people as the control group. For each suicide and living person, we interviewed two informants: one family member and one friend. Data collection was accomplished in China in the summer of 2003. Results indicate that the bereaved people (informants of the suicides) are more likely to experience depression than those people in the control group. The closer the relationship to the suicide, the higher the degree of depression. While the survivor's education and income are negatively correlated with his or her depression level, neither age nor gender is a predictor of depression in the sample. Given the strong relationship between suicide and depression, the bereaved survivors of suicide could be a high risk group of suicide. Further and larger study is warranted to investigate more details of the high risk group so as to recommend prevention measures.

AB Background: In studies about the risk factors for suicidal behavior, the assessment of impulsiveness and aggression often depend on information from proxy informants. Aims: To assess the validity of proxy informants' reports on impulsiveness and aggression in China. Methods: Modified Chinese versions of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-CV) and the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AQ-CV) were administered to 131 suicide attempters treated at a hospital in rural China, to coresident relatives about the attempters, to 131 matched community controls, and to coresident relatives about the controls. Results: BIS-CV and AQ-CV total scores and subscale scores were all significantly higher for suicide attempters than for matched controls. Proxy informants considered subjects slightly more impulsive and aggressive than the subjects reported themselves. Subject-proxy concordance for total BIS-CV and AQ-CV scores were excellent for both attempters and controls ( ICCs = 0.76-0.83). Concordance for the three BIS-CV subscales was 0.74-0.81 for attempters and 0.74-0.83 for controls. Concordance for the five AQ-CV subscales was 0.66-0.85 for attempters and 0.56-0.82 for controls. Limitations: Results are based on respondents from a single location in rural China. Conclusions: The results support the validity of the BIS-CV and AQ-CV and of research on suicidal behavior in China that uses proxy-based reports of impulsiveness and aggression.

AB Background: To describe the level and risk factors for suicidal behaviors in Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM).
   Methods: A total of 807 MSM were recruited using a respondent-driven sampling method from Anshan, Benxi, Dandong, and Shenyang cities in northeastern China.
   Results: Chinese MSM had lifetime prevalences of suicide ideation (18.3 %), plan (8.7 %) and attempt (4.6 %) that were about 2.8, 5.8 and 5.8 times greater than that of male adults in the general population of China. The MSM with any psychiatric disorders were 4-7 times more likely to think about, plan or attempt suicide than those MSM with no disorder, and there was a clear relationship between the number of comorbid disorders and suicidal behaviors. Multiple regression analysis showed that major depression, bipolar disorder, dysthymia and alcohol use disorder significantly increased the risk for suicide ideation, but not for suicide attempt. Drug dependence disorder, panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder significantly increased the risk for suicide attempt, but not for suicide ideation. More advanced education reduced the risk of suicidal behaviors, sexual orientations revealed to or discovered by family members or friends significantly increased risk of these suicidal behaviors.
   Conclusions: Chinese MSM have significantly increased risk for suicidal behaviors, mental disorders and their comorbidities could be the largest risk factors for the elevated suicidal behaviors in Chinese MSM. Reducing the family and social stigma and rejection of homosexual behavior and early detection and effective treatment of psychiatric disorders and their comorbidities in MSM may help to decrease suicidal behaviors of Chinese MSM.

AB Objectives: 1) To compare the 2-year completed suicide and reattempt rates in a preintervention group of Hong Kong Chinese suicide attempters (aged 65 years and older) who received standard care and a postintervention group enrolled in a regional elderly suicide prevention program (ESPP) that adopts a two-tiered multifaceted care management model and 2) to examine the trend of suicide rates in older adults aged 65 years and older in the pre- and postintervention periods. Design: The first part is an observational cohort study with baseline, follow-up, and outcome data being identified from a clinical electronic registry. The second part examines changes in suicide rates from official mortality statistics. Setting: A government-funded suicide intervention program serving catchment population (852,796 people aged 65 years and older) in Hong Kong, China. Participants: Suicide attempters (aged 65 years and older) presenting to old-age psychiatric service in the pre- and postintervention phases. Measurements: 1) Two-year rates of completed suicide and suicide reattempt and 2) changes in population suicide rates in the pre- and postintervention periods. Results: The 2-year completed suicide rate was 7.58% in the preintervention group (N = 66) and 1.99% in the ESPP group (N = 351) chi(2) = 6.192; p value: 0.028; df = 1). Reattempt rates were not different. At a population level, suicide rate dropped significantly only in women aged 85 years and older, relative to the preintervention period. Conclusions: The ESPP was associated with a reduced rate of completed suicide in old-age suicide attempters and might have contributed to a fall of suicide rate in women aged 85 years and older.

AB Background: Suicidal behaviors are strong predictors of suicide death and are much more common than completed suicides. This study aimed to describe the prevalence and transitions of suicidal behaviors in an Inner Mongolian City of China and to explore the association of comorbidity of mood and anxiety disorders with suicidal behaviors.
   Method: This study was a cross-sectional study. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview-3.0 (CIDI-3.0) was administered face-to-face to make diagnoses of mental disorders, measure suicidal behaviors and collect social demographic information.
   Results: A total of 4528 respondents were interviewed. The lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, suicide plan and suicide attempt were 1.52%, 0.70% and 0.54%, respectively. Among those respondents with suicidal ideation, 21.1% of them had planned suicide attempt, and 6.6% had unplanned suicide attempt. When comorbidity was not considered in the model, mood and anxiety disorders were the most important drivers of suicidal behaviors. However, when including the comorbidity, those respondents with mood and anxiety disorders, rather than those with a specific disorder only, had a significant positive association with suicidal behaviors. In the model, being unemployed, rural, female, no income and childhood adversities were also related to suicidal behaviors.
   Limitations: There might be systematic recall bias as the data were based on retrospective self-reports. Suicide is a sensitive question, so the respondents were probably ashamed to talk about suicidal behaviors.
   Conclusions: The comorbidity of mood and anxiety disorders was the most important risk factor of suicidal behaviors. Special attention should be paid to those patients with this comorbidity.

AB The high prevalence of suicide in schizophrenia may be related to its demographic and clinical characteristics. Because suicide prevalence and its associations with clinical variables are less well characterized in Chinese than European patients with schizophrenia, we assessed the suicide attempts in 520 Chinese inpatients with schizophrenia. The suicide attempt data were collected from medical case notes and interviews with the patients and their family members. Patients were rated on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Simpson and Angus Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (SAES), and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). Smoking severity was evaluated using clinician-administered questionnaires and the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). We found a suicide attempt rate of 9.2% in these schizophrenic inpatients. The attempters were single, had a significantly younger age but more hospitalizations, had higher depressive symptoms, and began smoking at an earlier age, smoked more cigarettes each day and had higher FTND total scores than patients without suicide attempts. The logistic regression analysis also indicated that suicide attempts were associated with the number of hospitalizations, depressive symptoms and FTND total scores. These results suggest that Chinese inpatients with schizophrenia attempt suicide more often than the general population. Further, some demographic and clinical variables are risk factors for suicide attempts in schizophrenia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although mental illness is a major suicide risk factor, some cases of suicide list no symptoms of mental disorder at the time of death. Studying suicides without psychiatric illness has important implications for social work because this group's service needs seem to have been overlooked. The authors of this article conducted a psychological autopsy study of 150 people who committed suicide and 150 age- and gender-matched living controls. Suicides without psychiatric illness showed similar detectable psychopathology as the suicide and living control groups with nonpsychotic psychiatric disorders. Though suicides without psychiatric disorders showed fewer warning signs that could be noticed by their informants, they experienced more negative life events than living controls. The suicide cases without psychiatric illness also seemed to be less protected by enabling factors (such as social support and employment) than living controls with and without psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, they had lower use of services than the control and deceased-with-diagnosis groups. With fewer at-risk signs and poorer enabling resources, they were undetected or unengaged by the existing physical, psychiatric, and psychosocial services. This group should be of concern to social workers, who may develop community-based health education programs and preventive services to meet this vulnerable population's psychosocial needs.

AB Purpose: Despite increasing rates of suicide among youth in Asian cultures, there is a lack of suicide data among 15-24 year-olds, and little is known about the risk and protective factors for suicidality. This study examines the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts among 15-24 year-olds and identifies the sociodemographic correlates of suicidality in Hanoi, Shanghai, and Taipei.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 17,016 youth aged 15-24 years was conducted in rural and urban areas of Hanoi, Vietnam; Shanghai, China; and Taipei, Taiwan in 2006. Logistic regression was used to analyze correlates of suicidal ideation and attempt across cities.
   Results: The 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempt was 8.4% and 2.5% across all three cities, respectively. Suicidal ideation was highest in Taipei (17.0%), Shanghai (8.1%), and lowest in Hanoi (2.3%); similar trends were found for suicidal attempts. Younger age cohorts (15-19 year-olds) and females were more likely to report suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts compared with 20-24 year-olds and males. In multivariate logistic regression results, across the three cities, female gender, younger age, family structure, parental support, family history of suicide, migration status, and substance use were associated with suicidal ideation. Factors associated with suicidal attempt included female gender, family history of suicide, parental support, and substance use.
   Discussion: Suicidality is common among Asian youth, with highest levels reported in more industrialized cities. (C) 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The incidence of bullying is high among adolescents. Adolescents who were victims of bullying have a higher risk of self-harm and suicidal behavior than adolescents who were non-victims. However, research on suicide and both traditional and cyber bullying was limited in China. Therefore, this study examined the associations between Chinese adolescents who were the victims of traditional and cyber bullying and the prevalence of suicidal ideation, self-harm and suicide attempts.
   Methods: This was a population-based study of 2647 students (51.2% girls) with a mean age of 13.6 +/- 1.1 years from 10 junior high schools in Shantou, China. Information on bullying victimization, suicidal ideation, self-harm and suicide attempts were collected using a self-administered questionnaire and the psychopathology of the students was assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). The associations were examined with multinomial logistic regression, adjusted for covariates.
   Results: Traditional bullying victimization was reported by 16.7% of the adolescents, cyber bullying victimization by 9.0% and both by 3.5%. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 23.5%, self-harm was 6.2% and suicide attempts was 4.2%. Psychopathology symptoms were risk factors for suicide ideation only, ideation plus self-harm, self-harm only and suicide attempts. Victims of both traditional and cyber bullying had the highest risk of suicidal ideation only, ideation plus self-harm and suicide attempts, compared to those reporting one form of bullying. Victims of cyber bullying only had the second highest risk of suicidal ideation only and suicidal ideation plus self-harm compared to non-victims.
   Conclusions: Adolescents who were victims of both traditional and cyber bullying had greater risks of adverse outcomes of suicidal ideation only, suicidal ideation plus self-harm and suicide attempts. The results of the current study suggest that those exposed to both forms of bullying should be routinely screened for suicidal risk. In addition, school-based anti-bully interventions should also target cyber bullying.

AB Background:
   While numerous past reviews of psychological autopsy (PA) studies have examined the relationship between mental disorder and suicide, there has been little systematic investigation of suicide occurring in the absence of any identifiable psychiatric condition.
   Aim:
   This article reviews available literature on the topic by considering Axis I, sub-threshold, mild disorders and personality disorders.
   Method:
   We conducted a systematic review of PA studies from 2000 onwards. Studies included in the review had to clearly describe the proportion of suicide cases without a classifiable mental disorder or sub-threshold condition.
   Results:
   Up to 66.7% of suicide cases remained without diagnosis in those studies that only examined Axis I disorders (n = 14). Approximately 37.1% of suicide cases had no psychiatric condition in research papers that assessed personality and Axis I disorders (n = 9), and 37% of suicides had no Axis I, sub-threshold/mild conditions (n = 6). In general, areas in China and India had a higher proportion of suicides without a diagnosis than studies based in Europe, North America or Canada.
   Conclusion:
   Variation in the proportion of suicide cases without a psychiatric condition may reflect cultural specificities in the conceptualization and diagnosis of mental disorder, as well as methodological and design-related differences between studies.

AB Adolescent suicide has become a serious public health problem in China. Since suicide attempts are considered the strongest predictor of suicide completion, it is valuable to identify adolescents with a high suicide attempt risk. This study aimed to develop a decision tree model for the interactive prediction of high suicide attempt risk in Chinese adolescents. A classification tree analysis was conducted in a sample of senior high school students (N = 6,686) based on the CRUISE program. The results indicated that depression, anxiety, social support, gender, self-esteem, family cohesion and adaptability were significant predictors of high suicide attempt risk, and interactions among these predictors constructed a hierarchical decision tree model. The tree model offered a series of reliable rules to identify Chinese adolescents with high suicide attempt risk, for example, adolescents with high depression scores had the highest probability (69.22%) of having a suicide attempt, female adolescents with low social support and low depression scores had the second highest probability (57.58%), and adolescents with low anxiety, low family adaptability, and medium depression scores had the third highest probability (55.77%). These exploratory findings suggested that different screening criteria are needed to detect at-risk Chinese adolescents with different severities of depression.

TI Newspaper reporting of suicides in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Guangzhou:

SO JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH

AB Background Media guidelines for suicide reporting are available in many countries. However, to what extent the mass media comply with the guidelines is unknown. Few studies are available that investigate systematically whether the mass media reflect the epidemiological reality of suicide deaths in their articles.
   Methods Based on the WHO media guidelines, this study investigated the characteristics of newspaper articles of suicides in three Chinese communities, namely Hong Kong, Taiwan and Guangzhou. Epidemiological comparisons were conducted to identify the age and gender differences between the suicide victims as reported in the newspapers and the official records of suicide deaths in all three places.
   Results The results found that one media characteristic complied with the WHO media guidelines (ie, only about 2% of the articles were printed on the front page), but there were a number of instances of non-compliance (ie, only 4-14% provided sources for help-seeking and 27-90% printed with photos). The epidemiological comparisons revealed an over-representation of younger suicides and an under-representation of late-life suicides in the newspapers of all three places. Furthermore, female suicides were found to be under-reported in Taiwan and Guangzhou newspapers, but not in Hong Kong papers.
   Conclusion Non-compliant suicide articles are prevalent in the newspapers of these three Chinese settings. The observed media misrepresentations may potentially mislead the public and the policy makers about the actual risk for suicide in some demographic groups.

AB Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a common cause of death globally, and case reports and empirical studies on CO poisoning are widely examined. However, to the authors' knowledge, CO poisoning deaths in the mainland China are scarcely studied. Therefore, this study aims to explore the incidence trend of CO poisoning deaths that occurred in Wuhan - a mega city in Central China - for a six-year period (2009-2014). This arguably is the first comprehensive study to provide an overall analysis of CO poisoning deaths that sampled the mainland Chinese population. Using the data provided by the legal physicians who are employed in nine districts of Wuhan, a total of 131 cases of CO poisoning that resulted in the death of 156 victims are collected. Out of the total, 76 cases (97 deaths) are classified as accidents, 49 cases (51 deaths) are suicides, three cases (four deaths) are homicides, one case (three deaths) is homicide-suicide, and one case (one death) is classified as undetermined. Male victims are found to be the dominant sex group (53.5%; N = 83); with a mean age of 44.9 years, while female victims averagely aged 46.1 years. The highest death occurring month is in January, and followed by February and December. Coal or charcoal burning is found to be the major cause of suicide CO poisoning death (66.7%), while fire accident is the major cause of accidental CO poisoning death (60.8%) in Wuhan during the six-year period.

AB Objectives To test, among older Chinese adolescents, the associations of childhood maltreatment with single and multiple suicide attempts and whether these associations vary in relation to the presence of sleep disturbance.
   Study design We analyzed data collected from 10th to 12th graders from 7 randomly selected provinces of China in the 2015 School-based Chinese Adolescents Health Survey. There were 83 200 students who were invited to participate. and 75 715 students' questionnaires were completed and qualified for the survey. Adjusted multinomial logistic regression models were conducted to evaluate the associations of childhood maltreatment with suicide attempts.
   Results Compared with no suicide attempts, each type of adjusted childhood maltreatment (physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect, or emotional neglect) was associated with an increased risk of single and multiple suicide attempts (P < .05). The magnitude of the aORs in multiple suicide attempters was greater than those in single suicide attempters. Moreover, the adjusted interaction effects for a single suicide attempt between each type of childhood maltreatment and sleep disturbance were all statistically significant in the multivariable multinomial logistic regression models (P < .001). However, the adjusted interaction effects for multiple suicide attempts were not significant (P > .05).
   Conclusions Maltreatment during one's childhood is associated with an increased risk of single and multiple suicide attempts among older Chinese adolescents. Sleep disturbances play a moderating role in these associations for a single suicide attempt.

AB How does state repression affect the incidence and impact of terrorism? This study conducts a process tracing analysis of the ongoing contention between the Uyghur separatist movement and the Chinese state to provide a plausible explanation for the present lack of consensus on this question. Relying on insights from collective action theory, it argues that although repression was initially successful in curtailing the opportunistic use of terrorism, novel political opportunity allowed some separatists to adopt innovations, such as suicide bombing, to circumvent repression. Repression has since proved ineffective in quelling terrorism, and will likely remain incapable of forestalling future terrorist innovations.

AB Suicide attempts are the most important known predictor of death by suicide. The aim of this study is to examine the prevalence, distribution, and associated factors of suicide attempts among young adolescents in 40 low-income and middle-income countries. We used data from the Global School-Based Student Health Survey (2009-2013) and a nationally representative study in China (2010), which are school-based surveys of students primarily aged 12-18 years that assess health behaviors using an anonymous, standardized, self-reported questionnaire. We calculated the prevalence of suicide attempts in young adolescents from 40 low-income and middle-income countries using the surveys. Multilevel logistic models were used to estimate the associations between suicide attempts and potential risk factors, adjusting for gender, age, school and survey year. Results show that the mean 12-month prevalence of suicide attempts was 17.2%, ranging from 6.7% in Malaysia to 61.2% in Samoa. The overall prevalence of suicide attempts was higher for girls than for boys (18.2% vs 16.2%, P<0.05). Among the suicide attempts, the proportion of suicide attempts with a plan was higher for girls than for boys (62.7% vs 53.2%, P<0.05). Both the prevalence of suicide attempts and the proportion of suicide attempts with a plan increased with age. Factors associated with suicide attempts included poor socioeconomic status, history of bullying, loneliness and anxiety, tobacco and alcohol use, and weak family and social relationships. In conclusion, suicide attempts are frequent among young adolescents in low-income and middle-income countries. Girls and older adolescents tend to make suicide attempts with a plan. The data demonstrate the need to strengthen suicide intervention and prevention programs for young adolescents in low-income and middle-income countries.

ID AGGRESSION
AB Purpose Little is known about the clinical characteristics of patients with dementia receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for the treatment of behavioral symptoms. This study examined the demographic and clinical profile of patients with dementia receiving ECT in China.
   Methods This was a retrospective, case-control study. The sample was composed of 23 patients with dementia treated with ECT and 71 sex- and age-matched controls treated for a period of 8 years (2007-2014) at the National Clinical Research Centre of Mental Disorders, China. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from the electronic chart management system.
   Results Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that ECT was independently associated with high risk for suicide at admission. The recorded indications for ECT included both high risk for suicide and aggressive behavior. Most patients responded to ECT satisfactorily (56.5%) or partially (34.8%) with only mild-moderate transient memory impairment (30.4%).
   Conclusions Although this is a preliminary study limited by the retrospective design and small sample size, findings suggest that ECT is an effective and safe therapeutic intervention to reduce the risk for suicide and aggressive behavior in dementia.

AB Marital status is an index of the phenomenon of social integration within social structures and has long been identified as an important predictor suicide. However, previous meta-analyses have focused only on a particular marital status, or not sufficiently explored moderators. A meta-analysis of observational studies was conducted to explore the relationships between marital status and suicide and to understand the important moderating factors in this association. Electronic databases were searched to identify studies conducted between January 1, 2000 and June 30, 2016. We performed a meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression of 170 suicide risk estimates from 36 publications. Using random effects model with adjustment for covariates, the study found that the suicide risk for non-married versus married was OR = 1.92 (95% CI: 1.75-2.12). The suicide risk was higher for non-married individuals aged < 65 years than for those aged >= 65 years, and higher for men than for women. According to the results of stratified analysis by gender, non-married men exhibited a greater risk of suicide than their married counterparts in all sub-analyses, but women aged 65 years or older showed no significant association between marital status and suicide. The suicide risk in divorced individuals was higher than for non-married individuals in both men and women. The meta-regression showed that gender, age, and sample size affected between-study variation. The results of the study indicated that non-married individuals have an aggregate higher suicide risk than married ones. In addition, gender and age were confirmed as important moderating factors in the relationship between marital status and suicide.

AB The aim of this study is to examine the link between bullying and the tendency toward suicide (suicidality). In particular, we tested the interaction effect of teacher-student relationships on the association between bullying and suicidality among urban youth in China. A total of 3,675 participants were recruited from 7 provinces in urban China. Three questions were used to capture suicidality-related measures: suicide ideation, suicide planning, and attempting suicide. Traditional bullying and cyberbullying were used to measure the effect of being bullied. The results show that being bullied, traditionally or online, is significantly associated with suicidality. The interaction effect between traditional bullying and the teacher-student relationship for suicidal ideation is significant (odds ratio 1.34, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.74). However, no significant interaction effects in teacher-student relationships have been found in the association between cyberbullying and suicidality. The results indicate that teacher-student relationships have a significant protective, but limited, effect on the relationship between bullying and suicidality. Future development of suicidality intervention strategies adapted to the development of society will be beneficial.

AB Over the past decade, great concern has been expressed about the high suicide rates in China, especially among women and young women in particular. However, most of the information that has been presented has considered macro-level data and speculated on why women are so vulnerable to self-harm. This article presents the detailed story of one village woman who killed herself and suggests that motives and behavior arc more complex than the cultural script and statistics suggest. Although depression is said to be commonly present in people who kill themselves in Western countries, this may not be the case in China.

AB Background: This study aimed to illustrate the characteristics of suicide attempters treated in the Emergency Departments of 7 general hospitals in Xi'an and to provide relevant data for early psychological treatment.
   Material/ Methods: Between October 2010 and September 2014, 155 suicide attempters were treated in the Emergency Departments. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and multivariate analyses were used to identify the factors associated with suicidal behaviors.
   Results: Females outnumbered males at a ratio of 3.7 to 1. The greatest proportion of cases was in the age group of 21 to 30 years (52.9%). Patients who finished middle school or high school accounted for most of the suicide attempters (50.3%). The most common method used for attempted suicide was drug ingestion (86.5%). The majority of cases attempted suicide at home (74.8%) during the night. Marriage frustration, work and study problems, family fanaticism and conflict, somatic disease, and history of mental disorders were all significantly associated with suicide attempts. The ratio of patients to be discharged or to die were similar in occupation, marital status, and the place of suicide attempt; however, the results were different in gender, age, educational level, methods used for suicide, time of day, and reason.
   Conclusions: Suicide is an important public health problem and is multidimensional in nature. Future studies with larger samples are expected to provide more specific knowledge of the effect of each social factor on the suicide risk in Chinese in order to improve the prevention of suicides.

AB Little is known about the risk factors for aggression in general clinical settings in China. The aim of this study is to explore potential risk factors for inpatients with serious mental illness. The study was conducted from 15 March to 14 April 2013 and involved 16 general psychiatric institutions in China. A standardized data collection form was used to collect demographic and clinical characteristics data, including information on current hallucinations, delusions, depression, excitement, aboulia, apathy, and adherence to treatment. Information on lifetime history of violence and suicidality was also collected. The Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS) was also administered to indicate recent (past week) aggression. A total of 511 inpatients were enrolled. On the basis of a score of five or greater on the MOAS, 245 inpatients were assigned to aggressive group and 266 were assigned to non-aggressive group. A lifetime history of violent behaviour (OR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.95-5.11), suicide (OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.49-6.10), as well as current delusions (OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.24-2.97), and excitement (OR = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.57-4.39) were associated with aggression. The study suggested violent history, suicide history, current delusions, and excitement are the risk factors for aggression among general psychiatric inpatients with serious mental illnesses.

AB Background: To assess whether gender inequality determines the patterns of suicide gender ratios.
   Methods: Using suicide data obtained from the World Health Organization Statistical Information System, 2012, suicide gender ratios were calculated and a world map of the ratios constructed. Forest plots were utilized to assess whether gender inequality (indicated by the Gender Inequality Index ["GII"] and male to female sex ratios at birth) moderated the worldwide patterns of suicide gender ratios. Regression analyses were then performed to estimate the extent to which gender inequality affects suicide gender ratios before and after controlling for human development level ("HDI").
   Results: Gradient relationships of suicide gender ratios across 3 tertiles of GII were observed (ratios = 2.03, 2.54, 3.51, respectively for high, moderate and low GII, P = 0.03). High sex ratio at birth was significantly associated with lower suicide gender ratio (ratio = 1.64 vs. 2.75, P = 0.00). Regression analyses showed that highest tertile of GII and high sex ratios at birth were significantly associated with lower suicide gender ratios (P = 0.00 and P = 0.00, respectively). When the level of human development level was controlled, high sex ratio at birth remained to be a significant determinant of suicide gender ratios (P = 0.00), whereas the significance of GII disappeared (P = 0.19).
   Limitations: The cross-sectional data do not allow for causal inferences.
   Conclusions: Male to female suicide ratios were higher in countries with more egalitarian gender norms. Strategies to eliminate culturally embedded gender discrimination have the potentials to prevent suicides.

DT Article
ID MEDIA COVERAGE; CELEBRITY SUICIDE; MASS-MEDIA; IMPACT; NEWS
AB Media reporting can lead to the acceptance of incorrect ideas and information by the general public, which in turn can impact behavior. A number of studies have found that suicide reporting in the media can lead to an increase in the suicide rate or copycat suicides. Therefore, the aims of this study are to (a) investigate front-page reporting of suicide in four major newspapers in Taiwan; (b) investigate violation of recommendations for reporting suicide by the four major newspapers in Taiwan; and (c) investigate the impact of important events and government policy on front-page reporting of suicide (i.e., the effect of the Apple Daily newspaper entering the market, and the start of media monitoring). We carried out content analysis of reports of suicide on the front pages of the four newspapers with the highest rates of readership in Taiwan (China Times, Liberty Times, Apple Daily, and United Daily News) between 2001 and 2012. We used the chi-squared test, chi-squared test for trend, and analysis of variance to analyze trends in violation of reporting recommendations and potential associated factors. We found that (a) suicide was most commonly reported as a front-page headline and as a whole-page spread by the four major newspapers in Taiwan, with many reports including photographs; (b) reporting of suicide by the four major newspapers in Taiwan frequently violated World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for suicide reporting in the media; (c) following the entry of the Apple Daily newspaper into the Taiwanese market, reporting approaches to suicide by the other three major newspapers changed to more sensational photos and texts; and (d) monitoring of suicide reporting by the Taiwan Suicide Prevention Center appears to have been only partially effective. In summary, reporting of suicide by the four major newspapers in Taiwan could be further improved. Effective regulation of suicide reporting by newspapers could reduce the impact of this reporting on readers. In addition, regular assessment of observance of the WHO recommendations for suicide reporting by newspapers is an important part of suicide prevention.

AB Purpose: This study explored the extent to which trait aggression is associated with suicidal behavior in a nationwide school-based sample of adolescents.
   Methods: A nationwide sample of 14,537 high school students in urban areas of China was recruited. Information concerning suicide ideation, plans, attempts, trait aggression and other risk factors was collected by a self-reported questionnaire. Multivariate regression analyses were employed to predict suicidal behavior.
   Results: Approximately 18.5% of students reported suicide ideation, 8.7% reported suicide plans, and 4.1% reported attempts during the past one year. Hostility and trait anger had a significant positive association with suicidal ideation. Hostility and physical aggression were positively related to suicide plans. Hostility had a positive correlation with suicide attempts, while trait anger was inversely associated with suicide attempts.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that hostility, physical aggression and trait anger may be able to be used to predict suicidal behavior among adolescents. Suicide prevention programs should target at attenuating the severity of hostility, anger and physical aggression. But teachers and parents should also give close attention to students with low trait anger.

AB Using a nested case-control design drawing from a larger sample of 2272 adolescents, this study examined the characteristics of adolescents from Hong Kong (n = 99) and the United States (US) (n = 60), who indicated that they had made a suicide attempt at least once in the past, compared to their equally depressed sex- and age-matched counterparts who had not attempted suicide. The cross-cultural literature suggested three hypotheses which were tested: (a) depressive symptoms would differentiate between suicide attempters compared to non-attempters less in Hong Kong and more in the US; (b) discord in interpersonal relationships would be a more important distinguishing factor in suicide attempts in Hong Kong than in the US and (c) cognitive variables such as hopelessness would be less associated with suicide attempts in Hong Kong compared to the US. There were strong similarities in the two cultures with regard to characteristics that distinguished between attempters and matched controls. Hypotheses regarding cultural differences between attempters in Hong Kong and the US were not supported. Depression, current and lifetime suicide ideation, hopelessness, poor interpersonal relationships and exposure to suicide attempters and completers distinguished attempters from controls equally in the two cultures and in both genders. These findings do not support the proposition that depression is a less relevant variable in suicide attempts in Chinese versus western groups. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Previous studies in Eastern as well as Western countries have shown a relationship between marital status and suicide mortality. However, to date, no Korean study has calculated national suicide rates by marital status for specific genders, ages, and education levels. This study investigated whether the relationship between marital status and suicide differs by age, gender, and educational attainment, and analyzed the effect of marital status on suicide risk after controlling for these socio-demographic variables.
   Methods: Using national mortality data from 2015, and aggregated census data from 2010 in South Korea, we created a virtually individualized dataset with multiple weighting algorithms, including individual socio-demographic characteristics and suicide rates across the entire population.
   Results: The findings show that the following groups faced the highest relative suicide risks: 1) divorced men of all ages and men aged more than 75 years, particularly divorced men aged more than 75; and 2) never-married men aged 55-64 years, and never-married women of lower education status.
   Limitations: We did not account for important variables such as mental health, substance abuse, employment insecurity, social integration, perceived loneness, and family income which we were unable to access.
   Conclusions: This current research extends prior theoretical and methodological work on suicide, aiding efforts to reduce suicide mortality in South Korea.

AB In 2010, a startling 18 young migrant workers attempted suicide at Foxconn Technology Group production facilities in China. This article looks into the development of the Foxconn Corporation to understand the advent of capital expansion and its impact on frontline workers' lives in China. It also provides an account of how the state facilitates Foxconn's production expansion as a form of monopoly capital. Foxconn stands out as a new phenomenon of capital expansion because of the incomparable speed and scale of its capital accumulation in all regions of China. This article explores how the workers at Foxconn, the world's largest electronics manufacturer, have been subjected to work pressure and desperation that might lead to suicides on the one hand but also open up daily and collective resistance on the other hand.

AB Background. Few studies have prospectively examined whether depressive symptoms and other risk factors are associated with a higher risk of suicide death in individuals other than high-risk populations such as psychiatric patients and individuals with self-harm histories. The purpose of the study is to prospectively examine whether depressive symptoms assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) are associated with greater risk of suicide death and whether depressive symptoms and other risk factors are independent predictors of suicide in general-risk populations. Another aim is to evaluate the sensitivity of the BDI for predicting suicide death.
   Methods. 10,238 Korean Vietnam War veterans (mean age: 56.3 years) who participated in two surveys in 2001 were followed up for suicide mortality over 7.5 years.
   Results. 41 men died by suicide. Severely depressed participants had a higher adjusted hazard ratio (aHR = 3.4; 95% CI [1.5-7.7]) of suicide than non-to-moderately depressed ones. Higher suicide risk was associated with more severe depressive symptoms (p for trend = 0.009). After adjustment for depressive symptoms and other factors, very poor health, low education, and past drinking were associated with higher suicide risk, while good health, body mass index, and marital status were not associated with suicide. The sensitivity at the cut-off score of 31 for detecting suicide was higher during the earlier 3.5 years of the follow-up (75%; 95% CI [50-90]) than during the latter 4 years (60%; 95% CI [41-76]).
   Conclusions. Depressive symptoms are a strong independent predictor and very poor health, low education, and drinking status may be independent predictors of future suicide. The BDI may have acceptable diagnostic properties as a risk assessment tool for identifying people with depression and suicidal potential among middle-aged men.

ID RISK-FACTORS; TRENDS; AGE; AVAILABILITY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MORTALITY;

AB Background: The gender ratio (male/female) of suicide rates greatly differs by country and by age group. These differences are accompanied by differences in the use of violent methods of suicide.
   Methods: The gender ratio of suicide rates and the methods used were calculated from the most recently available official electronic mortality data published by the four countries (two Eastern (Korea and Japan) and two Western (Australia and the United states) countries) and from the World Health Organization [WHO] mortality database. Suicide gender ratios based on 95% Confidence intervals (CIs) were used to compare the countries between age groups.
   Results: The gender ratio of suicide rates was higher in the United States (3.9) and Australia (3.3), where gender differences in suicide methods were more prominent, than in Korea (1.8) and Japan (2.7). In the United States and Australia, the gender ratios greatly increased in the elderly (age 70 years and over), with a higher use of firearms by men. The gender ratio of suicide rates was lowest (1.0) in the young (age 20-29) in Korea, where hanging was a more common method in women than in men.
   Limitations: The study does not consider the various other factors that may have influenced gender differences of suicide rate.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that differences in suicide methods play a role in determining the differences in the gender ratio of suicide rates between countries. Because suicide methods varied with gender, age, and country and may play a role in the suicide rates of each group, these parameters should be taken into account in the design of suicide prevention measures.

AB BackgroundThe objective of this study was to investigate the contributions of mental health status and attitudes towards suicide on suicidal ideation in a sample of 6568 Chinese children and adolescents in China. Attitudes towards suicide were investigated as a possible moderator and mediator of the influence of mental health status on suicidal ideation.
   MethodsDescriptive statistical analyses, Pearson correlation analyses and hierarchical regression analyses were adopted as methods of data analyses.
   ResultsApproximately 35.38% of children and adolescents in our study reported having suicidal ideation. Mental health status and attitudes towards suicide both had an independent effect on the severity of suicidal ideation. Results indicated that mental health status was positively associated with suicidal ideation, while attitudes towards suicide were negatively associated with suicidal ideation. Moderation analysis showed that the impact of mental health status on suicidal ideation was significantly greater among children and adolescents who reported favourable attitudes towards suicide. Attitudes towards suicide partially mediated the link between mental health status and the severity of suicidal ideation. Specifically, students who experienced poorer mental health status might be more likely to report significantly more favourable attitudes towards suicide, which in turn promote greater suicidal ideation.
   ConclusionsThese results have implications for the prevention of youth suicide, suggesting that mental health status and attitudes towards suicide could be important targets for prevention and intervention for children and adolescents at risk of suicidal ideation.

AB Suicide has been identified as one of the three leading causes of death in adolescents and young adults. No previous study in China has tested the association between protective factors and urban adolescents' suicidal behaviours. In this study we tested the hypothesis that suicidal behaviours would be associated with multiple protective factors.
   A stratified random of 9015 students from 100 junior middle schools in Beijing, Hangzhou, Wuhan and Urumqi completed the Chinese version of Global School-Based Student Health Survey.
   Overall, 17.4% of students had seriously considered attempting suicide, and 8.1% had made a specific plan to attempt suicide during the 12 months preceding the survey. The students in Wuhan (18.7%) and Urumqi (20.8%) cities were significantly more likely than students in Beijing (14.4%) and Hangzhou (14.4%) to have suicidal ideation (chi(2) = 45.9, P < 0.001). Female students were significantly more likely than male students to have suicidal ideation and have made suicide attempts [odds ratio (OR) = 1.4, P < 0.001]. Results indicated that the rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts increased with age (OR = 1.44, P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression models showed that suicide risk tended to decrease significantly when 'days of missed classes or school without permission were less than one', and when students thought students in their school were kind and helpful most of the time or always', 'parents or guardians checked to see if homework was done most of the time or always', 'parents or guardians understood their problems and worries most of the time or always' and 'parents or guardians really know what they are doing with their free time most of the time or always'.
   Adolescent suicide behaviour should be a serious problem. Measures can be taken to prevent suicide by observing the factors significantly linked to suicidal behaviour. Steps can then be taken to identify adolescents who have serious suicidal ideation so that intervention can be taken to reduce the suicidal rate.

AB Background: The purpose of the present nationwide psychological autopsy case control study is to identify the association between mental disorders and suicide in Japan, adjusting for physical conditions.
   Methods: A semi-structured interview was conducted of the closest family members of 49 suicide completers and 145 gender-, age-, and municipality-matched living controls. The interview included sections of socio-demographic characteristics, physical conditions, and a psychiatric interview producing DSM-IV diagnoses of mental disorders prior to suicide (or at survey). We compared prevalences of mental disorders between the two groups, using conditional logistic regression.
   Results: A significantly higher proportion with any mental disorder was found in the suicide group (653%) compared to the control group (4.8%) (p = 0.003, odds ratio [OR] = 7.5). The population attributable risk proportion associated with mental disorder was 0.24. Mood disorder, particularly major depressive disorder, was the most strongly associated with suicide (p<0.001). Anxiety disorder, alcohol-related disorder, and brief psychotic disorder were also significantly associated with suicide (p<0.05). These patterns were unchanged after adjusting for serious chronic physical conditions. Limitations: The present study had some limitations, such as small sample size, sampling bias and information bias.
   Conclusions: Most mental disorders, particularly mood disorder, were significantly associated with a greater risk of suicide in Japan, independent of physical conditions. Mental disorders are a major target of suicide prevention programs in Japan. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: This study aimed to establish and assess the Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) prediction model for suicide attempt, so as to improve the individual prediction accuracy.
   Method: Data was collected from a wide range case-control suicide attempt survey. 659 serious suicide attempters (case group) were randomly recruited through the hospital emergency and patient registration system from 13 rural counties in China. Each case was matched the control by same community, gender, and similar age (+/- 2 ages). Face to face interviews were conducted for each subject with structured questionnaire. Logistic regression was applied to preliminarily screen the factors and BPNN was used to establish the prediction model of suicide attempt.
   Results: Multivariate logistic regression indicated that family history of suicide (OR = 4.146), mental problem (OR = 3.876) Low education level, poor health, aspiration strain, hopelessness, impulsivity, depression are the risk predictors and social support, coping skills, healthy community are the protect predictors for suicide attempt. Repetitious data simulation process of BPNN indicated that three-layer BPNN with 9 hidden layer neurons is the optimal prediction model. The sensitivity (67.6%), specificity (93.9%), positive predictive value (86.0%), negative predictive value (84.1%), total coincidence rate (84.6%) manifested that it is excellent to distinguish suicide attempt case.
   Conclusions: The BPNN method is applicative, feasible, credible and good discriminative effect for suicide attempt. The BPNN established has significant clinical meaning for the clinical psychiatrist and lay theoretical foundation for artificial intelligence expert assisted diagnosis system for suicide attempt in the future.

AB This study investigated suicidal behavior prevalence and its association with physical and sexual health, and behavior-related factors among female sex workers in South Korea. Using time location sampling, we recruited 1,083 sex workers for an interviewer-administered questionnaire regarding sexual behavior, sociodemographics, and self-rated health (SRH) status. Participants were also tested for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). We used binary logistic regression analysis to define suicide attempt factors. Around 28 % of sex workers in the sample reported that they had attempted suicide in the past year. Suicide attempts were independently associated with drinking alcohol almost every day, not using condom regularly, STD infection experience, and unfavorable SRH status. Higher suicide attempt likelihood was associated with poor sexual and physical health, but there was no significant association with the number of customers per week. We thus need to revive STD screening programs provided by the government and to support mental health programs.

AB IntroductionBroadcasting a suicide attempt on social media has become a public concern in China. Stigmatizing attitudes around such broadcast can limit help-seeking and increase the likelihood of death. To reduce stigmatizing attitudes, this paper aims to detect stigma expressions in social media posts through language use patterns and then identify suicide literacy in responses to such broadcast.
   MethodsFirstly, to examine linguistic patterns of stigma expressions, 6632 Weibo posts with keywords were collected and analyzed. Using 102 linguistic features, 2 classification models were built: one for differentiating between stigmatizing and nonstigmatizing attitudes, and one for differentiating between specific types of stigmatizing attitudes. Secondly, to identify the levels of suicide literacy, a content analysis was conducted on 4969 Weibo posts related to social media suicide.
   ResultsFirstly, the model accuracy ranged from 66.15% to 72.79%. Secondly, a total of 11.67% of the Weibo posts (n=580) contained misinformation about suicide. In the category of knowledge of signs, 27.93% and 18.10% of posts endorsed the stigmatizing views that suicide happens without warning and people who want to attempt suicide cannot change their mind quickly, both of which were related to a stigmatizing belief that a suicide attempt on social media is not genuine. In the category of knowledge of treatments, 35.17% of posts endorsed the stigmatizing view that people who have thoughts about suicide should not tell others about it.
   DiscussionThis paper presents an opportunity for the dissemination of targeted online campaigns to increase mental health literacy and help-seeking.

AB Suicide prevention is a critical issue for young people. However, no large body of representative data on the risk of suicide attempts in school-aged patients with epilepsy in Taiwan or other developing countries is available. Patients aged ae<currency> 18 years who received a diagnosis of epilepsy between 2000 and 2012 were included in the epilepsy cohort (N = 9801). The comparison cohort was matched to the epilepsy cohort at a ratio of 4:1. We calculated the adjusted hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for suicide attempts after adjustment for age, sex, urbanization level, parental occupation category, comorbidities, and follow-up time. Further analysis was performed to assess the dose-response effect on the risk of attempting suicide based on the average frequency of medical visits for epilepsy. The overall incidence rates of suicide attempts in the epilepsy and comparison cohorts were 15.7 and 5.89 per 100,000 people per year, respectively. The epilepsy cohort had a 2.34-fold higher risk of suicide being attempted (95% CI 2.17-2.52) than did the comparison cohort. Male sex, over 12 years of age, and parental occupation of office work were found to be the major risk factors for suicide attempts. Epilepsy might be an independent factor predisposing school-aged patients to suicide attempts. The results of this study could provide clinicians and governments with vital information on suicide prevention for young people with epilepsy in Taiwan and other developing countries.

AB As one of the leading causes of death around the world, suicide is a global public health threat. In the Chinese population, suicides constitute one-fifth of all recorded suicides in the world. Despite the factual data on suicide rates, the understanding of various causal factors behind suicide, including risk and protective factors and adverse health care, remained incomplete among the global Chinese aging population. To fill in the knowledge void, this paper reviews the epidemiology of suicide among Chinese older adults globally as well as explores the existing intervention strategies. Using the PRISMA statement, we performed a systematic review of exiting research on the topic, including studies describing suicide among Chinese older adults in communities outside of Asia. A literature search was conducted online by using both medical and social science data-bases. Our findings highlighted that elderly suicide in Chinese populations is significantly affected by the social, cultural, and familial contexts within which the individual lived prior to committing suicide. Reviewing such research indicated that while reducing risk factors may contribute to lowering suicides amongst Chinese older adults, measures to improve protective factors are also critical. Support through ongoing family and community care relationships is necessary to improve resilience in older adults and positive aging. Future longitudinal studies on the risk factors and protective factors, and adverse health consequences are called for to devise culturally and linguistically appropriate prevention and intervention programs in global Chinese aging populations.

ID RURAL SUICIDE; UNEMPLOYMENT; COUNTRIES; IMPACT; CHINA; SPAIN; WEST
AB Objective: The effectiveness of suicide prevention programmes is an important issue worldwide today. The impact of urbanization and gender is controversial in suicide rates. Hence, this study adjusted on potential risk factors and secular changes for suicide rates in gender and rural/urban areas.
   Study design: Observational study.
   Methods: A Suicide Prevention Center was established by the Executive Yuan in Taiwan in 2005 and tried to carry out suicidal intervention in the community in every city and town. There were two phases, including the first phase of the programme from 2005 to 2008, and the second phase of the programme from 2009 to 2013. The crude suicide rates data from the period of 1991-2013, which recruited nine urban and 14 rural areas in Taiwan, were extracted from the Taiwanese national mortality data file. The suicide rates in two areas of Taiwan (Taipei city and Yilan County) were further used to compare the differences between urban and rural areas.
   Results: The results show that unemployment increased the suicide rate in men aged 45-64 years and in women older than 65 years of age in Taiwan. High divorce and unemployment rates resulted in increased suicide rates in men in the city, whereas emotional distress was the main cause of suicides in men in rural areas. The main method of suicide was jumping from a high building for both sexes in the city, whereas drowning was the most common method of suicide for men in rural areas.
   Conclusion: Following the intervention programme, suicide behaviour began to decrease in all urban and rural areas of Taiwan. This study showed the cumulative effect of the intervention programme in decreasing the suicide rate in Taiwan. Moreover, the gender-specific suicidal rate and disparity in suicidal methods in urban and rural areas should be considered in further preventive strategies in Taiwan.

Based on this motivation, the current study administered the Suicide Probability Scale(SPS) to 1041 weibo users at Sina Weibo, which is a leading microblog service provider in China. Two NLP (Natural Language Processing) methods, the Chinese edition of Linguistic Inquiry andWord Count (LIWC) lexicon and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), are used to extract linguistic features from the Sina Weibo data. We trained predicting models by machine learning algorithm based on these two types of features, to estimate suicide probability based on linguistic features. The experiment results indicate that LDA can find topics that relate to suicide probability, and improve the performance of prediction. Our study adds value in prediction of suicidal probability of social network users with their behaviors.

AB Objectives This study aims at designing and piloting a convenient Chinese webpage suicide information mining system (SIMS) to help search and filter required data from the internet and discover potential features and trends of suicide.
   Methods SIMS utilizes Microsoft Visual Studio2008, SQL2008 and C# as development tools. It collects webpage data via popular search engines; cleans the data using trained models plus minimum manual help; translates the cleaned texts into quantitative data through models and supervised fuzzy recognition; analyzes and visualizes related variables by self-programmed algorithms.
   Results The SIMS developed comprises such functions as suicide news and blogs collection, data filtering, cleaning, extraction and translation, data analysis and presentation. SIMS-mediated mining of one-year webpage revealed that: peak months and hours of web-reported suicide events were June-July and 10-11 am respectively, and the lowest months and hours, September-October and 1-7 am; suicide reports came mostly from Soho, Tecent, Sina etc.; male suicide victims over counted female victims in most sub-regions but southwest China; homes, public places and rented houses were the top three places to commit suicide; poisoning, cutting vein and jumping from building were the most commonly used methods to commit suicide; love disputes, family disputes and mental diseases were the leading causes.
   Conclusions SIMS provides a preliminary and supplementary means for monitoring and understanding suicide. It proposes useful aspects as well as tools for analyzing the features and trends of suicide using data derived from Chinese webpages. Yet given the intrinsic "dual nature" of internet-based suicide information and the tremendous difficulties experienced by ourselves and other researchers, there is still a long way to go for us to expand, refine and evaluate the system.

AB Objective Gender ratios of suicide rates differ greatly across countries. Victoria has a high male: female ratio in suicide that is typical in English-speaking and European countries, while in Hong Kong the low ratio is similar to other SouthEast Asian countries. This study investigates the effect of gender in the psychiatric and non-psychiatric populations to examine how psychiatric history may modulate the effect of gender in these two different communities. Method Review of coronial documentation of all suicide cases in 2000 in Hong Kong and Victoria, Australia. Log-linear model was used to test the gender-psychiatric history-location interaction. Results Gender difference in suicide was narrower in victims with psychiatric history than those without in both communities, albeit gender remained to have an effect even among those with a psychiatric history in Victoria. The impact of cultural-and gender-specific factors is most apparent in suicide cases with no prior psychiatric history in Victoria: the male: female ratio was as high as 8: 1 in this group of victims. Log-linear model results show that the gender-psychiatric history-location interaction was statistically significant. Conclusions The gender differentials in suicide rates in these two communities are mainly driven by gender's effect in the population with no psychiatric history. Severe clinical conditions can override some, but not all, of gender's effects in Victoria. Suicide prevention effort should target gender-specific factors to prevent suicides in men without history of psychiatric disorders.

AB The current study was to examine the relationship among depressive symptoms, post-traumatic stress symptoms, emotion regulatory self-efficacy and suicide risk. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 3257 graduate students from a medical college of China. Lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, plan and attempt were 25.7%, 1.6%, 1.1%, respectively, with one-year suicidal ideation showing at 6.3%. Structural equation modeling was employed to examine the relative contribution of depressive symptoms, post-traumatic stress symptoms and emotion regulatory self-efficacy on suicide risk. Structural equation model had a highly satisfactory fit [chi(2) = 7.782, df = 4, p = 0.096; RMSEA = 0.021; CFI = 0.992; OFT = 0.997]. Post-traumatic stress symptoms had a direct effect and an indirect effect on suicide risk via emotion regulatory self-efficacy. Depressive symptoms also had a direct effect and an indirect effect on suicide risk via emotion regulatory self-efficacy. The depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms increased the risk of suicide risk, but the variable of emotion regulatory self efficacy would be served as a buffering factor, decreasing the risk of suicide. The interaction term of depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress symptoms had a direct effect on suicide risk. A significant interactive effect of depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms on suicide risk was found.

AB Acute poisoning is a public health threat that leads to morbidity and mortality worldwide. In this retrospective study, we evaluated autopsies from deaths caused by acute poisoning from 2008 to 2017 at the School of Forensic Medicine, China Medical University (SFMCMU) in the Liaoning Province, northeast China. A total of 140 poisoning deaths were investigated and the demographic characteristics, causes and manner of death, toxics category were analyzed. The number of poisoning deaths gradually increased during the study period. The majority of poisoning deaths were accidents (66.43%), followed by suicides (27.86%), and homicides (3.57%). Of the 140 cases, 47 (33.57%) were caused by drugs, 38 (27.14%) by agrochemicals (mainly organophosphate pesticides, n = 16), 37 (26.43%) by respiratory dysfunction toxics (mainly carbon monoxide, n = 21), and 9 (6.43%) by poisonous plants and animals. Alcohol/methanol (5, 3.57%) and other chemicals (4, 2.86%) accounted for the remaining cases. The present study provides poisoning distribution in the Liaoning province and highlights implications for public health policy and prevention efforts in northeast China.

AB Suicide rate is relatively high among Chinese rural elderly. While there has been some exciting work on reporting and preventing suicide among community-dwelling elderly, only a few published studies have addressed the issues of rural nursing homes in China. This study aimed to investigate the relationship among perceived social support, physical health, and suicidal thoughts of the elderly living in Chinese rural nursing homes. It also examined the moderating effects of social support on the path from physical health to suicidal thoughts of the rural institutional elderly in China. This study investigated 205 participants aged 60years and above in Chinese rural nursing homes. Participants' suicidal thoughts, perceived social support, and physical health were assessed. This study conducted descriptive analysis, Student's t-test, and Pearson's chi-square test to test how physical health and social support predicted suicidal thoughts, as well as the moderating effects of family's, friends', and others' social support on physical health and suicidal thoughts. Both physical health and perceived social support were significantly related to suicidal thoughts. Perceived social support from family, friends, and significant others moderated the relationship between physical health and suicidal thoughts. Findings of this study suggested that increasing social support and improving physical health would be effective in both suicide prevention and intervention for the residents in Chinese rural nursing homes.

AB Background. Prior research consistently demonstrates that neuroticism increases risk for suicidal ideation, but the association between neuroticism and suicidal behavior has been inconsistent. Whereas neuroticism is recommended as an endophenotype for suicidality, the association of neuroticism with attempted suicide warrants clarification. In particular, prior research has not distinguished between correlates of attempted suicide, correlates of suicidal ideation, and correlates of comorbid psychopathology.
   Methods. The present study used the CONVERGE study, a sample of 5864 women with major depressive disorder (MD) and 5783 women without MD throughout China. Diagnoses, suicidal ideation, and attempted suicide were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Neuroticism was assessed with the neuroticism portion of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire.
   Results. Results replicate prior findings on the correlates of suicidal ideation, particularly elevated neuroticism among individuals who report prior suicidal ideation. Moreover, as compared with individuals who reported having experienced only suicidal ideation, neuroticism was associated with decreased likelihood of having attempted suicide.
   Conclusions. The association of neuroticism with suicidality is more complicated than has been previously described. Whereas neuroticism increases risk for suicidal ideation, neuroticism may decrease risk for a suicide attempt among individuals with suicidal ideation. These results have implications for the assessment of risk for a suicide attempt among individuals who report suicidal ideation and addresses prior discordant findings by clarifying the association between neuroticism and attempted suicide.

AB This study aims to quantifiably evaluate the trend of the suicide rate among Korean adolescents from 1997 to 2012 according to urbanity. We used national death certificates and registration population data by administrative district for 15-19 years-old adolescents. The annual percent change (APC) and average annual percent change (AAPC) were estimated by the Joinpoint Regression Program. The suicide rate in the rural areas was higher than that in the urban areas in both genders (males (/100,000), 12.2 vs. 8.5; females (/100,000), 10.2 vs. 7.4 in 2012). However, the trend significantly increased only in the urban area (AAPC [95% CI]: males 2.6 [0.7, 4.6], females 3.3 [1.4, 5.2]). In urban areas, the suicide rate by jumping significantly increased in both genders (AAPC [95% CI]: males, 6.7 [4.3, 9.1]; females, 4.5 [3.0, 6.1]). In rural areas, the rate by self-poisoning significantly decreased by 7.9% per year for males (95% CI: -12.5, -3.0) and the rate by hanging significantly increased by 10.1% per year for females (95% CI: 2.6, 18.2). The trend and methods of suicide differ according to urbanity; therefore, a suicide prevention policy based on urbanity needs to be established for adolescents in Korea.

TI Belief system, meaningfulness, and psychopathology associated with

AB Background: Research suggests that Chinese religious believers are more likely to commit suicide than those identifying as non-religious among rural young adults, contrary to findings in Western countries. However, one cannot conclude that religiosity is associated with elevated suicide risk without examining the effect of political and religious beliefs in a generally atheist country like China where political belief plays a dominant role in the belief system of young adults. The present study investigated the effects of political and religious belief on suicidality with meaningfulness and psychopathology as potential mediators in a large representative sample of Chinese college students.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1390 first-year college students randomly sampled from 10 colleges and universities in mainland China.
   Results: A total of 1168 respondents (84.0%) provided complete data on all variables. Lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt were 45.1%, 6.8%, and 1.9% respectively, with one-year suicidal ideation showing at 19.3%. Female gender was associated with elevated risk of suicidality. Political belief but not religious belief was associated with decreased suicide risk. A significant interactive effect of political belief and religious belief was found, indicating that for political believers, being religious was associated with decreased suicide risk; for non-political believers, being religious was associated with increased suicide risk. Multi-group structural equation modeling showed that meaningfulness completely mediated and psychopathology partially mediated the effect of belief system on suicidality. Gender differences were found in pathways of political belief by religious beliefs to suicidality and political belief to psychopathology. The coefficients were significant for males but not for females.
   Conclusions: In less religious societies, political belief may serve as a means of integration as does religious affiliation in religious societies. Males were more likely to benefit from the protective effect of a belief system on suicidality than females.

AB Background This scoping review maps population-based surveys and mental health literacy (MHL) interventions undertaken in China during 1997-2018 in order to identify research gaps. Method Following Arksey and O'Malley's framework for a scoping review, five English databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Cochrane library, Web of Science and CINAHL) and two Chinese ones (CNKI and WanFang) were systematically searched, identifying both reports of surveys and evaluation of interventions from Jan 1997 to Oct 2018. Results MHL research has developed rapidly in China in terms of numbers of studies and geographic coverage over the past two decades. There were 350 peer-reviewed publications included in this review, covering diverse settings and participants. Of these publications, 313 (89.4%) were published in Chinese-language journals and 37 in English-language journals; 303 (86.6%) reported on survey findings and 47 reported on the evaluation of MHL interventions. MHL research in China has mainly focused on the assessment of mental health-related knowledge and beliefs. Much less attention has been given to developing and evaluating relevant interventions. MHL related to general mental health and suicide were most commonly studied, with less focus on specific disorders, although some studies covered depression, psychosis and anxiety disorders. The majority of MHL tools utilized in the studies reported in this review were developed in China (n = 97, 80.2% ) and almost half of these studies (57.8%) did not provide enough details concerning psychometrics. Conclusions More interventions targeting the general public and aiming to improve MHL and promote behaviour change, are needed in China. These should be evaluated with high-quality study designs, such as randomised controlled trials. Proper validation of tools used for measuring MHL should also be addressed in future studies.

AB Objective: Aim of this study was an evaluation of the completed suicide rate as well as exploring what associated psychological and social factors might have increased the risk of death from suicide.
   Method: The study examines all adult suicide cases in the Province of Denizli that occurred between January 2009 and December 2010. In addition to examining the judicial files, interviews were conducted with the suicide victims' relatives to elaborate the cases and evaluate the risk factors for suicide. For 19 of 53 suicide victims (35.9%), no interviews were conducted; telephone interviews were carried out with relatives of 27 of the victims (50.9%), and face-to-face interviews were held with relatives of 7 of the subjects (13.2%). Healthy controls were randomly chosen from the registers of 14 Denizli primary healthcare centers. The 31 control individuals were from a similar geographic area and social backgrounds as the case group.
   Results: Of the cases, 13.2% (n=7) were female, while 86.8% (n=46) were male. The mean age was 41.57+15.33 years. The total mean age of the control group was 42.84+16.98 years (p=0.725). The results of this study showed that a history of psychiatric disorder, prior suicide attempts, a history of alcohol abuse, stressful life events, and lack of social support/interaction were associated with suicide.
   Conclusion: Clinical and psychosocial factors such as a history of psychiatric disorder, unemployment, and financial or relationship problems increase the risk of suicide.

AB Objective: This study aimed to determine the 12-month and lifetime prevalence of major depressive episode (MDE) and their socio-demographic correlates in both the urban and rural areas of Beijing, China.
   Methods: A total of 4767 adults were randomly selected and interviewed in Beijing using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 1.0). Basic socio-demographic and clinical data were collected during the interviews.
   Results: The overall 12-month prevalence of MDE was 3.2%; 2.8% and 3.8% for men and women, respectively. The overall lifetime prevalence of MDE was 5.3%; 4.4% and 6.3% for men and women, respectively. Being older than 25 years of age was independently associated with increased risk of MDE. Sixteen point three percent of the subjects with lifetime MDE attempted suicide while the rate of suicide attempts was only 0.2% in subjects without MDE. The percentage of subjects with MDE who received any type of treatment from medical practitioners was 33.1%; of them, only 5.4% sought help from mental health professionals.
   Conclusions: National epidemiologic Surveys are needed to further explore the prevalence of MDE in China. The low percentage of subjects treated for MDE constitutes a major public health problem that should be urgently addressed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Health demographic mortality studies use verbal autopsies to identify suicide as a cause of death. Psychological autopsies focus almost exclusively on associated high-risk psychiatric disorders. New approaches considering contextual factors are needed for preventing suicide and promoting mental health. Aims: This study examined explanations of suicide reported by surviving family members or close friends with reference to social, cultural, and environmental conditions as well as the challenges of life in the Malavani slum of Mumbai. Methods: An EMIC (Explanatory Model Interview Catalog) interview based on a cultural epidemiological framework considered underlying problems, perceived causes, and sociocultural contexts. It was administered to survivors of 76 people who had died by suicide (56.6% women). Results: Accounts of underlying problems typically referred to various aspects of tension (73.7%). Perceived causes often identified multiple factors. The sociocultural contexts of suicide included the victimization of women, the personal and social impact of problem drinking, marital problems, physical health problems, mental tension, possession and sorcery. Women were particularly vulnerable to the impact of problem drinking by a spouse or father. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the value of an approach to sociocultural autopsy examining local contexts and explanations of suicide. Findings highlight needs for both mental health services and culturally sensitive social interventions.

AB Background: Sri Lanka has experienced major changes in its suicide rates since the 1970s, and in 1995 it had one of the highest rates in the world. Subsequent reductions in Sri Lanka's suicide rates have been attributed to the introduction of restrictions on the availability of highly toxic pesticides. We investigate these changes in suicide rates in relation to age, gender, method specific trends and birth-cohort and period effects, with the aim of informing preventative strategies.
   Methods: Secular trends of suicide in relation to age, sex, method, birth-cohort and period effects were investigated graphically using police data (1975-2012). Poisoning case-fatality was investigated using national hospital admission data (2004-2010).
   Results: There were marked changes to the age-, gender-and method-specific incidence of suicide over the study period. Year on year declines in rates began in 17-25 year olds in the early 1980s. Reduction in older age groups followed and falls in all age groups occurred after all class I (the most toxic) pesticides were banned. Distinct changes in the age/gender pattern of suicide are observed: in the 1980s suicide rates were highest in 21-35 year old men; by the 2000s, this pattern had reversed with a stepwise increase in male rates with increasing age. Throughout the study period female rates were highest in 17-25 year olds. There has been a rise in suicide by hanging, though this rise is relatively small in relation to the marked decline in self-poisoning deaths. The patterns of suicides are more consistent with a period rather than birth-cohort effect.
   Conclusions: The epidemiology of suicide in Sri Lanka has changed noticeably in the last 30 years. The introduction of pesticide regulations in Sri Lanka coincides with a reduction in suicide rates, with evidence of limited method substitution.

AB Background: Ethical issues have been raised about using the psychological autopsy approach in the study of suicide. The impact on informants of control cases who participated in case-control psychological autopsy studies has not been investigated. Aims: (1) To investigate whether informants of suicide cases recruited by two approaches (coroners' court and public mortuaries) respond differently to the initial contact by the research team. (2) To explore the reactions, reasons for participation, and comments of both the informants of suicide and control cases to psychological autopsy interviews. (3) To investigate the impact of the interviews on informants of suicide cases about a month after the interviews. Methods: A self-report questionnaire was used for the informants of both suicide and control cases. Telephone follow-up interviews were conducted with the informants of suicide cases. Results: The majority of the informants of suicide cases, regardless of the initial route of contact, as well as the control cases were positive about being approached to take part in the study. A minority of informants of suicide and control cases found the experience of talking about their family member to be more upsetting than expected. The telephone follow-up interviews showed that none of the informants of suicide cases reported being distressed by the psychological autopsy interviews. Limitations: The acceptance rate for our original psychological autopsy study was modest. Conclusions: The findings of this study are useful for future participants and researchers in measuring the potential benefits and risks of participating in similar sensitive research. Psychological autopsy interviews may be utilized as an active engagement approach to reach out to the people bereaved by suicide, especially in places where the postvention work is underdeveloped.

AB Suicide is the second leading cause of death in Chinese university students and research examining their professional help-seeking is limited. This study aims to investigate: (i) professional help-seeking intentions for suicidal ideation among Chinese university students, with comparison to Australian university students, (ii) relationships between suicide literacy, social support, suicide stigma, self-reliance and help-seeking intentions, and (iii) self-recognised barriers to help-seeking. Chinese (N = 208) and Australian (N = 128) university students were recruited to complete an online cross-sectional survey assessing their intentions to seek professional help if they experienced suicidal ideation. One-third of the surveyed Chinese and Australian students expressed reluctance to seek professional help. Self-reliance was endorsed by both countries' university students as an important barrier. Suicide literacy, suicide stigma, and social support were not found to have a significant relationship with help-seeking intentions. The high costs of mental health services (Australian university students) and informal support from family and friends (Chinese university students) were identified as critical barriers to help seeking by participants. Results from this study suggest self-reliance is a potentially important barrier to professional help-seeking, whereas, suicide literacy and suicide stigma may have limited influence on help-seeking intentions among student populations.

ID BURDEN
AB Background A recent survey in China indicated the 12-month prevalence rate of depressive disorders was 2.5% in Beijing and 1.7% in Shanghai. These disorders may result in disability, premature death, and severe suffering of those affected and their families. Aims This study estimates the economic consequences of depressive disorders in China. Methods Depressive disorders can have both direct and indirect costs. To obtain direct costs, the research team interviewed 505 patients with depressive disorders and their caregivers in eight clinics/hospitals in five cities in China. Depression-related suicide rates were obtained from published literature. The human capital approach was used to estimate indirect costs. Epidemiological data were taken from available literature. Results The total estimated cost of depression in China is 51,370 million Renminbi (RMB) (or US $6,264 million) at 2002 prices. Direct costs were 8,090 million RMB (or US$ 986 million), about 16% of the total cost of depression. Indirect costs were 43,280 million RMB (or US$ 5,278 million), about 84% of the total cost of depression. Conclusions Depression is a very costly disorder in China. The application of an effective treatment-reducing the length of depressive episodes (or preventing episodes) and reducing suicide rates-will lead to a significant reduction in the total burden resulting from depressive disorders. Government policymakers should seriously consider further investments in mental health services.

DE Attempt incidence; Case fatality; Gender ratio; Suicide; Taipei; Taiwan
ID HONG-KONG; RATES; CHINA; MORTALITY; SEX
AB Background: There has been a widening suicide gender gap in Taiwan in the past decade. This study aimed to examine the contributions of changing incidence patterns of suicidal behavior and case fatalities of different suicide methods in quantitatively explaining the male excess in suicide rates and the associated changes in gender ratio of suicide in Taipei City from 2004 to 2006.
   Methods: A decompositional method was used to quantify the contributions of age, method-specific case fatality, and attempt incidence to male excess in suicide rates. Our aim is to examine the male excess in suicide rate by decomposing the difference (i.e., male minus female) and widening gender ratio (i.e., male to female) during the study period, respectively.
   Results: Charcoal burning suicide replaced hanging as the most common method of suicide in 2006. Its percentage of contribution for the male excess in suicide rate (i.e., male minus female) increased from 36.3% in 2004 to 45.1% in 2006 whereas poisoning from solid and liquid poisoning reduced from 7.7% to 4.9% for the same period. Also, the widening suicide gender ratio was mostly due to the increased incidence of attempts of three highly lethal methods of suicide among men: charcoal burning (59.5%), hanging (38.6%), and jumping from a height (35.6%). The disproportionate increase in attempt incidence especially for the methods of charcoal burning and hanging among 40-59 year-old men contributed most significantly to the widened suicide gender gap.
   Limitations: Although accessibility to emergency services in major hospitals is good, it is to be expected that there are an unknown number of underreported of suicide attempts which might affect the results. Also, we have selected only age-, gender- and method-specific case fatality and incidence of suicide attempt to explain the male excess in suicide rates. Some other factors, for example, urban and rural region which might be related to the gender ratio, but have not been examined in this study.
   Conclusions: Suicide attempt incidences in males and females have increased considerably in the period 2004-2006. As males especially those 40-59 years old are drawn to use more lethal methods of suicide (i.e. charcoal burning and jumping), the excessive male suicide rate and the suicide gender ratio continues to increase even though the gender ratio of attempt incidence remains the same.

AB Background: Between 1955 and 2011 there were marked fluctuations in suicide rates in Sri Lanka; incidence increased six-fold between 1955 and the 1980s, and halved in the early 21st century. Changes in access to highly toxic pesticides are thought to have influenced this pattern. This study investigates variation in suicide rates across Sri Lanka's 25 districts between 1955 and 2011. We hypothesised that changes in the incidence of suicide would be most marked in rural areas due to the variation in availability of highly toxic pesticides in these locations during this time period.
   Methods: We mapped district-level suicide rates in 1955, 1972, 1980 and 2011. These periods preceded, included and postdated the rapid rise in Sri Lanka's suicide rates. We investigated the associations between district-level variations in suicide rates and census-derived measures of rurality (population density), unemployment, migration and ethnicity using Spearman's rank correlation and negative binomial models.
   Results: The rise and fall in suicide rates was concentrated in more rural areas. In 1980, when suicide rates were at their highest, population density was inversely associated with area variation in suicide rates (r = -0.65; p < 0.001), i.e. incidence was highest in rural areas. In contrast the association was weakest in 1950, prior to the rise in pesticide suicides (r = -0.10; p = 0.697). There was no strong evidence that levels of migration or ethnicity were associated with area variations in suicide rates. The relative rates of suicide in the most rural compared to the most urban districts before (1955), during (1980) and after (2011) the rise in highly toxic pesticide availability were 1.1 (95% CI 0.5 to 2.4), 3.7 (2.0 to 6.9) and 2.1 (1.6 to 2.7) respectively.
   Conclusions: The findings provide some support for the hypothesis that changes in access to pesticides contributed to the marked fluctuations in Sri Lanka's suicide rate, but the impact of other factors cannot be ruled out.

ID MIGRATION; IMMIGRANTS; SUICIDE
AB Objectives There are currently around 120 million rural-urban migrants in China. Elsewhere migration has been associated with increased vulnerability to mental health problems. This study was conducted to explore the mental health status and help seeking behaviours of migrant workers in Hangzhou city, Zhejiang Province, and to compare them with permanent urban and rural dwellers. Methods A self-completion questionnaire including items relating to sociodemographics, health and lifestyles and mental health, was completed by 4453 migrant workers and 1957 urban workers in Hangzhou city, and by 1909 rural residents in Western Zhejiang Province. Results The mean age of the migrants was 27 years, (male 29 years, female 25 years). They worked long hours (28% > 12 h per day, 81% 6 or 7 days per week) and their living conditions were very basic. On the SF-36 mental health scale migrants had lower scores (52.4) than rural residents (60.4, P < 0.0001) but scored higher than urban residents (47.2, P = 0.003). The difference between urbanites and migrants disappeared after adjustment for confounders (P = 0.06). Independent predictors of better mental health status among migrants were being unmarried, migrating with a partner, higher salary, good self-reported health and good relationships with co-workers. There were small significant differences in suicide ideation and attempts between the three groups with suicide ideation commonest in migrants and suicide attempts most common in the rural population. Fewer than 1% across all three groups had received any professional help for depression or anxiety. Conclusion Rural-urban migrant workers in this part of China are not especially vulnerable to poor mental health. This may result from a sense of well being associated with upward economic mobility and improved opportunities, and the relatively high social capital in migrant communities.

AB Current knowledge of suicidal behavior in the Western Pacific region is relatively limited when compared to other areas of the world. This area is characterized by a wide diversity of social, economic, and cultural aspects that do not permit any homogenous reading of suicide phenomena. Data from countries of the region included in this article suggest the existence of important differences among nations in terms of gender, age, and methods of suicide, as well role of mental illness. In addition, the Western Pacific region appears to be affected by higher rates of suicide than other areas in the world, with signs of progressive worsening in recent years and worrying predictions for the next two decades. The Suicide Trends in At-Risk Territories (START) Study, initiated by the World Health Organization Regional Office in Manila, seeks to research the incidence of both fatal and nonfatal suicidal behavior in countries of the region and to implement interventions for suicide attempters. This ambitious project is expected to standardize data collection procedures and improve the knowledge cultural factors in suicide.

LA English
DT Article
ID BEHAVIOR; SCALE; POPULATION; PSYCHACHE; EMOTIONS; CHINA
AB The role of psychological pain in the risk of suicide was explored using a three-dimensional psychological pain model (pain arousal, painful feelings, pain avoidance). The sample consisted of 111 outpatients with major depressive episodes, including 28 individuals with suicidal histories. They completed the Chinese version of the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSI), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Psychache Scale, and the three-dimensional Psychological Pain Scale (TDPPS). A structured clinical interview was conducted to assess the history of suicidal acts. Significant correlations were found among BDI, BSI, and TDPPS scores (p<.01). Stepwise regression analyses showed that only pain avoidance scores significantly predicted suicide ideation at one's worst point (=.79, p<.001) and suicidal acts (=.46, p<.001). Pain avoidance was also a better predictor of current suicidal ideation (=.37, p=.001) than were BDI scores (=.31, p<.01). Increased levels of pain avoidance during a major depressive episode may be a dominant component of the motivation for suicide. Future clinical assessments for populations at high risk of suicide should include measures of psychological pain to reduce the incidence of suicide.

AB Background In India, death registration is not complete, especially in rural areas. Chiefly for other purposes special efforts were made to identify all deaths that occurred during 1997-98 in rural areas of one of the districts in Tamil Nadu, South India, and the verbal autopsy was done.
   Methods Trained non-medical field interviewers interviewed surviving spouses, close associates or neighbours, and wrote the verbal autopsy reports in the local language (Tamil). The reports were reviewed independently by two physicians to arrive at the probable underlying cause of death. About 5% of the data were randomly selected for re-interview.
   Results The verbal autopsy was done for 38 836 deaths. injuries accounted for 18.5% of the total deaths. About half of these were suicides. The average annual suicide rate for men and women were 71 and 53/100 000, respectively. Three-fourths of all suicides were in the socially and economically productive age-group of 15-44 years. At ages 15-24 years the female suicide rate of 109/100 000 exceeded the male rate of 78/100 000; suicide was responsible for 49% of all deaths in women and 38% of all deaths in men at these ages.
   Conclusions This is the second largest study to date that has used verbal autopsy to estimate mortality rates in India. Suicides accounted for 9% of total deaths, and the ratio of male to female suicide was 1: 0.72. The overall (male + female) annual suicide rate was 62/100 000 population. The female suicide rate at ages 15-24 years was higher than the male rate in that age-group and other female age-groups. About 50% of suicides were by self-poisoning, one-third by hanging and one-eighth by self-immolation.

AB Injuries have emerged as a crucial public health concern in China. Data were obtained from the death registry system in Ningbo during 2004-2013. Mortality rates resulting from all injuries and the 6 most common types of injuries were analyzed to identify time trends using linear regression models on both the absolute scale and log scale. A decreased male to female ratio and increasing age were observed among the total injury deaths. The annual all-injury mortality rates declined considerably during the observation period. Injury mortality rates for motor vehicle traffic crashes, drowning, and suicide all showed a deceasing trend; however, only mortality from falls showed an increasing trend. There was a sharp increasing trend among females, with a disproportionate number of falls. The injury patterns in Ningbo are mostly comparable to those in high-income countries. Appropriate preventive strategies should be urgently tailored to control this aggressive evolution in older individuals and females.

AB Objectives: To investigate and describe the epidemiological characteristics of suicide in the elderly in Jiading, Shanghai, for the period 2003-2013.
   Design: Retrospective, observational, epidemiological study using routinely collected data.
   Setting: Jiading District, Shanghai.
   Methods: Suicide data were retrieved from the Shanghai Vital Registry database for the period 2003-2013. Crude and age-standardised mortality rates were calculated for various groups according to sex and age. Joinpoint regression was performed to estimate the percentage change (PC) and annual percentage change (APC) for suicide mortality.
   Result: A total of 956 deaths due to suicide occurred among people aged >= 65 years during the study period, accounting for 76.7% (956/1247) of all suicide decedents. Among the 956 people with suicide deaths, 88.7% (848/956) had a history of a psychiatric condition. The age-standardised mortality rates for suicide without and with a psychotic history in people aged >= 65 years were much higher than those for people aged <65 years in both genders. Suicide mortality in the elderly showed a declining trend, with a PC of -51.5% for men and -47.5% for women. The APC was -29.1 in 2003-2005, 4.6 in 2005-2008 and -9.7 in 2008-2013 for aged men, and -12.2 in 2003-2006 and -5.2 in 2006-2013 for aged women, respectively. Women living in Jiading had a higher risk of suicide death than men, especially among the elderly. The mortality rate for suicide increased with age in the elderly, and was more marked for those with a psychiatric history than for those without.
   Conclusions: Suicide mortality declined in Jiading during the study period 2003-2013 overall, but remained high in the elderly, especially those with a psychiatric history.

TI CORPSE ADMONITION: WU KEDU AND BUREAUCRATIC PROTEST IN LATE QING CHINA
SO JOURNAL OF CHINESE HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
DE Bureaucratic protest; constitutional agenda; corpse admonition; late
   Qing China; suicide
AB In late imperial China, an extremely small number of bureaucrats adopted corpse admonition (shijian) to protest with their death what they regarded as inadequacies or failings in the imperial structure. This article introduces the case of Wu Kedu, who killed himself to protest the designation, by the late Qing empress dowagers Ci'an and Cixi, of Guangxu as the emperor, and as the adopted son of Xianfeng and not as the heir to Tongzhi. The article argues that Wu Kedu's suicide, which was highly praised during and after its time, was an attempt to sway bureaucratic opinion to put a check on the arbitrary power of empress dowagers, but instead had the unintended consequence of reinforcing it. More importantly, Wu Kedu's corpse admonition was a precursor of the outpouring of voices of remonstrance over political issues at the turn of the twentieth century, leading to further development of the Chinese "constitutional agenda."

AB For a long time, under the specific historical social and cultural background in China, domestic violence has long been seen as household chores and lack of external intervention, this concept may require a long process of change. Nowadays, with the rapid development of urbanization in China, the problem of rural suicide is becoming more and more prominent. Live in rural families with low family ties and strong interpersonal ties, Traditional married rural women having been faced with heavy psychological and emotional stress of domestic violence caused by all kinds of family conflicts and disputes, And young women, which tend to be impulsive, frustrated and difficult, often act with suicidal behavior as a way of venting and expressing unhappiness. The implementation of the anti-domestic violence act will provide them with the dignity, justice, or solution to their deaths. China's anti-domestic violence law was implemented on March 1, 2016, and the law clearly defined domestic violence as a legal fonn.

AB Objective: The authors examined the prevalence and distribution of mental disorders in rural Chinese 15-34 years of age who committed suicide. They hypothesized that mental illness is a risk factor for suicide in this population and that the prevalence of mental illness is lower in females than in males.
   Method: In this case-control psychological autopsy study, face-to-face interviews were conducted to collect information from proxy informants for 392 suicide victims and 416 living comparison subjects. Five categories of DSM-IV mental disorders (mood disorders, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, and other axis I disorders) at the time of death or interview were assessed using the Chinese version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Sociodemographic variables, social support, and life events were also assessed.
   Results: The prevalence of current mental illness was 48.0% for suicide victims and 3.8% for comparison subjects. Among suicide victims, mental illness was more prevalent in males than in females (55.1% compared with 39.3%). A strong association between mental illness and suicide was observed after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics. Other risk factors included having a lower education level, not being currently married, having a lower level of social support, and having a history of recent and long-term life events. Additive interactions were observed between mental illness and lower level of social support.
   Conclusions: Although mental illness is a strong risk factor for suicide, it is less prevalent among rural Chinese young people who committed suicide, particularly females, in comparison with other populations in China and in the West. (Am J Psychiatry 2010; 167:773-781)

AB IQs were correlated with the z score of suicide rate minus z score of homicide rate using nine regions of the world-established market economies, formerly socialized Europe, India, China, other Asian nations, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America/Caribbean, Middle East Crescent, and the USA. Correlations were .85 and .83 with crude rates and age-adjusted rates, respectively. The homicide findings are consistent with previous research in individual countries showing that less intelligent persons commit homicide more often. However, the present findings of a positive correlation between IQ and suicide rates are the opposite of what has been found in the more definitive studies within countries. Explanations for the apparent paradox and for the findings more generally were offered.

AB The object of this article is to review the past decade of research on teenage suicide, with a particular emphasis on epidemiologic trends by age, gender and indigenous ethnicity. As such, a review of research literature from 2003 to 2014 was conducted via a comprehensive search of relevant psychological and medical databases. Wide gaps in our knowledge base exist concerning the true extent of teenage suicide due to lack of data, particularly in developing countries, resulting in a Western bias. The gender paradox of elevated suicidality in females with higher completed suicide rates in males is observed in teenage populations worldwide, with the notable exceptions of China and India. Native and indigenous ethnic minority teens are at significantly increased risk of suicide in comparison to general population peers. Often those with the highest need for mental health care (such as the suicidal adolescent) have least access to therapeutic support.
   Globally, suicide in teenagers remains a major public health concern. Further focused research concerning completed suicides of youth below the age of 18 is required across countries and cultures to understand more about risk as children progress through adolescence. Gender and ethnic variations in suicidality are embedded within cultural, historical, psychological, relational and socio-economic domains. Worldwide, the absence of child/adolescent-specific mental health policies may delay the development of care and suicide prevention. Overall, it is vital that clinicians adopt a holistic approach that incorporates an awareness of age and gender influences, and that cultural competency informs tailored and evaluated intervention programmes.

AB To date, there have been very limited studies regarding the clinical epidemiology of attempted suicide in Chinese individuals with heroin-dependence. The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence and correlates of suicide attempt in Chinese individuals receiving methadone maintenance treatment for heroin dependence. Demographic, clinical, and psychosocial data of 603 methadone-maintained patients with heroin dependence were collected with a standardized self-administered questionnaire. The presence of suicide attempt and antisocial personality disorder was assessed by using a single question and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5.0. The one-month and lifetime prevalence rates of suicide attempt were 9.5% and 34.2%, respectively. In multivariable logistic regression, lifetime suicide attempt was significantly associated with female gender (OR = 2.81), being 20-39 years old (OR = 2.73), an education level of primary school or lower (OR = 2.07), poor economic status (OR = 3.06), injecting heroin before methadone maintenance treatment (OR = 2.92), depressive symptoms (OR = 3.46), anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.88), and antisocial personality disorder (OR = 2.85). Suicide attempt is very prevalent among Chinese individuals receiving methadone maintenance treatment for heroin dependence. Services for patients with heroin dependence in methadone maintenance treatment clinics in China should include psychosocial supports, periodic screening for suicide attempt and other suicidal behaviors and, when needed, psychiatric treatment and crisis intervention.

ID CHINA
AB Constraints to participating in leisure activities have been studied extensively. Yet given the sensitive nature of death and death-related topics, little effort has been invested in understanding travel constraints that limit people's decisions to engage in physician-assisted suicide travel. As this form of travel is a relatively new area of interest in the tourism literature, this study investigates the public's perceptions of physician-assisted suicide travel by extracting online comments from user-generated content. By applying thematic content analysis with a deductive approach, a pre-coding scheme was developed based on the hierarchical constraint model. Four travel constraints were identified: perceived incapability and lack of personal support (intrapersonal constraints), lack of suitable travel agencies and services (structural constraint), and complex travel decision making. The latter consisted of two sub-dimensions: individualistic decisions (intrapersonal constraint) and collectivistic decisions (interpersonal constraint). The findings of this study help to contextualise physician-assisted suicide practices and knowledge in a tourism context. Relevant practical implications are also discussed.

TI Association of suicide rates for elderly age bands with gender equality
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID EPIDEMIOLOGIC PROFILE; CHINA; EAST
AB A lower sex ratio (male to female) of elderly Suicide rates in several Asian countries have been attributed to gender inequality oil several parameters. The association of two proxy measures of gender equality (value of the gender empowerment measure and the gender-related development index) and the male to female sex ratio of suicide rates in the age bands 65-74 yr. and 75+ yr. was examined using multiple linear regression. The two proxy measures of gender equality did not account for significant variance in the male to female sex ratio of suicide rates in the age bands 65-74 yr. and 75+ yr. Association of gender equality with the male to female sex ratio of Suicide rates requires further clarification in both cross-sectional studies across different Countries and longitudinal Studies within individual countries for all age bands. Such studies should, in addition to the GEM and the GDI, include other measures of gender equality including sex differences ill educational attainment, income, poverty, housing, employment, access to healthcare and social welfare services, and urbanisation.

AB Background: As one of the leading causes of death around the world, suicide is a global public health threat. Due to the paucity of systematic studies, there exist vast variations in suicide ideation, attempts and suicide rates between various regions of Chinese aging communities.
   Objectives: Our systematic study aims to (1) identify studies describing the epidemiology of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and behaviors among global Chinese communities; (2) conduct systematic review of suicide prevalence; (3) provide cross-cultural insights on this public health issue in the diverse Chinese elderly in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Asian societies and Western countries. Data sources: Using the PRISMA statement, we performed systematic review including studies describing suicidal ideation, attempts, and behavior among Chinese older adults in different communities. Literature searches were conducted by using both medical and social science data bases in English and Chinese.
   Results: Forty-nine studies met inclusion criteria. Whereas suicide in Chinese aging population is a multifaceted issue, culturally appropriate and inter-disciplinary approach to improve the quality of life for the Chinese older adults is critical.
   Conclusions: Future research is needed to explore the risk and protective factors associated with suicidal thoughts, attempts and behaviors in representative Chinese aging populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SUICIDE ATTEMPTS; VIOLENT CRIME; RISK-FACTORS; CONSEQUENCES; PREVALENCE;

AB Background: There is a large and increasing excess of men in China, especially in poor rural areas, with millions now unable to marry. The study aimed to determine whether these high sex ratios influence the prevalence of depression.
   Methods: The study was a cross-sectional survey, using a self-completion questionnaire, administered to adults of reproductive age in localities with widely varying sex ratios in three provinces: Zhejiang, Yunnan and Guizhou. Depression was measured using the Chinese version of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).
   Results: A total of 7435 men and women aged 19-40 completed questionnaires. Moderate or severe depression was found in 17.6% of men and 17.0% of women, and suicide thoughts and wishes in 18.0% and 20.0% respectively. Independent correlates for depression and suicide ideation in men were high local sex ratio, rural residence, low education and poor economic status. Very high local sex ratio was the strongest independent determinant of depression in men.
   Limitations: These include (1) selection bias: with just three provinces and a purposive sampling strategy, (2) reporting bias: the BDI score is arguably a crude measure for a complex psychological condition, and the veracity of responses to sensitive questions cannot be guaranteed, (3) information bias: county-level sex ratio figures may underestimate the actual sex ratio, especially in rural areas.
   Conclusion: Very high sex ratios in parts of China are contributing to depression and suicidal tendencies in men, and women, but especially unmarried men. Proactive measures need to be taken to identify and treat vulnerable individuals. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article reviews research into suicide in women during the last 25 years. National rates vary between the extremes of 19/10(5) per year in Sri Lanka and < 1/10(5) per year in the Philippines and Egypt, but almost everywhere rates for women are much lower than male retest with a median ratio of 2.8/1. The exceptions are in India and China, which report higher rates in young married women. The reproductive process has some influence. While menstruation, hormonal treatment, pregnancy and the puerperium have no major effect, unwanted pregnancy may still lead to suicide under certain circumstances, and severe labour can occasionally do so. Having children protects, but the relative risk is no more than 2.0 in nulliparous women. Social factors also have a limited effect. There are higher rates of suicide in divorced women, but the evidence on widowhood is equivocal. Prosperity and employment have no effect. Sexual abuse, rape and domestic violence undoubtedly lead to suicide attempts, but the evidence on completed suicide is lacking. There are many unanswered questions, especially why rates of completed suicide for women (with a greater prevalence of overt depression) are lower than for men, and why Chinese and Indian women have higher rates. More research is required, especially from developing nations.

AB Background: Pathological gambling is associated with suicidal ideation and attempt. There is no known report on pathological gambling preceding suicide. By examining a series of 17 suicide cases with evidence of pathological gambling prior to death, we sought to generate hypotheses for further study of this under-researched but rapidly-increasing worldwide public health problem.
   Method: Psychological autopsy interviews using a semi-structured format were conducted with proxy respondents for suicide and control subjects aged 15-59 years in Hong Kong SAR, China.
   Results: Of the 150 suicides and 150 controls examined, 17 suicides (11.3%) and one control case (0.6%) met criteria for the diagnosis of pathological gambling at the time of death or interview. All 17 Suicide cases with pathological gambling had unmanageable debt at the time of death. Fourteen cases (82.4%) had other associated psychiatric disorders, most often major depressive disorders (n = 10, 58.9%) and substance-use disorders (n = 3, 17.6%). None had ever received psychiatric treatment.
   Limitations: Descriptive, retrospective case series with a small sample size.
   Conclusions: Along with unmanageable debt, a high proportion of the Suicide cases with pathological gambling also experienced other psychiatric illnesses, most often depression, at the time of death. None sought treatment for their addictive behavior or psychiatric illness prior to death. Pathological gambling is a modifiable risk factor for Suicide for which means to enhance case identification and engagement in treatment are urgently needed. Clinicians treating depression should explore the presence of pathological gambling behavior or unmanageable debts among their patients. Addressing pathological gambling should be one important component of a comprehensive suicide prevention strategy especially in countries where gambling activities are legalized and expanding.

AB Metropolitan' sociology has universal pretensions that cannot be realised. These and other limitations of mainstream sociology are borne out by the experience of teaching a classical sociological theory course in Hong Kong during 2012. Imparting accessible material meaningfully applicable to analysis of Chinese society led students to scrutinise primary texts and to apply to them material that supplemented, corrected and provided an alternative framework to the received wisdom of western social theory.

AB Background: Injury is a growing public health concern in China. Injury death rates are often higher in rural areas than in urban areas in general. The objective of this study is to compare the injury mortality rates in urban and rural residents in Hubei Province in central China by age, sex and mechanism of injury.
   Methods: Using data from the Disease Surveillance Points (DSP) system maintained by the Hubei Province Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 2006 to 2008, injury deaths were classified according to the International Classification of Disease-10th Revision (ICD-10). Crude and age-adjusted annual mortality rates were calculated for rural and urban residents of Hubei Province.
   Results: The crude and age-adjusted injury death rates were significantly higher for rural residents than for urban residents (crude rate ratio 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.8-2.0; adjusted rate ratio 2.4, 95% confidence interval 2.3-2.4). The age-adjusted injury death rate for males was 81.6/100,000 in rural areas compared with 37.0/100 000 in urban areas; for females, the respective rates were 57.9/100,000 and 22.4/100 000. Death rates for suicide (32.4 per 100 000 vs 3.9 per 100 000), traffic-related injuries (15.8 per 100 000 vs 9.5 per 100 000), drowning (6.9 per 100 000 vs 2.3 per 100 000) and crushing injuries (2.0 per 100 000 vs 0.7 per 100 000) were significantly higher in rural areas. Overall injury death rates were much higher in persons over 65 years, with significantly higher rates in rural residents compared with urban residents for suicide (279.8 per 100 000 vs 10.7 per 100 000), traffic-related injuries, and drownings in this age group. Death rates for falls, poisoning, and suffocation were similar in the two geographic groups.
   Conclusions: Rates of suicide, traffic-related injury deaths and drownings are demonstrably higher in rural compared with urban locations and should be targeted for injury prevention activity. There is a need for injury prevention policies targeted at elderly residents, especially with regard to suicide prevention in rural areas in Central China.

AB Suicide is an important public health hazard worldwide. A 4-year retrospective study from January 2000 to December 2003 was conducted to identify the favored methods in realized suicides among males and females in the west coastal region of India. During the study period, a total of 539 cases of suicidal deaths were autopsied. Males were predominantly affected (male: female-1.9:1). The age of the victims ranged from 13 to 90 years in males (mean = 40.1 years, median = 37.0 years) and 15 to 85 years in females (mean = 36.6 years, median = 32.0 years). Most favored method of suicide amongst males and females was hanging (36.9%, n = 199) followed by poisoning (34.7%, n = 187). Male dominance was apparent for each method of suicide except for self-immolation. Males were relatively more likely to use hanging and poisoning while females were more likely to prefer drowning and self-immolation as methods of suicide. Relatively younger females (mean = 33.0 years, median = 32.0 years) preferred hanging as a method of suicide when compared to males (mean = 42.4 years, median = 40.0 years). Among females, significantly younger females resorted to hanging when compared to older females who preferred drowning. On investigating the various theories proposed for choice of suicide methods in males and females in different regions we conclude that preference of method of suicide in men and women is complexly determined. In this region, availability, accessibility, popularity, and socioacceptability seem to be the major determinants in the choice of methods among males and females rather than violence associated and lethality of the method. Females were as likely to use lethal and violent methods as males in this region.

DT Review
DE Injury prevention; Safety promotion; Safe Community; Economic
   development; China
ID SUICIDE; HEALTH; SWEDEN
AB Due to its rapid economic development, China is facing a huge health, social, and economic burden resulting from injuries. The study's objective was to examine Safe Communities in China as a strategy for injury prevention and safety promotion programmes in the era of rapid economic growth. Literature searches in English and Chinese, which included grey literature, were performed on the Chinese Journal Full-text Search System and Medline, using the words "Safe Community", "injury", "economics", and "prevention". The results showed that the existing 35 recognized members of the International Safe Community Network have not placed due emphasis on suicide prevention, which is one of the leading problems in both rural and urban China. A few groups, such as children, the elderly, cyclists, and pedestrians, have received due emphasis, while other vulnerable groups, such as migrant workers, motorcyclists, students, players, and farmers have not received the necessary attention from the Safe Community perspective. As the evidence describes, Safe Communities in China can be a very effective strategy for injury prevention, but four aspects need to be strengthened in the future: (1) establish and strengthen the policy and regulations in terms of injury prevention at the national level; (2) create a system to involve professional organizations and personnel in projects; (3) consider the economic development status of different parts of China; and (4) intentional injury prevention should receive greater attention.

AB Background: Forty percent of the world's suicide deaths occur in low and middle income countries (LAMIC) in Asia. There is a recognition that social factors, such as socioeconomic position (SEP), play an important role in determining suicidal risk in high income countries, but less is known about the association in LAMIC.
   Methods: The objective of this systematic review was to synthesise existing evidence of the association between SEP and attempted suicide/suicide risk in LAMIC countries in South and South East Asia. Web of Science, MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and article reference lists/forward citations were searched for eligible studies. Epidemiological studies reporting on the association of individual SEP with suicide and attempted suicide were included. Study quality was assessed using an adapted rating tool and a narrative synthesis was conducted.
   Results: Thirty-one studies from nine countries were identified; 31 different measures of SEP were reported, with education being the most frequently recorded. Most studies suggest that lower levels of SEP are associated with an increased risk of suicide/attempted suicide, though findings are not always consistent between and within countries. Over half of the studies included in this review were of moderate/low quality. The SEP risk factors with the most consistent association across studies were asset based measures (e.g. composite measures); education; measures of financial difficulty and subjective measures of financial circumstance. Several studies show a greater than threefold increased risk in lower SEP groups with the largest and most consistent association with subjective measures of financial circumstance.
   Conclusion: The current evidence suggests that lower SEP increases the likelihood of suicide/attempted suicide in LAMIC in South and South East Asia. However, the findings are severely limited by study quality; larger better quality studies are therefore needed.

AB Background WHO estimates that about 170 000 deaths by suicide occur in India every year, but few epidemiological studies of suicide have been done in the country. We aimed to quantify suicide mortality in India in 2010.
   Methods The Registrar General of India implemented a nationally representative mortality survey to determine the cause of deaths occurring between 2001 and 2003 in 1.1 million homes in 6671 small areas chosen randomly from all parts of India. As part of this survey, fieldworkers obtained information about cause of death and risk factors for suicide from close associates or relatives of the deceased individual. Two of 140 trained physicians were randomly allocated (stratified only by their ability to read the local language in which each survey was done) to independently and anonymously assign a cause to each death on the basis of electronic field reports. We then applied the age-specific and sex-specific proportion of suicide deaths in this survey to the 2010 UN estimates of absolute numbers of deaths in India to estimate the number of suicide deaths in India in 2010.
   Findings About 3% of the surveyed deaths (2684 of 95 335) in individuals aged 15 years or older were due to suicide, corresponding to about 187 000 suicide deaths in India in 2010 at these ages (115 000 men and 72 000 women; age-standardised rates per 100 000 people aged 15 years or older of 26.3 for men and 17.5 for women). For suicide deaths at ages 15 years or older, 40% of suicide deaths in men (45 100 of 114 800) and 56% of suicide deaths in women (40 500 of 72 100) occurred at ages 15-29 years. A 15-year-old individual in India had a cumulative risk of about 1.3% of dying before the age of 80 years by suicide; men had a higher risk (1.7%) than did women (1.0%), with especially high risks in south India (3.5% in men and 1.8% in women). About half of suicide deaths were due to poisoning (mainly ingestions of pesticides).
   Interpretation Suicide death rates in India are among the highest in the world. A large proportion of adult suicide deaths occur between the ages of 15 years and 29 years, especially in women. Public health interventions such as restrictions in access to pesticides might prevent many suicide deaths in India.

   Methods: We investigated the association of SEP with attempted suicide in a cross-sectional survey of 165 233 Sri Lankans. SEP data were collected at the household (assets, social standing (highest occupation of a household member), foreign employment and young (<= 40 years) female-headed households) and individual level (education and occupation). Respondent-reported data on suicide attempts in the past year were recorded. Random-effects logistic regression models, accounting for clustering, were used to investigate the association of SEP with attempted suicide.
   Results: Households reported 398 attempted suicides in the preceding year (239 per 100 000). Fewer assets (OR 3.2, 95% CI 2.4 to 4.4) and having a daily wage labourer (ie, insecure/low-income job; OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.6 to 3.2) as the highest occupation increased the risk of an attempted suicide within households. At an individual level, daily wage labourers were at an increased risk of attempted suicide compared with farmers. The strongest associations were with low levels of education (OR 4.6, 95% CI 2.5 to 8.4), with a stronger association in men than women.
   Conclusions: We found that indicators of lower SEP are associated with increased risk of attempted suicide in rural Sri Lanka. Longitudinal studies with objective measures of suicide attempts are needed to confirm this association.

AB Aim. The aim of this study was to evaluate the interview version of the screening of risk for suicide with redefined items for the hospitalised patients. Background. Patients hospitalised in general hospitals with physical illnesses performed suicidal acts more rapidly after admission. Design. A two-hour screening skills training course was provided to general nurses caring for hospitalised patients. The patients were rated by trained nurses according to the screening of risk for suicide. Then, patients did self-rating of repulsion of life scale and symptom distress. The participants were 54 trained nurses and 205 patients, 76 of whom had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 129 had lung cancer. Methods. The trained nurses used the screening of risk for suicide to screen patients and compared their results with their trainers within 24 hours for inter-rater consistency, followed by patients' self-rating. Results. The inter-rater reliability between nurses and their trainers was 0 85. The screening of risk for suicide rated by nurses correlated significantly with repulsion to life and symptom distress rated by patients. There were 26 3% ( 20) of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 14 0% ( 18) of patients with lung cancer who showed moderate-to-high suicide risk, most of them having poor social support. The nurse's score on patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was higher than patient's self-rating. Conclusions. The screening of risk for suicide was useful in alerting the general nurses to high-risk patients and the nurse' screening collected more in-depth data than patients' self-rating. It is suggested that this suicide risk-screening training should incorporate into continuing education in general hospital and the use of Screening of Risk for Suicide incorporating into new patient nursing assessment. Relevance to clinical practice. The two-hour suicide risk-screening training could renew the general nurse skill of risk screening for the hospitalised patients.

AB Background: There is a critical need for empirical data concerning the association of personality traits and attempted suicide with and without psychiatric disorders in mainland China. The objective of the present study is to provide such data by determining the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and analyzing the levels of impulsivity and neuroticism among people who have attempted suicide, and to examine the association between these personality traits and suicide attempt in people with or without psychiatric disorders.
   Methods: We administered self-reported tests and clinical interviews to 196 people who have attempted suicide who were admitted to a hospital emergency room or our psychiatric settings after a suicide attempt.
   Results: One hundred and fifty-six subjects (79.6%) met the criteria for Axis I disorders and eleven (6.6%) met the criteria Axis II personality disorders. Those who have attempted suicide who did not have psychiatric disorders exhibited a greater degree of background characteristics (e.g., high lethality, more interpersonal conflicts and more alcohol use), lower levels of suicidality (suicide risk, depressive symptoms) and differences of personality traits (e.g., more impulsive and less neuroticism) as compared to those who do have psychiatric disorders. Profile differences existed even after control for the stressful life event.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that some personality traits differ between people who have attempted suicide depending on whether or not they have psychiatric disorders. Based on these findings, investigating the impact of personality traits on suicidal behavior in therapeutic settings would provide critical data to improve patient treatment and outcomes.

AB Objective: To determine which sleep variables, including sleep duration, sleep quality, insomnia symptoms, and nightmares, were significantly and independently associated with subsequent adolescent suicidal behavior and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI).
   Methods: A prospective longitudinal study was conducted in Shandong, China. Participants were 7,072 adolescents initially assessed in November and December in 2015 and reassessed 1 year later in 2016. Self-administered structured questionnaires were used to assess suicidal behavior, NSSI, night sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, sleep quality, nightmares, impulsivity, depression, and family demographics. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the associations between sleep variables and suicidal behavior and NSSI.
   Results: At 1-year follow-up, 190 participants (2.7%) attempted suicide and 621 (8.8%) engaged in NSSI. Insomnia symptoms and frequent nightmares (several times a month) at baseline were significantly associated with subsequent suicide attempt and NSSI 1 year later. After adjustment for covariates including adolescent and family demographics, depression, impulsiveness, and prior suicide attempt/NSSI, frequent nightmares in the past year remained significant for suicide attempt (OR =1.96; 95% CI, 1.15-3.33) and NSSI (OR =1.52; 95% CI, 1.10-2.08). With further adjustment for insomnia symptoms, sleep quality, and sleep duration, the associations between frequent nightmares and subsequent suicide attempt and NSSI had almost no change. Insomnia, short sleep duration, and poor sleep quality were not independently associated with subsequent suicide attempt and NSSI.
   Conclusions: Frequent nightmares were independently associated with subsequent suicide attempt and NSSI among adolescents. Assessing and intervening for nightmares may have important implications for early identification of adolescents at risk and prevention of adolescent self-harm and suicide.

AB Background: Suicide is a major global mental health problem among college students. The aim of the current study was to explore the association between the psychological strains of the strain theory of suicide and suicidal behaviors among college students.
   Methods: Participants comprised 1912 college students (16-28 years old, 47.2% female) from three universities in Jilin Province, China, who completed the self-report assessments of psychological strains (40 items Psychological Strains Scale) and suicidal behaviors (Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised). The demographic characteristics included four variables: health status, psychological status, academic status and economic status.
   Results: Approximately 15.0% (286/1912) of participants were classified as having suicide risk, based on the cut-off scores of the SBQ-R. The prevalence of suicidal behaviors among males and females was 11.9% (120/ 1009) and 18.4% (166/903), respectively. Value strain (OR = 1.075, 95%CI: 1.057-1.094), aspiration strain (OR = 1.082, 95%CI: 1.064-1.101), deprivation strain (OR = 1.073, 95%CI: 1.052-1.093), and coping strain (OR = 1.095, 95%CI: 1.075-1.116) were risk factors for suicidality in college students. Coping strain (OR = 1.050, 95%CI: 1.023-1.077) was still positively associated with suicide risk in multivariate logistic regression. Logistic regression analysis indicated that coping strain had the highest correlation with suicidal behaviors.
   Limitations: The directionality of the relationships cannot be deduced because this study is cross-sectional.
   Conclusion: This study confirms a strong association between psychological strains and suicidal behaviors in college students. Some measures can be taken to reduce psychological strains to mitigate suicide risk among college students. More studies investigating coping strain among college students are warranted.

AB Background There is little investigation on the interaction effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and social support on non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in community adolescent populations, or gender differences in these effects. Aims To examine the individual and interaction effects of ACEs and social support on NSSI, suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in adolescents, and explore gender differences. Method A school-based health survey was conducted in three provinces in China between 2013-2014. A total of 14 820 students aged 10-20 years completed standard questionnaires, to record details of ACEs, social support, NSSI, suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Results Of included participants, 89.4% reported one or more category of ACEs. The 12-month prevalence of NSSI, suicidal ideation and suicide attempt was 26.1%, 17.5% and 4.4%, respectively; all were significantly associated with increased ACEs and lower social support. The multiple adjusted odds ratio of NSSI in low versus high social support was 2.27 (95% CI 1.85-2.67) for girls and 1.81 (95% CI 1.53-2.14) for boys, and their ratio (Ratio of two odds ratios, ROR) was 1.25 (P = 0.037). Girls with high ACEs scores (5-6) and moderate or low social support also had a higher risk of suicide attempt than boys (RORs: 2.34, 1.84 and 2.02, respectively; all P < 0.05). Conclusions ACEs and low social support are associated with increased risk of NSSI and suicidality in Chinese adolescents. Strategies to improve social support, particularly among female adolescents with a high number of ACEs, should be an integral component of targeted mental health interventions. Declaration of interest None.

AB Objective: To document the characteristics of self-poisoning suicide attempters who were brought to the University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI) Emergency Room and to outline the type of drug used in the attempt.
   Method: This was a retrospective study conducted over the period 2005-2009. Data were gathered from patients' case records, log books and the hospital records using a questionnaire developed for this study The questionnaire examined demographics, parameters of the drug ingested, patient's disposition, and reasons for attempt, final outcome and the type of discharge of patients who reported to the UHWI Emergency Room due to a suicide attempt by self-poisoning.
   Results: Over the five-year period, 127 cases of suicide attempt by self-poisoning were reported. Significantly more females than males presented to the hospital due to self-poisoning (3:1, chi(2) = 33.37; p < 0.001). Of this amount, 96 cases (75.6%) were females and 31(24.4%) were males. The age group most recorded was 16-30 years (70.8%). The most common reason for the suicide attempt was an interpersonal conflict (52%). The drug category most often used in self-poisoning was analgesics (52%) with acetaminophens being the most common (26.2%).
   Conclusion: These findings are consistent with global suicide trends and indicate an urgent need to develop and implement national preventative and treatment measures for groups known to be at risk of suicidal attempts.

AB Background: There are few studies on trends in injury death rates in China during the recent decades of tremendous change in this society. This paper examined trends in injury mortality rates among women aged 15 years or older in Macheng City from 1984-2008.
   Methods: Data on injury deaths in women from 1984 to 2008 were obtained from the Death Registry System in Macheng City. Injuries were classified using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 9th and 10th editions.
   Results: The average overall injury death rate of women aged 15 or older was 87.6/100,000 in Macheng City from 1984-2008. Injuries were the leading cause of death for women aged 15-44 and the fourth cause of death for all women during this period. The all-cause injury mortality rate decreased from 149.01 per 100,000 population in 1984 to 32.90 per 100,000 population in 2008 for women. Road traffic injury (RTI) was the only injury for which the mortality rate increased dramatically from 1984 (1.35 per 100,000) to 2008 (4.63 per 100,000). For all age groups, suicide was the leading cause of injury death. For women aged 15 to 64, RTI and drowning were the second and third leading causes of injury deaths, respectively.
   Conclusions: The injury mortality rate for women aged 15 years or older decreased by 77.92% from 1984-2008. In contrast, RTI deaths increased sharply in the 2000s compared with the 1980s. Although the suicide rate decreased dramatically, it was still the leading cause of injury death for women. Research is needed to identify risk factors contributing to the increase in RTI and decrease in suicides.

AB The majority of studies on risk factors for suicide have been conducted in developed countries, and less work has been done to systematically profile risk factors in developing countries. The current paper presents a selective review of sociodemographic, clinical, and environmental/situational risk factors in developing countries. Taken together, the evidence suggests that the profiles of risk factors in developing countries demonstrate some differences from those in developed countries. In some developing countries, at least, being female, living in a rural area, and holding religious beliefs that sanction suicide may be of more relevance to suicide risk than these factors are in developed countries. Conversely, being single or having a history of mental illness may be of less relevance. Risk factors that appear to be universal include youth or old age, low socioeconomic standing, substance use, and previous suicide attempts. Recent stressful life events play a role in both developing and developed countries, although their nature may differ (e.g., social change may have more of an influence in the former). Likewise, access to means heightens risk in both, but the specific means may vary (e.g., access to pesticides is of more relevance in developing countries). These findings have clear implications for suicide prevention, suggesting that preventive efforts that have shown promise in developed countries may need to be tailored differently to address the risk factor profile of developing countries.

SO JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION
LA English
DT Article
ID COMMUNITY MEDIATION; SOUTH-KOREA
AB It is commonly assumed that conflicts in China and other Asian countries that share its cultural heritage are resolved through mediation rather than adjudication or appeals to political institutions. Archival sources in China and interviews with urban and rural officials reveal that the preference for mediation in China and other Asian and even Western societies is largely correlated with region, class, and gender and therefore does not constitute a national pattern. Historical (19th century and Maoist China) and more contemporary evidence reveals that mediation-to the extent that it was actually performed at the grassroots level-was but one method of resolving problems in China. Other methods included interpersonal violence, collective action, and even feigned suicide. A disaggregated perspective on conflict resolution is a more accurate representation of China as it deepens market reforms and a more powerful way to predict China's capacity to manage the conflicts that follow such reforms.

AB In this article, we will discuss the question of self-cremation by monks in Japan, a phenomenon that was similar to that found in China in some respects but also quite different. The Japanese state began trying to modernize its administration and its mode of governance in the middle of the seventh century, and some laws were issued prohibiting Buddhist monks from using fire for self-immolation. However, there is no source to show that Japan experienced a wave of suicides similar to that of China in the fifth and sixth centuries. It was not until the second half of the Heian period (794-1185) that we can observe a phenomenon of urbanization and of the spectacularization of these suicides by fire, which became an important phenomenon of social and religious life, frequently associated with the feast of the Dead, uranbon (sic), on the fifteenth day of the seventh month.

AB Injuries are a growing public health concern in China, accounting for more than 30% of all Person Years of Life Lost (PYLL) due to premature mortality. This study analyzes the trend and disease burden of injury deaths in Chinese population from 2004 to 2010, using data from the National Disease Surveillance Points (DSPs) system, as injury deaths are classified based on the International Classification of Disease-10th Revision (ICD-10). We observed that injury death accounted for nearly 10% of all deaths in China throughout the period 2004-2010, and the injury mortality rates were higher in males than those in females, and higher in rural areas than in urban areas. Traffic crashes (33.79-38.47% of all injury deaths) and suicides (16.20-22.01%) were the two leading causes of injury deaths. Alarmingly, suicide surpassed traffic crashes as the leading cause of injury mortality in rural females, yet adults aged 65 and older suffered the greatest number of fatal falls (20,701 deaths, 2004-2010). The burden of injury among men (72.11%) was about three times more than that of women's (28.89%). This study provides indispensible evidence that China Authority needs to improve the surveillance and deterrence of three major types of injuries: Traffic-related injury deaths should be targeted for injury prevention activities in all population, people aged 65+ should be encouraged to take individual fall precautions, and prevention of suicidal behavior in rural females should be another key priority for the government of China.

AB Purpose: To evaluate the prevalence, suicidality and treatment gap (TG) of depression in people with epilepsy (PWE) in West China, and to explore the related risk factors.
   Methods: A consecutive cohort of PWE from West China Hospital was recruited. The Chinese version of the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy scale was used to assess depression and suicidality. Prevalence and TG of depression were calculated. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess risk factors of depression and suicidality.
   Results: Among a total of 461 participants, there were 29.9% with depression and 15.8% had suicidality. Being female, an unmarried status, disease course, seizure frequency, seizure occurrence in the last 6 months, and focal impaired awareness seizure were risk factors for depression. Depression was an independent risk factor for suicidality. The TG of depression was 72.5%. The TG was larger in the 30-40 year age group, in rural populations, and among those with a disease course between 5 and 10 years. The TG figures dropped with increasing annual family income.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of depression and the rate of suicide risk for PWE in West China are high. A large TG for depression exists in PWE. Clinicians should focus on depression and suicidality for PWE and identify the related risk factors in a timely manner so as to reduce the incidence of depression and suicide. Management including public education as well as professional training of neurologists are necessary to fill the TG.

AB Purpose: The relationship was investigated between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentrations, a BDNF polymorphism (196G>A), and the response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) among Chinese patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).
   Patients and methods: A total of 125 patients and 91 healthy controls were enrolled. The disease progression and treatment responses were evaluated using the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD24), the Hamilton anxiety scale, the Beck depression index, and BDNF concentrations at the baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after treatment. Responders were defined as patients with at least a 50% decrease in the HAMD24.
   Results: The BDNF concentrations were significantly lower in MDD (947 +/- 297 vs 1187 +/- 236 pg/mL, p=0.019), in MDD with attempted suicide than those without (779 +/- 231 vs 993 +/- 298, p=0.024) at the baseline. The BDNF concentrations remarkably increased in response to SSRI treatment Significant correlations were noted between the BDNF concentrations and suicide ideation or attempted suicide (p<0.01), but not with HAMD24 or depression. BDNF 196G>A correlated with neither suicide ideation nor treatment responses.
   Conclusion: BDNF concentrations were significantly lower in patients with attempted suicide/ideation. BDNF concentrations could serve as a response marker for antidepressant treatment in MDD.

AB Suicide is a major public health concern worldwide. This study aimed to predict the suicidal behavior of Chinese university students by studying psychological measures such as hopelessness, orientation to happiness, meaning in life, depression, anxiety, stress, and coping styles. In November 2016, a stratified-clustered-random sampling approach was utilized to select subjects from two large public medical-related universities in Shandong province, China. This sample consisted of 2,074 undergraduate students (706 males, 1,368 females; mean age = 19.79 +/- 1.39 years). The students' major risk factors for suicide were depression, anxiety, stress, and hopelessness, and the students' minor risk factors included orientation to happiness and coping styles (including self-distraction, self-blame and substance use). Notably, the presence of meaning in life had a positive effect on preventing suicide and acted as a protective factor, which suggests that it is important to identify risk factors as well as protective factors relevant to the target population group in order to increase the effectiveness of counseling and suicide prevention programs.

AB Background: The Strain Theory of Suicide has been tested and well supported regarding rural people who show risk of suicide. Studies on the impact of psychological strains on psychopathologies and suicidality in urban environments in China have been lacking.
   Aims: This study was designed to further examine the associations between psychological strains, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation in two separate urban samples of adults in China.
   Methods: One sample consisted of randomly selected medical employees of a large hospital (n = 1012), and a second sample included heterogeneous office employees (n = 1052). A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect demographics, psychological strains, social support, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation.
   Results: Depressive symptoms were associated with longer work hours, less social support, value strain, aspiration strain and coping strain among medical staff, and were linked to longer work hours, less social support, aspiration strain and coping strain among non-medical staff. Suicide ideation was associated with longer work hours, coping strain, and depression among medical staff, and was linked to longer work hours, gender, religion, value strain and depression among non-medical staff.
   Conclusions: Both depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation were associated with psychological strains among Chinese urban professionals. Reduction of psychological strain is necessary to help maintain proper mental health and to ensure optimal performance at work.

AB Objective: This study was to explore the relation between psychological strains and suicidal ideation among Chinese and American college students. Another secondary purpose of the study was to examine the reliability of the psychological strains scales (PPS: Ref) one more time in China and the United States in college populations.
   Method: Samples of college students were randomly recruited from China and United States. All of 529 college students (aged 17-27, 68.9% female) completed self-report assessments of psychological strains (Psychological Strain Scale), suicidal ideation (Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation), and indicators of psychological well-being (e.g., depression, anxiety, and stress).
   Results: Empirical results show that Psychological Strain Scales (PSS) has a good reliability. Chinese college students reported higher suicide ideation scores than American students whereas there was no statistical difference in psychological strains. Psychological strains and, depression, anxiety, and stress, were positively related to suicidal ideation in both countries. Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that psychological strain can significantly predict suicidal ideation.
   Conclusions: These findings provide support for the Strain Theory of Suicide for both Chinese and American college students and some measures can be taken to reduce psychological strains in students. However, future work could extend these findings by utilizing a longitudinal design to determine whether psychological strains are in fact antecedents, and not simply correlates, of suicide ideation.

AB Cancer patients are at high risk for suicide, particularly when they are informed about the cancer diagnosis or hospitalized for cancer treatment. Therefore, oncology healthcare settings such as large general hospitals in China, may represent an ideal setting to identify and treat suicidality in cancer patients. However, the clinical epidemiology of suicidality of Chinese cancer patients remains largely unknown. This study examined the prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation among Chinese cancer inpatients of large general hospitals. A total of 517 cancer inpatients were consecutively recruited from two tertiary general hospitals of a metropolitan city in northern China, and administered with standardized questionnaires to collect data on sociodemographics, mental health, and cancer-related clinical characteristics. Suicidal ideation and mental health were measured with a single self-report question "In the past month, did you think about ending your life?" and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, respectively. The one-month prevalence of suicidal ideation was 15.3% in Chinese cancer inpatients. In multivariable Logistic regression, depression, anxiety, moderate-to-severe pain, metastatic cancer, poor performance status, surgery, and palliative care were significantly associated with suicidal ideation. Cancer inpatients of large Chinese general hospitals have high prevalence of suicidal ideation and therefore potentially at high risk for suicide. Suicide prevention efforts for cancer inpatients should include periodic evaluation of suicidality, effective pain management, psychooncological supports, and, when necessary, psychiatric treatment and crisis intervention.

AB Foxconn, the biggest electrical manufacturing service provider in global consumer electronics, tries to change after employees' suicide accidents in China. The change mostly goes toward the recovery of employees' interest. As of May 2013 Foxconn has successfully completed the remedial tasks that recommended by FLA. Accordingly this study considered such a change as a restoration process for employees' benefit that had been infringed by other stakeholders, customer and local government. In addition there had been a recognition gap between Foxconn and third-party evaluators regarding corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities of Foxconn, so this study clarified it through FLA investigation report and GRI guideline version 3.1. As a result it turned out that CSR type of Foxconn rarely go beyond the responsive CSR range although it has improved the working conditions after FLA investigation.

AB Little is known about the differences in mortality among non-institutionalized geriatric and younger patients with schizophrenia. In this study long-term mortality and suicidal behavior of all the geriatric (age >= 65 years), middle-age (age 41-64 years), and young (age 15-40 years) subjects with schizophrenia living in a Chinese rural community were compared. A 10 year follow-up investigation among a 1994 cohort (n = 5 10) of patients with schizophrenia was conducted in Xinjin County, Chengdu, China. Compared with young subjects, geriatric subjects with schizophrenia were more likely to be female, have more previous physical illness, never accepted treatment, and practice religious (p <= 0.01). There were no significant differences of suicide attempts among the three groups. Young subjects had a higher rate of suicide (1,033.8 per 100,000 person-years), and geriatric subjects had a higher rate of deaths due to other causes (accident and natural causes) (4,314.2 per 100,000 person-years). Standardized mortality ratios for both suicide and deaths due to other causes were highest in young subjects and the lowest in geriatric subjects. Patients with schizophrenia in all age groups had a marked increase in mortality and suicide. Specific intervention strategies for decreasing mortality and suicide should be developed for patients with schizophrenia in different age groups.

AB Excess weight status may increase the risk of suicidality among sexual minority females, but few studies have examined this suicidality disparity in sexual minority males. This study examined the association between sexual minority status and suicide attempts in Chinese male adolescents and tested whether body mass index (BMI) had a moderating effect on that association. Data were collected from 7th to 12th graders from seven randomly selected provinces of China in the 2015 School-Based Chinese Adolescents Health Survey. In total, 72,409 male students completed the questionnaires regarding sexual attraction, self-reported weight and height, and suicide attempts. After adjustment for covariates, sexual minority status was associated with suicide attempts among male students (AOR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.57-1.93). Stratification analyses showed that BMI category moderated this association; compared with the results before stratification analyses, sexual minority males who were obese had increased risk of suicide attempts (AOR = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.09-4.24), sexual minority males who were overweight had reduced odds of suicide attempts (AOR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.01-1.92), and no significant association change was found in sexual minority males who were underweight (AOR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.43-2.33). Our study indicated that BMI moderated the risk of suicide attempts in sexual minority males. Suicide prevention targeting sexual minority males should be focused on weight status disparity and the creation of a positive climate to reduce minority stressors due to body image.

TI Characteristics of attempted suicides seen in emergency-care settings of
   general hospitals in eight low- and middle-income countries
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE

AB Background. The objective was to describe patients presenting themselves at emergency-care settings following a suicide attempt in eight culturally different sites [Campinas (Brazil), Chennai (India), Colombo (Sri Lanka), Durban (South Africa), Hanoi (Viet Nam), Karaj (Iran), Tallinn (Estonia), and Yuncheng, (China)].
   Method. Subjects seen for suicide attempts, as identified by the medical staff in the emergency units of 18 collaborating hospitals were asked to participate in a 45-minute structured interview administered by trained health personnel after the patient was medically stable.
   Results. Self-poisoning was the main method of attempting suicide in all eight sites. Self-poisoning by pesticides played a particularly important role in Yuncheng (71(.)6% females, 61(.)5% males), in Colombo (43(.)2% males, 19(.)6% females), and in Chennai (33(.)8% males, 23(.)8% females). The suicide attempt resulted in danger to life in the majority or patients in Yuncheng and in Chennai (over 65%). In four of the eight sites less than one-third of subjects received any type of referral for follow-up evaluation or care.
   Conclusions. Action for the prevention of suicide attempts can be started immediately in the sites investigated by addressing the one most important method of attempted suicide, namely self-poisoning. Regulations for the access to drugs, medicaments, pesticides, and other toxic substances need to be improved and revised regulations must be implemented by integrating the efforts of different sectors, such as health, agriculture, education, and justice. The care of patients who attempt suicide needs to include routine psychiatric and psychosocial assessment and systematic referral to professional services after discharge.

AB Background: People living with HIV and depression have high rates of suicide. Studies of mobile health (mHealth) interventions have shown feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy in improving mental health in people living with HIV and depression. However, few studies have examined the mechanisms and effects of mHealth interventions on suicide.
   Objective: This study was designed to examine the mechanisms and effects of a WeChat-based intervention, Run4Love, on suicide among people living with HIV and depression in China, while considering perceived stress and depressive symptoms as mediators.
   Methods: A sample of 300 People living with HIV and depression was recruited from the outpatient clinic of a large HIV or AIDS treatment hospital and was randomized to the Run4Love group or a control group. Data were collected at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-ups. Path analysis modeling, with longitudinal data, was used in data analyses.
   Results: The Run4Love mHealth intervention had a direct effect on reducing suicide rate at the 6-month follow-up (beta=-.18, P=.02) and indirect effect through reducing perceived stress and depressive symptoms at the 3-month follow-up (beta=-.09, P=.001). A partial mediating effect between perceived stress and depressive symptoms accounted for 33% (-0.09/-0.27) of the total effect.
   Conclusions: Through path analyses, we understood the mechanisms and effects of an mHealth intervention on suicide prevention. The findings underscored the importance of stress reduction and depression treatment in such a program. We call for more effective suicide prevention, especially mHealth interventions targeting the vulnerable population of people living with HIV and depression.

AB PurposeIncreased frequency of suicide in rural areas of Tuscany has been described since the 1970s. A case-control study was conducted in 2014 and 2015. The objective of this study was to identify major individual risk factors related to suicides in six rural districts of Tuscany.MethodsCases were identified as all 128 suicides occurred in six rural districts between 2009 and 2013. Controls (three for each case) were matched for age, sex, and general practice. Information was collected from GPs using a structured questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to investigate the association between individual risk factors and suicide.ResultsInformants for 91 cases of the 128 identified cases were successfully interviewed (response rate 71.1%). About 40.5-65.9% suicide cases and 11.4-20.0% of controls had some psychiatric pathology, accordingly to different definitions. Univariate conditional regression analysis showed that living in isolated houses (OR 2.48), living alone (OR 2.97), not being married (OR 2.63), low income (OR 2.73), psychiatric pathology (OR 9.70), psychotropic medication (OR 5.58), problems with relatives (OR 14.78), psychiatric family history (OR 5.67), and suicidal ideation (OR 15.61) were all risk factors. Practising religion (OR0.27) was the only protective factor identified. Multivariate regression identified two independently and significantly associated variables namely, psychiatric pathology (OR 8.87) and living alone (OR 2.30).ConclusionsResults of this study showed, similarly to recent research, that not all suicide events are the results of psychiatric pathology. Prevention strategies should, therefore, target both socio-economic and clinical risk factors.

AB Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is very common in Southern China and Southeast Asian countries. To explore a novel and more effective approach to NPC therapy, a combined strategy of suicide genes and radiation was designed in this study. Five suicide gene expression cassettes, yeast CD, yeast CD/UPRT, and yeast CDglyTK gene controlled by CMV, and Egr-1 and a synthetic CMV-enhanced Egr-1 promoter (CE) were constructed in an expression vector p11MS. The expression of suicide genes in NPC CNE-2 cells were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. The cytotoxicity of suicide gene therapy and radiation were analyzed by MTT assay. An animal study in which yeast CD/UPRT-expressing CNE-2 tumors in nude mice were treated with 5-FC and radiation was also developed. Our results revealed that p11MSCEyCD/UPRT and p11MSCEyCDglyTK are superior over three other constructs in the killing of NPC cells in vitro. We combined suicide gene-expressing tumors, 5-FC treatment, and radiation in vivo and found that the tumors greatly regressed, some disappeared completely in 3 nude mice in the yCD/UPRT group, and a significant difference of tumor volumes was observed between this group and the other four groups (p < 0.05). Our results indicated that suicide gene therapy and radiation have a synergic effect on NPC therapy, and the combined strategy of radiogene therapy is of great potential as a substitute for the traditional method, radiation alone, in NPC therapies.

AB Objective: It is unclear whether clinical and behavioral suicide risk factors, identified primarily among men, can be extended to women. We therefore explored sex differences in psychopathology and personality variants among suicide completers.
   Method: Using the psychological autopsy method, we compared personality variants and the prevalence of psychopathology as a function of sex among 351 consecutive suicides in a large, urban community. Psychiatric diagnoses were obtained using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders, and measures of impulsive aggression, temperament, and character were administered. Subsequently, we carried out secondary analyses between male and female suicides matched 2:1 for age, current depression, and number of lifetime depressive episodes. The study was conducted from late 2000 to 2005.
   Results: Females were less likely to meet criteria for current and lifetime alcohol abuse, but those who did were less likely than males to have concurrent depression. On average, females were less impulsive, yet similar proportions of males and females were highly impulsive and impulsivity was associated with alcohol abuse irrespective of gender. Females were more likely to meet criteria for lifetime anxiety disorders; these were associated with nonviolent suicide methods, irrespective of gender.
   Conclusions: Despite a lower prevalence among females, high levels of impulsivity and alcohol abuse appear to be valid risk factors for both sexes. Researchers should focus on females for the identification of other suicide mediators.

AB The nature of rurality varies considerably across the world, and there is no single pattern of suicide in rural areas. However, some common themes are evident from countries as diverse as India, the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and China. Suicide rates tend to be higher in rural populations compared with urban, with relatively higher female rates in some areas. North American and Australian data suggest that indigenous people may be at particularly high risk. Specific rural occupations, such as farming, often seem to be associated with higher risk. Although mental illness plays an important role in suicide in rural areas, as it does elsewhere, it is unclear whether higher rural suicide rates are linked to a correspondingly higher prevalence of mental illness in such populations. Instead, other factors may be important including: adverse socio-economic conditions; higher rates of alcohol or substance misuse; greater access to potentially lethal methods, such as pesticides or firearms; cultural attitudes which promote independence and discourage help-seeking behaviour; poor access to services providing help at times of psychological crisis; and cultural discontinuity in traditional societies. Not all factors apply in all areas, hence, the literature on rural suicide prevention initiatives varies considerably. Strategies have involved: the restriction of access to lethal methods; improving attitudes to, and knowledge of, mental illness in high-risk populations; improving the accessibility of conventional mental health services; making the use of such supports more culturally acceptable; and the development of context-specific supports, such as programmes addressing specific cultural issues.

AB When parents die of or are infected with HIV, children might have to leave their own household and be displaced to other living arrangements and some may even be displaced multiple times. The objective of this study is to examine the association between household displacement and health risk behaviors among AIDS orphans (children who have lost one or both of their parents to HIV/AIDS) and vulnerable children (children living with HIV-infected parents) in rural China.
   The sample consisted of 1015 children (549 AIDS orphans, 466 vulnerable children) in family-based care. The children were assigned to three displacement groups according to the number of household displacement (i.e., none, once, at least twice) after their parents became ill or died of HIV/AIDS. Cigarette smoking, alcohol use, violence, public property destruction, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt were used to assess the health risk behaviors of these children. Both bivariate and multivariate tests were used to assess the differences in health risk behaviors among displacement groups.
   The findings indicated that children who were displaced at least twice were more likely to report a higher frequency of public property destruction and suicide ideation than those who were never displaced or displaced once. Multivariate analysis revealed that public property destruction, suicide ideation and suicide attempt were significantly associated with the household displacement among these children, controlling for gender, age, child status (AIDS orphans vs. vulnerable children), and the duration of household displacement.
   Results in the current study suggest that a stable living environment was important for both AIDS orphans and vulnerable children in communities with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. The government, community, and other agencies need to make efforts to avoid frequent household displacement among these children after the HIV-related infection or death of their parents.

AB This study determines the socio-demographic and clinical correlates of suicide attempts in Chinese schizophrenia outpatients and their impact on patients' quality of life (QOL). Two hundred and fifty-five clinically stable schizophrenia outpatients were randomly selected in Hong Kong (HK) and their counterparts matched according to sex, age, age at onset and length of illness were recruited in Beijing (BJ). All subjects at both sites were interviewed by the same investigator using standardized assessment instruments. Basic socio-demographic and clinical data and history of suicide attempts were collected. The lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts was 26.7% in the whole sample and 20% and 33.6% in the HK and BJ samples, respectively. Patients with a history of suicide attempts were less likely to receive depot antipsychotic (AP) medication, more likely to receive clozapine, benzodiazepines (BZD) and higher doses of APs; were younger at onset, had more hospitalizations; had more severe positive, depressive, anxiety and extrapyramidal (EPS) symptoms; were poorer QOL in the physical, psychological, social and environmental domains; and were more likely to be BJ residents. In multiple logistic regression analysis, early age at onset, poor physical QOL, use of clozapine and BZDs, and study site (HK vs BJ) were significant contributors to lifetime suicide attempts. Significant difference was found between matched samples in HK and BJ with respect to suicide attempts. HK is a cosmopolitan city with a Western social structure and mental health system, whereas in BJ more traditional Chinese cultural values predominate, with a mental health policy radically different from that of HK. These differences suggest that socio-cultural factors play a significant role in determining suicide attempts in schizophrenia. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Joiner's Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which states that an individual will desire death when they perceive themselves to be a burden to others, and experience social isolation, has received much support, but has not been directly assessed in non-Eurocentric individuals.
   Methods: Joiner's Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (measuring both perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness) and measures of depression, hopelessness, gender, relationship status and region of residence were evaluated as risk factors for suicidality after controlling for response biases. Participants were 273 undergraduate university students of Chinese ethnicity between the ages of 17 and 23 years in Macao.
   Results: The predictors in sum distinguished between the presence and absence of suicidality ((2) = 62.759, p < .01). Perceived burdensomeness (p < .01) and relationship status (p < .01) made significant contributions to the presence of suicidality. Low internal consistency prevented thwarted belongingness from being assessed as a risk factor.
   Conclusions: Interpersonal variables may account for the seemingly disparate risk factors for suicide.

AB The success of screening for individuals at suicidal risk among the general population relies heavily on the availability of a reliable and validated instrument. However, there remains a lack of a well-validated screening tool for suicidal risk in Chinese, despite the fact that about a quarter of the world's suicides takes place in China. In view of the severity of the suicide problem among the Chinese population, there is a crucial need to develop robust screening tools locally. This study investigates the psychometric properties related to the Chinese version of the Adult Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (ASIQ) with a 2-wave, population-based panel study in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China. Two-thousand sixteen Chinese people were interviewed for their suicidality, psychological well-being, and ASIQ scores. The Chinese ASIQ was shown to have strong internal reliability, convergent validity, and factorial validity. This study also demonstrated its predictive validity by examining sensitivity and specificity in identifying subsequent suicidality. A 4-item short version of ASIQ was also developed.

AB Wang Zheng was a Chinese official interested in machine design from a young age. In the 1620s, he became familiar with European missionaries and the knowledge they brought to China. Together with Johannes Schreck Terrenz (1576-1630), a German Jesuit missionary, he compiled Yuanxi Qiqi Tushuo Luzui (A Record of the Best Illustrations and Descriptions of Extraordinary Devices of the Far West) to introduce European mechanics and machines to China. This remained the most authoritative book on mechanics and machine design in China until the 1860s. Wang Zheng published two further books on machine design and constructed several devices himself. In 1644, he committed suicide because of the fall of the Ming Dynasty.

AB This study examines whether abusive supervision is related to suicide ideation and whether the need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness mediates this relationship. We use a diverse sample (N=687) from six Chinese organizations. Abusive supervision was significantly related to suicidal ideation and satisfaction of the needs for competence and relatedness, but not for autonomy, partially mediated this relationship. Findings suggest that organizations that initiate intervention strategies to limit the adverse consequences of abusive supervision thereby help protect subordinates from suicidal ideation.

AB In this article, I employ the concept of 'unintended consequence' for my, analysis of an elderly woman's suicide in China. The larger socio-political Context of the narrative that will follow is the building of the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River. As the largest hydropower project ever built in tile world, this dam entailed the involuntary resettlement of more than 1 million people, mostly rural residents living along the river's middle reaches. The thrust of my analysis is to demonstrate that analyses of state power and modernization processes need to pay more attention to the question of how individuals deal with drastic social change and how they conduct their interpersonal relation-ships in ways that lead to unintended consequences. Such consequences are far more complicated than social theories that lead its to view society-state relationships as one-dimensional configurations would allow.

TI CONFUCIAN ETHIC OF DEATH WITH DIGNITY AND ITS CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE
SO APPLIED ETHICS: A MULTICULTURAL APPROACH, 6TH EDITION
LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
AB This paper advances three claims. First, according to contemporary Western advocates of physician-assisted-suicide and voluntary euthanasia, "death with dignity" is understood negatively as bringing about death to avoid or prevent indignity, that is, to avoid a degrading existence. Second, there is a similar morally affirmative view on death with dignity in ancient China, in classical Confucianism in particular. Third, there is consonance as well as dissonance between these two ethics of death with dignity, such that the Confucian perspective would regard the argument for physician-assisted-suicide and voluntary euthanasia as less than compelling because of the latter's impoverished vision of human life.

AB Objective: The major cause of premature mortality in people with epilepsy (PWE) is suicide. Actual data on the risk of suicidal tendency in adult PWE in China are scarce. In our study, associations between possible risk factors and suicidal tendency in adult PWE in China were investigated.
   Methods: People with epilepsy (n = 251) were recruited, and their demographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated. Suicide risk was examined using the suicidality module (SM) of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) Plus Chinese Version 5.0.0.
   Results: Suicidal tendency was present in 36 (143%) of the 251 PWE. On the basis of the results of univariate analyses. family relationship (P < 0.001), age at epilepsy onset (P 0.037), seizure-free period (P = 0.041), seizures/ month (P 0.015), depressive disorders (P<0.001), and number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (P = 0.017) were associated with suicidal tendency. Multivariate analysis revealed that moderate or poor family relationships (odds ratio (OR): 6.468, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.418-17.300) and depressive disorders (OR: 3.548, 95% CI: 1.575-7.995) were associated with high odds of suicidal tendency.
   Conclusion: Suicidal tendency is common among adult PWE. This study reveals that family relationships and depressive disorders are independent risk factors for suicidal tendency among adult PWE. Therefore, while maintaining treatment of epilepsy, more attention should be directed to the social support and mental state of PWE to prevent suicide. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   Crude and age standardised rates from suicide mortality and years of life lost were compared across regions and countries, and by age, sex, and Sociodemographic index (a composite measure of fertility, income, and education).
   RESULTS
   The total number of deaths from suicide increased by 6.7% (95% uncertainty interval 0.4% to 15.6%) globally over the 27 year study period to 817 000 (762 000 to 884 000) deaths in 2016. However, the age standardised mortality rate for suicide decreased by 32.7% (27.2% to 36.6%) worldwide between 1990 and 2016, similar to the decline in the global age standardised mortality rate of 30.6%. Suicide was the leading cause of age standardised years of life lost in the Global Burden of Disease region of high income Asia Pacific and was among the top 10 leading causes in eastern Europe, central Europe, western Europe, central Asia, Australasia, southern Latin America, and high income North America. Rates for men were higher than for women across regions, countries, and age groups, except for the 15 to 19 age group. There was variation in the female to male ratio, with higher ratios at lower levels of Socio-demographic index. Women experienced greater decreases in mortality rates (49.0%, 95% uncertainty interval 42.6% to 54.6%) than men (23.8%, 15.6% to 32.7%).
   CONCLUSIONS
   Age standardised mortality rates for suicide have greatly reduced since 1990, but suicide remains an important contributor to mortality worldwide. Suicide mortality was variable across locations, between sexes, and between age groups. Suicide prevention strategies can be targeted towards vulnerable populations if they are informed by variations in mortality rates.

ID SUICIDE; RISK; METAANALYSIS; COMMUNITY; PREVALENCE; DEATH
AB Background Long-term mortality and the risk factors for premature death among patients with schizophrenia living in rural communities are unknown.
   Aims To explore the 10-year mortality and its risk factors among patients with schizophrenia.
   Method We used data from a 10-year prospective follow-up study (1994-2004) of mortality among people with schizophrenia, and death registration data for Xinjin County, Chengdu, China.
   Results The mortality rate was 2228 per 100 000 person-years during follow-up. Both all-cause mortality and suicide rates were significantly greater in male than in female patients. Age at illness onset (> 45 years), duration of illness (>= 10 years), age greater than 50 years, physical illness, inability to work, male gender, and never having received treatment were identified as independent predictors of increased mortality.
   Conclusions Higher mortality rates in male patients may contribute to the higher prevalence of schizophrenia in women compared with men in China. The findings of risk factors for mortality should be taken into account when developing interventions to improve outcomes among people with schizophrenia.

TI How many premature deaths from pesticide suicide have occurred since the

SO CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
LA English
DT Review
DE Pesticide poisoning; suicide; mortality; Green Revolution
ID POISONING DEATHS; CHINA; RATES; INDIA; MORTALITY; TRAGEDY; TRENDS;
   IMPACT
AB Introduction: The agricultural Green Revolution in the 1950s and 60s is thought to have averted many deaths from famine. However, it also introduced highly hazardous pesticides such as parathion and endrin into poor rural communities that were totally unequipped to store or use them safely. Pesticide self-poisoning rapidly became one of the two most common global means of suicide. Thus far, no attempt has been made to enumerate the total number of deaths that have occurred subsequent to the Green Revolution. Objective: To calculate plausible estimates for the total global number of pesticide suicides that have occurred since 1960. Methods: We performed a literature review on Medline and Embase databases to July 2019 to find papers that reported national or global numbers of pesticide suicides. We restricted our search to papers published in English. We used the search terms: pesticide) OR insecticide) OR paraquat) OR organophosphate) OR organophosphorus) OR agrochemical) AND suicide) OR "") OR deliberate) AND poison in all fields. These searches identified 2,144 papers; a further 8 citations were added through the searching of reference lists and our own paper collections. 2,136 papers were excluded as they contained no data on pesticide suicide, or were case reports, case series, or related to specific socio-demographic groups, or were non-human studies. This left 16 papers giving country specific or global pesticide suicide data. Long-term national trend in pesticide suicides: We found studies from one low- and middle-income country (Sri Lanka) that recorded long-term trends in suicide throughout the Green Revolution. These data showed a steady increase in suicides from 1960 to the early 1970s, with a more rapid increase from 1979 to 1984. The number of suicides plateaued until 1995, when they started a steady almost linear decrease that has continued at least until 2015. We used the Sri Lankan epidemiology as a model of the incidence of pesticide suicides in other low- and middle-income countries. Data from Bangladesh suggested that the decrease might have started in 2002. Estimating global numbers since 1960: Starting from a conservative estimate of zero deaths in 1960, the best estimate of the total global burden of pesticide suicides from 1960 to 2018 is 14,272,105 or 14,936,000 (depending on whether a fall in incidence began in 1995 or 2002), with a plausible range of 9,859,667 to 17,303,333 deaths. These are likely underestimates because suicide is illegal in many countries, and most pesticide suicides occur in poor rural areas without effective death registration systems. Conclusions: Pesticide self-poisoning has been a major clinical and public health problem in rural Asia for decades, while being long ignored. Most pesticide suicides are relatively impulsive with little planning: in the absence of highly hazardous pesticides, many people would have survived their suicidal impulse, gone on to find support amongst family, community, and health services, and lived a full life. Pesticide suicides must therefore be considered a category 4 occupation condition following Schilling's classification - if they had not been brought into rural communities for agricultural use, pesticide suicides would not have occurred. Preventing these deaths should be a global public health priority.

ID DEATHS; MORTALITY; SUICIDE
AB Background: Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is one of the most important intoxications in the modem world. This study aimed to identify the characteristics of CO poisoning deaths in Sichuan province in the west of China.
   Methods: Data on fatal non-fire-related carbon monoxide poisoning in Sichuan from 2008 to 2016 were obtained from the Department of Forensic Analytical Toxicology of Sichuan University and were analyzed by the month and year of registration of death, sex, age group, manner of death, source of CO, and location of CO exposure. Comparing with the previous studies carried out in Wuhan and Shanghai to identify the regional differences of CO poisoning in China.
   Results: A total of 165 non-fire related CO poisoning cases including 237 victims were recorded. Over 90% of the victims died from accidental poisoning. Non-fire related CO poisoning occurred more frequently in winter months and was most prevalent in individuals aged between 18 and 60 yr old. Showering gas accident and coal or charcoal burning was found to be the major source of CO in accident and in suicide cases, respectively. Furthermore, significant regional differences of CO poisoning have been detected in the manner of death and the source of CO.
   Conclusion: These findings will be valuable in the targeted prevention of non-fire related CO poisoning in China.

AB The goal was to assess rates of anxiety and depression in adolescents in two areas of Zhejiang Province, China. A cross-sectional survey was carried-out using a self-report questionnaire developed for this study. Participants were middle school students (age range 13-16 years) in an urban and a rural setting. There were 1576 completed questionnaires. Symptoms of anxiety sufficient to interfere with enjoyment of life, relaxation, and sleep were common (48%, 40%, and 27%, respectively). School-related problems were the predominant sources of worry. One third reported a history of depression, 16% had at times felt life was not worth living, and 9% reported that they had attempted suicide. Girls were more likely to report symptoms of depression. Patterns of help-seeking showed reliance on friends and parents; only 1% had sought professional help. There were no significant differences in anxiety and depression between one-child and multisibling families.

   War; Qing Dynasty; bushido; surrender
AB What can be learned from the now largely forgotten first Sino-Japanese War (1894-95) about concepts like the heroism of surrender? I show that Japanese depictions, far from being universally contemptuous, treated their main opponent, the commander of the Chinese Beiyang fleet, Admiral Ding Buchan& with great respect before, during, and even after the war despite his surrender. Why? I use accounts by observers and Ding's own letters to scrutinize the enduring popularity of his posthumous image in Japan versus China. I argue that Ding showed neither strategic brilliance nor formidability as an opponent. This means he does not fit the "nobility of failure" concept, remaining an anomalous outlier for provoking such hero-worship in Japan despite his mediocre wartime performance. Overall, how Ding and the Beiyang Fleet were treated in popular Japanese accounts suggests that Japanese attitudes towards concepts such as "bravery," "surrender," and "suicide" were in flux in the 1890s.

AB Introduction: Suicide is the second leading cause of death for the university aged population globally. A significant proportion of students with suicidal ideation or behaviours do not seek professional help. Few primary suicide prevention programs have specifically targeted help seeking for suicidal ideation or behaviours among university students.
   Methods: This study reported the development and pilot test of a brief, two-module online psychoeducational program (ProHelp) that aimed to encourage help seeking for suicidal ideation and behaviours among university students. The program consists of two five-minute modules that address the risk factors and warning signs of suicide, stigmatising attitudes, and perceived barriers to help seeking. 156 Chinese university students and 101 Australian university students were recruited to evaluate the effectiveness of this program at post-test and one-month follow-up. Participants were randomly assigned to the psychoeducational program or an attention control program.
   Results: Of the Chinese and Australian students who were randomised into the study, around 50% completed the twoday posttest survey, and 30% completed the one-month followup survey. Although no significant difference was found between the control and experimental group on professional help-seeking beliefs and intentions, both groups' help-seeking attitudes increased during the study (p = 0.003 for the posttest survey, and p = 0.008 for the followup survey). The experimental group in both countries demonstrated a significant improvement in suicide literacy at the post-test survey (p = 0.015) compared to control. Qualitative feedback indicated that the ProHelp program was user-friendly, clear, and helpful.
   Conclusions: This study provides initial evidence that a brief online psychoeducational program could enhance university students' suicide literacy in both China and Australia. It also suggests that increasing suicide literacy might not be sufficient to improve students' help seeking, although effect sizes indicated that this lowintensity online approach shows promise in encouraging more positive beliefs towards help seeking and preparedness to help individuals with suicidal ideation among young people.

AB ObjectiveTo examine the attitude toward suicide (ATS) and its influence on nonfatal suicidal behaviors of Chinese rural-to-urban migrant workers (MWs).
   MethodAltogether, 3031 MWs completed the positive ATS Scale and structured questions regarding lifetime suicide ideation, plan, and attempt. Mental health help-seeking behaviors of MWs were also investigated.
   ResultsOverall, MWs held a more negative ATS than the Chinese general population. The lifetime prevalence of suicide ideation, plan, and attempt was 5.5%, 1.3%, and 1.1%, respectively. After controlling for lifetime depressive disorders and other covariates, a negative ATS was still significantly associated with lower risk of lifetime suicide ideation (OR = 0.32), plan (OR = 0.22), and attempt (OR = 0.26). MWs with a negative ATS were more likely to talk to others and seek help by online/telephone consultation for their mental health and suicidal problems (p < .05). A more positive ATS was significantly associated with male gender, low education level, ethnic minority of Miao, low monthly income, and originating from western China.
   ConclusionsThe majority of MWs hold a negative ATS, which significantly contributes to their relatively low risk of nonfatal suicidal behaviors. The more help-seeking from others and online/telephone consultation in MWs with a negative ATS may lower their risk of nonfatal suicidal behaviors.

AB The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using currently available emergency department (ED) records to retrospectively ascertain the prevalence and characteristics of episodes of medically treated deliberate self-harm (DSH). Discussions with ED staff identified 10 ED diagnoses in persons 12 years of age or older that were commonly used for episodes of DSH and another 7 injury-related diagnoses that could, under specific conditions, be acts of DSH. A retrospective analysis of the ED registry of one large general hospital in Shanghai for 2007 to 2010 identified all cases with one of these diagnoses. Diagnosis-specific algorithms based on the characteristics of each case were applied to classify cases as probable DSH, possible DSH or probably not DSH. The 1,495 cases of DSH identified accounted for 0.2% of all ED admissions over the 4 years; only 6 of them (0.4%) had an ED diagnosis of suicide attempt. Three ED diagnosesoverdose of medication, fall from height, and pesticide ingestionaccounted for 1,275 (85.3%) of the DSH cases. There were substantial differences in the characteristics of male and female cases of DSH and a 43% drop in the proportion of ED admissions for DSH over the 4 years. In locations where it is not feasible to develop prospective registries of suicide attempts treated in EDs, retrospective analysis of ED records that use algorithms to classify the intentionality of injuries can provide estimates of the prevalence and characteristics of medically treated episodes of DSH.

AB China is a key player on the global stage, and nearly 300 million Chinese youth stand to be affected by rapid social and ecological transformations. Programs that promote developmental assets in Chinese youth could increase their resilience in the face of contemporary stressors and enhance their capacity to contribute to China's development. In this paper we describe a unique, service-learning approach to youth development, the Jane Goodall Institute's Roots & Shoots program (R&S), as it is implemented in China. Through qualitative and quantitative methods we explore perceptions of program impact on the personal and social development of Chinese youth. Cultural, sociopolitical, and environmental issues related to program practices, outcomes and viability are highlighted. Results suggest that R&S mobilized Chinese youth to work for the benefit of their environment, their communities, and themselves.

AB Mental health is essential for functioning, general health, and quality of life in low and middle-income countries (LAMICs), as for high-income countries. This study aimed first to search in the English language peer-reviewed literature for reviews of mental health promotion interventions in the Asia-Pacific region. A global rapid review by Barry and colleagues indicated a paucity of publications on this topic in the peer-reviewed literature. The second aim of the study followed from this observation. Two systematic reviews of English language literature were conducted as case studies in two countries with known interest in mental health promotion, Thailand and China. The reviews covered publications in peer-reviewed journals and the grey literature. In Thailand, the review demonstrated: strong evidence for an empowerment program for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected mothers; a reduction in HIV-related stigma in a community-based program; and a coping program for adolescents. The second review concerned suicide prevention interventions in China. It found one relevant study, a WHO multi-site study of suicide prevention. We found surprisingly little evidence in either country of interventions focused on health equity or modifying the social determinants of mental health. We agree with Barry and colleagues that there is an urgent need to invest in the policy, practice, and research capacity for mental health promotion in LAMICs so that mental health promotion can be incorporated into the wider health promotion and global health development agenda. This includes the Global Action for Health Equity Network. Evidence-based interventions in parenting, schools, workplaces, and among older people can be initiated or adapted and evaluated in LAMIC settings.

AB Aim The present study aimed to evaluate the validity of proxy informants' reports on Life Event Scale for the Elderly (LESE) by using psychological autopsy method among rural older adults in China. Methods A multistage stratified cluster sampling method was used to select research sites. Using a case-control psychological autopsy study, face-to-face interviews were carried out to collect information from 242 suicide cases and 242 living controls. We compared the intensity and number of life events to assess the validity and reliability of LESE with proxy data reported by different informants. Data from proxy respondents of the living controls were compared with data reported by the targets (gold standards). Intraclass correlation coefficients were computed to evaluate the consistency of informants. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to analyze the convergent validity and discriminate validity of the LESE. Results The number of life events between different informants showed higher intraclass correlation coefficients values than the intensity of life events, but the results of correlation analysis was similar. The LESE was positively correlated with depression, loneliness and hopelessness, and negatively correlated with quality of life, family function and social support both in suicide cases and living controls. Conclusions The LESE has good convergent validity and discriminant validity. LESE is a valid instrument for measuring life events in psychological autopsy studies. We suggest using the number of life events to assess the validity and reliability with proxy data in a psychological autopsy study, which is more reliable than using the intensity of life events.

AB The aims of this study were to describe fatal and non-fatal self-harm burdens, as well as burdens from the main preventable risk factors, and to investigate the different suicide methods in Hubei province in central China utilizing data from both Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 and Hubei Disease Surveillance Points system. All self-harm burdens including mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), prevalence, years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) consistently demonstrated downward trends in Hubei from 1990 to 2015, with a bigger decline gap observed among females and narrower decreasing amplitudes among the elderly. Hubei experienced much higher age-standardized rates for self-harm mortality (22.0 per 100,000), YLLs (560.1 per 100,000) and DALYs (563.9 per 100,000) than the national (9.0, 292.3 and 295.0 per 100,000 respectively) and global levels (11.5, 453.3 and 457.9 per 100,000 respectively) in 2015. Self-harm burdens have begun shifting from females to males and the elderly suffered more self-harm burdens than other age groups. Alcohol use accounted for 20.9% of all self-harm DALYs for males, whereas intimate partner violence accounted for 24.4% of all self-harm DALYs for females. Poisoning, mainly pesticide self-poisoning, was still the most common method of suicide. Effective interventions by multi-sectoral collaboration are urgently needed to reduce the alarmingly heavy self-harm burdens in Hubei.

AB Background: Although there is much literature on adolescent suicide, combined effects of depression and anorexia nervosa on suicide were rarely investigated. The aims of this study are to examine the association between anorexia nervosa and suicidal thoughts and explore the interaction between anorexia nervosa and depression.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study, in the study, a sample of 8,746 Chinese adolescents was selected by multistage stratified method in 2012/2013 from 20 middle schools in 7 provinces across China Mainland. Multilevel logistic model was introduced to explore association between anorexia nervosa and suicidal thoughts. And subgroup analyses were conducted on participants with or without depression.
   Results: Multilevel logistic model revealed that demographic variables, including academic achievement, were not the predictive risk factors of suicidal thoughts. Those who suffered from worse severity of perceived anorexia nervosa were at increased risk of thinking about suicide. The interaction between depression and anorexia nervosa was significant, however, subgroup analyses showed that the associations were significant only among the adolescents without depression.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that all levels of anorexia nervosa serve as predictable indicators of suicidal thoughts in Chinese adolescents, and the effects of anorexia nervosa are modified by depression status.

AB Unplanned acts of suicidal behavior involve little preparation or forethought whereas planned acts may be carefully conceived and implemented. Planned acts are associated with greater depression, hopelessness, and lethality, but there are meager data on other factors associated with planning. The prevention of planned and unplanned acts may require different strategies, but in either case improved knowledge is required to tailor prevention efforts. Improved knowledge can be facilitated by the acceleration of validation studies on assessments of planning, taking steps to avoid the conflation of assessments of planning with measurements of psychopathology such as impulsivity, and the use of controlled research designs.

AB Objective To provide a comprehensive overview of poisoning mortality patterns in China.
   Methods Using mortality data from the Chinese national disease surveillance points system, we examined trends in poisoning mortality by intent and substance from 2006 to 2016. Differences over time between urban and rural residents among different age groups and across external causes of poisoning were quantified using negative binomial models for males and females separately.
   Results In 2016, there were 4936 poisoning deaths in a sample of 84 060 559 people (5.9 per 100 000 people; 95% confidence interval: 5.6-6.2). Age-adjusted poisoning mortality dropped from 9.2 to 5.4 per 100 000 people between 2006 and 2016. Males, rural residents and older adults consistently had higher poisoning mortality than females, urban residents and children or young adults. Most pesticide-related deaths (34 996 out of 39 813) were suicides among persons older than 15 years, although such suicides decreased between 2006 and 2016 (from 6.1 per 100 000 people to 3.6 for males and from 5.8 to 3.0 for females). In 2016, alcohol caused 29.3% (600/2050) of unintentional poisoning deaths in men aged 25-64 years. During the study period, unintentional fatal drug poisoning by narcotics and psychodysleptics in individuals aged 25-44 years increased from 0.4 per 100 000 people to 0.7 for males and from 0.05 to 0.13 for females.
   Conclusion Despite substantial decreases in mortality, poisoning is still a public health threat in China. This warrants further research to explore causative factors and to develop and implement interventions targeting at-risk populations.

ID OLDER-PEOPLE; CHINA; URBAN; DEPRESSION; INEQUALITY; MIGRATION; SUICIDE
AB In China, there are immense barriers to inclusive social citizenship because of the failure to overcome the institutional fragmentation of social security across the hukou division. The hukou system continues to be important in determining how social citizenship is granted in China; not only does it facilitate dual social citizenship, it imposes perceptions of deservingness that bolster these divisions. The aim of this paper is to build a social-citizenship-based framework, drawing upon the strengths of the capability approach, which is applicable to the complexity of the rural-urban divide in China. Referring to several data sources, the paper examines social citizenship as a subjective phenomenon. The paper highlights the social exclusion mechanisms embedded in the hukou system that might have an effect on social citizenship as a state of self-awareness.

AB The rate of suicide remains high in Slovenia, particularly in rural settings and among farmers. As is the case with many issues faced by rural people, few social responses are developed in terms of political action, health and social services and research. In this article, the severity of farmers' suicide in Slovenia is detailed and analysed as a social problem based on the following criteria: first, the scope of the situation is considered worrying and unequal; second, normative structures are abnormally or harmfully connected to the situation; third, there is a will and a power to transform the situation because it is found unacceptable according to social ethics and values; and fourth, the implementation of social responses such as intervention programmes and collective actions. This framework enables to highlight the importance of gender (masculinities), location (rural settings), local culture (agrarian values) and occupation (farming). Priority for future policies, practice and research should focus on these social determinants of health and wellbeing in support of farming people, communities and associations.

AB Background. To date, there has been no large-scale survey of geriatric depression (GD) involving; both rural and urban areas in China using standardized assessment tools and diagnostic criteria. This study aimed to determine the 12-month and lifetime prevalence rates of GD and sociodemographic correlates in urban and rural regions of Beijing, China.
   Method. A total of 1601 elderly patients (aged >= 60 years) were randomly selected and interviewed in Beijing using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 1.0). Basic sociodemographic and clinical data were also collected during the interviews.
   Results. The overall 12-month prevalence of GD was 4.33%, and the 12-month prevalence rates for men and women were 2.65%, and 5.83%, respectively. The overall lifetime prevalence of GD was 7.83%, and lifetime prevalence rates for men and women were 4.65%, and 10.66% respectively. Female sex, lower educational level, monthly income, rural abode, and the presence of one or more major medical conditions were associated with increased risk of GD. Of the GD subjects interviewed, 25.2% were receiving some type of treatment, with only 4.7% preferring to seek treatment from mental health professionals.
   Conclusions. Although still relatively low by international standards, there is all increasing trend in the prevalence of GD in China. The low percentage Of subjects treated for GD is a Major public health concern that should be addressed urgently.

AB Background: Although there are accumulating data regarding the epidemiology of suicide in China, there are meager data on suicidal ideation and attempts among college students. Interestingly, elevated impulsivity is thought to facilitate the transition from suicidal thoughts to suicidal behavior. Therefore, the objective of this research was to identify the associations between suicide and the personality factors of impulsivity and aggression.
   Methods: This study's sampling method employed stratified random cluster sampling. A multi-stage stratified sampling procedure was used to select participants (n = 5,245). We conducted structured interviews regarding a range of socio-demographic characteristics and suicidal morbidity. The Patient Health Questionnaire depression module (PHQ-9) was used to acquire the information about thoughts of being better off dead or hurting themselves in some ways during the past two weeks. The impulsivity symptoms in this study were assessed with the BIS-11-CH (i.e., the Chinese version of the BIS-11), and the Aggressive symptoms were assessed with the BAQ. The statistical package for social science (SPSS) v. 13.0 program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Socio-demographic variables such as ethnic and gender were compared between groups, through the use of X-2 tests. The nonparametric test (k Independent Sample test, Kruskal-Wallis H) was performed to determine differences between the personality factors of impulsivity and aggression and suicide.
   Results: In total, 9.1% (n = 479) of the 5,245 students reported they have ever thought about committing suicide; and 1% (n = 51) reported a history of attempted suicide (attempters). The analyses detected significant differences in scores on cognitive impulsivity (p < 0.01), when comparing individuals who only had suicidal ideation and individuals who had attempted suicide. Moreover, significant differences were found between ideators only and attempters on scores of self-oriented attack (p < .001).
   Conclusions: Suicidal ideation is prevalent among Chinese university students. Students with high aggression scores were more susceptible to committing suicide. Scores on self-oriented attack and cognitive impulsivity may be important factors for differentially predicting suicide ideation and suicide attempts.

AB Objective Despite the rapid industrialisation and urbanisation over the past 30years, agriculture is one of the largest economic sectors in China and the unregulated use of pesticides result in extensive pesticide poisoning. The objective of this study was to analyse pesticide poisoning cases registration received by Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China.
   Design Register-based study.
   Setting Cases registered regarding pesticide poisoning. Data were obtained from the Occupational Disease Surveillance and Reporting Systems in Zhejiang province from 2006 to 2010, which contains anonymous records representing general population of Zhejiang province, China.
   Participants All cases registered as pesticide poisoning were identified.
   Primary outcome Monthly and age-group pesticide poisoning death rates were calculated.
   Results A total of 20097 pesticide poisoning cases with 1413 deaths were recorded during the study period. There were 10513 male pesticide poisoning cases with 782 deaths, and 9584 females with 631 deaths. Pesticide poisoning occurred mostly in non-occupational exposure (79.86%), in which the majority (85.77%) of the cases was of intentional pesticide poisoning. The occupational exposure was most common in men during the farming season. The death rate increased stepwise with age, and the pesticide suicide rate was higher in the older age group.
   Conclusions Pesticide poisoning remains a major health problem in China, and further recommendations to reduce the pesticide poisoning are required.

The epidemiological characteristics of injury mortality is changing along with the social development. This study described the epidemiological characteristics of injury mortality in Guangdong Province by analyzing the death surveillance data in a few areas in Guangdong Province in 2015.MethodsUsing the mortality data from the Disease Surveillance Points (DSP) system, injury deaths were classified according to the International Classification of Disease-10th Revision (ICD-10). The data were stratified by areas (urban/rural), gender, age groups, injury types, and then overall and type-specific injury mortality rates were estimated for the whole Guangdong Province, China.ResultsWe estimated that about 38,200 individuals died from injury in Guangdong Province in 2015, producing a mortality rate of 43.11/100,000. The overall age-standardized injury mortality in men was higher in rural areas compared with urban areas (41.29/100,000 versus 24.89/100,000). In terms of injury intent, unintentional injuries were the commonnest injury type, which accounted for 83.93% of the overall injury deaths, however, the deaths caused by suicide should not be ignored, which occupied 12.67% of the total injury deaths. In terms of injury cause type, falls, road-traffic accidents, suicide, drowning, and accidental poisoning were the top five leading types of injury deaths.ConclusionsIn Guangdong Province, injury is an important cause of death. Road-traffic accidents, falls, suicide, drowning, and accidental poisoning should be the priorities of intervention. Moreover, in rural areas, the men were the most targeted subpopulation of the prevention activities.

AB A fatal concentration of pentobarbital found in a coroner's case where the history had not indicated use of this drug prompted a review of fatalities in Ontario from 2012 to 2015. Coroner's case files, including police and toxicology reports, were reviewed in twenty deaths, in which pentobarbital was identified as the primary cause of death. In all of the deaths (11 females, 9 males), the blood concentration of pentobarbital was greater than 10 mg/L. There were three to eight deaths per year and each was classified as suicide. In 11 cases, there was clear evidence that the drug was purchased over the internet from Mexico or China and imported into Canada. In four cases, it appears that the pentobarbital was labeled as a different, innocuous chemical to facilitate crossing the border without scrutiny. The findings underscore the value of a thorough scene investigation, including details of evidence that may be considered unrelated.

AB Objective To investigate the association between pesticide exposure and suicidal ideation in rural areas of China.
   Methods The analysis involved data from a survey of a representative sample of 9811 rural residents in Zhejiang province who had been asked about the storage of pesticides at home and about whether or not they had considered suicide within the 2 years before the interview. The Chinese version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHO) was administered to screen for mental disorder.
   Findings The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for the association between pesticide storage at home and suicidal ideation over the prior 2 years was 2.12 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.54-2.93). After adjusting for gender, age, education, socioeconomic status, marital status, physical health, family history of suicidal behaviour, GHQ caseness and study design effects, the OR was 1.63 (95% CI 1.13-2.35).
   Conclusion A potential marker of chronic pesticide exposure was found to be associated with suicidal ideation, which supports findings from previous studies. Given the high level of pesticide exposure and the high suicide risk in rural China, clarification of the causal mechanisms underlying this association and the development of appropriate interventions are priorities for public health and health policy.

TI Use of electroconvulsive therapy in adolescents with schizophrenia in
   China
SO CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY AND MENTAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS; ATTITUDES
AB Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective treatment for psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, major depression and bipolar disorder. However, few studies have addressed the use of ECT in adolescents with schizophrenia. The aims of our study were to investigate the frequency of ECT, and its relationship with clinical and demographic correlates among adolescents with schizophrenia in China.
   Methods: The study was a retrospective study and conducted in the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Department of Beijing Anding Hospital, and adolescents with schizophrenia over a period of 10 years (2007-2016) were enrolled. The demographic and clinical data were collected from the electronic chart management system.
   Results: A total of 835 patients were included, 411/835 (49.2%) of the adolescent inpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia were in ECT group. There were significant differences in the sex, age, high risk for aggression and suicide, family history of psychiatric disorders and concomitant psychotropic medication (antidepressants and benzodiazepines) between the ECT and non-ECT groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that ECT use was independently and positively associated with sex, high risk for suicide.
   Conclusions: In a major psychiatric center in China, the use of ECT was common, and reasons for the high use of ECT for adolescent patients in this hospital should warrant urgent investigations.

AB Objectives: To investigate the trends and correlations of gross domestic product (GDP) adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita on suicide rates in 10 WHO regions during the past 30 years.
   Design: Analyses of databases of PPP-adjusted GDP per capita and suicide rates. Countries were grouped according to the Global Burden of Disease regional classification system.
   Data sources: World Bank's official website and WHO's mortality database.
   Statistical analyses: After graphically displaying PPP-adjusted GDP per capita and suicide rates, mixed effect models were used for representing and analysing clustered data.
   Results: Three different groups of countries, based on the correlation between the PPP-adjusted GDP per capita and suicide rates, are reported: (1) positive correlation: developing (lower middle and upper middle income) Latin-American and Caribbean countries, developing countries in the South East Asian Region including India, some countries in the Western Pacific Region (such as China and South Korea) and high-income Asian countries, including Japan; (2) negative correlation: high-income and developing European countries, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and (3) no correlation was found in an African country.
   Conclusions: PPP-adjusted GDP per capita may offer a simple measure for designing the type of preventive interventions aimed at lowering suicide rates that can be used across countries. Public health interventions might be more suitable for developing countries. In high-income countries, however, preventive measures based on the medical model might prove more useful.

AB In China, female injection drug users who are also sex workers (IDUFSW) have a high prevalence of HIV and low prevalence of HIV testing. They are concerned about HIV infection and may be subjected to the risk of suicidal ideation if they become infected, due to stress and discrimination. During 2005-2006, we recruited 199 IDUFSW who self-reported negative/unknown HIV sero-status in Dazhou, Sichuan, China, to investigate the prevalence of and factors associated with suicidal ideation if they became HIV positive. Among the participants, 40.7% responded affirmatively to the question Whether you would commit suicide if you were infected with HIV in the future? In multivariate analyses, hatred toward oneself, perception of dying within 2-3years, perceived nonavailability of HIV-related treatment, inability to cope with HIV-related trauma, and inclination to leave one's family if one contracted HIV were significant factors related to anticipated suicidal ideation under the hypothetical situation of HIV infection. The odds ratios (OR) ranged from 2.38 to 10.36 (p<.05). These findings can facilitate the planning of primary suicidal prevention services targeting high-risk, non-HIV-positive IDUFSW. Such programs may enhance psychosocial support, empowerment, cultivation of positive coping strategies, and perceived accessibility to treatment, and be integrated with HIV testing.

AB Aims and objectives. To explore suicide predictors in rural outpatients with schizophrenia. Background. Suicide is a major cause of mortality in patients with schizophrenia. Evidence indicates that patients in rural areas are at high risk for inadequate health care services. However, information is limited on suicide risk in outpatients with schizophrenia in rural areas. Design. Cross-sectional survey. Methods. Data were collected on individuals enrolled in the 2007 Taiwan National Health Insurance program as diagnosed with schizophrenia, =18 years, and living in a rural county. Eligible individuals (n = 1655) were assessed by 12 community-based nurses at 12 public health centres. Participants personal information was retrieved from National Health Insurance records using a personal data sheet, and treatment experiences were obtained by interviewing patients with a 10-item risk-assessment inventory. Data were collected over 18 months (20072008) and analysed by descriptive statistics and regression analyses. Results. Risk of suicide attempt in the previous year had four significant predictors: number of self-harm incidents during the previous year, violent incidents towards others during the previous year, number of follow-ups by mental health clinics and number of involuntary hospitalisations during the previous year (R2 = 0.337, adjusted R2 = 0.334, F = 133.19, p = 0.000). Conclusion. Health care providers should assess rural outpatients with schizophrenia for suicidal thoughts by asking simple questions to evaluate for a history of self-harm and violence and by comparing this information with health system data on follow-ups by mental health clinics and involuntary hospitalisations. Relevance to clinical practice. Community-based health providers may use these results to prioritise assessments when they have a high case load of patients with schizophrenia. Community-based nurses need to be trained to recognise these four predictors to increase their sensitivity to suicidality among patients with schizophrenia.

This article explores the last words of Yick Yourn, a Bendigo storekeeper who committed suicide in 1875, revealing his life to be a complex web of local, cross-cultural and translocal connections. His suicide letters, combined with the witness statements at his inquest, provide a unique opportunity to glimpse the private world of a nineteenth-century Chinese immigrant to Victoria. This article argues that an assimilation narrative is an inappropriate way for understanding the lives of Chinese immigrants, but neither can they be dismissed as sojourners. Yick Yourn was an agent of his own making as a long-term resident intent on returning to China.

TI Positive and negative life events and reasons for living modulate

AB Background: The influence of life events on suicidal behavior remains inconclusive, while reasons for living (RFL) may be protective.
   Objectives: To analyze the association between positive and negative life events and suicidal ideation (SI) and the interaction between life events and RFL on SI.
   Method: Patients with history of suicide attempts (n = 338) underwent a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including SI (Beck's Suicidal Ideation scale), RFL (Reasons for Living Inventory, RFLI) and life events (family, school, student or professional, social, health and religion-related and other life events) during the last twelve months.
   Results: The only negative life events associated with SI were health-related events (OR = 2.01 95%CI [1.04;3.92]). Family-related positive life events and RFL were negatively associated with SI (OR = 0.73 95%CI[0.58;0.91] and OR = 0.98 95%CI[0.97;0.98], respectively). No significant interaction between the number of positive life events and RFLI total score with current SI (p = 0.57) was detected. Family-related positive life events and RFL did not have any additive effect on SI. Positive life events did not moderate the association between health-related negative life events and SI.
   Limitations: This was a retrospective study, the presence of axis II disorders was not investigated and results cannot be generalized due to the sample choice (only suicide attempters).
   Conclusions: Patients with history of suicide attempts could be less sensitive to negative life events, except for those related to health. Clinicians should pay more attention to somatic problems in patients at risk of suicide. Family support, positive psychology and therapies that strengthen RFL should be developed to prevent suicide.

AB Due to increasing immigration in Germany the German Mental Health Care System today has to deal in a growing number with the assessment of the level of psychic functioning and the capability of self control in patients of different ethnic origin. For clinicians this is a challenge, since suicidal behaviour in terms of its frequency, meaning, motives and manner is very much dependent on the cultural context in which it occurs. Moreover, the general attitude of an individual towards suicide is embedded in the culture of origin of the immigrant. Until now there has been only little systematic research on the influence of culture on suicidal behaviour. In this review the traditions of suicidal behaviour in different cultures in their religious and historical dimensions will be reflected. The historical and cultural roots of suicidal behaviour will be put in context to a categorization of the different variants of suicide, such as institutionalized suicide versus individualized suicide. Psychodynamic aspects of suicidal ideation will be highlighted in cross-cultural perspective with a distinction between a. the wish to die, b. the wish to kill and c. the wish to be killed. It will be shown that there can be differentiated between accepted and non-accepted suicide. With respect to epidemiology there will be discussed the impact of culture on the suicide rates across cultures. The influence of culture on the psychopathology of suicidal behaviour will be summed up systematically.These aspects are of high relevance for the understanding and assessment of suicidal crisis in immigrants, since the suicidal patient even today- although subconsciously - is influenced by the deep rooted traditions of suicidal behaviour in his culture of origin.

AB Objective There are conflicting reports about whether individual anxiety disorders are independently associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. We examined whether anxiety disorders are related to suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in a community sample of South Korean adults.
   Methods In-person interviews based on the South Korean version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview were conducted to diagnose mental disorders. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to examine whether anxiety disorders were associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Each regression model treated lifetime diagnosis of anxiety disorders as independent variables. Sociodemographic characteristics, cohabitation status, lifetime history of mood disorders, alcohol use disorders, and psychotic disorders were included as covariates.
   Results Nationally representative sample of 6,510 South Korean adults aged 18-64 years was recruited. Multivariate analysis adjusted for psychiatric comorbidity and sociodemographic variables revealed that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) [2.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.27, 4.33)], post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (3.50, 95% CI: 2.16, 5.68), specific phobia (1.55, 95% CI: 1.14, 2.11), social phobia (2.97, 95% CI: 1.27, 6.94), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (5.58, 95% CI: 2.70, 11.6) were associated with suicidal ideation, whereas only social phobia (3.78, 95% CI: 1.41, 10.1) and PTSD (5.13, 95% CI: 2.81, 9.37) were associated with suicide attempts.
   Conclusion Individual anxiety disorders are independently associated with suicidal ideation and/or suicide attempts. The importance of the early detection of anxiety disorders and of assessing the suicide risk in individuals with anxiety disorders is emphasized.

AB Background: China's HIV epidemic commenced in its agrarian provinces through contaminated commercial plasma donation centers and is now becoming a public health concern nationwide. Little is known of the psychiatric and substance use disorder characteristics of this population, or their impact on everyday function, employment, and life quality.
   Methods: HIV-infected (HIV+) former plasma donors (N=203) and HIV-negative (HIV-) donor controls (N=198) completed the World Mental Health Survey Composite International Diagnostic Interview to determine lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD), substance use disorders, and suicidality. Current mood and suicidality were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Everyday function was measured by an Activity of Daily Living questionnaire; life quality was evaluated by the Medical Outcomes Study - HIV.
   Results: HIV+ participants had known their infected status for 2 years on average. Most were taking antiretroviral treatment and had frank AIDS. Rates of current MDD were similar across groups (1-2%), but HIV+ had a higher frequency of lifetime MDD (14% vs. 5%, p<.05). Its onset preceded date of known infection in one-third of cases. Alcoholism was the only substance use disorder detected; HIV+ had a higher proportion of lifetime substance use diagnoses (14% vs. 6%, p<.05). Depression and AIDS independently predicted worse daily functioning and life quality, and unemployment.
   Limitations: The epicenter of China HIV has moved into urban injection drug users, limiting the representativeness of this sample.
   Conclusions: High rates of MDD and its impact suggest that in China, as elsewhere, comprehensive care requires detection and treatment of mood disorder. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between adolescent substance use and psychosocial distress indicators among 30,851 adolescents aged 11 to 16 in four countries (Philippines, China, Chile, and Namibia). Global School-Based Student Health Survey data from these countries provided information about frequency and lifetime use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs as well as items about early adolescents' feelings of loneliness, worry, hopelessness, suicide, and number of close friends. Overall, there were significant relationships between adolescent substance-use behaviors and a measure of "global" psychosocial distress for both boys and girls in all four countries and for four of the five items of psychosocial distress (often lonely, often worry, sad/hopeless, and having a suicide plan). The association between substance use and psychosocial distress was also consistent in both genders and across the four countries. These results have important implications for professionals who work with adolescent populations.

TI The impact of parental migration on health status and health behaviours
   among left behind adolescent school children in China
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID FAMILY-STRUCTURE; RISK BEHAVIOR
AB Background: One out of ten of China's population are migrants, moving from rural to urban areas. Many leave their families behind resulting in millions of school children living in their rural home towns without one or both their parents. Little is known about the health status of these left behind children (LBC). This study compares the health status and health related behaviours of left behind adolescent school children and their counterparts in a rural area in Southern China.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among middle school students in Fuyang Township, Guangdong, China (2007-2008). Information about health behaviours, parental migration and demographic characteristics was collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Overweight/obesity and stunting were defined based on measurements of height and weight. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to estimate the differences in health outcomes between LBC and non LBC.
   Results: 18.1% of the schoolchildren had one or both parents working away from home. Multivariate analysis showed that male LBC were at higher risk of skipping breakfast, higher levels of physical inactivity, internet addiction, having ever smoked tobacco, suicide ideation, and being overweight. LBC girls were more likely to drink excessive amounts of sweetened beverage, to watch more TV, to have ever smoked or currently smoke tobacco, to have ever drunk alcohol and to binge drinking. They were also more likely to be unhappy, to think of planning suicide and consider leaving home.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that parental migration is a risk factor for unhealthy behaviours amongst adolescent school children in rural China. Further research is required in addition to the consideration of the implications for policies and programmes to protect LBC.

AB Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between psychological strains and depression and to further test the Strain Theory of Suicide and Mental Disorders. Method: Data for the current study were from a large psychological autopsy (PA) study in Chinese rural populations with a case-control design to investigate the environmental and other characteristics of rural young suicides and controls. Subjects (N=1618) for the current study were the informants in the PA interviews. The center for epidemiologic studies depression scale was used to assess the respondents' depression level. Chi-square chi(2), t test, t' test, and general linear regression model were used to analyse the data by SPSS software. Results: Value strain and deprivation strain are positively correlated with the depression level for both men and women of the Chinese rural population. Religion is another strong risk factor for depression and marriage is not a protective factor for depression in this sample. Conclusions: The study verifies that there is strong correlation between the psychological strains and depression in Chinese rural populations. It is suggested that reducing psychological strains may be a possible approach to reduce the prevalence of depression so as to help bring down the suicide risk in rural China.

TI Risks and Predictors of Current Suicidality in HIV-Infected Heroin Users

DT Article

AB Objective: Suicide is an important public health problem in China. Elsewhere, injection drug use and HIV infection have independently been associated with suicidality, but research has often overlooked these high-risk groups in China. We determined the frequency and predictors of suicidal ideas in Chinese HIV-infected (HIV+) and HIV-uninfected (HIV-) heroin injection drug users (IDUs) in treatment and a control sample. We hypothesized that rates of suicidal ideas would be significantly higher among IDUs compared with controls and highest among HIV+ IDUs.
   Method: We assessed suicidal ideas within the past 2 weeks in HIV+ (n = 204) and HIV- (n = 202) heroin IDUs in methadone treatment in Yunnan, a province at the intersection of the heroin and HIV epidemics, and in demographically matched HIV- non-drug-using controls (n = 201).
   Results: Rates of suicidality were higher in IDUs than controls, but there was no additive effect of HIV infection (HIV+ IDU: 43.1%; HIV- IDU: 37.1%; controls: 8.5%). Among HIV+ IDUs, suicidality was associated most strongly with a combination of prior history of major depression, low perceived social support, and experience of HIV-relevant stress, but not with AIDS diagnosis. Among HIV- IDUs, suicidality was associated with prior history of major depressive or alcohol use disorder. Less than 25% of IDUs with suicidality had histories of mood or alcohol use diagnoses.
   Conclusion: Because suicidal ideation is frequent in IDUs in China, regardless of HIV status, and is not fully accounted for by past psychiatric history, additional research may be warranted.

SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE

DT Article
DE Suicidal ideation; Social capital; Hierarchical ordinal regression;
   Youth
ID PUBLIC-HEALTH; DURKHEIM; INTEGRATION; SOCIOLOGY; TIES; TOO
AB Rationale: Social capital is an important theoretical construct often used to explain positive behavioral outcomes. However, suicide research is often hampered by a limited definition of social capital, at the expense of its multidimensional nature, since suicide may occur when individuals are beset by overwhelming and conflicting relationships. We hypothesize not all dimensions of social capital protect individuals from suicidal ideation, and the beneficial return from some types also gradually diminishes.
   Methods: We conducted a hierarchical ordinal regression analysis of combined samples of university students from 22 cities across all regions of China (n = 5025, response rate 97%).
   Results: 1) whereas social capital, measured as network connection, embedded-resource, and generalized trust, is negatively associated with self-reported suicidal ideation, controlling for mental stress and other covariates, when measured as social participation, shows a positive association; 2) the moderate curvilinear effects of embedded resource and network connection imply that the return from some dimensions of social capital gradually diminishes.
   Conclusions: We leveraged the results to discuss the theoretical relevance of social capital in the suicide literature particularly its dark side and the need for more contextualized public health intervention programs for suicide prevention.

TI Choosing between life and love - Negotiating dyadic gender ideals among
   the Lahu of Southwest China
SO CRITICAL ASIAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article examines the ways in which some star-crossed lovers reconcile their romantic attachments and social constraints through life-and-death negotiation of the gender ideals among the Lahu of Lancang, Southwest China. While the prevailing Lahu ideal of the husband-wife dyad (in which the married pair functions as a single social entity) fosters gender equality and marital stability and harmony, the dyad ideal also models romantic expressions through the ritualized singing of courtship songs that ordinarily lead to a marriage. The gaps between the dyadic ideology and its practice, which have been drastically magnified since the Chinese state introduced radical social changes in the 1950s, have significantly increased both dysfunctional marriages and extramarital relationships. This article explores the diverse patterns in which some individuals appropriate the courtship singing sessions to both express their socially disapproved romance and to resolve their dilemma caused by personal romantic longings that contradict social obligations. Resolving these dilemmas typically involves compromising romance for socially acceptable intimacy, committing double suicide in order to marry each other in the afterlife, or choosing separate paths (in which one member of the couple commits suicide and the other does not). The author argues that couples who jointly choose either life apart or love together in the afterlife do so with oneness in thought and mind, simultaneously challenging and reinforcing the ideal of the husband-wife dyad. In contrast, those who commit love-suicide alone push the boundaries of the dyadic ideal to the extreme.

AB In recent years, the number of cases of acute poisoning has increased in China, yet; currently, there is no detailed report published that addresses acute poisoning in the mainland of China. We collected biological samples from 466 cases of suspected acute poisoning at the hospitals in Shanghai, China, and examined them using spectroscopy, chromatography and chromatography/mass spectrometry. Of the 466 cases, 230 cases (100 men and 130 women) were positively confirmed as acute poisonings. There were 80 types of compounds identified in this study. Medications were the most frequent substances identified, and the other substances included pesticides, multiple compounds, volatile compounds, natural toxins, and others. The results of this study indicate a need for strengthening the education about and management of the rational and safe use of drugs in Shanghai.

AB Background: Suicide is an urgent public health challenge for China. This study aims to examine the prevalence, influence factors, and gender differences of suicidal ideation among general population in Northwestern Urban China.
   Methods: Data used in this study were derived from the third wave of a cohort study of a randomized community sample with 4291 participants (>= 20 years) in 2008 in Lanzhou City and Baiyin City, Gansu Province. Data were collected via face-to-face interview by the trained interviewers. Descriptive analyses, chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regressions were performed by using Stata 12.0, as needed.
   Results: The prevalence of 12-month suicidal ideation was 4.29 %, there was no significant difference between males and females [5.04 % vs 3.62 %, Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR)=0.83, p=0.351]. Several risk factors for suicidal ideation were confirmed, including being unmarried (AOR=1.55, p=0.030), having depression symptoms (AOR=2.33, p < 0.001), having other insurance (AOR=1.83, p=0.01) or no insurance (AOR=1.73, p=0.024). In addition, several influence factors were significantly different in males and females, such as being currently married (unmarried vs married, AOR=1.84, p=0.027, for females; no difference for males), feeling hopeless (hopless vs hopeful, AOR=1.92, p=0.06, for females; no difference for males), having other insurances (having other insurances vs having basic employee medical insurance, AOR=1.92, p=0.044, for males; no difference for females), having debts (having debts vs no debts, AOR=2.69, p=0.001, for males; no difference for females), currently smoking (smoking vs nonsmoking, AOR=3.01, p=0.019 for females, no difference for males), and currently drinking (drinking vs nondrinking, AOR=2.01, p=0.022, for males; no difference for females).
   Discussion and conclusion: These findings suggested that comprehensive suicide prevention strategies should be developed or strengthened in order to prevent suicide ideation in China, and the gender-specific differences need to be explored through further researches.

These students were recruited from two high schools in Lijin County, Shandong Province, China by using a stratified random cluster sampling method. Overall, 13.5% of the sample reported having suicidal ideation in the past year, and there was no significant difference between boys and girls in reporting rate of suicidal ideation. Nightmares, physical activity, and sleep duration as well as family environment, paternal education, and mental heath status were significantly associated with suicidal ideation. More efforts for these factors should be considered in suicide prevention for high school students in rural China.

AB Objectives: To investigate the prevalence of substance use, sexual behaviours, and suicidal ideation and attempts among adolescents in Guangzhou, China, and to explore the associations between these risk behaviours and demographics.
   Study design: A two-stage stratified cluster sample design produced a representative sample of 12-19-year-old students in Grades 1-6 who attended public middle schools in Guangzhou.
   Methods: Prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using SUDDAN statistical software. Logistic regression was used to examine the associations between health risk behaviours and demographics.
   Results: In total, 5988 students (45.5% males, 54.5% females) were included in this study. Overall, 17.6% of students had tried cigarette smoking, 63.1% of students had had at least one drink of alcohol, 1.7% of students had used marijuana, 3.5% of students had experienced sexual intercourse, 17.6% of students had seriously considered attempting suicide and 3.2% had attempted suicide. Male gender was positively associated with substance use and sexual risk behaviours, but negatively associated with feeling sad or hopeless and suicide ideation. Being in Grades 4-6 was positively associated with lifetime cigarette use, lifetime alcohol use, current alcohol use, episodic heavy drinking and marijuana use, but negatively associated with suicide attempts. Higher parental education was positively associated with lifetime alcohol use, current alcohol use, lifetime marijuana use, feeling sad or hopeless, and suicidal ideation, but negatively associated with lifetime cigarette use and current cigarette use.
   Conclusions: Gender, school grade and parental education were found to be significantly associated with certain risk behaviours. (C) 2008 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide is a major public health issue in China, and suicidal ideation is an important step in the suicidal process. The purpose of this study was to understand the prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation among rural immigrant daughters-in-law with multi-role of female, farmer and immigrant in China. A total of 939 participants including 474 local daughters-in-law and 465 immigrant daughters-in-law were surveyed using the self-rating questionnaire. Demographic characteristics, depression, anxiety, impulsivity and suicidal ideation were assessed. Results indicated that the lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation among rural immigrant daughters-in-law was 9.68%. Physical disability, domestic violence and negative events demonstrated statistical significance by suicidal ideation (p <.05), and participants with suicidal ideation had higher scores of depression, anxiety and impulsiveness in the univariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression showed that physical disability (OR = 7.43, 95% CI: 2.84-19.46), domestic violence (OR = 2.65, 95% CI: 1.02-6.88), depression (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01-1.12), impulsiveness (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.08) and motor impulsiveness (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01-1.14) were significantly associated with suicidal ideation. Suicidal ideation is an issue that can't be ignored among rural immigrant daughters-in-law. And the findings should be considered for the intervention of the suicide among the rural immigrant daughters-in-law.

AB Background: To date, no study has investigated the use of depot antipsychotic medication (DA) in Chinese outpatients with schizophrenia. This study explored the frequency and sociodemographic and clinical correlates of DA in schizophrenia outpatients in both Hong Kong (HK) and Beijing (BJ), China. Methods: 505 clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia were randomly selected and interviewed in HK and BJ using standardized assessment instruments. Their basic sociodemographic and clinical data and psychotropic drug prescriptions were collected at the time of a diagnostic interview. Results: 117 (23.2%) patients were prescribed DA, 36.1 and 10% of the HK and BJ samples, respectively. Prescription of DA was associated with a history of suicide, less use of clozapine, more frequent antipsychotic polypharmacy (APP), more frequent admissions, and study site (HK vs. BJ). In multiple logistic regression analysis, Study site, less frequent prescription of clozapine, history of suicide, and more frequent use of APP remained significantly associated with DA. Conclusion: There was wide variation in the frequency of DA prescribing between HK and BJ even though the ethnic and clinical characteristics of the two samples were nearly identical. This suggests that sociocultural and economic factors, as well as traditions in psychiatric training and practice all played a role in determining the use of DA.

AB Rural left-behind children is a special group formed during the social development of China. They are at a vulnerable status and exposed to much hidden danger. Given the frequent occurrences of incidents like accidental death, sexual abuse and suicide to the rural left-behind children, this essay proposes that precautionary measures should be taken by the government, educational department, different sectors of society and the guardians of those children to reduce the occurrence rate of such incidents and strengthen the educational work on the improvement of rural left-behind children's safety consciousness.

These modalities form a central set of techniques through which neoliberalism is activated, through which it moves from ideology to material reality.

AB Objectives: Guided by the biopsychosocial framework and empirical evidence, this study examined protective and risk factors of older adults' suicidal thoughts and attempts during the previous month, 12 months, and 5 years.Method: The data used in this study were extracted from the Sample Survey on Aged Population in Urban/Rural China conducted in 2006, which included 15,957 older adults from mainland China. Multiple penalized logistic regressions were used to conduct the analyses.Results: During the previous month, 12 months, and 5 years, 5.1, 10.0 parts per thousand, and 17.7 parts per thousand of older adults indicated that they thought about suicide, whereas 2.2 parts per thousand, 3.5 parts per thousand, and 6.3 parts per thousand reported suicidal attempts, respectively. Older adults' age, financial strain, functional limitations, depression, children's filial piety, social network, loneliness, and urban residence were significantly related to suicidal thoughts during the different time periods. In addition, older adults' religious affiliation, depression, loneliness, and urban residence were significantly related to suicidal attempts during the different time periods.Conclusion: Older adults' suicidal thoughts and attempts need to be assessed by mental health care professionals and primary care doctors. Programs addressing these important protective and risk factors may help reduce older adults' suicidal thoughts and attempts.

AB Objective: The current study was designed to explore the prevalence of child sexual abuse (CSA) and its association with health risk behaviors (i.e., smoking, alcohol use, binge drinking, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt) among rural children and adolescents in China.
   Methods: A sample of 683 rural children and adolescents (8 to 18 years of age) completed an anonymous questionnaire which assessed experiences of CSA and 5 health risk behaviors. Data on several potential confounding factors were also collected.
   Results: A total of 123(18%) respondents reported experiencing at least 1 kind of CSA before 16 years of age, with more boys reporting CSA than girls (21.5% vs. 14.2%). In addition, attending non-boarding schools, lower levels of self-esteem, and higher levels of perceived peer pressure for engagement in health risk behaviors were associated with higher rates of CSA. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that CSA experience was significantly associated with cigarette smoking (aOR = 2.14), binge drinking (aOR = 2.68), suicidal ideation (aOR = 1.69), and suicide attempt (aOR = 2.69) after controlling for several demographic and psychological factors.
   Conclusion: More attention should be paid to the issues of CSA among rural children and adolescents in China. Effective CSA prevention intervention needs to address the vulnerabilities of the population, increase children's and parents' awareness of CSA and ability of self-protection. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background. The relationship between recurrent major depression (MD) in women and suicidality is complex. We investigated the extent to which patients who suffered with various forms of suicidal symptomatology can be distinguished from those subjects without such symptoms.
   Method. We examined the clinical features of the worst episode in 1970 Han Chinese women with recurrent DSM-IV MD between the ages of 30 and 60 years from across China. Student's t tests, and logistic and multiple logistic regression models were used to determine the association between suicidality and other clinical features of MD.
   Results. Suicidal symptomatology is significantly associated with a more severe form of MD, as indexed by both the number of episodes and number of MD symptoms. Patients reporting suicidal thoughts, plans or attempts experienced a significantly greater number of stressful life events. The depressive symptom most strongly associated with lifetime suicide attempt was feelings of worthlessness (odds ratio 4.25, 95% confidence interval 2.9-6.3). Excessive guilt, diminished concentration and impaired decision-making were also significantly associated with a suicide attempt.
   Conclusions. This study contributes to the existing literature on risk factors for suicidal symptomatology in depressed women. Identifying specific depressive symptoms and co-morbid psychiatric disorders may help improve the clinical assessment of suicide risk in depressed patients. These findings could be helpful in identifying those who need more intense treatment strategies in order to prevent suicide.

AB The connection between community stress and problems and community residents' psychopathology is an understudied area, and a limited number of studies have reported inconsistent findings. This research aimed to estimate the effect of perceived social factors in the community environment on the residents' self-reported psychopathology. The study sample consisted of 2034 men and women from 16 selected rural counties in three provinces of China. The social factors in the village community were measured by the World Health Organization Multisite Intervention Study on Suicidal Behaviors (WHO SUPRE-MISS) scale of Community Stress and Problems. The sychological and mental health of the individuals was assessed by (1) suicidal thoughts, plans and attempts (National Comorbidity Survey Replication or NCS-R), (2) pro-suicide attitudes (General Social Survey or GSS), (3) depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale or CES-D) and (4) suicide ideation (Scale for Suicide Ideation or SSI). Multiple regressions were performed separately for each of the four psychopathologic traits with the scale of Community Stress and Problems as the major predicting variable and age, gender, education years, marital status, family annual income, family status in village and religion as the confounding correlates. It is found that community stress and problems generally increase rural Chinese residents' psychopathologies, especially issues in health care, housing and transportation, which play more important roles than others.

AB Background: Suicide is a great public health challenge. Two hundred million people attempt suicide in China annually Existing suicide prevention programs require the help-seeking initiative of suicidal individuals, but many of them have a low motivation to seek the required help. We propose that a proactive and targeted suicide prevention strategy can prompt more people with suicidal thoughts and behaviors to seek help.
   Objective: The goal of the research was to test the feasibility and acceptability of Proactive Suicide Prevention Online (PSPO), a new approach based on social media that combines proactive identification of suicide-prone individuals with specialized crisis management.
   Methods: We first located a microblog group online. Their comments on a suicide note were analyzed by experts to provide a training set for the machine learning models for suicide identification. The best-performing model was used to automatically identify posts that suggested suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Next, a microblog direct message containing crisis management information, including measures that covered suicide-related issues, depression, help-seeking behavior and an acceptability test, was sent to users who had been identified by the model to be at risk of suicide. For those who replied to the message, trained counselors provided tailored crisis management. The Simplified Chinese Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count was also used to analyze the users' psycholinguistic texts in 1-month time slots prior to and postconsultation.
   Results: A total of 27,007 comments made in April 2017 were analyzed. Among these, 2786 (10.32%) were classified as indicative of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The performance of the detection model was good, with high precision (.86), recall (.78), F-measure (.86), and accuracy (.88). Between July 3, 2017, and July 3, 2018, we sent out a total of 24,727 direct messages to 12,486 social media users, and 5542 (44.39%) responded. Over one-third of the users who were contacted completed the questionnaires included in the direct message. Of the valid responses, 89.73% (1259/1403) reported suicidal ideation, but more than half (725/1403, 51.67%) reported that they had not sought help. The 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) mean score was 17.40 (SD 5.98). More than two-thirds of the participants (968/1403, 69.00%) thought the PSPO approach was acceptable. Moreover, 2321 users replied to the direct message. In a comparison of the frequency of word usage in their microblog posts 1-month before and after the consultation, we found that the frequency of death-oriented words significantly declined while the frequency of future-oriented words significantly increased.
   Conclusions: The PSPO model is suitable for identifying populations that are at risk of suicide. When followed up with proactive crisis management, it may be a useful supplement to existing prevention programs because it has the potential to increase the accessibility of antisuicide information to people with suicidal thoughts and behaviors but a low motivation to seek help.

AB Aim: Greater soft drink consumption was associated with increased risk of mental health problems in Western countries. The objective of the study was to examine the association between soft drink and sweet food consumption and suicidal behaviours among adolescents in China.
   Methods: In 2005, a population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 100 schools in Jiangsu Province, China. Participants were aged 12-19 years old (n = 23 976).
   Results: Among the participants, 20.5% reported daily soft drink consumption; 18.6% reported having suicidal ideation. Soft drink consumption was significantly and positively associated with risk of suicidal plan or suicide attempt. Prevalence of suicidal plan was 12.8% among those who consumed soft drink at least three times per day and 6.2% among those who did not consume any soft drinks. In multivariate analyses, compared with soft drink consumption less than once per day, consumption at least three times per day was associated with 80% increased risk for suicidal plan and more than 3.5-fold increased risk for suicide attempt. Of note, nonconsumption of soft drinks was also associated with about 32% elevated risk for suicidal plan and suicidal attempt. High frequency intake of sweet food was associated with increased risk of suicidal behaviours.
   Conclusions: There is a positive association between consumption of soft drinks and sweet food and risks for suicidal behaviours among adolescents in China. Prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings.

AB Previous researchers have studied the relationship between mental disorder and major demographic variables, but the study on the relationship between relative poverty or relative deprivation, a subjectively perceived status in comparison with people around, and psychopathology is rare. Data for this study were obtained from a survey research conducted on a university campus in Beijing China, between 2007 and 2011, with a total of 5925 college students who participated in the surveys over the past five years. According to the Strain Theory of suicide we hypothesized that the stronger the relative deprivation, the higher the level of depression for the students and the higher the degree of suicidal ideation the students would experience. Findings indicated that relative deprivation is significantly correlated with suicidal ideation, positively related with depression and negatively related to social support. It is proposed that reduction of psychological strains might be an effective procedure to reduce college students psychopathology and increase their positive psychological feelings such as self-perceived social support.

AB AimThe aim of this qualitative descriptive study was to explore the influencing factors of suicidal ideation in Chinese patients diagnosed with stomach cancer.
   IntroductionMore recently, links have been made between suicide and cancer. For inpatients with cancer, nurses are at the front line to cope with suicidal issues in clinical settings.
   MethodThis study was part of a larger study that investigated psychological strains and related factors associated with suicidal ideation. Thirty-two patients with stomach cancer participated in a face-to-face interview. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data.
   FindingsFour themes were identified as protective factors against suicidal ideation: suicidal denial and fears of stigmatization; positive coping skills; family connectedness; and desire to live well and longer.
   DiscussionConsistent with previous research, these four protective factors may encourage participants to think more positively about life and cancer.
   ConclusionOur findings suggest four protective factors for targeted suicide prevention, which may play an important role in future suicide-prevention programmes for Chinese patients diagnosed with stomach cancer.
   Implications for nursingNurses may help reduce patients' risk for suicidal ideation more effectively by discussing beliefs, family and meaning in life perspectives, as well as offering health education about positive coping skills.
   Implications for healthy policyClinical nurses, hospitals and the government should work collaboratively with each other. It is suggested that Chinese national guidelines for working with the high-risk suicide populations should be considered within a future mental health working plan.

AB Suicide is among the leading causes of death in China. However, technical approaches toward preventing suicide are challenging and remaining under development. Recently, several actual suicidal cases were preceded by users who posted microblogs with suicidal ideation to Sina Weibo, a Chinese social media network akin to Twitter. It would therefore be desirable to detect suicidal ideations from microblogs in real-time, and immediately alert appropriate support groups, which may lead to successful prevention. In this paper, we propose a real-time suicidal ideation detection system deployed over Weibo, using machine learning and known psychological techniques. Currently, we have identified 53 known suicidal cases who posted suicide notes on Weibo prior to their deaths. We explore linguistic features of these known cases using a psychological lexicon dictionary, and train an effective suicidal Weibo post detection model. 6714 tagged posts and several classifiers are used to verify the model. By combining both machine learning and psychological knowledge, SVM classifier has the best performance of different classifiers, yielding an F-measure of 68.3%, a Precision of 78.9%, and a Recall of 60.3%.

AB Background: The self-presentation of suicidal acts in social media has become a public health concern. Aims: This article centers on a Chinese microblogger who posted a wrist-cutting picture that was widely circulated in Chinese social media in 2011. This exploratory study examines written reactions of a group of Chinese microbloggers exposed to the post containing a self-harming message and photo. In addition, we investigate the pattern of information diffusion via a social network. Methods: We systematically collected and analyzed 5,971 generated microblogs and the network of information diffusion. Results: We found that a significant portion of written responses (36.6%) could help vulnerable netizens by providing peer-support and calls for help. These responses were reposted and diffused via an online social network with markedly more clusters of users - and at a faster pace - than a set of randomly generated networks. Conclusions: We conclude that social media can be a double-edged sword: While it may contagiously affect others by spreading suicidal thoughts and acts, it may also play a positive role by assisting people at risk for suicide, providing rescue or support. More research is needed to learn how suicidally vulnerable people interact with online suicide information, and how we can effectively intervene.

AB A retrospective study of autopsy cases was conducted at the Department of Forensic Medicine, Tongji Medical College (DFM-TMC), in Hubei, China to describe the characteristics of poisoning deaths from 1999 to 2008. A total of 212 poisoning deaths were investigated by DFM-TMC during the 10-year period. The poisoning deaths ranged from 17 cases in 1999 to 27 cases in 2008. Of the 212 cases, 82 deaths (38.7%) were from pesticides, 36 deaths (17.0%) from carbon monoxide, 34 deaths (16.0%) from drugs, 22 deaths (10.4%) from alcohol, 17 deaths (8.0%) from other chemicals, 15 deaths (7.1%) from poisonous plants and animals, and six deaths (2.8%) from heavy metals. Of the 82 pesticide poisoning deaths, 43 (52.4%) cases were caused by rodenticides, mainly tetramine (N = 39). The majority of poisoning deaths were accidents (63.7%), followed by suicides (25.9%) and homicides (3.8%). The manner of death could not be determined in 14 cases (6.6%).

AB This paper describes emergent stigma-related themes from individual descriptions of living with HIV in Liuzhou, China. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 23 people living with HIV (PLHIV). To provide contextual information, 14 public health personnel and 4 community workers in Liuzhou were also interviewed. PLHIV experienced enacted, anticipated, and internalized HIV-related stigma, which resulted in negative affective, behavioral, and physical health outcomes, including barriers to health care, preemptive self-isolation, suicidal ideation, and poverty. To lessen stigma, future programs should aim to increase HIV knowledge and empathy for PLHIV among family members, community workers, and health professionals. HIV programs should also include suicide risk assessment for PLHIV, especially immediately after diagnosis and at the onset of HIV-related symptoms.

AB Demoralization is a form of psychological distress that may cause suicidal ideation. Demoralization syndrome is common among cancer patients, but there has been little empirical study on the association of suicidal ideation with demoralization, depression, and anxiety in this population. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of high demoralization among cancer patients in mainland China and the contribution of high demoralization to suicidal ideation beyond the impact of self-report depression and anxiety. In this cross-sectional study, 303 patients with cancer were invited to complete questionnaires. In total, 14.5% participants reported suicidal ideation and 49.50% high demoralization. Logistic regression analysis identified high demoralization as an independent risk factor for suicidal ideation. Only depression (odds ratio [OR], 6.68) had a stronger influence on suicidal ideation than demoralization (OR, 5.85), and patients with both depression and high demoralization were most likely to experience suicidal ideation. These findings suggest that measures of demoralization can help identify cancer patients at high suicide risk and that such patients require further attention and measures targeting demoralization for suicide prevention.

AB Objective: The present study examined ADHD symptoms among college students in China and the United States. Method: A total of 283 (45%) American and 343 (55%) Chinese students completed the Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS) and the Current Symptoms Scale (CSS), in addition to other measures. Results: Both of the ADHD measures appear to be reliable and valid, with good internal consistency, similar factor structures, and predicted relationships with other variables, such as depression and self-esteem. However, differences exist between the cultures in gender and overall reported symptom severity. Conclusion: ADHD symptomatology is present among college students in China in a pattern similar to that found in American college students. The WURS and the CSS appear to be effective screening measures for the disorder in China, although further research on gender and cultural differences is necessary. (J. of Att.

AB Background: Suicide is a global public health problem that has a significant negative influence on individuals, families and the society. The objective of this study is to explore the risk factors associated with suicidal ideation among the elderly in Shandong Province, China.
   Method: A total of 3313 participants (60+) of Shandong Province, China were included in this study. Suicidal ideation was assessed by using questions from the NCS (National Comorbidity Survey). Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the factors associated with suicidal ideation. Path analysis was conducted to test the direct and indirect association between factors and suicidal ideation.
   Results: The prevalence of suicidal ideation among the seniors in Shandong, China was 4.2%. Depression had the strongest direct (beta=0.303, p-value < 0.05) and total effect (beta=0.303), life satisfaction (beta=-0.103, p-value < 0.05; beta=-0.136, p-value < 0.05), economic status (beta=-0.046, p-value < 0.05; (beta=-0.040, p-value < 0.05) had both direct and indirect impacts on suicidal ideation. Social support (beta=-0.040, p-value < 0.05) had indirect influence on suicidal ideation. Depression was a mediator between life satisfaction, economic status, social support and suicidal ideation.
   Limitations: The data used in this study was cross-sectional, and the relationship between identified factors and suicidal ideation cannot be interpreted as cause-effect.
   Conclusions: Depression was the strongest influencing factor of suicidal ideation among the elderly, followed by life satisfaction, economic status. Active intervention measures focusing on the depression screening and treatment both in urban and rural communities should be taken to prevent suicide.

AB To date, few studies have examined the association between difficulties in activities of daily living (ADL) and suicidal ideation (SI) among the seniors in China. This study aims to explore this association among older adults in China. A total of 3313 older people (60+) were included in this study, and questionnaires were administered by face-to-face interview. In total, 4.2% of the participants reported SI. The mean score of ADL among older adults with SI (21.06 +/- 10.92) was much higher than that in those without SI (16.13 +/- 5.60). Multivariate analyses showed that some specific domains of ADL including using transport, medical care, and household activities were associated with SI even after we controlled the psychological conditions. An association was observed between difficulties in daily living and SI among older adults in China. Psychological interventions should be taken to prevent potential risk of suicide targeting the seniors with certain disabilities.

AB Background Anxiety is a common comorbidity in major depressive disorder (MDD) that has been studied extensively in the past. However, few studies have explored anxiety in drug naive (FEDN) patients with MDD and those presenting with a first episode. The objective of this current study was to examine the prevalence and risk factors of anxiety in FEDN patients with MDD in order to understand the relationship between MDD and anxiety in the acute early phase and provide important implications for therapeutic interventions.
   Methods: A total of 1718 FEDN patients with MDD were recruited in this cross-sectional study. Their anthropometric and clinical data, including suicide attempt and psychotic symptom, were collected. The Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) and Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) were used to evaluate depression and anxiety for all the patients in this study.
   Results: Overall, we found that the prevalence of anxiety in FEDN MDD patients was 80.3%. Correlation analysis showed that anxiety was associated with suicide attempt and psychotic symptom in FEDN patients with MDD. The rate of suicide attempt and psychosis in above patients with anxiety was 24.3% and 12.3%, respectively. Furthermore, stepwise regression analysis showed that suicide attempt and psychotic symptom were significant predictors for anxiety in FEDN patients with MDD.
   Conclusions: Our study showed that the prevalence of comorbid anxiety in FEDN patients with MDD is very high. We also found that two clinical variables, suicide attempt and psychosis, are risk factors for comorbid anxiety in FEDN patients with MDD.

AB This study aims to determine the 12-month and lifetime prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and its sociodemographic correlates.
   A total of 5,926 subjects were randomly selected and interviewed.
   The overall 12-month and lifetime prevalence of GAD was 0.8%, and 1.2%, respectively. Being older than 25 years and female, lower education level, unemployed status, and lower (< RMB500/month) or higher (> RMB2000/month) monthly income were associated with increased risk of GAD.
   The low percentage of subjects treated for GAD indicates a major public health problem that should be addressed.

AB Study Objectives: Suicide risk begins to increase during adolescence. Adolescents do not get enough sleep and are also at risk for many sleep disturbances. This study examined the association between sleep patterns and sleep problems and adolescent suicidal behavior.
   Design and Setting: A questionnaire survey of adolescents attending school was conducted in one prefecture of Shandong Province, People's Republic of China.
   Participants: A total of 1,362 adolescents attending school (mean age 14.6 years, 60% males) participated in the survey.
   Measurements: Respondents completed a self-administered questionnaire that asked about sleep patterns, sleep problems, suicidal behavior, depressive symptoms, and demographic characteristics of the family and adolescent.
   Results: Overall, 19.3% of the sample reported having suicidal ideation, 10.5% having suicide attempts in the past 6 months, 16.9% having insomnia symptoms, 2.3% having taken hypnotic medication, and 48.9% having experience of nightmares in the past month. Mean night sleep duration was 7.6 hours (SD = 0.8). Logistic regression analyses showed that sleeping less than 8 hours at night (OR = 2.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07-7.81) and frequent nightmares (OR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.76-3.35) were significantly associated with increased risk for suicide attempts after adjustment for age, sex, father's occupation, and depressive symptoms and that nightmares (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.20-2.38) were also significantly related to suicidal ideation.
   Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the association between short sleep duration and nightmares and suicidal behavior and highlight the potential role of sleep intervention in the prevention of adolescent suicide.

AB People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) have higher rates of suicide than does the general population. It is critical to interpret the intricate relationships among various psychological variables that increase the risk of suicidal ideation among PLWHA in China. An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted from Jul to Aug 2016 in Nanjing, China, using a self-reporting questionnaire. A total of 465 PLWHA participated. Sociodemographic, psychological variables and suicide information about the participants were collected. Structural equation modeling (SEM)-path analysis was used to analyze the cross-sectional data. The final structural equation model had a highly satisfactory fit. Among PLWHA, perceived stigma had the greatest accumulated total effect on suicidal ideation, with both a direct effect and indirect effect through self-esteem and depression. Additionally, self-esteem had the second greatest total effect on suicidal ideation and was influenced by social support. Depression contributed directly to suicidal ideation and partly mediated the association of perceived stigma and self-esteem with suicidal ideation. These findings suggest that self-esteem and depression, particularly perceived stigma, play important roles in suicidal ideation among PLWHA. Enhancing personal self-esteem or social support might also reduce perceived stigma and may be an important target for intervention to decrease suicidal ideation among PLWHA.

AB Among 112 homicides involving sexual intimates that occurred in Hong Kong between 1989 and 2002, 38% ( n = 42) of offenders remained voluntarily at the homicide scene, 21% (n = 24) committed suicide, 20% (n = 22) escaped and denied involvement, 13% (n = 14) disposed or hid the body of their victim, and 9% (n = 10) escaped but later voluntarily surrendered. This study used police investigation reports, coroner's reports, witness statements, and other relevant documents to compare these five types of postkilling behavior. The type of response was explained by the offender's characteristics, the strength of attachment to the victim, and situational factors. The offender's prior criminal conduct or history of violence was not significant in predicting the type of postkilling response.

AB Background: Few studies have focused on depression and social support in Eastern populations, especially women in rural China. Our research investigated depression among women in rural China, and studied the relationships between social support and depression.
   Methods: We recruited women ages 16 years and older from north Sichuan. Participants completed socio-demographic measures, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and the Duke Social Support Index. The analysis method included descriptive statistics and logistic regression.
   Results: The final sample included 1,898 participants with a mean age of 48.6 years, and the prevalence of significant depressive symptoms was 12.4%. Results suggest being unemployed, having poorer perceived health/economic status, and lower social support were positively associated with depression. Younger age and greater social support were negatively associated with depression.
   Conclusions: This study provides insights on the psychological health of women in rural China and potential directions for future research. These issues are especially pertinent during this time of rapid economic transformation and outmigration in rural China.

AB Objectives
   To examine predictive power of psychache and life satisfaction on risks for suicidal ideation and suicide attempt among young people.
   Design
   A cross-sectional study.
   Setting
   Data were collected from an online survey in Wuhan, China.
   Participants
   5988 university students from six universities were selected by a stratified cluster sampling method.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures
   Suicidal ideation and suicide attempt at some point of the students' lifetime were the outcomes of interest.
   Results
   Students with suicidal ideation or attempted suicide reported a lower level of life satisfaction and high degree of psychache than counterparts without suicidal ideation or attempt. Regression analyses indicated that life satisfaction and psychache were significantly associated with the risk of suicidal ideation and the risk of suicidal attempt. Though psychache showed a relatively stronger predictive power than life satisfaction, the effect of the two factors remained significant when they were individually adjusted for personal demographic characteristics. However, when the two factors were included in the model simultaneously to adjust for each other, psychache could fully explain the association between life satisfaction and suicidal attempt. Life satisfaction remained to contribute unique variance in the statistical prediction of suicidal ideation.
   Conclusions
   Psychache and life satisfaction both have a significant predictive power on risk for suicidal behaviour, and life satisfaction could relieve the predictive power of psychache when suicidal behaviour is just starting. Shneidman's theory that psychache is the pre-eminent psychological cause of suicide is perhaps applicable only to a more serious form of suicidal behaviour.

AB Suicidal ideation is life-threatening and is prevalent among people living with HIV (PLWH). A dearth of such studies was conducted in China. This study investigated the prevalence of suicidal ideation and associated factors among PLWH who were former blood and/or plasma donors (FBPD) in a rural county in central China. Prospective respondents were randomly selected from a local registry; 176 PLWH who were FBPD joined the study. With informed consent, these PLWH and their spouse were interviewed separately and anonymously. Respectively, 34 and 8% of the sampled (index) PLWH self-reported having suicidal ideation and making a suicidal attempt in the last year. The multivariate analyses results showed that the index PLWH's Physical Function subscale score of the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey scale (Odds ratio (OR)=6.67, 95% CI=1.69-26.27, 25 percentiles against 75 percentiles), the Depression subscale score of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS; OR=9.26, 95% CI=1.32-64.77), and the spouse's Depression subscale score of the DASS (OR=7.64, 95% CI=1.37-42.77) were independently associated with the index PLWH's suicidal ideation. HIV-related variables (e.g., duration of diagnosis, treatment and side effects) and perceived discrimination of the index PLWH, and HIV status of the PLWH's spouse, were not significant factors. Depression is a risk factor for suicides. Moreover, depression may be contagious and the depression status of the spouse also matters. Treatments for depression and prevention intervention for suicides targeting PLWH in rural China are not readily available. Such services are greatly warranted and need to be provided to both the PLWH and his/her spouse.

AB The aim of this study was to examine insomnia symptoms, behavioral problems, and suicidality among adolescents of insomniac parents (IP) and non-insomniac parents (NIP). A family survey of sleep and health was conducted among 1090 adolescents and their parents in Jinan, China. Adolescents completed a sleep and health questionnaire to report their sleep and mental health problems. Parents reported their insomnia symptoms and history of mental disorders. Insomnia, behavioral problems, and suicidal behavior were compared between IP adolescents and NIP adolescents. IP adolescents were more likely than NIP adolescents to report insomnia symptoms, use of sleep medication, suicidal ideation, suicide plan, and suicide attempt. IP adolescents scored significantly higher than NIP adolescents on withdrawn and externalizing behavioral problems. After adjustment for demographics and behavioral problems, parental insomnia remained to be significantly associated with adolescent suicidal ideation and suicide plan. Our findings support the need for early screening and formal assessment of sleep and mental health in adolescents of insomniac parents. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of media representations of suicides on the subsequent increase of suicide rate has been researched for decades. Yet the underlying psychological mechanism of such media influences on individual's suicidality remains uncertain. Based on the conceptual framework of social cognitive theory, this article discusses the operationalization of media influences on suicidal ideation by using a psychometric approach. It then develops and tests a theoretical model to explain the mechanism of media influences on suicidal ideation. A two-wave panel study with a randomized population sample was carried out in the Hong Kong SAR, China with the results indicating that the proposed operationalization closely fit the data collected and empirically supported the theoretical model. Reciprocal associations between prior suicidal ideation and processes of media influences were also confirmed. The results also tested the factorial invariance across age groups and different pre-existing levels of suicidal ideation. This study reports the first individual-level finding on the theoretical relationship between media influences and suicidal ideation, as well as the first psychometrically validated operationalization of media influences on suicidal ideation.

AB Background: Little is known about risk factors of suicidal behavior among Chinese adolescents. This study examined the associations between negative life events, psychopathology, and suicidal behavior in rural adolescents of China.
   Methods: A total of 1362 adolescent students in a rural prefecture of China completed a self-administered questionnaire concerning suicidal behavior, psychopathology, life events, and demographics. Data analyses were conducted using multivariate logistic regression modeling.
   Results: Females were more likely to report suicidal ideation than males (22.0% vs. 17.5%). While the rate of suicide attempt was slightly higher in younger males (12-15 years) than in females (4.7% vs. 3.1%), the rate was higher in older females (16-18 years) than in males (12.7% vs. 9.5%). Suicide attempters reported more negative life events during the past year than suicidal ideators and non-suicidal adolescents. Academic stress and family conflicts were the major stress domains of adolescents at risk for suicidal behavior. A significant dose-response relationship was observed between the number of life events and suicidal behavior. Negative life events were also associated with increased risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. Both internalizing and externalizing problems were significantly associated with elevated risk for suicidal behavior after negative life events were controlled.
   Limitations: This is a cross-sectional study. Longitudinal study is warranted to examine the roles of life stress in adolescent suicidal behavior.
   Conclusions: Adolescents who experienced more negative life events are at increased risk for suicidal behavior. Both internalizing and externalizing problems mediate the effect of life events on adolescent suicidal behavior. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the associations between negative life events, social support, depressive and hostile symptoms, and suicide risk according to gender in multinational Asian patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). A total of 547 outpatients with MDD (352 women and 195 men, mean age of 39.58 +/- 13.21 years) were recruited in China, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Taiwan. All patients were assessed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the Symptoms Checklist 90-Revised, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and the List of Threatening Experiences. Negative life events, social support, depressive symptoms, and hostility were all significantly associated with suicidality in female MDD patients. However, only depressive symptoms and hostility were significantly associated with suicidality in male patients. Depression severity and hostility only partially mediated the association of negative life events and poor social support with suicidality in female patients. In contrast, hostility fully mediated the association of negative life events and poor social support with suicidality in male patients. Our results highlight the need of in-depth assessment of suicide risk for depressed female patients who report a number of negative life events and poor social supports, even if they do not show severe psychopathology.

AB This research note reports on a study that examined the psychological strains among migrant workers in China, and the potential negative life impact of these strains. It was hypothesized that psychological strains, resulting from social and psychological conflicts (value strain, aspiration strain, deprivation strain and coping strain), would be associated with greater psychological distress. Most of the sampled migrant workers experienced at least one of four types of strain. Independently, greater levels of all four types of strain were related to elevated self-reported psychological distress. Regression analyses showed that coping strain was the strongest predictor of psychological distress, whereas deprivation strain was not predictive when other types of strain were simultaneously considered. It is concluded that further research regarding the combined impact of social and personal factors in impacting both healthy and unhealthy psychological outcomes within the population of migrant workers in China is needed.

AB This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of pesticide poisoning in Jiangsu Province, China, and to provide a scientific basis for developing effective interventional measures and preventive strategies. From 2006 to 2015, a total of 35,308 cases of pesticide poisoning were reported in Jiangsu Province. Non-occupational poisoning accounted for 73.79% of all poisoning cases. A comparison of the data collected before (2006) and after (2015) this study showed a decrease in non-occupational pesticide poisoning. Pesticide poisoning showed an age central tendency of 30 to 44 years, area central tendency for northern Jiangsu, and seasonal central tendency of occupational pesticide poisoning in autumn. Pesticide poisoning remains a major health concern in China. Government agencies together with scientists should focus their efforts on the prevention of potential threats to vulnerable groups such as the elderly, women, and children.

AB Background: East Asian countries have high suicide rates. However, little is known about clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with suicidality in Asian populations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors associated with suicidality in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) from six Asian countries.
   Methods: The study cohort consisted of 547 outpatients with MDD. Patients presented to study sites in China (n = 114), South Korea (n = 101), Malaysia (n = 90), Singapore (n = 40), Thailand (n = 103), and Taiwan (n = 99). All patients completed the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Global Severity Index(SCL-90R), the Fatigue Severity Scale, the 36-item short-form health survey, the Sheehan Disability Scale, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Patients were classified as showing high suicidality if they scored >= 6 on the MINI suicidality module. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine sociodemographic and clinical factors related to high suicidality.
   Results: One hundred and twenty-five patients were classed as high suicidality. Unemployed status (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.43, p < 0.01), MADRS score (adjusted OR 1.08), p < 0.001, and GSI (SCL-90R) score (adjusted OR 1.06, p < 0.01) were positively related to high suicidality. Hindu (adjusted OR 0.09, p < 0.05) or Muslim (adjusted OR 0.21, p < 0.001) religion and MSPSS score (adjusted OR 0.82, p < 0.05) were protective against high suicidality.
   Conclusions: A variety of sociodemographic and clinical factors were associated with high suicidality in Asian patients with MDD. These factors may facilitate the identification of MDD patients at risk of suicide.

AB Heroin users are at high risk for suicide. However, the epidemiological profile of suicidal behaviors in Chinese methadone-maintained patients remains largely unknown. This study determined the prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation among Chinese methadone-maintained patients. A total of 603 methadone-maintained patients were consecutively recruited from three methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) clinics in Wuhan, China, and administered with standardized questionnaires to collect sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological data. Suicidal ideation was measured with a single self-report question "Have you ever thought about committing suicide?". Depression and anxiety were assessed with Zung's Self-rating Depression Scale and Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale, respectively. The one-month and lifetime prevalence rates of suicidal ideation were 17.9% and 58.9%, respectively. In multiple logistic regression, lifetime suicidal ideation was significantly associated with female (OR: 1.69), an educational attainment of primary school and below (OR: 1.47), fair and poor interpersonal relationship (OR: 2.20), a history of injecting heroin (OR: 1.60), depression (OR: 1.38), and anxiety (OR: 4.00). Methadone-maintained patients of MMT clinics have a high prevalence of suicidal ideation and therefore at high risk for suicide. Suicide prevention efforts at MMT clinics should include periodic evaluation of suicidality, psychosocial supports, and, when necessary, psychiatric treatment and crisis intervention.

AB This study assessed the extent to which social sexism affects Chinese women's perception and evaluation of other women's performance. A sample of 100 college women was selected in a top university in Beijing, China, and was asked to read six scholastic essays and then evaluate the quality of the essays and competence of the authors. Male and female names were randomly assigned as authors of the essays, and the respondents were blind to the arrangement. Results showed that the essays assumed to be written by male authors did not receive higher scores than those assumed to be written by female authors on quality or competence items. Sexism is not marked among these highly educated young women.

AB This study aims to examine the relationship between the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and 14-year outcomes of schizophrenia in a Chinese rural area. Participants with schizophrenia (n = 510) were identified in an epidemiological investigation of 123 572 people aged 15 years and older in 1994 and followed up in 2008 in Xinjin, Chengdu, China. Longer DUP (> 6 months) was common in participants (27.3%). In 1994, participants with DUP <= 6 months were more likely to have a significantly lower rate of suicide attempts, shorter duration of illness and higher rate of full remission compared with those with DUP > 6 months. No significant differences were found regarding the rates of survival, suicide, death due to other causes and homelessness between individuals with shorter and longer DUP in 2008. Nevertheless, longer DUP (> 6 months) of participants in 2008 was significantly associated with higher mean of PANSS total negative and general mental scores, longer duration of illness and higher rate of live alone in the logistic regression model. Earlier identification, treatment and rehabilitation, and family intervention should be addressed when developing mental health policies and delivering community mental health services.

AB The impact of sociodemographic and clinical factors on subjective quality of life (SQOL) in Chinese schizophrenia outpatients was explored. Randomly selected subjects with schizophrenia (N = 273) were assessed with respect to their sociodemographic, clinical characteristics, and SQOL. Compared with the Chinese general population, patients had significantly lower scores in the physical and social SQOL domains. Multiple regression analyses revealed that depressive symptoms inversely predicted all SQOL domains; positive symptoms negatively predicted psychological, social, and environmental SQOL domains whereas educational level, extrapyramidal side effects, anxiety, history of suicide attempts, employment status, monthly income, number of hospitalization, and length of illness all significantly contributed to 1 or 2 SQOL domains.

   ADOLESCENTS; IMPACT; TRENDS; VICTIMIZATION; PERSONALITY; RELIABILITY
AB Background Suicide is still the leading cause of death in the 15 to 34-year age group, especially for girls aging 15 to 19-year old. In China particularly, the suicide rate of female is 60% higher than male. The gender difference on suicidal ideation and its patterns with academic, family, social and health-risk factors is unknown among adolescents in Beijing, China.
   Methods A total of 33 635 students in grades 7-12 in Beijing participated in the 2014 Chinese Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance. Data were stratified by gender and associations with suicidal ideation were analyzed using chi(2) test and multivariate regression analyses. The interaction effects on suicidal ideation between gender and the related behaviors were also analyzed.
   Results The prevalence of suicidal ideation was significantly higher for girls (13.3%) than boys (10.7%). The multivariate regression analyses indicated that high academic pressure, running away from home, feeling lonely or sad/hopeless, being bullied, fighting, and binge drinking were significantly associated with suicidal ideation in boys and girls. Factors more strongly associated with suicidal ideation in girls than boys were being in junior vs senior high school (girl vs boys: 1.24 vs NA), high academic pressure (2.42 vs 1.55), ever smoking (1.52 vs NA), binge drinking (1.30 vs 1.17), fighting once (1.63 vs 1.06) and being sad/hopeless (2.39 vs 2.04) and their interaction with gender were all statistically significant (P<0.05). A lower likelihood of suicidal ideation was found among boys, but not girls, who had PE class two or more days per week.
   Conclusions Girls showed more vulnerability to suicidal ideation than boys particularly among girls in junior school, reporting high academic pressure, smoking, binge drinking and fighting. The combinations of risk factors and differential patterns for boys and girls point to high-risk groups and potential targets for gender-specific suicide prevention.

AB Introduction To date no study has compared the treatment patterns for schizophrenia specifically between China and Japan. This study examined the cross-national differences in the use of psychotropic drugs and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in schizophrenia.
   Method Data on 3248 schizophrenia inpatients (n = 1524 in China and n = 1724 in Japan) were collected by either chart review or interviews during the designated 3 study periods between 2001 and 2009. Patients' socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, prescriptions of psychotropic drugs, and ECT use were recorded using a standardized protocol and data collection procedure.
   Results Multivariate analyses revealed that compared to their Japanese counterparts, Chinese inpatients had a shorter length of current hospitalization, were significantly less frequently prescribed second-generation antipsychotics (except clozapine), antipsychotic polypharmacy, benzodiazepines, and mood stabilizers, and more likely to receive clozapine, antidepressants, and ECT.
   Discussion Substantial variations in inpatient treatment patterns for schizophrenia were found between China and Japan. The common use of ECT and clozapine in Chinese inpatients and the frequent use of antipsychotic polypharmacy and high antipsychotic doses in Japanese inpatients need to be addressed.

AB Background: Air pollution has become an important factor restricting China's economic development and has subsequently brought a series of social problems, including the impact of air pollution on the health of residents, which is a topical issue in China. Methods: Taking into account this spatial imbalance, the paper is based on the spatial panel data model PM2.5. Respiratory disease mortality in 31 Chinese provinces from 2004 to 2008 is taken as the main variable to study the spatial effect and impact of air quality and respiratory disease mortality on a large scale. Results: It was found that there is a spatial correlation between the mortality of respiratory diseases in Chinese provinces. The spatial correlation can be explained by the spatial effect of PM2.5 pollutions in the control of other variables. Conclusions: Compared with the traditional non-spatial model, the spatial model is better for describing the spatial relationship between variables, ensuring the conclusions are scientific and can measure the spatial effect between variables.

AB China has a highly centralized bureaucracy that is no longer strictly monitored by political loyalty but by governance performance (e.g., economic growth), rewarded with promotion and monetary incentives. In the early 2000s, environmental criteria were added to this system. As part of this effort, a high-powered performance management system was introduced in 2006. It held high-level provincial officials, who are part of the nomenklatura, personally responsible for meeting specific emissions targets. Using data from China Statistics Yearbooks and several official news archives, the empirical results indicate that the implementation of the new performance management system reduced emissions only for air pollutants, which are the most publicly visible among the targeted pollutants. Water pollution, which is less visible but also a mandated target, was unaffected. Emissions of soot, an untargeted pollutant, were also unaffected. The findings imply that, even in centrally managed systems like China, compliance with a high-stakes reward for measured performance is not universal.

DE Cultural Revolution; Red Guards; violence; mass movement; Maoism
AB The author investigated the so-called "Red August" of 1966, the start of large-scale violent persecution during China's Cultural Revolution. She interviewed hundreds of teachers and students from ninety-six schools and reviewed all available written materials. This article provides a detailed description of how educators were insulted, tortured, and even killed by their students. Mobilized as members of a new youth organization named "Red Guards," the students attacked the educators for being "capitalist intellectuals." In those schools, twenty-seven educators were murdered; more committed suicide subsequent to torture. Cruel oppression silenced resistance. Stories about bloody campus persecutions were too politically sensitive following the Cultural Revolution, so have heretofore received scant attention in the historical narrative. As the author shows, given the high regard China has traditionally held for education, the brutalizing of educators in China was an unprecedented act. The objective of this article is to reveal the texture and significance of this underreported and under appreciated part of China's history. Causes and ramifications are discussed and analyzed.

AB Background: Studies suggest that sexual minority adolescents experience higher rates of sleep disturbance than their heterosexual peers, and disturbed sleep is a well-known risk factor for suicidality. This study aimed to explore whether sleep quality had mediating effects on the relationship between sexual minority status and suicidal behavior in Chinese adolescents.
   Methods: We analyzed data collected from 7th to 12th graders from seven randomly selected provinces of People's Republic of China in the 2015 School-Based Chinese Adolescents Health Survey. The 123,459 students who completed questionnaires regarding sexual attraction, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, past-year suicidal ideation, and past-year suicide attempts were included in our study (response rate: 95.9%).
   Results: After adjustment for covariates, sexual minority status was associated with suicidal ideation (adjusted odds ratio =1.82, 95% CI=1.69-1.95) and suicide attempts (adjusted odds ratio =2.16, 95% CI=1.82-2.56). Sleep quality partially mediated the effects of sexual minority status on suicidal ideation (standardized beta estimate=0.009, 95% CI=0.007-0.012) and suicide attempts (standardized beta estimate=0.004, 95% CI=0.003-0.005).
   Conclusion: Poor sleep quality partially explained the increased risk of suicidality for Chinese sexual minority adolescents. To prevent subsequent suicidality, suicide interventions targeting sexual minorities should be made, with a focus on their disparities in sleep disturbance and sleep health promotion.

AB Recognizing the complementary effects of social contexts and psychiatric disorders, this study clarifies the role of gender in suicidal behavior in urban Mumbai by considering psychiatric diagnoses and patient-identified sociocultural features. The cultural epidemiological approach suggests the critical impact of situational sociocultural factors that complement the customary psychopathological accounts for those who harm or kill themselves. The cultural epidemiology of deliberate self-harm (DSH), it is argued, is critical to planning for suicide prevention, community mental health and psychiatric practice. This study, based on a cultural epidemiological framework, compares male and female admissions for DSH, evaluating conditions with SCID-I and EMIC interviews. We assessed features and narratives of suicidal behavior, patient-identified underlying problems, their perceived causes and triggers. The study included 92 women and 104 men. A diagnosis of depressive disorder was made for 48.9 percent of women and 39.4 percent of men. Many patients (50.0 percent of women and 41.3 percent of men) did not fulfill the criteria for any diagnosis, or did so only for an adjustment disorder or a V-code. Men typically explained DSH with reference to work problems, financial problems and problem drinking. Women typically discussed domestic problems, in-law relations and victimization. Problem drinking affected women living with men who drank. Social and situational factors appear to play a relatively greater role than psychiatric illness in self-harm and suicide in Mumbai, as in other Asian studies, compared with Europe and North America.

AB Aims: As a top ambient pollutant in urban area, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been associated with the occurrence and deterioration of many medical conditions, while limited studies have observed the association with psychiatric conditions. This study aimed to investigate the association between short-term PM2.5 exposure and psychiatric emergency events, and further explored the variation by age, sex and seasonal patterns, which have been suggested to be associated with both psychiatric risk and pollutant toxicity.
   Methods: We used time-series analysis to investigate the association between short-term exposure of PM2.5 and emergency ambulance dispatches for psychiatric emergencies (EPE) (n = 158634) in Beijing, one of the top polluted cities in China during the study period between 2008 and 2014. Stratified analyses were conducted to examine the effects of age, sex and seasonal pattern.
   Results: Every 10 mu g/m(3) increase of the PM2.5 concentration was associated with a 0.12% increase of the same-day overall EPE (95% CI: 0.03-0.22%, p = 0.013) and a 0.12% increase of the suicide-related EPE at lag 2 (95%CI: 0.01-0.24%, p = 0.041). The associations remained when adjusted for sunlight duration. An age effect was observed where children (age < 18) showed a higher risk of suicide-related EPE after PM2.5 exposure compared to adults (18 <= age <= 64). We did not observe evidence of effect modification by sex and season based on the results of stratified analysis.
   Conclusions: We found a positive association between acute PM(2.5 )exposure and increased psychiatric emergency presentations indicated by emergency ambulance dispatches data. Children were more vulnerable and might develop psychiatric problems including those leading to suicide. Public awareness of the health risks of PM2.5 is important to strengthen current efforts to reduce emissions.

AB Completed suicide (CS) is a leading cause of death worldwide and its rates are available for most developed countries. On the other hand, attempted suicide (AS) is a risk factor for CS but there are limited data on its rates in various countries. In constructing a ratio for AS/CS rates, most would agree that for CS, the denominator should be the annual suicide rate ( per 100 000). As for the ratio's numerator (AS) per 100 000, there are three possible calculations: (1) annual prevalence from population surveys, (2) annual prevalence from national clinical registers or (3) lifetime prevalence from population surveys. We think that the first possibility would probably be the best choice but, unfortunately, surveys providing the annual prevalence of AS are lacking for most countries. Annual prevalence from national registers is also lacking for most countries and is contaminated by under-reporting. Therefore, in this editorial, we are left with only the last option, a ratio for lifetime prevalence of AS (per 100 000) divided by annual rate of CS (per 100 000). This ratio for AS/CS rates appears to differ substantially across countries worldwide but presents no big regional differences other than two remarkable exceptions, one per continent. In Europe, Spain and France had greater ratios (174.4 and 152.5, respectively) than Italy (64.1). In Asia/Pacific, New Zealand has a higher ratio (345.9) compared with China (75.8) and Japan (76.9). The ratio for AS/CS rates could be a good index for implementing evidence-informed decision-making regarding suicidal behaviour (SB) among health service managers, and for helping them in the allocation of health resources for the prevention of SB.

AB BackgroundSuicide is the second leading cause of death among 15-29year old youths globally, and the third most common external cause of death in China. School bullying can cause serious consequences among adolescents, including psychosocial problems, low self-esteem and post-traumatic stress disorder. Most studies examining the associations between being bullied in school and suicide are from Western, developed countries. Moreover, few studies focus on being threatened or injured with a weapon, which may cause serious body injury. Our study aimed to explore the relationship of being threatened or injured with a weapon in school with suicidal ideation and attempt among middle and high school students in Zhejiang Province, China.MethodsA cross-sectional study of 23,543 students in grades 7-12 from 442 schools was carried out through an anonymous self-administered questionnaire between April and May 2017. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship of being threatened or injured with a weapon in school with suicidal ideation and attempt.Results51.3% of participants were boys, and mean (SD) age was 15.6 (1.7) years. The overall prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempt were 16.1% (95%CI: 15.3-16.9) and 3.6% (95%CI: 3.3-4.0), respectively. Prevalence was higher among girls than boys (ideation: 19.1% vs. 13.3%. attempt: 4.4% vs. 2.9%). 13.2% of students reported being threatened or injured with a weapon in school in the past 12months (95%CI: 11.9-14.5), higher among boys than girls (15.7% vs. 10.5%), and among rural students than urban students (13.9% vs. 11.6%). After adjustment for socio-demographic status, lifestyle factors, academic performance, self-reported health and mental health, the odds ratios for suicidal ideation and attempt among students who reported being threatened or injured with a weapon were 1.46 (1.31-1.61) and 1.68 (1.31-2.13) respectively, as compared with those who did not report being threatened or injured.ConclusionsPreventive measures for physical bullying in school need to be reinforced in China. Being threatened or injured with a weapon is associated with both suicidal ideation and attempt among middle and high school students. Suicide prevention should be an important component of psychological interventions for threatened or injured students.

AB The digital revolution facilitates a prominent feature of public engagement with the Internet. Human flesh search (HFS) is called "cyber manhunt" or "cyber crowdsourcing". It has autonomous and collective nature and action. Many scholars proclaimed that HFS is considered as a unique online phenomenon in the Greater China region. A promising female writer committed suicide due to her teacher's sexual assault when she was a teenager, which has provoked an intensive cyber debate and HFS in Taiwan. HFS worked like police-netizens, tracked down the perpetrator, and pushed the lawmakers to institute legal mechanism. The implications for interdisciplinary collaborations were reviewed.

AB This study examined the influence of immediate social environment on health compromising behaviors (HCB) among 6564 high school students in China. Results showed that physical abuse by parents was a major risk factor that accounted for high rates of HCB. Perceived positive school experience and social support were protective factors associated with low rates of HCB. These two protective factors also buffered the adverse influence of abuse on the practice of individual HCB. In particular, parental abuse was associated with sexual experimentation, non-fatal self-harm, and suicide behaviors only at low levels of protective factors.

AB The aim of this study was to analyze data from toxic substance-related cases in Northeast China (Heilongjiang Province) reported between 2000 and 2010, and to investigate the associations among the classes of toxic substances detected with gender, age, season, district of occurrence, and type of case. Pesticides, drugs, and alcohol were detected using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or flame ionization detection. Carbon monoxide levels were measured using ultraviolet spectrometry, and levels of cyanides, nitrites, and acid were monitored using the chemical colorimetry method. Among a total of 565 cases, 208 (36.8%) were related to accidental injury/death, 175 (31.0%) to suicide, 80 (14.2%) to homicide, 43 (7.6%) to robbery, 29 (5.1%) to fire or arson, 20 (3.5%) to intentional injury/death, 7 (1.2%) to rape, and 3 (0.5%) to kidnapping. Men constituted 65.3% of the total 565 victims, most of who were between the ages of 31 and 50 years, with the average age being 44 years. The highest number of cases (126) was reported from Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang Province. Pesticide-related cases accounted for 37.9% of the cases, with more cases occurring between April and August. Methomyl (48 cases) and fluoroacetamide (38 cases) were the most common pesticides involved in these cases. Drug-related cases accounted for 19.5% of the total poisoning cases, with benzodiazepines being the most commonly detected drugs (45 cases). More than 70% of alcohol-related cases involved the use of alcohol in crime (or affair) execution, with the blood alcohol concentration being less than 350 mg/100 mL in these cases. Carbon monoxide was detected in 16.1% of the cases, with a higher yearly incidence noted in winter. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide an overall analysis of toxic substance-related cases in Northeast China. Similar to the findings observed in Central China (Hubei), our findings indicated that pesticides were the major cause of poisoning in the Heilongjiang Province of Northeast China.

AB To report public health practitioners' perceptions of injury prevention in Changsha, China. We undertook a cross-sectional study at Changsha, Hunan, China. An anonymous self-reported survey was conducted to ascertain the proportion of respondents who answered negatively to questions about the value of injury prevention. Over 20% of respondents answered 'unpreventable' or 'don't know' to whether injuries from natural environmental disaster, homicide/assault, poisoning, animal bite, cut/pierce, suffocation and electric current were preventable. More than 40% of respondents answered 'no' or 'don't know' to whether the prevention of injuries from homicide/assault, cut/pierce, fall, suicide/self-harm, drowning, road traffic crash and fire/burn belonged to the job of public health. Only 48% of respondents supported building a division/office within the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions at all levels. Many public health practitioners in Changsha had misperception about injury prevention. Education and training are needed to correct their misperception.

AB Due to its fast economic growth and lifestyle changes, China is experiencing a rapid epidemiological transition from communicable to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Mental disorder such as depression is an important yet often neglected NCD and is becoming a growing cause of disability, suicides, and disease burden. This paper provides the first nationally representative estimate of the medical cost attributable to depression and depressive symptoms among the adult population in China. On the basis of the 2012 China Family Panel Studies survey, our results indicate that these mental health conditions have significant impacts on the individual medical expenditure, and they jointly contribute to 14.7% of total personal expected medical spending in China, with depression and depressive symptoms accounting for 6.9% and 7.8%, respectively. Given that patients with mental illness face multiple psychological and institutional barriers in seeking appropriate treatment, the high depression-induced medical costs may be primarily driven by the cost-shifting effect from mental health care to general health care, as mental disorders often coexist with other NCDs such as diabetes and hypertension. As an implication, our study calls for an urgent reform of China's mental health and insurance systems to remove the policy-induced obstacles for the access to mental health care resources.

TI Urban-Rural Disparities in Injury Mortality in China, 2006

LA English
DT Article
DE China; disparity; injury; mortality; rural; urban
ID RATES; AREA; RISK
AB Context: Urban-rural disparity is an important issue for injury control in China. Details of the urban-rural disparities in fatal injuries have not been analyzed.
   Purpose: To target key injury causes that most contribute to the urban-rural disparity, we decomposed total urban-rural differences in 2006 injury mortality by gender, age, and cause.
   Methods: Mortality data came from the Chinese Vital Registration data, covering a sample of about 10% of the total population. The chi-square test was used to test the significance of urban-rural disparities.
   Findings: For all ages combined, the injury death rate for males was 60.1/100,000 in rural areas compared with 40.9 in urban areas; for females, the respective rates were 31.5 and 23.6/100,000. The greatest disparity was at age < 1 year for both sexes, where the rate from unintentional suffocation in rural areas was more than twice the urban rate. The higher mortality from drowning among males of all ages and among females ages 1-24 and 35+ contributed substantially to the age-specific urban-rural disparities. For both sexes, transportation incidents and suicide were the most important contributors to higher rates among rural residents ages 15+.
   Conclusions: Unintentional suffocation, drowning, transportation incidents, and suicide not only are the major causes of injury death, but also play a key role in explaining the urban-rural disparities in fatal injuries. Further research is needed to identify factors leading to higher rural death rates and to explore economical and feasible interventions for reducing injuries and narrowing the urban-rural gap in injury mortality.

AB Background: Suicidal risk begins to increase during adolescence and is associated with multiple biological, psychological, social, and cultural factors. This study examined the prevalence and psychosocial factors of parent-reported suicidal behavior in Chinese adolescents.
   Methods: A community sample of 1920 adolescents in China participated in an epidemiological study. Parents completed a structured questionnaire including child suicidal behavior, illness history, mental health problems, family history, parenting, and family environment. Multiple logistic regression was used for data analysis.
   Results: Overall, 2.4% of the sample talked about suicide in the previous 6 months, 3.2% had deliberately hurt themselves or attempted suicide, and 5.1% had either suicidal talk or self-harm. The rate of suicidal behavior increased as adolescents aged. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that the following factors were significantly associated with elevated risk for suicidal behavior: depressive/anxious symptoms, poor maternal health, family conflict, and physical punishment of parental discipline style.
   Limitations: Suicidal behavior was reported by parents. No causal relationships could be made based on cross-sectional data.
   Conclusions: The prevalence rate of parent-reported suicidal behavior is markedly lower than self-reported rate in previous research. Depressive/anxious symptoms and multiple family environmental factors are associated with suicidal behavior in Chinese adolescents. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although China's government is rapidly expanding access to antiretroviral therapy, little is known about barriers to adherence among Chinese HIV-infected patients, particularly among injection drug users. To better understand barriers to antiretroviral treatment adherence, we conducted a qualitative research study, using both focus group and key informant methods, among 36 HIV-positive men and women in Dali, in southwestern China. All interviews utilized semi-structured question guides and were conducted in Mandarin, audio-recorded and translated into English for analysis. The most commonly cited adherence challenges were stigma, including secondary stigma experienced by family members; mental health issues; and economic concerns, particularly related to finding and maintaining employment. Distinctive gender differences emerged, partly due to previous heroin use among male respondents. Optimizing adherence may require that antiretroviral therapy programs be linked to other services, including drug addiction treatment, mental health services and vocational treatment and support. HIV care and service providers and policy makers in China responsible for HIV treatment should be aware of these important barriers to adherence.

AB Background: Tetramine, or tetramethylenedisulfotetramine, is an internationally banned compound that had been used primarily as a rodenticide. Despite its regulatory status, there are widespread reports of its intentional use in human poisonings, primarily in China, and often in mass poisonings. Enhanced governmental regulations were implemented in 2003 to further reduce the availability of tetramine, though the effects of these regulations, and the current use of tetramine, remains unknown.
   Methods: Reports from the website of the China News Agency were collected from 2000 to 2012. Details such as the location, date, and intent of the events were compared before and after the regulations were implemented.
   Results: There were a total of 148 events during the study period (95 from 2000 to 2003, and 53 after 2003). There were a total of 3526 victims, including 225 fatalities. The majority of the events were homicidal/terroristic in nature. The incidence of events fell after 2006. More poisoning events occurred in central China, such as Henan and Jiangsu province, and an increase was noted in April and September.
   Conclusion: Tetramine poisoning events, as reported in the national Chinese media, fell after the implementation of strict regulation on tetramine. The causal relationship is not known.

AB This paper examines the moral community thesis in the secular context of China. Using multilevel logistic regression, we test (1) whether both individual- (measured by affiliation with Islam, Buddhism and Christianity) and aggregate-level religiosity (measured by the number of mosques, Buddhist temples, and churches per 10,000 people in province) are inversely related to law and rule violations at the individual level and (2) whether province-level religiosity enhances the inverse relationship between individual religiosity and deviant behaviors. Results from the 2010 China General Social Survey and the Spatial Explorer of Religions provide some support for the moral community proposition that contextual religiosity affects deviance at the individual level. Specifically, we find provincial as well as individual level of Islam to be inversely related with the violation of the law and rules. However, we find that neither the provincial level of Christianity and Buddhism nor cross-level interaction is related to deviance. The only exception, cross-level interaction involving the individual and provincial level of Islam, is in the opposite direction (i.e., positive, not negative). The implications of our findings are discussed.

AB This article is based on ethnographic fieldwork carried out among what Lian Si (2009) has called China's ant tribe', referring to the millions of unemployed Chinese college graduates who live in the outskirts of Beijing and to some extent share the predicament of China's migrant workers. Education has been the main route to social mobility for centuries in China, but today college graduates are outnumbering jobs in China's large cities. I focus on the relationship between the fantasy of education as a route to social mobility and the actuality. By narrating the biographies of two university graduates, Jing Jing and Bai Gang, who attempted but partly failed to transcend the boundary between rural and urban China, I show how their quests for social mobility and a more fulfilling life were tied to economic, legal and cultural constraints. I argue that the quest for a better life through educational migration may lead to physical mobility, but that existential mobility is lacking and this sometimes leads to instances of suicide, just as is the case for Chinese migrant workers who feel trapped in appalling working conditions.

AB This study examined the time trend and pattern of HIV/AIDS-related deaths in China. Data on HIV deaths and AIDS deaths were provided by the Chinese Ministry of Health. Time trend of the overall death rates over the period 2000-2012 was examined using Poisson regression models. Pattern of AIDS deaths was examined for the period 2006-2012, using the age-, gender-, and region-specific death rates. The results indicated that HIV/AIDS-related death rate increased significantly in China over the past decade, with an average annual percentage change of 22.3%. A vast majority of the deaths occurred among those aged between 20 and 65 years, with two age peaks. The death rate was higher for males than females and in rural areas than urban areas. A total of 83% of the deaths occurred among rural residents and 67% among males. The upward trend and distribution pattern of HIV/AIDS-related deaths depicted in the present study not only provides valuable information for additional understanding of the dynamics of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in China, but also has implications for evidence-based public health intervention strategies and policies as well as for further studies.

AB Objective: Little is known about relations between religious involvement and suicidal behaviors in mainland China. This study aims to examine the association between religious involvement and suicidal ideation, planning, and attempts within a general community population controlling for socio-demographic, physical, and mental health factors. Method: Data were examined from a population-based sample of 2,769 community-dwelling adults in the province of Ningxia China, where nearly 40% are Muslim, 11% other religious affiliations, and 49% no religion. Four separate logistic regression models examined correlations between religious involvement and self-reported suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts. Analyses were also stratified by Muslim affiliation (n = 1103) and no religion (n = 1,366). Results: Bivariate analyses in the overall sample demonstrated that higher personal religiosity scores (chi(2) = 6.8, p < 0.01) and total religiosity scores (chi(2) = 5.1, p < 0.05) were positively correlated with developing a suicidal plan, which disappeared after controlling for demographic characteristics. Otherwise, no significant correlations were found between any religious characteristic and suicidal ideation, plan, or attempt in either Muslims or those with no religion. Conclusions: In contrast to most previous studies, religious involvement plays less of a role in suicidal behaviors in at least one province of mainland China.

AB Purpose To determine the prevalence and associated risk factors of suicidal ideation (SI) among junior, senior high and college school students.
   Methods A total of 5249 students in Anhui Province of China participated in a self-administered anonymous survey.
   Results Females were more likely to report SI than males (32.1% vs. 20.6%). Using binary logistic regression analysis, we found that being female, passive coping, lower family satisfaction, lower school satisfaction, lower living environment satisfaction and higher self-esteem were associated with an increased risk of SI.
   Conclusions This study suggested that SI was common among Chinese adolescents. Being female, high score of passive coping, lower family satisfaction, lower school satisfaction, lower living environment satisfaction and higher self-esteem were significantly associated with an increased risk of SI. There is an urgent need to take effective measures reducing the rate of SI among adolescents through collaboration among families, schools and society.

AB Eager to build an integrated community-based mental health system, in 2004 China started the '686 Programme', whose purpose was to integrate hospital and community services for patients with serious mental illness. In 2015, the National Mental Health Working Plan (2015-2020) proposed an ambitious strategy for implementing this project. The goal of this review is to assess potential opportunities for and barriers to successful implementation of a community-based mental health system that integrates hospital and community mental health services into the general healthcare system. We examine 7066 sources in both English and Chinese: the academic peer-reviewed literature, the grey literature on mental health policies, and documents from government and policymaking agencies. Although China has proposed a number of innovative programmes to address its mental health burden, several of these proposals have yet to be fully activated, particularly those that focus on integrated care. Integrating mental health services into China's general healthcare system holds great promise for increased access to and quality improvement in mental health services, as well as decreased stigma and more effective management of physical and mental health comorbidities. This article examines the challenges to integrating mental health services into China's general healthcare system, especially in the primary care sphere, including: accurately estimating mental health needs, integrating mental and physical healthcare, increasing workforce development and training, resolving interprofessional issues, financing and funding, developing an affordable and sustainable mental health system, and delivering care to specific subpopulations to meet the needs of China's diverse populace. As China's political commitment to expanding its mental health system is rapidly evolving, we offer suggestions for future directions in addressing China's mental health needs.

AB Background: Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15- to 29-year-olds in China, and 60 % of suicidal patients have a history of depression. Previous brain imaging studies have shown that depression and suicide may be associated with abnormal activity in default mode network (DMN) regions. However, no study has specifically investigated the relationship between DMN functional activity and suicidal behavior in depressed individuals. Therefore, in the present study, we directly investigated features of DMN brain activity in adolescent patients with histories of depression and attempted suicide.
   Methods: A total of 35 sex-and age-matched suicidal depressed patients were compared with 18 non-suicidal depressed patients and 47 healthy controls. We explored functional activity changes in DMN regions that could be associated with suicidal behavior by comparing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) signals using independent component analysis (ICA). Scores on six clinical scales that measure depression severity (Hamilton Depression Scale (HDRS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)) and suicidal traits (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), Suicide Attitude Questionnaire (SAQ), Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), and Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI)) were compared in the three groups.
   Results: Compared with the healthy controls, all of the evaluated depressed patients showed increased functional connectivity in select DMN regions. The suicidal patients showed increased connectivity in the left cerebellum and decreased connectivity in the right posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), whereas the non-suicidal depressed patients showed increased connectivity in the left superior frontal gyrus, left lingual gyrus and right precuneus and decreased connectivity in the left cerebellum. Compared to the non-suicidal patients, the suicidal patients showed increased connectivity in the left cerebellum and the left lingual gyrus and decreased connectivity in the right precuneus. No differences in the scores of any clinical scales were found between the suicidal and non-suicidal depressed patients.
   Conclusions: Collectively, our results highlight the importance of the DMN in the pathophysiology of depression and suggest that suicidal behavior in depressed adolescents may be related to abnormal functional connectivity in the DMN. In particular, abnormal connectivity in the PCC/precuneus and left cerebellum might be a predictor of suicidal behavior in depressed adolescent patients.

AB The fact that in 2010 eighteen young workers attempted suicide at Foxconn production facilities in China has attracted worldwide attention. Drawing on research conducted in Foxconn factories in three regions of China-the Pearl River Delta, the Yangtze River Delta, and West China-the authors trace the development of the Foxconn Technology Group as a case that demonstrates the aggressive nature of capital expansion in China and its impact on the lives of Chinese workers. While the Foxconn Group produces Apple products for the world's consumers, it simultaneously produces a new Chinese working class, the majority of whom are young migrant laborers. The authors claim that in China the state played a significant role in accelerating global capital accumulation. The authors hope to make sense of the way that a state-capital alliance is shaping a new form of labor recruitment and labor use. This article analyzes the emerging labor regime, specifically, the use of student labor in the process of Foxconn's expansion in China. First, the article discusses the ways in which the state contributes to the rise of monopoly capital by supplying workers who are both cheaper and younger. Second, the article examines how the new labor regime, established by Foxconn, generates more pressure on workers, leading to increased levels of anxiety and desperation among young factory workers. The article's principal research question is how a labor crisis was structurally produced in a mega global factory regime, when a new youth working class was emergent in China.

AB Background: Deliberate self-poisoning with agricultural pesticides is the commonest means of suicide in rural Asia. It is mostly impulsive and facilitated by easy access to pesticides. The aim of this large observational study was to investigate the immediate source of pesticides used for self-harm to help inform suicide prevention strategies such as reducing domestic access to pesticides.
   Methods: The study was conducted in a district hospital serving an agricultural region of Sri Lanka. Patients who had self-poisoned with pesticides and were admitted to the adult medical wards were interviewed by study doctors following initial resuscitation to identify the source of pesticides they have ingested.
   Results: Of the 669 patients included in the analysis, 425 (63.5%) were male; the median age was 26 (IQR 20-36). In 511 (76%) cases, the pesticides had been stored either inside or immediately outside the house; among this group only eight patients obtained pesticides that were kept in a locked container. Ten percent (n = 67) of the patients used pesticides stored in the field while 14% (n = 91) purchased pesticides from shops within a few hours of the episode. The most common reasons for choosing the particular pesticide for self-harm were its easy accessibility (n = 311, 46%) or its popularity as a suicide agent in their village (n = 290, 43%).
   Conclusion: Three quarters of people who ingested pesticides in acts of self-harm used products that were available within the home or in close proximity; relatively few patients purchased the pesticide for the act. The study highlights the importance of reducing the accessibility of toxic pesticides in the domestic environment.

AB Objective: As there is growing evidence outlining varying degrees of social, economic and cultural changes among minority groups in China, there was a need to undertake research to determine whether modernization and urbanization of China has had an impact on the mental health of individuals from minority groups. In 1979, the Jino ethnic minority group was the last minority group to be designated a minority by the Chinese Central Government. As a direct result of the Chinese Government intervention, the Jino society began transitioning from a traditional rural lifestyle existence to that of a more modern urban lifestyle. Our objective was to explore whether changing social and economic influences had impacted the mental health of the Jino people.
   Methods: A longitudinal study over three decades was undertaken to determine the mental health of the Jino People.
   Results: From our initial study in 1979 and subsequent follow-up studies in 1989, 1999 and 2009, there were no significant changes found for 1-month prevalence, lifetime prevalence and prognosis for schizophrenia and mental retardation among the Jino population researched. For major depressive disorders, there were significant differences, suggesting a rising trend not only in 1-month prevalence but also in lifetime prevalence. We found significant differences had occurred over the three decades for alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence and Korsakov's psychosis. At the same time, the annual suicide incidence had increased at least three times in 2009 compared to that of 1989.
   Conclusion: Results from our three-decade longitudinal repeated cross-sectional survey show that due to rapid social, economic and cultural changes among the Jino people, serious social and mental health problems such as alcohol-related disorder, suicide and major depressive disorders have increased.

AB Objectives. To estimate the unintentional poisoning burden and risk Factors in China From 1990 to 2015.
   Methods, We extracted data From the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 to compare mortality, prevalence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost, years lived with a disability, and risk Factors of unintentional poisoning in China. We determined We median of the percent change and 95% uncertainty interval For the period between 1990 and 2015.
   Results, The age-standardized unintentional poisoning death rate decreased by 61.8% from 1990 (4.1 per 100 000) to 2015 (1.6 per 100 000). The age-standardized prevalence decreased From 1990 (87.9 per 100 000) to 2010 (39.0 per 100 000), but rebounded in 2015 (42.6 per 100 000). All risk factors combined accounted For 14.9% of unintentional poisoning DALYs in 2015. The leading risk Factors For unintentional poisoning DALYs were alcohol and drug use and occupational risks.
   Conclusions. China has made substantial progress in reducing the mortality attributable to unintentional poisoning, but the prevalence and absolute number of patients has been increasing again since 2010. The growing contribution from alcohol and drug use requires increased attention.

AB Globalization, brought about by the rapid development of Information and Communication Technology, offers clear opportunities and benefits for the world economies but comes with substantial social costs that appear to affect many people, especially the youth. The world's researchers have paid the greatest attention to adolescents, a special group of youth whose transition from being children to adulthood, has been most affected by the period of globalization. This paper is aimed to study the future perspectives, of place identity, among adolescent students living in rural China. The primary data were collected from 317 adolescent students at Grade 9 and Grade 12, who attended high schools in rural China. The results indicated that the respondents were more willing to live in big cities and that traditional music styles were neither popular nor attractive to them. Among the participating adolescents, place identity concerning their current living area was weak, which might impact upon the sustainable development of the rural areas. Moreover, social problems such as 'left behind children,' high rates of suicide, etc. might occur which would require the attention of scholars, worldwide.

AB Previous studies have identified global associations between sleep quality and suicidal ideation. However, little is known regarding the relationship between sleep quality and suicidal ideation among Chinese older adults. We examined the relationship between sleep quality and suicidal ideation in older adults in China. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 3313 seniors in Shandong, China. Suicidal ideation was assessed using the interviewees' answers to the question "Have you ever seriously considered wanting to die?". Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Logistic regression was performed to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals adjusted for confounders. When controlling for sex, age, living condition, economic status, marital status, education, past occupation, relationship with children, non-communicable diseases, and mental health, the odds of suicidal ideation increased in association with an increase in the total score for sleep quality and its components (subjective sleep quality, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, and daytime dysfunction). Poor sleep quality was associated with increased odds of suicidal ideation in Chinese older adults. Sleep-based interventions should be developed to prevent suicide in older adults in China.

AB People with suicidal ideation (PSI) are increasingly using social media to express suicidal feelings. Researchers have found that their internet-based communication may lead to the spread of suicidal ideation, which presents a set of challenges for suicide prevention. To develop effective prevention and intervention strategies that can be efficiently applied in online communities, we need to understand the behavior of PSI in internet-based communities. However, to date there have been no studies that specifically focus on the behavior of PSI in Chinese online communities. A total of 4489 postings in which users explicitly expressed their suicidal ideation were labeled from 560,000 postings in an internet-based suicidal community on Weibo (one of the biggest social media platforms in China) to explore their behavior. The results reveal that PSI are significantly more active than other users in the community. With the use of social network analysis, we also found that the more frequently users communicate with PSI, the more likely that users would become suicidal. In addition, Chinese women may be more likely to be at risk of suicide than men in the community. This study enriches our knowledge of PSI's behavior in online communities, which may contribute to detecting and assisting PSI on social media.

AB Background: This study examined the tendency and suicidal behavior rates of Chinese adult inpatients with different types of mental disorders from 2010 to 2015. The aim was to provide some interesting clues for further studies. Methods: Adult patients with mental disorders who were hospitalized in Beijing Anding hospital from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2015 were included. Chi-square tests were used to compare the difference among inpatients with mental disorders by gender and year. Frequency, trend and suicidal behavior rates of inpatients with mental disorders were graphed. Results: A total of 17,244 psychiatric adult inpatients were included in our study. About 53.2% of the inpatients had mood disorders, followed by schizophrenia, which accounted for 34.6%. The proportion of female inpatients with mental disorders was larger than that of males (52.6% to 47.4%). Of the total, 3296 psychiatric inpatients were recognized as having suicidal behaviors. The rate of suicidal behavior among all inpatients was 19.1%, and it varied over the years. The suicidal behavior rate of female inpatients with mood disorders was much higher than that of the corresponding male inpatients. Conclusions: The presence of suicidal behavior varied among people with different types of mental disorders. For each type of mental illness, identifying the risk of specific suicide behavior would help tailor-make preventive efforts accordingly.

AB Aims. Suicidal behaviour is prevalent among adolescents and is a significant predictor of future suicide attempts (SAs) and suicide death. Data on the prevalence and epidemiological characteristics of suicidal behaviour in Chinese adolescents are limited. This study was aimed to examine the prevalence, characteristics and risk factors of suicidal behaviour, including suicidal thought (ST), suicide plan (SP) and SA, in a large sample of Chinese adolescents. Method. This report represents the first wave data of an ongoing longitudinal study, Shandong Adolescent Behavior and Health Cohort. Participants included 11 831 adolescent students from three counties of Shandong, China. The mean age of participants was 15.0 (s.d. = 1.5) and 51% were boys. In November-December 2015, participants completed a structured adolescent health questionnaire, including ST, SP and SA, characteristics of most recent SA, demographics, substance use, hopelessness, impulsivity and internalising and externalising behavioural problems. Results. The lifetime and last-year prevalence rates were 17.6 and 10.7% for ST in males, 23.5 and 14.7% for ST in females, 8.9 and 2.9% for SP in males, 10.7 and 3.8% for SP in females, 3.4 and 1.3% for SA in males, and 4.6 and 1.8% for SA in females, respectively. The mean age of first SA was 12-13 years. Stabbing/cutting was the most common method to attempt suicide. Approximately 24% of male attempters and 16% of female attempters were medically treated. More than 70% of attempters had no preparatory action. Female gender, smoking, drinking, internalising and externalising problems, hopelessness, suicidal history of friends and acquaintances, poor family economic status and poor parental relationship were all significantly associated with increased risk of suicidal behaviour. Conclusions. Suicidal behaviour in Chinese adolescents is prevalent but less than that previously reported in Western peers. While females are more likely to attempt suicide, males are more likely to use lethal methods. Multiple child and family factors are associated with suicidal behaviour. These findings highlight the importance of early screening and intervention of suicidal behaviour in Chinese adolescents.

AB Objective: This study examined the time trends and age distribution patterns of estimated road traffic fatalities (RTFs) in China over the period 2002-2012. Methods: Data on age-, sex-, and region-specific RTF rates were provided by the Chinese Ministry of Health. The crude rates were standardized and the Mann-Kendall test was used to test the significance of time trends. Annual number of RTFs was calculated. To minimize the effect of yearly variations, magnitude of changes in and age distribution patterns of the RTFs were examined using mean values of 2years. Results: RTFs increased significantly in China during the study period. Several features were identified for the RTFs in China. First, RTF rates skyrocketed in rural areas including towns and counties. Second, a significant increase in RTFs was also observed in cities even though the change in RTF rates was not statistically significant there. Third, individuals aged 20-24, 40-49, and 55-64, especially in rural areas, were particularly at risk for RTFs in recent years. Finally, RTFs became more common among middle-aged and older adults than young Chinese, with roughly 57% of all RTFs occurring among individuals aged 45 and above during 2011-2012. Conclusions: RTFs increased dramatically in China during the past decade, especially in rural areas. Age distribution patterns of RTFs have changed there. Community-based public health education and intervention programs are warranted.

AB China has a population of 1.3 billion, of which 238 million are children under age 15. The rapid economic development and social reforms that have taken place in recent years all had a great influence on child and adolescent mental health. Though a nationwide prevalence study for child and adolescent mental disorders in China is lacking, several regional studies have shown the prevalence of mental disorders in children to be close to the worldwide prevalence of 20%. This article reviews the current status of Chinese child psychiatry, the prevalence of specific disorders in China and the influence of culture on the diagnosis and treatment of child and adolescent mental disorders. Several important social issues are also explored in detail, including the one child policy and left-behind children of migrating workers. Changes in family structures along with the growing competitions in life have weakened the traditional social support system. As a result childhood behavioral problems, mood disorders in young college students, substance abuse and youth suicide are all increasing in China. Many who suffer from mental disorders are not adequately cared for because the scarcity of qualified service providers and pathways to care. This article also lists some challenges and possible solutions, including the multidisciplinary and culture sensitive service model for child mental health. Relevant laws, policies and regulations are also introduced.

ID COMMUNICATION
AB After the publication of data in the media on suicide at Foxconn and direct incrimination of the organizational culture, created the need to respond to the company's management reports. The image of the company is irretrievably fact that the first time was not considered a threat to the company. The situation got worst and worse because at the new cases of suicides in the early 2011. It was the first time the company realized that the management staff seemed not to go well. Parameters such as leadership style job satisfaction, work environment, job burnout and the management of information from the media are first placed under the microscope of the management of Foxconn.
   In all its communication company managers insisted that the treatment of employees was "world class" and no one can argue with that. The Foxconn, in response to international survey, insisted that "offers its employees a very healthy and productive work environment by ensuring the many benefits." Foxconn's management stated that it was not the style of leadership was to blame for the consecutive suicides, or working conditions or methods of rewarding employees. The company spokesman Edmund Ding said the incidents were due to "personal problems" of employees who have made suicide attempts. He stressed that all suicides were from the "class" of Nongmingong, which made them more vulnerable against high operational requirements.
   The human resources department of the company in a statement to the media confirmed that the incidents of suicides due to immaturity and fragility of the character of those who have committed, stressing that those belonging to groups of new immigrants from the provinces, highlighting the reluctance of the administration to consider the factors occupational burnout probably exhausted mentally and physically employees.
   The company's management insisted on the position that it bore no responsibility for suicide even when suicides receiving alarming society of Shenzhen. The CEO of Foxconn, Terry Gou, said the unanimous unwillingness of the company management to take measures to tackle the ever increasing suicides at Foxconn. At the same time Apple emphasized the wrong attitude of the administration towards handling Foxconn suicides. The problem of lack of communication over the local community of Shenzhen and society Foxconn, froze on degrading the urgent need to find solutions from the company's management.
   For the Apple, Foxconn's main concern should be to ensure a healthy working environment for its employees and the opening of the company in academic research, in order to clarify the operational and social factors that drive employees to the job exhaustion. The event is supported by Daisey and Glass (2012), which suggest through their research on the grant of the responsibilities of HR to external managers-probably from Europe or America-from countries that have formed political management of workers with more favorable terms.
   At this point, however, we should emphasize that the "Foxconnian Culture" places restrictions on research on issues that affect them and the management and dissemination of information out of it. This is in complete alignment with the national culture of China in accordance with the theory GLOBE ranks highly in countries favoring occultism and lack of communication problems. This means that the culture of Foxconn would be difficult to put on a new foundation that would give priority to solving the problems rather than the communication itself or this ban.
   Two years after the business crisis faced by successive Foxconn suicides of employees, we want to study in this article the changes requested to do to deal with the consequences. What changes have been invited to make the administration to meet the company to adverse comments in the media; What was the stimulus and what its response to this; The largest electronics manufacturer in the world, was invited in 2010 to deal with a large corporate crisis that brought the face of social disapproval. But it seems that he tried to change data concerning both the internal culture and its management to respond to the problem. In this article we study the transformations that had to do Foxconn to meet society's demands for a more human treatment of the problem of suicide in order to formulate effective measures and by making these important operational changes.

AB Background: As China is going through a profound aging process, the mental health of the elderly is becoming an issue. As in many other societies, the elderly in China is a population at high risk of suicide; Methods: Data for the study were taken from the Sample Survey of the Aged Population in Urban/Rural China (SSAPUR) accomplished in 2010 by the China Ministry of Civil Affairs. The valid sample for this study was composed of 18,683 individuals, including 9416 urban residents and 9267 rural residents both aged 60 or more years; Results: Logistic regression analyses showed that household income and expenditure, the number of children, chronic diseases, disability of daily living, depression, the frequency of visiting neighbors and having friends or relatives who can help or not had remarkable effects on the suicidal ideation among urban and rural old people. Gender, education, political affiliation, marital status and self-rated health status did not work on the dependent variable. However, some risk factors for suicidal ideation among the Chinese elderly were different between rural and urban regions; Conclusions: We should take different measures when facing the different groups of the elderly.

TI Mental Health Care in China: Providing Services for Under-treated
   Patients
SO JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH POLICY AND ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Mental health in China is a great concern given the large number of patients and huge social and economic costs. The one-month prevalence rate of adult mental disorder in China is about 17.5%. Over 170 million adults have one or more types of mental disorder. Of this, 16 million people are estimated to have serious mental diseases. Over 90% of patients with serious mental diseases in China have not been given proper medical treatment. Over 60% of suicide cases in China are associated with mental disorders and suicide is the most significant reason for death between 19 and 34 years old in China.
   Aims of the Study: This paper reviews the mental health care condition in China and discusses policy implications, given current import issues for mental health care.
   Method: We review research literature for mental health care in China and collect reports from various published sources.
   Results: Under-supply of the mental health services is the most pivotal issue for policymakers. The utilization of mental health care services in China has increased by double digits in recent years. In 2011, outpatient visits for mental health care were over 27 million. The situation is aggravated by the lack of qualified doctors and the shortage of physical infrastructures such as wards and equipment, leading to many patients with mental disorders being under-treated and under-reported. There are only 1.46 psychiatrists per 100,000 people and 15 beds per 100,000 people. Current government input for mental health in China accounts for less than 1% of total health expenditure. According to the 12th Five-Year Program (2 0 1 12 0 1 5), the Chinese government will increase its spending on the prevention and treatment of mental health care. The mental health law has been passed by the National People's Congress in October, 2012 and will come into effect on May 1st, 2013. The financial coverage of patients with mental diseases and relevant regulations for involuntary admission are still being debated.
   Discussion: Three more issues are discussed. First, the lack of provision of mental health care for vulnerable groups is serious. Second, the opportunistic behavior of both patients and suppliers of mental health care should be addressed. Thirdly, the extraordinary high share of involuntarily admitted patients should be reduced.
   Implications for Health Care Provision and Use: Mental health care provided in primary care clinics and community is both complement and substitutable for hospital care and should be supported for government to relieve the undersupply condition.
   Implications for Health Policies: First, government should increase financial support for mental health care provision. Second, mental health care provided at community level should be supported and carefully designed by government.
   Implication for Further Research: Future research should focus on two issues. First, how mental health care services can be provided more efficiently at community level? Second, how can a national mental health care law be helpful to reduce the number of involuntarily admitted patients?

AB Background: Recently, an emerging group of studies has reported the association between Body Mass Index (BMI) and suicidal ideation in the Western countries. However, this relationship is still unclear with controversial results, and we have little knowledge about this relationship in China which is one of few countries reported higher suicide rates.
   Methods: This study aims to analyze the association between BMI and suicidal ideation among seniors (60 years old) in Shandong, China. A total of 3313 seniors were included in the data analysis. Suicidal ideation, weight, height, socio-demographic and psychological variables were evaluated in this study. Logistic regression was conducted to explore the association between BMI and suicidal ideation among male and female seniors.
   Results: The results showed that 42% of the seniors reported suicidal ideation, and 3.4% for men, 4.9% for women. After controlling social-demographic variables, economic status, physical disease, social support and mental health, an inverse relationship between BMI and suicidal ideation was found for men, but not for women. Mental health was still an important factor associated with suicidal ideation.
   Conclusion: The results inform health care professors that underweight in male seniors can be associated with higher risk of suicidal ideation in China. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was first introduced in China in the early 1950s and has evolved into a significant psychiatric treatment. Research from Chinese psychiatrists provides important clinical data for ECT practitioners. However, most of the research has only been published in Chinese language journals. This article summarizes data from publications in the Chinese scientific community related to the clinical practice of ECT and research on efficacy in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.
   Methods: Descriptive study primarily based on Chinese language literature identified from searches of the China National Knowledge Infrastructure and the Medline databases (1979-2012).
   Results: More than 900 journal papers on ECT have been published in the Chinese language between 1979 and 2012. Currently, modified ECT has replaced unmodified ECT, and treatments were performed both in inpatient and outpatient settings. Electroconvulsive therapy is primarily used for the treatment of schizophrenia and mood disorders and has been shown to be very effective in both. The primary use of ECT in China is in the treatment of schizophrenia. The Chinese literature provides a rich database on the efficacy of modified and unmodified ECT, with and without adjunctive antipsychotics, in the treatment of schizophrenia.
   Conclusion: The Chinese medical literature provides an important database that will help advance the practice of ECT in both China and the international community.

ID DIRTY WORK; LABOR; CHINA
AB In 2010, a cluster of suicides at the electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn Technology Group sparked worldwide outcry about working conditions at its factories in China. Within a few short months, 14 young migrant workers jumped to their deaths from buildings on the Foxconn campus, an all-encompassing compound where they had worked, eaten, and slept. Even though the language of workplace dignity was invoked in official responses from Foxconn and its business partner Apple, neither of these parties directly examined workers' dignity in their ensuing audits. Based on our analysis of media accounts of life at Foxconn, we argue that its total institution structure imposed unique indignities on its workers that both raised questions of their self-respect and self-worth, as well as gave rise to multiple episodes of disrespectful communication. We interpret our findings in light of the larger cultural context and meanings of work in China to understand more fully the experience of dignity of Foxconn's migrant workforce.

AB It is generally true that the incarcerated population is one of the most vulnerable groups in almost every country. Although plenty of evidence on the health and deaths of the incarcerated population have been studied in different countries, there is still little availability of related information in China. Focusing on the Hunan province in the south central part of China, this paper aims to evaluate the characteristics of forensic pathology and epidemiology of the controversial deaths in the incarcerated population in China. During the evaluation process we have reviewed 61 cases which were autopsied by the Hunan Xiangya Judicial Identification Center from 2006 to 2013. The data are collected and analyzed from the point of view of demographics variables (age, gender, ethnicity and education level) and incarceration-related variables (number of incarcerations, place of imprisonment, cause of controversy and cause of death). The majority of the 61 cases are male (91.8%), and the leading age (63.8%)is within 31 to 50 years old. All the deceased are ethnic Han and most of them (75.5%) failed to complete the compulsory 9-year education in China. Jail (40.9%) and prison (32.8%) are the leading places where the deaths occur. The number of deaths during the study period exhibits fluctuations from year to year, with a slight decreasing trend. Violence-related death suspected by families and prosecutors constitutes 62.3% and has become the primary causes for disputes. Overall, 80.3% of deaths are due to illnesses, out of which 39.4% died of acute death, 26.2% of chronic diseases and 14.7% of infectious diseases; a cause of death not related to illness accounts for 19.7% of the total. The most frequent cause of death is sudden cardiac arrest (37.8%) in acute death; the cardiovascular disease (9.9%) is the most common cause of death in chronic diseases and suicide cases account for 14.9%, being the leading cause of non-illness related cases. Among the 61 controversial deaths reviewed in this paper, the causes of death are correlated with a diversity of factors. Therefore, it is necessary to take various preventive measures in order to decrease the number of deaths, depending on the different causes.

AB Since April last year, a large number of bosses in Wenzhou of China have ran away or committed suicide. It is because they had borrowed the loan sharks and couldn't pay back the several hundred million Yuan. As the similar things happened again and again, Private lending crisis in Wenzhou burst out. The government had to take measures to prevent the spread of the crisis, since the crisis do tremendous damage to the financing market and the real economy. On March this year, the government announced to set up financial reform pilot area in Wenzhou to lead private financing to make standard development. Private financing, which was always trading secretly, is now becoming open to the public. In this text, we will discuss the cause of private lending crisis and make a detailed analysis of this financing reform to see the effectiveness and shortages of it and the long prospect of private financing.

AB There has been a dramatic increase in rural-urban migration in China over the last two decades but there are few studies on the mental health of Chinese internal migrants. This study assesses the prevalence of depressive symptoms (DS) and their associated factors among migrant factory workers in Shenzhen, China. A questionnaire survey was sent to 4,280 migrant workers in 2009 with a response rate of 95.5%. Clinically relevant DS were identified using the Chinese version of the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depressive Scale. There is a high prevalence (21.4%) of clinically relevant DS among internal migrant factory workers. Higher scores were associated with being a minority, shorter intension of stay, working long hours, being a casual smoker or a frequent Internet user, and having better education. Stakeholders should be aware of the needs of these subgroups, particularly in the light of recent publicity about factory worker suicides in Shenzhen. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In China, men who have sex with men (MSM) are the fastest growing population at risk for HIV. They face social stigma due to both MSM behavior and HIV. In addition, concern has been raised about the mental health of wives of MSM. In this cross-sectional study, the authors examine the mental health status of a sample of 135 of these women. Participants completed an Internet-administered questionnaire in Xi'an from April to June, 2012. Most were unaware at the time of marriage that their husbands were MSM. Physical abuse was frequently reported; depressive symptom and mental health (Symptom Checklist, SCL-90) scores were significantly higher than those of the general Chinese adult female population. A majority (59.8%) of women reported suicidal thoughts after discovering their husbands' MSM behavior; about 10% had attempted suicide. Multiple logistic regression revealed that women's experience with anal sex was associated with 7.8 times (95% CI: 1.3-65.9) greater odds of suicidal ideation. Also, women who demonstrated mental symptoms on the SCL-90 had 2.3 times (95% CI: 1.04-5.2) the odds of suicidal ideation. These results suggest that wives of MSM have a significant need for mental health care, suicide prevention, HIV education, and social support.

AB HIV risk and mental health problems are prevalent among female sex workers (FSWs) in China. The purpose of this research was to study age group differences in HIV risk and mental health problems in this population. In the current study, we divided a sample of 1022 FSWs into three age groups (20 years, 21-34 years, and 35 years). Results showed that among the three groups (1) older FSWs (35 years) were likely to be socioeconomically disadvantaged (e.g., rural residency, little education, employment in low-paying venues, and low monthly income); (2) older FSWs reported the highest rates of inconsistent, ineffective condom use, and sexually transmitted diseases history; (3) younger FSWs (20 years) reported the highest level of depression, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts, regular-partner violence, and substance use; (4) all health-related risks except casual-partner violence were more prevalent among older and younger FSWs than among FSWs aged 21-34 years; and (5) age had a significant effect on all health indicators except suicide attempts after controlling for several key demographic factors. These findings indicate the need for intervention efforts to address varying needs among FSWs in different age groups. Specific interventional efforts are needed to reduce older FSWs' exposure to HIV risk; meanwhile, more attention should be given to improve FSWs' mental health status, especially among younger FSWs.

AB This study aimed to systematically review evidence of the prevalence and predictors of depression and anxiety among 'left-behind children' in rural China. The electronic databases PubMed/MEDLINE and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure/Wanfang (Chinese) were utilized to search for terms including 'depression' or 'depressive disorder', 'anxiety' or 'mental health', combined with 'left behind', 'children' and 'China'. High rates of psychological depression/anxiety have been reported among left-behind children compared with their age-matched peers. Prevalence rates of depression are reported to range from 12.1 to 51.4% and of anxiety are reported to range from 13.2 to 57.6%. Variability between studies is likely attributable to methodological variations relating to measures used and research setting. Potential predictors measured in studies include age and gender, types of being left, age/years of separation, socio-economic status, etc. These high rates of reported psychological problems among this group of young people suggest the need to develop more effective approaches to prevention and management.

AB The Eurasian Economic Union, founded in 2015, is the most important integration project in post-Soviet space. After more than two decades of disintegration and failed reintegration, Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan now have for the first time a common market for goods and services. However, some goods are exempt and non-tariff barriers are numerous. For now, coordination of monetary and fiscal policies remains only a goal. Just as important as internal integration is the expansion of cooperation with China and the European Union as the new common market's most important partners. The creation of a "Fortress Eurasia" would be suicide.

ID ECOLOGICAL FALLACY; SUICIDE RATES; ADOLESCENTS
AB Few studies have compared urban and rural adolescents' mental health problems, especially in developing countries. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mental health problems and coping styles of adolescents in urban and rural areas in China. A total of 927 urban and rural high school students in Shandong Province of China were recruited for the study. The results of the study are as follows: (a) students in rural low-socioeconomic status (SES) areas, especially females, had more mental health problems than did those in rural high-SES and urban areas; (b) rural low-SES students were more likely to cope by venting and fantasizing than did the other two groups; (c) regardless of residence and SES, mental health problems were inversely related to the use of problem solving as a coping strategy, but positively related to fantasizing; and (d) urban-rural differences in mental health problems were not entirely accounted for by group differences in coping strategies.

TI Stringent regulation of oocyte donation in China
SO HUMAN REPRODUCTION
LA English
DT Article
ID MINIMAL OVARIAN STIMULATION; NATURAL-CYCLE; IVF; WOMEN
AB Currently in China, health regulations permit oocyte donation only from IVF/ICSI patients who have 20 or more mature oocytes retrieved from a single cycle, of which at least 15 must be kept for their own treatment. Oocyte donation from non-patients and commercial transaction of human gametes are strictly prohibited by law. Additionally, embryos derived from donated oocytes must be cryopreserved and cannot be transferred to prospective recipients, until donors have been screened to be free of communicable diseases after 6 months. Such overly stringent regulation has in turn led to a severe shortage of available donor oocytes in China. The situation is made worse by a cultural aversion to oocyte donation by the majority of patients, because biological kinship and blood relations are viewed as sacrosanct in traditional Chinese culture. The harsh social stigmatization of childlessness in Chinese society, increasing incidence of age-related female infertility in recent years and growing numbers of bereaved older women who have lost their only child to accidents, natural disasters and suicides would make it imperative to reconsider liberalizing the regulation of oocyte donation in China. In particular, the blanket ban on oocyte donation by non-patients should be lifted, as it is anticipated that there are many young healthy women in China who are generous and open-minded enough to consider altruistically donating their oocytes to childless couples.

AB Objective: To explore the frequency and risk factors of homelessness among a previously identified cohort of patients with schizophrenia in rural China.
   Method: A 10-year follow-up investigation among a 1994 cohort (n = 510) of patients with schizophrenia was conducted in Xinjin County, Chengdu, China.
   Results: Thirty-nine patients (7.8%) experienced homelessness during the follow-up period. The rate of homelessness was 0.9 per 100 person-years during the 10-year follow-up period. Four significant predictors of homelessness remained in the final logistic regression model: living in shabby or unstable house or shelter, positive family history of mental disorders, without income of the patient, and unmarried, divorced, or separated. Risk of homelessness increased substantially with exposure to multiple risk factors.
   Conclusion: Substantial numbers of homeless patients with schizophrenia are challenges for mental health care and public health. Appropriate community-based services, especially housing services, should be crucial for prevention of homelessness in patients with schizophrenia.

AB Life satisfaction in China declined dramatically precisely at the time of its unprecedented economic growth and poverty reduction. We posit that a "progress paradox" is among the possible channels explaining these contrasting trends. Using data from the Chinese Livelihood Survey, we explore the role of reported physical and psychological health. The standard correlates of life satisfaction such as age, income, and health hold. In addition, we find that those with insufficient rest and leisure are significantly less satisfied. Urban, educated respondents are more likely to report depression, while rural and uneducated respondents are more satisfied with their lives and are less likely to report poor mental health. We also find that insufficient rest, stress, and low life satisfaction have a strong correlation with mental health problems. Given the gains in growth and poverty reduction in China, it is time to consider policies that focus on quality of life and mental illness. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The civilization theories prevailed among people are the theories paying attention to the geographical factors. In this paper, the latitude distribution of track and field elite athletes in China mainland has been studied in terms of the biological effects of sunlight. The China mainland is divided into seven latitude zones according to the absolute latitude value so that the larger the zone number is, the larger the distance from the Equator. The elite athletes are classified into speed-type, jump-type, strength-type and endurance-type so that the latitude distribution can be discussed in terms of exercise physiology. The latitude distribution shows that the elite athletes of speed-type or jump-type prefer to the zones of low latitude, and the elite athletes of strength-type or endurance-type prefer to the zones of high latitude. These phenomena can be understood by the effects of sunlight on exercise physiological index such as skeletal muscle fibre types.

AB Text analysis of the transcripts of 26 calls made to a Chinese crisis hotline by victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) reporting thoughts or acts of self-harm abstracted information on victims' patterns of self-harm and the relationship of their self-harm to IPV. Specific violent episodes often triggered self-harm. Victims considered self-harm a method for airing painful emotions caused by abuse or as a last resort to escape by dying when they saw no other options and were no longer able to endure the violence. We also elaborate on callers' discussions of barriers to accessing support, sociocultural pressures to preserve "face" and family, and restrictive gender roles that contribute to their self-harm behaviors.

AB Background. Worldwide 350 million people suffer from major depression, with the majority of cases occurring in lowand middle-income countries. We examined the patterns, correlates and care-seeking behaviour of adults suffering from major depressive episode (MDE) in China.
   Method. A nationwide study recruited 512 891 adults aged 30-79 years from 10 provinces across China during 20042008. The 12-month prevalence of MDE was assessed by the Modified Composite International Diagnostic Interviewshort form. Logistic regression yielded adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of MDE associated with socio-economic, lifestyle and health-related factors and major stressful life events.
   Results. Overall, 0.7% of participants had MDE and a further 2.4% had major depressive symptoms. Stressful life events were strongly associated with MDE [adjusted OR 14.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 13.7-15.7], with a dose-response relationship with the number of such events experienced. Family conflict had the highest OR for MDE (18.9, 95% CI 16.8-21.2) among the 10 stressful life events. The risk of MDE was also positively associated with rural residency (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.4-1.7), low income (OR 2.3, 95% CI 2.1-2.4), living alone (OR 2.6, 95% CI 2.3-3.0), smoking (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3-1.6) and certain other mental disorders (e.g. anxiety, phobia). Similar, albeit weaker, associations were observed with depressive symptoms. Among those with MDE, about 15% sought medical help or took psychiatric medication, 15% reported having suicidal ideation and 6% reported attempting suicide.
   Conclusions. Among Chinese adults, the patterns and correlates of MDE were generally consistent with those observed in the West. The low rates of seeking professional help and treatment highlight the great gap in mental health services in China.

AB Cong-wen Shen was mentally disturbed and committed suicide around the establishment of new China's literary system; then he gradually gave up literary creation and turned to study cultural relics. Rereading the materials written by Cong-wen Shen at this stage, readers can find that his writing in the period of mental disorder is unusually sober, clearly and objectively reflecting the current circumstances and many scholars' ideological situations. However, after recovering, Cong-wen Shen became less sober, leaving some "abnormalities" in writing. He constantly denied his creation and previous achievements; he denied his literary ideals and changed his pursuit, so as to conform to the times. Cong-wen Shen tried to create works about the new era for several times, but was frustrated repeatedly. These failures also exemplify the abnormality.

AB Although China's economy has experienced the dynamics of change in recent decades, gender inequality is still persistent, especially in rural areas. The present study aims to depict family structures in rural areas in Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, and to investigate the status of women in these. Qualitative and semi-quantitative methods were used. Fifty-five married women from three villages of Xining participated in the investigation. A family image test (FIT) and semi-structured interviews were used to gather information on family structures and women's status in the household. Results indicated that typical patriarchal families were prevalent in rural areas of Xining. Women, especially the young married young ones, were marginalized and were at the bottom of the family hierarchy.

AB Background
   Suicide is a serious cause of mortality worldwide and is considered as a psychiatric emergency. People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) have higher rates of suicidal behavior than the general population. This study assessed the prevalence and verified the syndemic effect of psychosocial health conditions on suicidal ideation among PLWHA in China.
   Methods
   An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted from July to August 2016 in Nanjing, China, using a self-report questionnaire. Sociodemographic characteristics, infection status, psychosocial variables and suicide ideation reports of participants were collected. Logistic regressions were used to identify potential factors associated with suicidal ideation and to verify the syndemic effect of psychosocial factors. Additionally, odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were computed.
   Results
   In total, four hundred sixty-five PLWHA participated, 31.6% (n = 147) of whom had suicidal ideation. The results from univariate analysis showed that older age, low education level, being married, having children, and psychosocial variables (high perceived stigma, depression, low self-esteem, social support and resilience) were significantly associated with increased suicidal ideation. Multiple logistic regression models revealed that depression (OR = 2.70, 95% CI = 1.62-4.51), perceived stigma (OR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.17-3.32), and low social support (OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.08-3.20) and self-esteem (OR = 4.11, 95% CI = 2.06-8.16) were statistically significant. PLWHA with at least two psychosocial health problems were nearly 5 times more likely (OR = 4.72, 95% CI 3.11-7.17) to have had suicidal ideation.
   Conclusions
   Suicidal ideation is frequent among PLWHA in China and is consistent with prevalence estimates from abroad. Psychosocial health problems were the determining factors associated with suicidal ideation, and a syndemic effect of psychosocial health conditions was confirmed in predicting suicidal ideation. Therefore, early screening of high-risk groups for suicidal ideation and more psychosocial health care among PLWHA are needed.

DE Environmental accounting; Green GDP; The green GDP accounting
AB Environment is a rich heritage handed over by previous generations. However the nature's straggling behind the economic development creates a chaotic atmosphere. Accountants are justifiably among those who might be criticized for this chaos because accounting which is the language business has never spoken for nature and environment except for the recent decades. The author tries to make the tragedy of environmental degradation More palpable through the numbers and accounting for senior managers and other participants to have a better understanding of the issues. Green economy means an economy that has the ability to rebuild itself as a stable one. The present economy of China and India are moving too rapidly in recent years and kills the environment that nourishes it which is a sort of suicide like a cancer that eventually led to its death with the elimination of host cells.

AB The objective of this study was to provide a cultural transmission model that partially explains attitudes towards gun ownership and related behaviors. We utilized cross-sectional data collected from Chinese university students in two separate provinces. This paper specifically examines a cultural transmission model of Chinese attitudes towards gun ownership, carrying, purchasing guns for self-defense, and beliefs regarding whether family and friends would own gulls. Our model includes measures of attachment, commitment, belief prior military service, feelings concerning safety in the presence of firearms, beliefs of the respondent regarding whether or not their close associates would own guns, age, gender, and residential location. Findings suggest that the cultural transmission model partially explains Chinese attitudes regarding gun ownership and related activities.

AB This article examined the extent of posttraumatic growth (PTG) and factors related to PTG in aging individuals who have lost their only child in China. The sample included 201 bereaved parents from different families residing in Chongqing, China. They were between 49-80 years old (M=61) and had lost their only child. Personal interviews were conducted in their homes. PTG was assessed with a revised Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI-R). Descriptive and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. Overall, the sample showed a positive tendency toward PTG. The older the child was at death, the less PTG the parent experienced. Time since the child's death was negatively correlated with PTG, and parents whose children died by accident/suicide had lower PTG than those whose children died of illness. Lower education and poor parental health were significantly associated with lower levels of PTG. Community support was significantly and positively associated with PTG. A majority of aging parents who have lost their only child in China experience PTG. Characteristics related to the loss (child's age at death, time since the death, and cause of death), personal resources (parent's education and health), and community support are associated with the degree of growth.

AB Stress and anxiety are pervasive mental health problems in "sweatshop" manufacturing factories, leading to depression, violence, and suicide. Previous studies ascribed workers' mental health problems to social-demographic and employment factors. Few have explored whether, and to what extent, the outdoor environment impacts workers' stress and anxiety status. Without this understanding, we lose the opportunity to create evidence-based environmental interventions that promote mental health for tens of millions of sweatshop workers worldwide. This participatory smartphone-photography survey (PSPS) study focuses on a large manufacturing factory in China where many suicides have occurred. 79 factory workers photographed 237 outdoor factory sites and then answered questions about the environmental qualities of the photographed sites, as well as their stress and anxiety status. After controlling for sociodemographic and employment factors, the regression analysis shows environmental factors collectively were significantly associated with workers' stress and anxiety status, and several specific environmental factors showed a significant association.

AB This study is the first to evaluate evidence for measurement invariance and the psychometric properties of the Suicide Resilience Inventory-25 (SRI-25; Osman et al., ) in college-age samples in both the United States and China. We found strong support for full measurement invariance of the three-factor structure of the SRI-25 in the U.S. (113 men and 238 women) and Chinese (121 men and 205 women) samples. In addition, we found that the U.S. sample scored significantly higher than the Chinese sample on all the individual scale scores. Composite scale reliability estimates ranged from moderate (=.83) to high (=.93) across the groups. Although not an aim of the current study, we examined estimates of internal consistency of the SRI-25 scales for men and women within each sample. Differential correlates of the SRI-25 scales were explored further for each sample. These results provide support for the use of the SRI-25 in U.S. and Chinese student samples.

AB Objectives Up-to-date information on the patterns of acute poisoning is crucial for the proper management of poisoning events. The objectives of this study were to analyse the characteristics of patients suffering from acute poisoning admitted to the emergency department (ED) in a tertiary medical centre in Northeast China and to compare these characteristics with those of a previous comparable study.
   Design Retrospective and descriptive study.
   Setting Data were collected from the hospital information system in Shengjing Hospital, China, from January 2012 to December 2016.
   Participants All cases aged 11 years old with a diagnosis of acute poisoning.
   Results In total, 5009 patients aged 11 years presented to the ED with acute poisoning during the study period. The average age of the patients was 36.015.1 years and over half (52.7%) were in the 20-39age group. The female to male ratio was 1.2:1. Patients with acute poisoning mainly lived in rural areas rather than in urban areas. The majority of patients consumed poison as suicide attempts (56.7%). Men were more commonly poisoned by drug abuse than women, but women outnumbered men in suicidal poisoning. The most common form of poison intake was ingestion (oral intake; 86.2%). The five most common toxic agent groups, in descending order, were therapeutic drugs (32.6%), pesticides (26.9%), alcohol (20.7%), fumes/gases/vapours (11.4%) and chemicals (3.6%). Sedatives/hypnotics in the therapeutic drugs group and paraquat in the pesticides group were the most common toxic agents, respectively. The mortality rate of study participants was 1.3%, with 64 deaths.
   Conclusions The results of this study indicate the need to strengthen education on the rational and safe use of drugs in Shenyang.

Tohoku J. Exp. Med., 2005, 206 (4), 283-290 - To know the therapeutic level at one's own institute is important and contributes to improving the treatment of patients. We compared the outcomes of extensively burned patients between a Chinese hospital and a Japanese hospital in order to identify the differences in the clinical treatment of severe burn patients. Thirty-four burn patients who were admitted to the National Defense Medical College Hospital (NDMC) in Japan and 95 burn patients who were admitted to the Changhai Hospital of the Second Military Medical University (SMMU) in China from January 1999 to December 2003 were studied. All patients were transported to the respective hospitals within 3 days after suffering burns and their total body surface area of burns was greater than 20%. Fourteen of the 34 patients (41.2%) at NDMC hospital and 1 of the 95 patients (1.1%) at SMMU hospital were injured by attempted suicide; namely, the suicide rate was significantly higher in the patients at NDMC hospital (p < 0.001). Moreover, the age (p = 0.005) and inhalation rate (p = 0.013) were significantly higher at NDMC hospital than those at SMMU hospital. Consequently, the survival rate at SMMU was higher than at NDMC in the patients with a burn surface area of greater than 80% or with a burn index of greater than 60. The excellent outcomes of the extensively burned patients at SMMU were in part due to the fact that Chinese doctors tend to perform an immediate tracheostomy and a traditional Chinese operation with alloskin, called microskin grafting or intermingled skin grafting. - burn; outcome; suicide-rate; tracheostomy; 17 C alloskin.

AB Background
   Somatic complaints are often the presenting symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) in the outpatient context, because this may go unrecognized. It is well understood that MDD carries an increased risk of suicide. This study aimed to identify the risk factors and association with both MDD and suicidality among Han Chinese outpatients.
   Methods
   A multicenter study was carried out in 5189 outpatient adults (>= 18 years old) in four general hospitals in Guangzhou, China. The 1392 patients who had the Patient Health Question-naire-9 (PHQ-9) score >= 5, indicating depressive symptoms were offered an interview with a psychiatrist by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI); 819 patients consented and completed the MINI interview. MINI module B was used to assess suicidality. Stepwise binary logistic models were used to estimate the relationship between a significant risk factor and suicide or MDD. According to with or without MDD, the secondary analysis was performed using the logistic regression model for the risk of suicidility.
   Results
   The current prevalence of MDD and the one month prevalence of suicidality were 3.7% and 2.3% respectively. The odds ratio of suicidality in women was more than twice that in men (OR = 2.62; 95% CI 1.45-4.76). Other risk factors which were significantly associated with suicidality were: living alone, higher education, self-reported depression, getting psychiatric diagnoses (MDD, anxiety disorders, and bipolar disorders). Significant risk factors for MDD were also noticed, such as comorbid anxiety disorders, self-reported anxiety, insomnia, suicidal ideation.
   Limitation
   It's a cross-sectional study in outpatient clinics using self-report questionnaires.
   Conclusion
   This study provides valuable data about the risk factors and association of MDD and suicide risk in adult outpatients in Han Chinese. Those factors allow better the employment of preventative measures.

AB Background Psychiatric disorders are reported to be present in 80% to 90% of suicide deaths in high-income countries (HIC), but this association is less clear in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). There has been no previous systematic review of this issue in LMIC. The current study aims to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in individuals with suicidal behaviour in LMIC. Methods and findings PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE searches were conducted to identify quantitative research papers (any language) between 1990 and 2018 from LMIC that reported on the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in suicidal behaviour. We used meta-analytic techniques to generate pooled estimates for any psychiatric disorder and specific diagnosis based on International classification of disease (ICD-10) criteria. A total of 112 studies (154 papers) from 26 LMIC (India: 25%, China: 15%, and other LMIC: 60%) were identified, including 18 non-English articles. They included 30,030 individuals with nonfatal suicidal behaviour and 4,996 individuals who had died by suicide. Of the 15 studies (5 LMIC) that scored highly on our quality assessment, prevalence estimates for psychiatric disorders ranged between 30% and 80% in suicide deaths and between 3% and 86% in those who engaged in nonfatal suicidal behaviour. There was substantial heterogeneity between study estimates. Fifty-eight percent (95% CI 46%-71%) of those who died by suicide and 45% (95% CI 30%-61%) of those who engaged in nonfatal suicidal behaviour had a psychiatric disorder. The most prevalent disorder in both fatal and nonfatal suicidal behaviour was mood disorder (25% and 21%, respectively). Schizophrenia and related disorders were identified in 8% (4%-12%) of those who died by suicide and 7% (3%-11%) of those who engaged in nonfatal suicidal behaviour. In nonfatal suicidal behaviour, anxiety disorders, and substance misuse were identified in 19% (1%-36%) and 11% (7%-16%) of individuals, respectively. This systematic review was limited by the low number of high-quality studies and restricting our searches to databases that mainly indexed English language journals. Conclusions Our findings suggest a possible lower prevalence of psychiatric disorders in suicidal behaviour in LMIC. We found very few high-quality studies and high levels of heterogeneity in pooled estimates of psychiatric disorder, which could reflect differing study methods or real differences. There is a clear need for more robust evidence in order for LMIC to strike the right balance between community-based and mental health focussed interventions.
   Author summaryWhy was the study done? Approximately 800,000 people die by suicide each year, with 75% of these deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Psychiatric disorder is thought to be associated with 80% to 90% of those who engage in suicidal behaviour in high-income countries (HIC), but this association is less clear in LMIC. A better understanding is needed of this association in LMIC to ensure effective and appropriate allocation of limited resources. What did the researchers do and find? We searched the existing literature for studies conducted in LMIC that estimated the proportion of individuals who engaged in suicidal behaviour with psychiatric disorders and found 112 studies from 26 countries (mainly from China and India). Even in the higher quality studies, there was wide variability in the proportion of psychiatric disorders in fatal (30%-80%) and nonfatal (3%-86%) suicidal behaviour, but on average, 58% of those who died by suicide and 45% of those who engaged in nonfatal suicidal behaviour had a psychiatric disorder. Mood disorders were the most prevalent disorder identified in both fatal and nonfatal suicidal behaviour. What do these findings mean? There were considerable differences in the estimates of psychiatric disorder between studies. This may reflect differences in the way studies were carried out or real differences, but there were too few high-quality studies to estimate the prevalence by individual country. More high-quality research is needed. Psychiatric disorders may be less common in suicidal behaviour in LMIC than in HIC. Although treating psychiatric illness is important, the treatment and prevention of suicidal behaviour should include a wider range of activities.

AB Background: Adolescence is a vulnerable period of life, and many mental health and behavioral problems emerge during this particular period, including depression, internet addiction (IA), and suicidal behaviors. Poor quality of life (QOL) and IA have been found to be significantly associated with suicidal ideation (SI) among Chinese university students, of whom most have been adults. Nevertheless, their associations with SI are rarely studied among Chinese adolescents. The objective of this study was to examine these relationships in a representative adolescent sample of Chinese senior high school students, who are experiencing an enormous transition from childhood to adulthood.
   Methods: By using multi-stage sampling, a total of 26,688 students were successfully recruited from 29 senior high schools of a very large City in western China, Chongqing municipality. In this cross-sectional online survey, students' demographic and lifestyle characteristics were collected with a standardized questionnaire. The Young's IA Test, the Chinese Six-item QOL questionnaire, and item 15 of the Symptom Checklist-90-R were used to measure IA, QOL, and SI, respectively.
   Results: The 1-month prevalence of SI was 11.5% among students of senior high schools in Chongqing, China. Students with SI had significantly higher QOL scores (17.3 +/- 3.7 vs. 13.7 +/- 3.8, P < 0.001) and higher prevalence of IA (49.6% vs. 25.6%, P < 0.001) than those without SI. After controlling for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical covariates, IA (odd ratio (OR) = 1.15, P = 0.003) and a high QOL score (OR = 1.09, P < 0.001) remained significantly associated with SI.
   Conclusion: Suicidal ideation is prevalent among Chinese adolescents and it is associated with IA and poor QOL. Measures aimed at reducing IA and improving QOL may help prevent suicidal behaviors among Chinese adolescents.

AB In contrast with most developed countries, mortality due to ischemic heart disease (IHD) continues to rise in China. We examined the effects of age, period, and cohort on IHD mortality in urban and rural populations from 1987 to 2013 to identify the drivers of this trend. Region-specific data on annual IHD mortality among adults aged 20 to 84 years and corresponding population statistics were collected. We then tested for age, period, and cohort effects using the Intrinsic Estimator approach. Our results indicated that IHD mortality in China increased significantly over the three decades studied. There was a log-linear increase in the age effect on IHD mortality as those aged 80-84 showed 277 and 161 times greater IHD mortality risk than those aged 20-24 in urban and rural populations, respectively. While there was an upward trend in the period effect in both populations, the influence of the cohort effect on mortality decreased over time for those born from 1904 to 1993. The age, period, and cohort effects on mortality in China were generally comparable between urban and rural populations. The results suggest that population aging is a major driver behind the rapid rise in IHD mortality. Increased exposure to air pollution may also have played a role in driving the period effect.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with suicidal ideation among HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) in Anhui, China. A cross-sectional study was conducted to recruit HIV-positive MSM in Anhui, China. A total of 184 HIV-positive MSM gave informed consent and completed the interview. Correlates of suicidal ideation were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Fifty-seven (31%) of HIV-positive MSM had suicidal ideations within six months before the interview. Multivariable analyses showed that learning of their HIV status in the past 12 months (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.6-7.3), perceived HIV stigma (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.1-5.2), depression symptoms (AOR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.1-5.9) and anxiety symptoms (AOR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.2-6.1) were significantly associated with the suicidal ideation among HIV-positive MSM. The results indicated that suicidal ideation was common among HIV-positive MSM in Anhui, China. There is an urgent need to establish psychological counselling services among HIV-positive MSM in China. Targeting of these potential risk factors could be an effective approach to reduce the suicide risk among this high-risk subgroup by the implementation of early intervention measurements.

AB Background: Village doctors are primary care physicians at the grass root-level of rural medical and health institutions in China. Their depression can increase medical errors and affect quality of medical care services. This study aims to examine depressive symptoms and their correlates among Chinese village doctors.
   Methods: A total of 616 village doctors were recruited from Zoucheng County of Shandong province. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the Duke Social Support Index (DSSI) and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ) were used to measure depressive symptoms in the last week, social support and coping styles, respectively. Logistic regression model was conducted to identify the associated factors of depressive symptoms among village doctors.
   Results: The prevalence rate of depressive symptoms was 27.4% (28.54% for males, 24.69% for females). Logistic regression analysis found that body mass index (BMI), poor physical health, low educational level, and negative coping styles were associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms. Positive coping styles were associated with decreased risk of depressive symptoms in village doctors.
   Conclusions: Depressive symptoms are prevalent among village doctors in China. They need to adopt more positive coping strategies to respond to negative emotions. More professional and medical trainings may be important to reduce risk of depressive symptoms and improve their quality of healthcare among village doctors in China.

AB To enrich the discussion of global labor, between 2010 and 2016, we studied Apple's value chain, Foxconn's mode of labor control, and Chinese workers' struggles. Through our fieldwork in China we also examined Apple's and Foxconn's responses to the spate of worker suicides, workers' resistance, the activism of scholar and student groups, and transnational justice campaigns. We conclude with reflection on global labor studies in light of the debates between Karl Polanyi's counter movement and Karl Marx's class-based struggle.

AB Background: Many studies have suggested that strategies of suicide prevention must be developed with a detailed understanding of the role of multiple risk factors. The aim of the current study was to explore the pathways of multiple risk factors for severe suicidal ideation (SSI) and provide empirical data and recommendations for suicide interventions.
   Methods: A door-to-door survey was administered to 3,821 rural residents aged 15 and older in rural China. The risk factor variables were socio-demographic characteristics, depression, social support, quality of life and negative life events. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze risk factors related to SSI, and structural equation modeling was used to analyze the pathways of risk factors for SSI.
   Results: Depression, socio-economic status and negative life events had direct effects on SSI. Socio-economic status and negative life events had indirect effects on SSI via depression. The most influential factor of the direct effects was depression, and the most influential factor of the indirect effects was socio-economic status.
   Conclusions: The direct and indirect effect pathways of risk factors contribute to the understanding of the role of multiple risk factors as well as the corresponding intervention strategies. The intervention in the acute phase perhaps should be mainly targeted on the direct factor of depression; before the acute phase (or even earlier) or after the acute phase, it should be mainly targeted on the indirect factor of socio-economic status.

AB Objectives Suicidality among sexual minority adolescents has generated worldwide concern in recent decades, and previous Western studies have demonstrated that sexual minority status is associated with adolescent suicidality. However, whether this association exists in Chinese adolescents remains largely unknown. This study aimed to estimate the associations between sexual minority status and suicidal behaviour among Chinese adolescents.
   Design Cross-sectional survey.
   Setting A total of 506 high schools in 7 provinces of China.
   Participants total of 150822 students in grades 7-12 who completed the questionnaires (response rate of 95.9%) were included.
   Main outcome measures Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts were used to measure suicidal behaviour, and sexual attraction (opposite sex, same sex or both sex) was used as a measure for sexual minority status.
   Results Of the 150822 adolescents analysed, 4.1% self-reported as sexual minorities and 17.3% were unsure. Compared with heterosexual and unsure adolescents, same-sex romantic attraction (SSA) and both-sex romantic attraction (BSA) adolescents reported a higher prevalence of past-year suicidal ideation (SSA: 21.6% for males and 30.4% for females; BSA: 34.7% for males and 42.3% for females) and suicide attempts (SSA: 6.9% for males and 8.9% for females; BSA: 12.2% for males and 10.9% for females). After adjustment for covariates, SSA and BSA adolescents were more likely to have past-year suicidal ideation and suicide attempts than their heterosexual and unsure peers. BSA adolescents reported the highest risk of suicidal ideation (males: adjusted OR (AOR) 2.42, 95% CI 2.03 to 2.88; females: AOR 2.61, 95% CI 2.41 to 2.82) and suicide attempts (males: AOR 3.83, 95%CI 2.85 to 5.14; females: AOR 2.59, 95%CI 2.19 to 3.06).
   Conclusions Our study suggested that Chinese sexual minority adolescents were at increased risk of suicidality, and those with BSA had an especially high risk in this population. These findings emphasised the urgent need to develop targeted interventions to effectively address suicide-related problems among Chinese sexual minority adolescents.

ID DAPSONE HYPERSENSITIVITY SYNDROME; RENAL LESIONS
AB We analyzed the causes of death among active leprosy patients in China, to better understand the disease and improve the quality of services, by performing a retrospective study involving 24 provinces of China. Information about patients with active leprosy who were not clinically cured and died between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2005, was collected by professionals at county levels. A total of 524 deaths were analyzed. The leading cause of death was suicide. There were 86 patients (16%) who died at a mean of 21 +/- 19 months after starting multi-drug therapy (MDT). The second and third leading causes of death were cardiovascular disease and organ failure associated with advanced age, respectively. Two hundred and twenty-one patients (42%) died within one year of beginning MDT. The second month of MDT was the riskiest for newly treated patients; approximately 20% of patients succumbed to liver failure, 33% to dapsone (diaminodiphenylsulfone/DDS) allergy, and 27% to renal insufficiency during this period. Among 143 deaths related to leprosy, 37 (26%) occurred within three months of starting MDT. We recommend that newly diagnosed patients should be provided with no more than two months of MDT blister packs.

AB In contrast to the mortality dynamics of the former socialist economies of Europe during their transition era, few studies have examined mortality changes in China since the start of its socialist economic reforms. This article examines mortality trends of Shanghai permanent residents during the transition from planned socialism to state capitalism. The previously steady improvement in life expectancy slowed down between 1992 and 1996. Mortality among young working-age men (ages 20-44) increased, largely due to rising cardiovascular disease and injuries. Transportation deaths increased but not mortality from suicide or liver disease. These unfavourable mortality patterns are linked to reform-associated institutional changes such as weaker social protection, increased unemployment, psychological stress, unsafe transport and hazardous environments. However, the unfavourable effects were moderate and transient due to gradualist reform strategies and strong institutions combined with rapid economic growth. The lessons learned from the Shanghai experience may be useful for other socialist countries wishing to shift to a market economy.

AB This chapter attempts to engage in the debate of circular migration in a global context by looking at the internal migration of Chinese workers from the rural to urban areas in general and the lived experience of the low and semi-skilled migrant workers at the industrial workplace, in particular at the Foxconn Technology Group. In this sense, this chapter analyzes critically the effects of circular migration in China that create adverse impacts on the lives of the rural migrants both in the sphere of production and reproduction. By putting in a class perspective in the circular migration studies, this paper hopes to enrich the debate on circular migration from a non-western perspective as well as to provide a better understanding of the lived struggles of the migrant workers from the bottom. This study focuses on the emergence of a new Chinese migrant working class who is now developed into its second generation at a time when China rapidly turns itself into a "world factory", and facilitates an approach to the reality of migrant workers, showing that negative experiences of circular migration to its extreme may even cause suicides of the youth migrant workers.

AB Background: Childhood trauma has long-term adverse effects on physical and psychological health. Previous studies demonstrated that suicide and mental disorders were related to childhood trauma. In China, there is insufficient research available on childhood trauma in patients with mental disorders.
   Methods: Outpatients were recruited from a psychiatric hospital in southern China, and controls were recruited from local communities. The demographic questionnaire, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF), and the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) were completed by all participants, and the Self-rating Idea of Suicide Scale (SIOSS) were completed only by patients. Prevalence rates of childhood trauma were calculated. Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunnett test were used to compare CTQ-SF and SSRS scores between groups. Logistic regression was used to control demographic characteristics and examine relationships between diagnosis and CTQ-SF and SSRS scores. Spearman's rank correlation test was conducted to analyze relationships between suicidal ideation and childhood trauma and suicidal ideation and social support.
   Results: The final sample comprised 229 patients with depression, 102 patients with bipolar, 216 patient with schizophrenia, and 132 healthy controls. In our sample, 55.5% of the patients with depression, 61.8% of the patients with bipolar disorder, 47.2% of the patients with schizophrenia, and 20.5% of the healthy people reported at least one type of trauma. In patient groups, physical neglect (PN) and emotional neglect (EN) were most reported, and sexual abuse (SA) and physical abuse (PA) were least reported. CTQ-SF and SSRS total scores, and most of their subscale scores in patient groups were significantly different from the control group. After controlling demographic characteristics, mental disorders were associated with higher CTQ-SF scores and lower SSRS scores. CTQ-SF scores and number of trauma types were positively correlated with the SIOSS score. Negative correlations existed between SSRS scores and the SIOSS score.
   Limitations: Our sample may not be sufficiently representative. Some results might have been interfered by demographic characteristics. The SIOSS was not completed by controls. Data from self-report scales were not sufficiently objective.
   Conclusions: In southern China, childhood trauma is more severe and more prevalent in patients with mental disorders (depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia) than healthy people. Among patients with mental disorders in southern China, suicidal ideation is associated with childhood trauma and poor social support.

AB Prior research and managerial practices have often over-emphasized employees' performance and ignored their occupational well-being. However, a series of employee suicide scandals in China have drawn people's attention to employees' occupational well-being and heightened the importance of how ethical leadership can enhance such well-being. Based on social exchange theory, this study examined the main effect of ethical leadership on subordinates' occupational well-being in China, as well as the underlying mechanisms and contextual factors between them. Our sample comprised 302 employee questionnaires and 34 questionnaires completed by supervisors about their group. Using a multi-level approach, we implemented hierarchical linear modeling to examine the hypotheses. The results revealed that ethical leadership positively influenced the subordinates' occupational well-being. This effect was partially mediated by distributive justice and interpersonal justice. Moreover, group level collectivism moderated the influence of ethical leadership on employees' perception of distributive justice, interpersonal justice and their occupational well-being.

AB Objective. Given the limited number of systematic studies on child victimization in China, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of child victimization and poly-victimization, and to examine the associations between victimization and negative health outcomes.
   Method. Using a 2-stage stratified sampling procedure, 18,341 adolescents aged 15 to 17 years old were recruited from 6 cities in China during 2009 and 2010. Adolescents completed a self-administered questionnaire containing items about child victimization and health outcomes (e.g. health-related quality of life, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], depression, deliberate self-harm, and suicide ideation). Structured multiphase logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations between these factors.
   Results. The lifetime prevalence of at least one form of victimization was 71%, whereas that of polyvictimization was 14%. Child victimization in the preceding year was associated with gender, age, number of siblings, and location of schools. Child victims were more likely to report PTSD and depressive symptoms, self-harm ideation, and poor physical and mental health.
   Conclusion. This study provided reliable estimates of the association between child victimization and health using a large and diverse sample in China. Based on the nature of the documented associations, several suggestions for public health professionals were offered. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Custodial deaths refer to the death of an individual who is in prison, a detention center, or a police station. The present study aims to retrospectively analyze cases of custodial deaths examined at Tongji Medico Legal Expertise Center in Hubei (TMECH). A total of 172 out of 5853 cases were screened at TMECH from January 1999 to December 2016. Male preponderance was observed in 172 cases (male-female ratio: 5:1). Natural deaths accounted for the majority (70.93%), followed by suicide (16.28%), accidents (3.49%), homicides (4.65%), and undetermined causes (4.65%). The most common natural cause was cardiovascular disease. Custodial deaths occurred more frequently in prisons and detention houses than in police cells (63%, 63%, and 46%, respectively). Among the 172 cases, 105 deaths occurred after resuscitation failure despite the individual being sent to the hospital. The average age across cases was 36.3 years, and 90% of the deceased were aged under 50 years. Since there is no officially reported data regarding the prevalence of causes and manners of custodial deaths in China, our analysis contributes to enhancing the understanding of such deaths in central China and serves as a reference for law enforcement to develop a prevention program to reduce incidents of mortality in custody.

AB The 12-item general health questionnaire (GHQ-12) has been extensively used with Chinese population. Yet, it has not been used from a national representative survey in rural China. The aim of this study was to examine how number of kins associated with the factor structures of the CHQ-12 among the rural residents in China. Data were obtained from the 2009 rural-to-urban migrants survey (RUMiC). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) (principal component analysis with varimax rotation) was performed to identify factor structures of GHQ-12 regarding number of siblings, age ranking, and number of children. To investigate the reliability of the questionnaire, Cronbach's alpha was used. Internal consistency was assessed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). In all, 32171 rural residents in China from 2009 RUMiC participated in the study. The mean age of the respondents was 37.03 (SD = 19.21) years. The psychometric properties and factor structures of the GHQ-12 used were described. All of the fit indices in CFA models were satisfactory. The two-factor and three-factor structures gathered the satisfactory fit indexes in the part of 2009 subsamples. The rural version of the GHQ-12 was reliable measures of psychological distress among the rural residents in China with respect to number of kins. The two-and three-factor structures derived from the present sample, with good model fit in the CFA analysis, which suggested that two-and three-factor solution could be used to assess mental health of rural residents in rural China.

AB Research concerning ethnocultural bullying and adolescent health in China remains extremely limited. This study among Chinese urban adolescents examines associations between ethnocultural bullying and eight health-related outcomes: suicidal ideation, suicide planning, depressive symptomology, anxiety symptomatology, fighting, injury intentionally inflicted by another, smoking and moderate/heavy alcohol consumption. Data were obtained from the World Health Organisation's 2003 Chinese Global School-based Health Survey, a cross-sectional national survey of urban adolescents in four Chinese cities. The analytic sample size was n = 8182, which represented a sampling frame of 769,835 adolescents. Statistical analysis was conducted using generalised linear mixed effects models and sampling weights. Prevalence of ethnocultural bullying was significantly higher in Urumqi, Xinjiang province (2.08%) compared with Beijing municipality (0.72%) or Wuhan, Hubei province (0.67%). Compared to participants who were not bullied, religious bullying victimisation was significantly associated with suicidal ideation, injury intentionally inflicted by another and depressive symptomology. Racial bullying victimisation was significantly associated with suicidal ideation, injury intentionally inflicted by another and among females but not males, depressive symptomology. Health effects of ethnocultural bullying appear to be distinct from that of bullying in general. Additional research on ethnocultural adolescent health issues in China is warranted.

AB AIM: To investigate the prevalence and physicians' detection rate of depressive and anxiety disorders in gastrointestinal (GI) outpatients across China.
   METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in the GI outpatient departments of 13 general hospitals. A total of 1995 GI outpatients were recruited and screened with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The physicians of the GI departments performed routine clinical diagnosis and management without knowing the HADS score results. Subjects with HADS scores; >= 8 were subsequently interviewed by psychiatrists using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to make further diagnoses.
   RESULTS: There were 1059 patients with HADS score >= 8 and 674 (63.64%) of them undertook the MINI interview by psychiatrists. Based on the criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edition), the adjusted current prevalence for depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and comorbidity of both disorders in the GI outpatients was 14.39%, 9.42% and 4.66%, respectively. Prevalence of depressive disorders with suicidal problems [suicide attempt or suicide-related ideation prior or current; module C (suicide) of MINI score >= 1] was 5.84% in women and 1.64% in men. The GI physicians' detection rate of depressive and anxiety disorders accounted for 4.14%.
   CONCLUSION: While the prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders is high in Chinese GI outpatients, the detection rate of depressive and anxiety disorders by physicians is low. (C) 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, we examine the development of mental health-as a concept, a movement, and a broad interdisciplinary field that originated in the West-in China over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries. Taking the international history as the reference point, we begin our narrative with the arrival of mental hygiene-the predecessor of mental health-in the Republican period. Then we delineate how the Chinese history departed from the post-war shift to mental health during the Maoist period, followed by an account on the renewed development that has slowly come closer to the international trends in the post-reform period. Particular emphasis is placed on the evolution of psy disciplines (including psychiatry, psychology, and psychotherapy) and the interplay between these bodies of knowledge and the country's social and political realities. Paying attention to terminology, we also describe how key concepts like mental health and mental hygiene are translated into Chinese.

AB This article analyses the Chinese rural migrant workers' collective struggles within a framework that highlights the deepening of contradictions among labour, capital, and the state. At times of labour crisis, aggrieved workers have taken legal and extra-legal actions to defend their rights and interests in the absence of leadership by trade unions. From 1 January 2015, Guangdong provincial government was compelled to enforce new collective bargaining regulations to regulate labour relations, when an increasing number of workers leveraged their power to disrupt production to demand higher pay and better conditions within the tight delivery deadlines. In addition to discussing the workplace bargaining power at the key nodes in global supply networks, we highlight the impact of demographic changes on the potential increase of the marketplace bargaining power of workers.

AB The authors describe a case of a well-designed homicidal poisoning in China. A male was treated with starvation, intravenous fluids and antibiotics while in the hospital for acute diarrhea. He suddenly suffered from shortness of breath and subsequently died. A forensic autopsy was carried out, and several specimens were collected for toxicological screening. Propofol was tentatively identified in the blood by GC-MS. Based on the presence of propofol in the blood, a suspect confessed that two other drugs, namely midazolam and vecuronium, were involved in this murder. Analytical drug quantification was then performed by GC-MS and LC-MS/MS. Blood analysis revealed the following: propofol at 0.5 mu g/mL, midazolam at 0.098 mu g/mL, and vecuronium at 0.10 mu g/mL. These results suggest that the cause of death was respiratory depression due to the acute combined effect of several anesthetic drugs administered by the victim's companion.

TI Misfit Xu Lizhi and Battlers Poetry (<i>Dagong shige</i>)

LA English
DT Article
DE Xu Lizhi; battlers poetry; subaltern literature; migrant workers; dagong
AB Battlers poetry (dagong shige), a genre whose name has mostly been rendered in English as "migrant worker poetry" to date, presents an important development in Chinese literature since the 2000s. Written by members of a new precariat that plays a key role in China's economic growth, this poetry speaks to the plight of its constituency. Xu Lizhi (1990-2014) is one of its best-known authors, whose rise to fame was triggered if not caused by his suicide. While it is impossible to conduct a real discussion of Xu's work without referring to his suicide and the story of the migrant workers, his status as a figurehead of battlers poetry at large raises questions because what he wrote is arguably not very representative of the genre at all. These observations lead to a discussion of the way battlers poetry has been framed in Chinese critical discourse, where it is often said to have high social significance but low aesthetic value. This convenient dyad is unsatisfying in that it simplifies the text's relation to reality-which is more highly charged for battlers poetry than for many other literary genres.

AB Background: Self-harm (SH) behaviors are established risk factors of suicide, however, in Chinese left-behind children (LBC), SH remains severely under-discussed. In this study, we aimed to investigate SH and explore its association between resilience in a large group of LBC.
   Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study of 2898 LBC was conducted in Yunnan province, China. Information was collected by self-reporting questionnaires. Descriptive analysis was used to depict and compare characteristics of the subjects. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were applied to estimate the associations between resilience and SH prevalence, SH severity, SH repetition.
   Results: The prevalence of SH in LBC was 48.8% (95%CI: 47.0-49.7%). Compared to LBC with lower level of resilience, a higher level of resilience was related to 0.40 folds of SH odds (95%CI: 0.34-0.48). Besides, among all dimensions of resilience, every 1 average score increase of emotion regulation and family support were associated with 0.13 (95%CI: 0.04-0.37) and 0.14 (95%CI: 0.04-0.47) folds of odds in severer SH, respectively; one unit increase in the average score of emotion regulation was related to an OR of 0.23 (95%CI: 0.07-0.71) for repeated SH.
   Conclusions: Psychological resilience presented protective effect on SH in LBC, especially the dimensions of emotion regulation and family support. Intervention measures focusing on enhancing emotion regulation ability and building parent-child connection could be considered in order to reduce SH and suicidal risk in LBC.

DT Article
ID BIOLOGICAL TERRORISM; HEALTH; CHINA
AB Shanghai is the most developed city in China and has a soaring population. This study uses forensic epidemiology to determine the relationship between unnatural deaths and the development in Shanghai, based on recently released forensic autopsy cases from the 2000s at the Shanghai Public Security Bureau (SPSB). There were 5425 accidental deaths, 2696 homicides, 429 suicides, 186 natural deaths, and 1399 deaths of undetermined cause. There was a male-to-female ratio of 2.02:1, and the average age was 40.9 +/- 18.7 years. Traffic accidents (84.2%) were the number one cause of accidental deaths, which decreased during the study period. Sharp force injury (50.6%) was the leading cause of homicides, different from Western countries, where firearms are the leading cause. Hanging (24.5%) was the leading cause of suicides, whereas drug and chemical intoxication was the leading cause in the previous decade; pesticide ingestion decreased in the 2000s. In addition to traffic accidents, manual strangulation was the leading cause of death in childhood fatalities. Children under age 2 were vulnerable to homicides. In the 2000s, there were a large number of drug overdoses, and illegal medical practices and subway-related deaths first appeared in Shanghai. A new type of terrorist attack that involved injecting people with syringes in public places was reflected in the SPSB archives. The forensic epidemiology and changes in unnatural deaths in this decade reflected their relationship with the law, policy and changes in Shanghai. Illegal medical practices, subway-related deaths and terrorist attacks were closely related to the development in Shanghai. Identifying the risks of unnatural deaths will improve public health.

AB There is a dearth of data on the association of internal migration with mental health in young rural Chinese. This study aims to explore the associations between migrant status, mental health, and suicidal behaviors in young rural Chinese.
   We recruited 1,646 rural subjects aged 16-34 years, of whom 756 were migrant workers and 890 non-migrants, from ten representative villages in rural Sichuan Province, the southwestern part of China. To assess subject's depressive symptoms and general psychological quality of life (psycho-QOL), the study protocol included the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and psycho-QOL subscale of the World Health Organization's QOL Questionnaire-Brief Version, in addition to structured questions regarding one-year suicidal thoughts and behaviors (serious ideation, plan, and attempt), socio-demographic, social support, and physical health information.
   After adjustment for confounders, migrant workers had relative to non-migrant rural residents a decreased risk for depression (OR = 0.69, P = 0.026), but comparable risk for poor psycho-QOL (OR = 0.91, P = 0.557) and one-year suicidal behaviors (OR = 0.59-1.10, P = 0.19-0.90). Migrant status only accounted for 0.5, 2.8, 4.7, 9.8, and 12.6 % of the total explainable variance for suicide attempt, poor psycho-QOL, suicide plan, depression and serious suicide ideation, respectively.
   Our findings suggested that among young rural Chinese there were no significant associations involving migrant status and poor psycho-QOL or one-year suicidal behaviors, while migrant status significantly correlated with a decreased risk of depression. The unique contribution of migrant status to mental health among young rural Chinese participants in this study was very small.

AB Study Objectives: To systematically review and meta-analyze the associations between sleep disturbances and suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts in adolescents and explore potential moderators of these associations.
   Methods: Embase, PubMed, ProQuest, and the China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database were searched from their inception dates to October 19, 2018. We selected cross-sectional, prospective, or retrospective studies without time or language restrictions.
   Results: Nine cross-sectional studies, four prospective studies, and one retrospective report that, respectively, involved 37 536, 9295, and 80 adolescents were included in the meta-analysis. Cross-sectional analyses revealed that adolescents with sleep disturbances were at higher risks of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts (pooled odds ratios [ORs] = 2.35, 1.58, and 1.92) than those without sleep disturbances. Prospective reports indicated that sleep disturbances in adolescents significantly predicted the risk of suicidal ideation but not suicide attempts (pooled ORs = 1.79 and 1.98, 95% confidence intervals = 1.36-2.36 and 0.62-6.29, respectively). The retrospective study did not support the association between sleep disturbances and suicide attempts. Depression did not moderate the associations between sleep disturbances and suicidal ideation or attempts in adolescents. Adolescents with insomnia complaints had a higher risk of suicidal ideation than those with other sleep complaints. Age, the female percentage, and reliable sleep measures were significant moderators (all p < .05).
   Conclusions: Sleep disturbances, particularly insomnia, should be considered an influencing factor when developing preventive strategies against adolescent suicidal ideation. Additional prospective studies are warranted to establish causality of sleep disturbances in youth suicide plans and attempts.

AB Background: To investigate the prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among medical college students in a Chinese population.
   Methods: A cross-sectional design was used to collect demographic data on participants and their symptoms of ADHD, anxiety, and depression. Data were collected through questionnaires filled out on a computer or through WeChat, a widely used social media app.
   Results: The prevalence of ADHD among 5693 college students was 3.5% (3.02 - 3.98%). Individuals with ADHD showed higher scores on scales of anxiety and depression symptoms (both p < 0.05) than the general population. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of ADHD grouped by smoking, drinking, suicidal ideation, suicidal plans, suicidal attempt, anxiety and depression (p < 0.05). The odds ratio (OR) of ADHD was high for suicidal ideation, suicide plans, suicide attempts, anxiety and depression, with ORs of 5.901, 5.46, 6.011, 8.037 and 7.88, respectively. The ORs of suicidal behaviors for ADHD were decreased after adjusting for covariates such as drinking, smoking and depression.
   Limitations: The sample was exclusively selected from three medical-related colleges, which might not be best representation of college students in China. Furthermore, majority of the participants were females.
   Conclusions: ADHD remains a common disorder among Chinese medical college students and is significantly associated with suicidal behaviors, anxiety and depression. It is important to increase awareness and promote effective interventions to this particular population.

AB Study Objectives: Daytime sleepiness is associated with poor daytime functioning and adverse cognitive and emotional consequences, such as impaired decision-making and increased impulsivity. Little is known about the association between daytime sleepiness and suicidal behaviors. This study examined the prospective relationship between daytime sleepiness and suicidal behaviors, including suicidal thought (ST), suicide plan (SP), and suicide attempt (SA), in a large sample of adolescents.
   Methods: A prospective longitudinal study of 7072 adolescents (mean age = 14.6 years) was conducted in Shandong province, China. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire to assess suicidal behaviors, daytime sleepiness, nighttime sleep duration, insomnia, snoring, hopelessness, impulsivity, anxiety/depression, and family demographics. Participants were first surveyed in November-December 2015 and resurveyed 1 year later. Of the 7072 participants, 77.1% (n = 5451) who did not report suicidal behaviors at baseline were included for primary analysis.
   Results: The incidence rates of ST, SP, and SA at 1 year follow-up were 6.0%, 2.1%, and 1.6%, respectively. The incidence rates of ST and SP significantly increased with elevated daytime sleepiness score at baseline. After adjusting for adolescent and family covariates including sleep-related variables (i.e. insomnia, nighttime sleep duration, and snoring), a daytime sleepiness score = median at baseline was significantly associated with increased risk of ST (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.02-2.35) and SP (OR = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.22-5.53).
   Conclusions: Daytime sleepiness appears to be a significant predictor of subsequent suicidal behaviors in adolescents. These findings emphasize the importance of assessing and intervening daytime sleepiness for preventing suicide in adolescents.

AB Background: About 1 million people worldwide commit suicide each year, and college students with suicidal ideation are at high risk of suicide. The prevalence of suicidal ideation in college students has been estimated extensively, but quantitative syntheses of overall prevalence are scarce, especially in China. Accurate estimates of prevalence are important for making public policy. In this paper, we aimed to determine the prevalence of suicidal ideation in Chinese college students.
   Objective and Methods: Databases including PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Chinese Web of Knowledge, Wangfang (Chinese database) and Weipu (Chinese database) were systematically reviewed to identify articles published between 2004 to July 2013, in either English or Chinese, reporting prevalence estimates of suicidal ideation among Chinese college students. The strategy also included a secondary search of reference lists of records retrieved from databases. Then the prevalence estimates were summarized using a random effects model. The effects of moderator variables on the prevalence estimates were assessed using a meta-regression model.
   Results: A total of 41 studies involving 160339 college students were identified, and the prevalence ranged from 1.24% to 26.00%. The overall pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation among Chinese college students was 10.72% (95% CI: 8.41% to 13.28%). We noted substantial heterogeneity in prevalence estimates. Subgroup analyses showed that prevalence of suicidal ideation in females is higher than in males.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of suicidal ideation in Chinese college students is relatively high, although the suicide rate is lower compared with the entire society, suggesting the need for local surveys to inform the development of health services for college students.

AB Aim: This study aims to examine the effect of physical activity (PA) intensity on tobacco or alcohol abuse, suicide behaviours and psychopathological symptoms in junior and senior high school students in China.
   Methods: A total of 5453 students from nine middle schools participated in a self-administered anonymous survey to report their frequency of moderate and vigorous PA at a normal learning week. Tobacco or alcohol use in the past 30 days, suicide behaviours during the past 12 months were asked. The Symptoms Checklist 90 was used to assess general mental problem and nine special psychopathological symptoms. The Rosenberg's Self-esteem Scale and School Life Satisfaction Rating Questionnaire for Adolescent were selected to rate the respondents' self-esteem and school life satisfaction.
   Results: Percentage of high-, low-moderate- and very-low-intensity PA was 22.0%, 37.0% and 41.0%, respectively. By using multivariable multinomial logistic regression, it was indicated that low-moderate-intensity PA was a protective factor of depression (odds ratio (OR) was 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) was 0.40-0.91) and psychotic symptoms (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31-0.93), while high-intensity PA was a risk factor of binge drinking (OR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.29-2.54), suicide ideation (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.04-1.54), general psychological disorders (OR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.11-1.84), and hostile symptoms (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.03-2.07).
   Conclusion: Different intensity PA in adolescents had different association with risk health behaviours and psychopathological symptoms. The reasons are worth further researching.

AB The suicide rate for females in China is the second highest worldwide, and China is the only country in the world in which the rate of suicides is higher for women than men. Affective instability has been shown to be a strong predictor of suicidal ideation, particularly among women. However, prior research has mainly focused on the impact of women's negative affect on suicidal ideation, ignoring the influence of positive affect on suicidal ideation. Studies have revealed that hopelessness, which is 1.3 times more important than depression for explaining suicidal ideation, is driven more by low levels of positive affect than by high levels of negative affect. Although positive affect has also been found to be related to suicidal ideation, and it demonstrates independent, beneficial effects on mental health, much remains to be learned about the association between positive affective instability and suicidal ideation. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence of suicidal ideation among Chinese working women and explored the differences between working women with and without suicidal ideation in the intensity and daily variability of positive affect. A total of 222 young working women of ages 22-36 years (M = 27.64, SD = 3.73) were recruited from a free weekend psychology lecture. The women subsequently completed a daily diary Day Reconstruction Method (DRM) as well as a suicidal ideation questionnaire. We used hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to analyze the data, and the results showed that: (1) 10.81% of participates reported suicidal ideation, the intensity of positive affect (happiness, warmth/friendliness, interest and relaxation/calmness) was significantly lower for women with suicidal ideation compared to women without suicidal ideation; (2) differing diurnal patterns of positive emotions were observed between women with and without suicidal ideation; women with suicidal ideation demonstrated a significantly lower trend of growth and a higher volatility in happiness, warmth/friendliness, relaxation/calmness. Given that lower intensity of positive affect and greater affective instability significantly predicted suicidal ideation in Chinese women, researchers should pay more attention to the role of positive affect in female suicide prevention research and intervention efforts in the future.

AB China has nearly 1.4 billion people, of whom 238 million of children under 15 years old. In recent years, the rapid economic development and social reform have had a major impact on the mental health of children and adolescents. Although China lacks a nationwide study on the prevalence of mental disorders in children and adolescents, some regional studies have shown that the prevalence of mental disorders in children is close to 20% of the global level. This article reviews the current status of mental disorders in Chinese children, the prevalence of specific disorders in China, and the impact of culture on the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders in children and adolescents. Several important social issues are discussed, including the one-child policy and the left-behind children. The change of family structure and the increasingly fierce competition have weakened the traditional social support system. As a result, children's behavioral problems, emotional disorders among young college students, drug abuse and suicide rates among adolescents are increasing. Many people with mental disorders are not adequately cared for, because they lack qualified service providers and access to treatment. This article also lists some challenges and possible solutions, including multidisciplinary and culturally sensitive service models for children's mental health, and introduces relevant laws, policies and regulations.

AB Mental health in China is of growing concern to both policy-makers and researchers. The Tianjin Mental Health Survey (TJMHS) was conducted between July 2011 and March 2012 to assess the prevalence and risk factors of mental disorders in the context of recent economic growth and other socio-demographic changes in Tianjin, a municipality of 13 million on China's eastern seaboard. A multistage cluster random sample selected using probability proportionate to size methods participated in a two-phase screening procedure: 11,748 subjects 18 or older were screened for risk of psychopathology and then an enriched risk-proportional subsample of 4,438 subjects was interviewed by psychiatrists using an expanded Chinese version of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) Axis I disorders (SCID). The study also collected information about the impairment associated with mental disorders, mental health literacy, the stigmatization of mental disorders, and help-seeking behavior for psychological problems. This paper provides a detailed overview of the study rationale, objectives, field procedures, and pattern of response. It highlights several of the methodological challenges of maintaining quality control of a complex epidemiological study in the Chinese setting, issues that are relevant to other community-based epidemiological studies in low- and middle-income countries.

AB Background This study aims to find the status and prevalence of depressive symptoms among the population aged 60?years and above in China. Methods We conducted a meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies in older population. Epidemiological studies on depressive symptoms published in Chinese journals were identified manually and online by using the Chinese Biological Medical Literature Database, Chongqing VIP database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure database. Studies published in English journals were identified using Medlars Online. Results A total of 32 eligible studies were included in this review. The analysis showed that the pooled prevalence (with 95% confidence interval) of depressive symptoms for the seniors in China was 22.7% (confidence interval: 19.426.4%). The prevalence of depressive symptoms among the older was a little higher in women (24.2%) than in men (19.4%), in rural (29.2%) than urban (20.5%) areas, and in western (30.5%) than eastern (19.5%) areas. In addition, the prevalence of depressive symptoms decreased with increasing levels of education. However, it did not increase gradually with age. Conclusions The prevalence of depressive symptoms among the older in China was a little high, and it was varied by gender, age, area, and education level. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Background: Menarche is the first menstrual cycle. Menstrual problems, such as dysmenorrheal menorrhagia, oligomenorrhea, and irregular cycle are common in female adolescents. This research aims to examine the associations between age at menarche and menstrual problems and suicidal behavior among Chinese female adolescents.
   Methods: An epidemiological survey of 5831 female adolescents from eight high schools of three counties of Shandong province, China, was conducted. A self-administered paper-and-pencil questionnaire was used to collect information. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between menstruation and suicidality.
   Results: The mean age of the sample was 15.02 (SD=1.44) years. Of the sample, 5,231 (90.0%) had experienced their first menstrual cycle, and 23.2%, 10.4%, and 4.5% of the sample reported having had suicidal ideation, plan and attempt, respectively. In multivariate models, menarche at <= 11 years was associated with increased risk of suicidal ideation (OR=1.41, 95%CI: 1.10-1.81) and menarche at 12 years was associated with suicide plan (OR=1.23, 95%CI: 1.00-1.51). Irregular menstrual cycle was significantly associated with increased risk of suicidal ideation (OR=1.40, 95%CI: 1.05-1.86) and menstrual period less than or equal to 4 days was significantly associated with increased risk of suicide plan (OR=1.32, 95%CI: 1.06-1.66).
   Limitations: This cross-sectional study cannot establish the causal directions between menstrual problems and suicidality in adolescents.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that earlier menarche, irregular menstrual cycle and short menstrual period are associated with suicidal behavior in female adolescents. Further research is warranted to examine the causal relationship between menstrual problems and suicidal behavior in adolescents.

AB Objective: This study examined the differences in 14-year outcomes of persons with schizophrenia with and without family history of psychosis in a rural community in China.
   Methods: All participants with schizophrenia (n = 510) aged 15 years and older were identified in a 1994 epidemiological investigation of 123,572 people and followed up in 2004 and 2008 in Xinjin County, Chengdu, China.
   Results: Individuals with positive family history of schizophrenia had significantly younger age of first onset than those with negative family history of schizophrenia in 1994 and 2004. Compared with individuals with negative family history of schizophrenia, those with positive family history of schizophrenia had significantly higher rate of homelessness and lower rate of death due to other reasons in 10-year (2004) and 14-year follow-up (2008). There were no significantly differences of mean scores on PANSS, SDSS and GAF in 2008 between positive and negative family history groups.
   Conclusions: The positive family history of schizophrenia is strongly related to younger age of onset, and may predict a poorer long-term outcome (e.g., higher rate of homelessness) in persons with schizophrenia in the rural community. The findings have implications for further studies on specific family-related mechanisms on clinical treatment and rehabilitation, as well as for planning and delivering of community-based mental health services.

ID YOUNG ADULTHOOD; MULTIPLE; CHILDHOOD; MIXTURE; NUMBER; YOUTH
AB Background
   Adolescent health risk behaviors are a public health priority given their prevalence and their associations with chronic diseases and life quality in adulthood. This study examined the heterogeneity of adolescent health risk behaviors and the associations between demographic characteristics and subgroup membership in rural western China.
   Methods
   In fall 2015, 2805 students from rural middle schools in Sichuan Province were surveyed using the Health-Related Behavior Questionnaire for Adolescents. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify subgroups of adolescents with distinct patterns of health risk behaviors. Differences in class membership related to selected demographic characteristics were examined using multinomial logistic regression analysis.
   Results
   A four-class model emerged: (1) high-risk group (n = 108, 4.0%), (2) high-physical-inactivity and suicide-risk group (n = 340, 12.1%), (3) moderate-risk group (n = 897, 32.0%), and (4) low-risk group (n = 1460, 52.1%). The multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that boys and adolescents with poor parental relationships and high allowances (spending money) were significantly more likely to be in the high-risk group than the low-risk group.
   Conclusions
   Adolescents in rural western China are a heterogeneous population requiring different tailored and effective interventions.

AB Background: In contrast with most developed countries, mortality from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) continues to rise in China. We examined secular trends and age, period, and cohort effects in mortality from AMI in China from 1987 to 2014.
   Methods: Data on deaths from AMI between 1987 and 2014 were obtained from the Chinese Health Statistics Annual Report (1987-2001) and the Chinese Health Statistics Yearbook (2003-2015). We then conducted an age-period-cohort analysis using the intrinsic estimator approach.
   Results: There was an upward trend in AMI mortality in both urban and rural populations that accelerated from 2004 onwards. AMImortality increased 5.6-fold from1987 to 2014. The net age effect on AMImortality increased exponentially. AMI mortality risk in the 80-84 years of age bracket was 220.15 and 190.70 times higher than in the 15-19 years of age bracket in urban and rural populations, respectively. Therewas a V-shaped trend in the net period effect between 1999 and 2009. Meanwhile, although there was a global reduction in the cohort effect in urban and rural AMI mortality, we found a modest increase among urban populations born between 1975 and 1989 and rural populations born between 1990 and 1999.
   Conclusion: The changes in exposure to lifestyle-related risk factors and triggers such as air pollution have contributed to the increase in AMI mortality in China over recent decades. The sharp increase in AMI mortality since 2004 is primarily attributable to population aging and the rise in AMI deaths among younger generations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a highly prevalent and serious public health problem among adolescents worldwide. However, to date there were no studies assessing the prevalence of NSSI defined by suggested DSM-5 criteria among Chinese adolescents. We aimed to conduct a nationwide survey to explore the prevalence of and risk factors for NSSI among school-based adolescents in rural China.
   Methods: A total sample of 15,623 adolescents in rural China were enrolled by using a multistage sampling method. Data was collected by self-report questionnaires including demographic characteristics, neglect, maltreatment, loneliness, resilience, social support and emotional management ability. NSSI was defined by suggested DSM-5 criteria, according to which the engagement in self-injury took place more than 5 times a year. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between risk factors and NSSI.
   Results: There were 12.2% of adolescents (n = 1908) met the suggested DSM-5 criteria. Approximately 29% reported a history of NSSI at least once during the last year. Significant differences were found in several demographic factors including gender, ethnicity, grade, and family structure between adolescents with and without experiencing NSSI. The top three NSSI behaviors among adolescents with NSSI experience were hitting self, pinching, and pulling hair, with a prevalence rate of 16.7%, 14.1% and 11.2%, respectively. Female, Han ethnicity, fathers' education level, neglect, maltreatment, loneliness, social support, suicidal behaviors and emotional management ability were significantly associated with NSSI by multivariate analysis. No significant relationship was found between resilience and risk of NSSI.
   Limitation: The DSM-5 has proposed 6 groups of criteria for NSSI, we only used criteria on frequency given its more accepted feasibility and pragmatic application. Consequently, it may different from other prevalence that estimated by other criteria.
   Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting prevalence of NSSI defined by suggested DSM-5 criteria among adolescent in rural China. In comparison to finding from the similar samples of adolescents, Chinese rural adolescents seem to have a relative higher prevalence. The potential risk factors for NSSI include female, father's education, Han ethnicity, psychosocial factors and suicide behaviors. More evidence for further understanding of context of the occurrence, improving access to health care utilization, and identifying the role of psychosocial factors and family relationship, is needed for the prevention and management of NSSI.

AB Aims Few studies have investigated the prescription patterns of clozapine in outpatients with schizophrenia in China. It is an important issue due to clozapine's high efficacy and potentially fatal side effect profile. This study examined the use of clozapine and its correlates in China.
   Methods Three hundred ninety-eight clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia were randomly selected and interviewed in Hong Kong (HK) and Beijing (BJ). Assessment instruments included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Simpson and Angus Scale of Extrapyramidal Symptoms, Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale and the Hong Kong and Mainland China World Health Organization Quality of Life Schedule-Brief version. Assessments were performed by the same investigator in both sites.
   Results Clozapine was prescribed to 15.6% of (n = 62) patients. There was a wide inter-site variation between HK and BJ. Use of clozapine was associated with age, age at onset, extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), having health insurance, use of depot and typical antipsychotic and anticholinergic drugs and benzodiazepines as well as history of suicidal attempts. On multiple logistic regression analysis, the number of hospitalizations, site (HK vs. BJ), use of typical antipsychotics, polypharmacy and co-prescription with anticholinergics were significantly associated with the prescription of clozapine. No significant differences were found between the clozapine and non-clozapine groups with regard to any of the quality of life domains.
   Conclusion A combination of economical and clinical factors, health policies and the characteristics of the treatment settings plays important roles in determining clozapine use. Clozapine appears to have little significant influence on quality of life in clinical stable Chinese patients with schizophrenia. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS; TRAUMA
AB Objective This study aims to provide alternative care plans for mental health of North Korean refugees who are ill protective facilities in China.
   Methods Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) Was utilized to measure the presence/absence of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among 65 North Korean refugees.
   Results The gender differences in PAI t-scores showed that women exhibited meaningfully higher scores largely in anxiety (m=61.85), depression (m=65.23), and schizophrenia (m=60.98). In different age groups, schizophrenia in the 30 age bracket (m=65.23) was meaningfully higher than the teens (m=48.11). Aggression among the treatment features was the highest in the 20 age group (m=59.19) showing higher t-scores than the teens (m=39.67). Duration in the facility affected mental health in that the 3-5 years group (m=63.91) reported the highest in paranoia. Groups of under 1 year and less than 1-3 years showed meaningfully higher scores in nonsupport. The PTSD (including partial PTSD) rate of the group recorded 9.2%. Correlation between the PTSD and PAI Scores showed that the full-PTSD group demonstrated higher average scores in negative impression, somatic complaints, anxiety, anxiety-related disorder, depression, paranoia, schizophrenia, antisocial features, suicide ideation, and treatment rejection than the non-PTSD group.
   Conclusion Mental health of North Korean refugees in China was worse ill women, the thirties, and less than 3-5 years in the facility, and it deteriorated as the duration prolonged. To promote better psychological health of North Korean refugees ill China, the attention and aid from the protection facilities and domestic and international interests are required.

AB In this retrospective study, we report the epidemiological characteristics of all poisoning deaths in Epirus, Greece, from 1998 to 2010; we present the toxicological findings and the statistical evaluation of the results. This is the first detailed scientific report on all the officially certified poisoning deaths concerning part of the Greek population. A total of 126 poisoning fatalities were recorded, 67 of them being mono-intoxications (53.2%). The cause of poisoning was as follows: drugs of abuse (60%); carbon monoxide (19.8%); pesticides (9.5%); corrosives (4.8%); pharmaceuticals (4.8%); and spider bite (0.8%). The most frequently detected poisonous substances were as follows: heroin (65 cases), ethanol (55), benzodiazepines (42), carbon monoxide (25), cocaine (17), cannabinoids (17) and pesticides (12). Increasing tendency in poisoning death rates was recorded, due to an increase in accidental poisoning deaths attributed mainly to drugs of abuse (total, accidental, and drugs-of-abuse poisoning death rates per 100,000 inhabitants per year were 1.87, 1.19, and 0.79, respectively, in the period 19982002 and 3.97, 3.41, and 2.55, respectively, in the period 20072010).

AB Background One purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of conducting epidemiological survey on suicidal thoughts and behaviors (hereafter suicidal thoughts/behaviors; i.e., any suicidal ideation, serious ideation, planning, and attempts) among older adults in rural China. Another purpose was to investigate among older people in rural China the prevalence of suicidal thoughts/behaviors, as well as their sociodemographic and clinical correlates. Methods A randomly selected sample of 263 subjects, 50?years or older, was recruited in a remote rural area of Southwestern China (Mianyang Region, Sichuan Province) and interviewed using structured instruments. Basic sociodemographic and clinical data were collected. Results There was no refusal among approached subjects, and subjects were willing to answer questions on suicidal thoughts/behaviors. The lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, serious ideation, planning, and attempt was 28.9% (23.4%34.4%), 19.7% (14.9%24.6%), 11.4% (7.5%15.3%), and 5.3% (2.6%8.1%), respectively. The corresponding 12-month prevalence was 8.8% (5.3%12.2%), 5.3% (2.6%8.1%), 2.7% (0.7%4.6%), and 0%, respectively. The 2-week prevalence was 3.4% (1.2%5.6%), 2.3% (0.5%4.1%), 2.3% (0.5%4.1%), and 0%, respectively. Correlates of suicidal thoughts/behaviors of this group are similar to findings from other community studies, such as female gender, unmarried status, major medical conditions, insomnia, financial difficulties and lower education, depressive symptoms, recent stressful life events, greater life dissatisfaction. Conclusions Our findings suggest that larger scale epidemiological survey of suicidal thoughts/behaviors on older adults in rural China would be feasible. Suicidal thoughts/behaviors are common among older people in rural China, as seen in this preliminary study, which points to the need for further larger scale investigations.

AB The objective of this paper is to introduce the epidemiology of injuries in China, and then consider the development of safe communities in regard to injury prevention and safety promotion. The disease spectrum has changed in recent decades in the People's Republic of China. Both in cities and rural areas, injury has become the fifth leading cause of death. At least 800 000 people die from injury each year, and 50 million non-fatal injuries occur, of which 2.3 million lead to disability of varying degrees of severity. The average injury-related death rate in China from 1990 to 1997 was 66 per 100 000, which accounts for 11% of total deaths. The potential years of life lost (PYLL) of injury accounts for 24% of the total, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) account for 17%. Main injury causes of death, in descending order, are: suicide, traffic accident, drowning, falling, poisoning, homicide, burn and scald, and iatrogenic injury. Considering China's current injury status and its rapid societal change, injury prevention and safety promotion need to be strengthened further, and there is a special need for the development of Safe Communities programmes. The prevention of injuries through safety promotion has been increasingly focussed on over recent decades. The WHO Safe Community model is recognized as representing an effective and long-term approach to the prevention of injuries at a local level, and has been beneficially applied all over the world. A programme may cover several aspects of injury prevention and safety promotion simultaneously, or only include one or two aspects. In a Safe Community programme in China, children, the elderly, cyclists and their passengers, and farmers should be among the prioritized target populations. However, multi-focussed inter-sectoral programmes have been shown to have additional effects to distinct sectoral programmes.

ID HIV TRANSMISSION RISK; SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR; MEN; ABUSE; SAMPLE
AB Background: Men who have sex with men (MSM) have become a high-risk group of HIV infection in China. To date, little is known regarding the behavioral, social and psychological characteristics in Chinese MSM, which makes the implementation of preventive and therapeutic strategies for this high-risk subpopulation of people extremely difficult.
   Methods: A total of 714 questionnaires were retrieved from the database of a Chinese government-sponsored National Key Research Project titled "Risk Analysis and Strategic Prevention of HIV Transmission from MSM to the General Population in China". The respondents were categorized into a high-risk group and a control group. Their behavioral, social and psychological characteristics were comparatively analyzed.
   Results: Of the 714 MSM analyzed, 59 (8.26%) had high-risk homosexual behaviors. This sub-group of MSM had a higher in-marriage rate, a higher monthly income, heavier alcohol consumption and more serious problems with sexual abuse in childhood, intentional suicide attempts and mistaken assumption on condom's role in protecting HIV infection, as compared with the control group (P < 0.05). In contrast, the two groups did not differ significantly the sexual orientation, level of education, types of profession, drug use, condom use and experience of social stigma and discrimination (P > 0.05). A vast majority of the individuals in both behavior categories expressed support of legally protected gay clubs as well as gay marriage legislation in China. There was a strong correlation between high-risk behaviors and sexual abuse in childhood, alcohol drinking, income level and a mistaken belief in perfect HIV protection through the use of condoms.
   Conclusions: MSM with and without high-risk homosexual behaviors have different social and psychological characteristics, which should be taken into account when implementing behavioral and therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing HIV/AIDS transmission among MSM as well as from MSM to the general population in China.

AB Background
   Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide; however, the prevalence and risk factors for the immediate precursors to suicide - suicidal ideation, plans and attempts - are not well-known, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
   Aims
   To report on the prevalence and risk factors for suicidal behaviours across 17 countries.
   Method
   A total of 84850 adults were interviewed regarding suicidal behaviours and socio-demographic and psychiatric risk factors.
   Results The cross-national lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts is 9.2% (s.e.=0.1), 3.1% (s.e.=0.1), and 2.7% (s.e.=0.1). Across all countries, 60% of transitions from ideation to plan and attempt occur within the first year after ideation onset. Consistent cross-national risk factors included being female, younger, less educated, unmarried and having a mental disorder. interestingly, the strongest diagnostic risk factors were mood disorders in high-income countries but impulse control disorders in low- and middle-income countries.
   Conclusion
   There is cross-national variability in the prevalence of suicidal behaviours, but strong consistency in the characteristics and risk factors for these behaviours. These findings have significant implications for the prediction and prevention of suicidal behaviours.

AB Two informants were interviewed for each of 416 living controls (individuals sampled from the normal population) interviewed in a Chinese case-control psychological autopsy study. The validity of proxy data, obtained using seven psychological autopsy information reconstruction techniques (types 1, 2 and A - E), was evaluated, with living controls' self reports used as the gold-standard. Proxy data for reconstruction technique types 1, 2 and D on the Impulsivity Inventory Scale (total impulsivity score) were no different from the living controls' self report gold standard, whereas data for types A and E were smaller than data from living controls. On the 'acceptance or resignation' sub-scale of the avoidance coping dimension of the Moos Coping Response Inventory, information obtained by reconstruction technique types 1 and D was not significantly different from the living controls' self reports, whereas proxy data from types 2, A and E were smaller than those from the living controls. No statistically significant differences were identified for other proxy data obtained by reconstruction technique types 1, 2, A, D and E. These results indicate that using a second informant does not significantly enhance information reconstruction for the target.

AB The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and correlates of suicidal behaviors among college students in Jilin Province, China. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2016, using a self-reported questionnaire. Convenience sampling method was used to select college students as participants. The analysis was based on a sample of 730 college students. We use multivariate logistic model to determine the risk factors of suicidal behaviors.The prevalence of suicidal ideation, suicidal plan, suicidal attempts were respectively 13.2%, 3.3% and 3.4%. After controlling for the potential confounding factors, history of family psychiatric illness, depression and quality of life were significantly associated with suicidal ideation. Besides, suicidal plan was predicted significantly by not living together with university roommates and depression. In terms of suicidal attempts, not living together with university roommates and history of family psychiatric illness were its risk factors. Comprehensive interventions regarding aims at risk factors may be critical as effective strategies to protect college students from suicide.

AB The aim in this study was to investigate the characteristics and regularity of changes in mental state of the Chinese public during the period of the SARS outbreak in China (2003). The self-administered SARS Mentality Questionnaire was sent to 8775 people who came from 20 different professions in the cities of Guangzhou (23.5%), Beijing (37.8%) and Xi'an (38.7%). Of the participants 59.4% were male. Ages ranged from 17 to 76 years. After the pilot study, 33 items were included in the questionnaire. Of the people surveyed, 96.4% presented marked emotional change and 23.3% showed blind behavior; 76.7% took "access to relevant information" as effective measures against emergencies; 45.5% believed that SARS would cause more harm to human beings than cancer, AIDS and suicide resulting from depression. The change of emotion during the SARS epidemic was significantly different, as compared to normal circumstances. The uncertainty people have about the epidemic development was a key cause of panic during this time.

AB The number of empty-nest elderly is on the rise, especially in rural areas of China. The empty-nest elderly were concerned from social and demographic perspective, but researches on mental health issues of the aged were still rare in China. To clarify the prevalence of depression among empty-nest elderly in a rural area of YongZhou, Hunan and evaluate the impact of social support, coping style and socio-demographic factors on depression of the empty-nest elderly, with the goal of decreasing the rate of depression in empty-nest elderly, a questionnaire survey was conducted on 415 elderly persons. The determined prevalence of depressive symptoms was 74.46%. The empty-nest group, in comparison with the non-empty nest group, had higher levels of depression. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed associations between depressive symptoms and negative coping style, support utilization, religious beliefs, economic status, marital status and subjective support. The results suggested that the strategy to alleviate the depression in empty-nest elderly can be considered by the society, village committee, the family members and the empty-nest elderly subjects themselves, which could control effectively the incidence of depression.

AB China has the highest excess of male births in the world at 118 to every 100 female, with a current excess of 20 million men of reproductive age. The impact on the psychological well-being of the large numbers of men who will never marry is unclear. This study was carried out to test the hypothesis that older never-married men are more predisposed to depression, low self-esteem and aggression.
   The study was a cross-sectional survey using a self-completion questionnaire conducted in high sex ratio rural areas of Yunnan and Guizhou provinces. The tools used were the Beck Depression Inventory, Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale and the Bryant-Smith Aggression questionnaire.
   A total of 1,059 never-married men and 1,066 married men aged 30-40 completed questionnaires. Never-married men were financially poorer and had lower education levels than married ones. After adjusting for age, education and income, never-married men were significantly more likely to have lower self-esteem scores (P < 0.001), higher depression scores (P < 0.001), higher aggression scores (P < 0.001) and were more likely to have suicidal thoughts or wishes (P < 0.001) than married men.
   The high prevalence of severe depression and suicide ideation in these men is of particular concern. In rural China mental health services are currently very sparse, but rural doctors could be trained to use a check score to identify severe depression, and refer as appropriate to specialist services.

AB Schizophrenia is a major cause of psychiatric disability in China. In the present study, we estimated total and age-specific prevalence of both schizophrenia disability and associated mortality among Chinese women and men. We further examined whether sex differences in prevalence were attributable to mortality differences between men and women. Data from the Second China National Sample Survey on Disability (2006) and the 2007-2010 follow-up studies were utilized. Possibly psychiatrically disabled individuals were administered the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule, Version II and the ICD-10 Symptom Checklist for Mental Disorders by trained clinical psychiatrists. In total, 0.37% of men and 0.44% of women were living with schizophrenia disability in China. We did not find statistically significant differences in the 4-year cumulative mortality between men and women. Overall standardized mortality ratios for the age groups of 18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, and 70+ years were 120.89, 29.56, 15.06, 9.16, 10.57, and 4.95, respectively. In conclusion, mortality differences between men and women were unlikely to be a major contributor to sex differences in prevalence. Premature death among younger individuals experiencing schizophrenia disability warrants urgent attention. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background: Suicide causes rising economic costs and public health risks for communities in the worldwide. Physical activity (PA) is considered a potentially feasible approach to reduce risk of suicide with low cost and high accessibility, and therefore attracting increasing attention. However, current literature on the association between PA and suicidal behavior amongst elderly people in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are scarce. Therefore, in this study we aimed to examine the relationship between suicidal thoughts (ST) and suicidal attempts (SA) with PA among elderly people in five LMICs.
   Methods: Cross-sectional data were collected from WHO's Study of Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) with 2,861 participants aged 50 years or above. Variables included: self-reported occurrence of ST and SA during past 12 months and four types of PA (vigorous physical activity (VPA), moderate physical activity (MPA), walking/bike riding, moderate leisure time physical activity (MLPA)).
   Results: The overall prevalence of taking >75 min of VPA/week, >150 min/week, MLPA and walking/bike riding were, respectively, 85.4% (95% CI [81.3-88.7]), 61.6% (95% CI [52.9-69.6]), 9.6% (95% CI [7.2-12.6]) and 75.1% (95% CI [68.7-80.6]). Respectively, 31.0% (95% CI [24.3-38.7]) and 5.5% (95% CI [3.9-7.5]) of the respondents reported having morbid thoughts and SA during last 12 months. In adjusted multivariable regression analysis, not engaging in PA revealed positive association with higher odds of having morbid thoughts and SA, however, with varying degrees for different types of PA among men and women and across countries. The adjusted odds ratio among elderly who encountered ST increased significantly with PA levels (1.265 in male and 1.509 in female with VPA, 1.292 in male and 1.449 in female with MPA, 1.669 in female with LMPA and 3.039 in women with walk/bike); similarly, with SA (1.526, 1.532, 1.474 and 1.392 in women with VPA, MPA, LMPA and Walk/bike, respectively). The degree of adjusted odds ratio varied between genders and among countries.
   Conclusion: Although the data were cross-sectional, and no linear dose-response relationship was observed between PA and morbid thought and suicide ideation, the findings provide important indications of potential harmful effects of no/inadequate PA on psychological morbidities among older individuals. Promoting adequate PA among older individuals through community-based suicide prevention programs can potentially contribute to reduction in the burden of PA in LMICs.

AB Background: It is unclear about the change and risk factors of depression among adolescent survivors after earthquake.Aims: This study aimed to explore the change of depression, and identify the predictive factors of depression among adolescent survivors after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China.Methods: The depression among high school students at 6, 12 and 18 months after the Wenchuan earthquake were investigated. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used in this study to assess the severity of depression.Results: Subjects included 548 student survivors in an affected high school. The rates of depression among the adolescent survivors at 6-, 12- and 18-month after the earthquake were 27.3%, 42.9% and 33.3%, respectively, for males, and 42.9%, 61.9% and 53.4%, respectively, for females. Depression symptoms, trauma-related self-injury, suicidal ideation and PTSD symptoms at the 6-month follow-up were significant predictive factors for depression at the 18-month time interval following the earthquake.Conclusions: This study highlights the need for considering disaster-related psychological sequela and risk factors of depression symptoms in the planning and implementation of mental health services. Long-term mental and psychological supports for victims of natural disasters are imperative.

ID HONG-KONG; EFFICACY
AB ObjectiveLittle is known about the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in older Chinese psychiatric patients. This study examined the frequency of ECT and the demographic and clinical correlates in older psychiatric patients hospitalized in a large psychiatric institution in Beijing, China.
   MethodsThis was a retrospective chart review of 2339 inpatients aged 60years and older treated over a period of 8years (2007-2013) in a university-affiliated psychiatric institution in Beijing. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from the electronic chart management system for discharged patients.
   ResultsThe rate of ECT use was 28.1% in the whole sample; 37.9% in those with bipolar disorders, 43.6% in major depression, 21.2% in schizophrenia, and 10.7% in other diagnoses. ECT (ECT group) was associated with 60-65-year age group, high risk for suicide and low risk for falls at the time of admission, use of mood stabilizers and antidepressants, lack of health insurance, and having major medical conditions and diagnosis of major depression. The above significant correlates explained 24.9% of the variance of ECT use (p<0.001).
   ConclusionsIn a major psychiatric hospital in China, the use of ECT was common among older patients. ECT use in older patients treated in other clinical settings warrants further investigations. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB To analyze the factors that affecting the help-seeking behavior of bipolar disorder (BD) patients by conducting interviews BD individuals in Hunan province of China.
   In 2015, 72,999 people from 123 counties of Hunan province of China were interviewed through multistage stratified random sampling. Twelve items of general health questionnaire (GHQ-12) and abnormal behavioral clue questionnaire were used as screening tools. The Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) (SCID) was used as a diagnostic tool.
   Among the 75 BD patients, 36% (27/75) sought help. Compared with help-seekers, non-help-seekers were more likely to be older, divorced, or widowed, mostly illiterate or elementary education, family monthly income at least 3000 (sic), more physically consulted in the past year, able to effective work or study, at a stable illness status. 70.4% help-seekers firstly sought help from a medical institution. The main reasons that patients did not seek help were economic problem, did not know where to seek help, unsatisfied with medical services, afraid of mental health stigma, and other problems, such as traffic inconvenience.
   Non-help-seekers were faced with more difficulties in their social functions and social interactions.

AB BackgroundCross-national comparisons of the associations of socioeconomic and religious factors with health can facilitate our understanding of differences in health determinants between countries and the development of policies to reduce health differentials appropriate to each country. However, very few such studies have been conducted in East Asia.MethodsThis study set out to compare the associations of socioeconomic and religious factors with health in China and Korea using the 2010 East Asian Social Survey, which was based on nationally representative samples. The study participants included 4980 individuals, 3629 in China and 1351 in Korea, aged 20years. The dependent variable, individuals' self-rated health, was categorized into poor, good, and excellent. Socioeconomic (education, employment, household income, and self-assessed social class) and religious factors (affiliation) were used as independent variables of interest. A multinomial logistic regression was performed with and without adjustments for factors such as demographics, health-related risks, the health system, and social capital.ResultsAccording to the results, China had a higher proportion of individuals who reported excellent health than did Korea (57.4% vs. 52.0%). After adjusting for all studied confounders, we found that the employment, household income, and social class gradient in health were significant in China, whereas the education and religion gradients in health were significant in Korea. For example, the odds ratio for poor health versus excellent health among those in the highest social class was 0.47 (95% CI, 0.27-0.84), compared to that of people in the lowest social class in China; and this odds ratio in people with college education or higher was 0.28 (95% CI, 0.14-0.59) compared to that of people with elementary school education or lower in Korea.ConclusionsThese findings demonstrate the important role of socioeconomic and religious factors in health in China and Korea as well as clear differences in this regard. Further cross-national studies are needed to provide a better understanding of the relationship between socioeconomic and religious factors and health and to draft appropriate health improvement policies in both countries.

AB Background China has experienced a remarkable epidemiological and demographic transition during the past three decades. Far less is known about this transition at the subnational level. Timely and accurate assessment of the provincial burden of disease is needed for evidence-based priority setting at the local level in China.
   Methods Following the methods of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013), we have systematically analysed all available demographic and epidemiological data sources for China at the provincial level. We developed methods to aggregate county-level surveillance data to inform provincial-level analysis, and we used local data to develop specific garbage code redistribution procedures for China. We assessed levels of and trends in all-cause mortality, causes of death, and years of life lost (YLL) in all 33 province-level administrative units in mainland China, all of which we refer to as provinces, for the years between 1990 and 2013.
   Findings All provinces in mainland China have made substantial strides to improve life expectancy at birth between 1990 and 2013. Increases ranged from 4.0 years in Hebei province to 14.2 years in Tibet. Improvements in female life expectancy exceeded those in male life expectancy in all provinces except Shanghai, Macao, and Hong Kong. We saw significant heterogeneity among provinces in life expectancy at birth and probability of death at ages 0-14, 15-49, and 50-74 years. Such heterogeneity is also present in cause of death structures between sexes and provinces. From 1990 to 2013, leading causes of YLLs changed substantially. In 1990, 16 of 33 provinces had lower respiratory infections or preterm birth complications as the leading causes of YLLs. 15 provinces had cerebrovascular disease and two (Hong Kong and Macao) had ischaemic heart disease. By 2013, 27 provinces had cerebrovascular disease as the leading cause, five had ischaemic heart disease, and one had lung cancer (Hong Kong). Road injuries have become a top ten cause of death in all provinces in mainland China. The most common non-communicable diseases, including ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancers (liver, stomach, and lung), contributed much more to YLLs in 2013 compared with 1990.
   Interpretation Rapid transitions are occurring across China, but the leading health problems and the challenges imposed on the health system by epidemiological and demographic change differ between groups of Chinese provinces. Localised health policies need to be implemented to tackle the diverse challenges faced by local health-care systems.

AB Debates about whether the relationship between religiousness and depression is nonlinear have continued, but no definitive conclusions thus far have been drawn. Unlike most previous research in this area, which has been based on U. S. populations, this study focuses on a sample of 882 young rural Chinese women. Results from analyses reveal an inverse U-shaped relationship between intrinsic religiosity and depression. In addition, results show that intrinsic religiosity and religious activities exacerbate the deleterious effects of particular life events such as childbirth issues and marital conflicts. Implications of the findings for future studies on the subject are discussed.

AB The mariner-based Himar1 system has been utilized for creating mutant libraries of many Gram-positive bacteria. Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) and Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus (SEZ) are primary pathogens of swine that threaten the swine industry in China. To provide a forward-genetics technology for finding virulent phenotype-related genes in these two pathogens, we constructed a novel temperature-sensitive suicide shuttle plasmid, pMar4s, which contains the Himar1 system transposon, TnYLB-1, and the Himar1 C9 transposase from pMarA and the repTAs temperature-sensitive fragment from pSET4s. The kanamycin (Kan) resistance gene was in the TnYLB-1 transposon. Temperature sensitivity and Kan resistance allowed the selection of mutant strains and construction of the mutant library. The SS2 and SEZ mutant libraries were successfully constructed using the pMar4s plasmid. Inverse-Polymerase Chain Reaction (Inverse-PCR) results revealed large variability in transposon insertion sites and that the library could be used for phenotype alteration screening. The thiamine biosynthesis gene apbE was screened for its influence on SS2 anti-phagocytosis; likewise, the sagF gene was identified to be a hemolytic activity-related gene in SEZ. pMar4s was suitable for mutant library construction, providing more information regarding SS2 and SEZ virulence factors and illustrating the pathogenesis of swine streptococcosis.

AB Sleep duration has received considerable attention as a potential risk factor of suicidality in youths; however, evidence on the dose-response association between sleep duration and suicidality has not been synthesized. This meta-analysis examined linear and nonlinear dose-response relationships between sleep duration and the risk of suicidality in adolescents and explored potential moderators of the associations. Electronic databases, namely EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I Wanfang Data (Chinese database), and the China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database, were searched from their inception to April 18, 2017. Studies examining the association between sleep duration and suicidality in adolescents were included. A random-effects dose-response model was used to estimate the linear and nonlinear dose-response relationships. We identified 13 reports that included a total of 598,281 participants for a systematic review, and 12 reports were further used for a dose-response meta-analysis. Strong curvilinear dose-response associations were obtained for both suicidal ideation and attempts, with the lowest suicidal ideation and attempt risks at sleep durations of 8 h and 8-9 h per day (all P-nonlinearity < 0.001). A linear dose-response relationship between sleep duration and suicide plans (pooled OR = 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.88-0.90) was obtained, indicating that the risk of suicide plans statistically decreased by 11% for every 1-h increase in sleep duration. Depression did not moderate the association between sleep duration and suicidality in youths. Our findings suggest curvilinear dose-response associations between sleep duration and the risks of suicidal ideation and attempts and a linear dose-response relationship between sleep duration and suicide plan risk. Additional longitudinal studies are warranted to establish causality. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: Globally, adolescents are at risk of depression, traumatic stress, and suicide, especially those living in vulnerable environments. This article examines the mental health of 15- to 19-year-old youth in five cities and identifies the social support correlates of mental health.
   Methods: A total of 2,393 adolescents aged 15-19 years in economically distressed neighborhoods in Baltimore, MD; New Delhi, India; Ibadan, Nigeria; Johannesburg, South Africa; and Shanghai, China were recruited in 2013 via respondent-driven sampling to participate in a survey using an audio computer-assisted self-interview. Weighted logistic regression and general linear models were used to explore the associations between mental health and social supports.
   Results: The highest levels of depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms were displayed in Johannesburg among females (44.6% and 67.0%, respectively), whereas the lowest were among New Delhi females andmales (13.0% and 16.3%, respectively). The prevalence of suicidal ideation ranged from 7.9% (New Delhi female adolescents) to 39.6% (Johannesburg female adolescents); the 12-month prevalence of suicide attempts ranged from 1.8% (New Delhi females) to 18.3% (Ibadan males). Elevated perceptions of having a caring female adult in the home and feeling connected to their neighborhoods were positively associated with adolescents' levels of hope across the sites while negatively associated with depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms with some variation across sites and gender.
   Conclusions: Adolescents living in the very economically distressed areas studied register high levels of depression and posttraumatic stress. Improving social supports in families and neighborhoods may alleviate distress and foster hope. In particular, strengthening supports from female caretakers to their adolescents at home may improve the outlooks of their daughters. (C) 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB BackgroundsSuicidal ideation is an important public health issue due to devastating mortality. In the meantime, interpersonal trust was found to be negatively associated with mental disorder and physical health. Although there is increasing evidence that interpersonal trust is a significant predictor of suicidal ideation, evidence of this association is still lacking in the developing world. The aim of this study was to test the association between interpersonal trust and suicidal ideation among older adults in China.MethodsUsing a multi-stage stratified sampling strategy, 7070 older adults aged 60 and above from Shandong Province, China were recruited in this study. Socio-demographic characteristics, health status, family relationship, psychological distress, interpersonal trust and suicidal ideation in the last 12months were obtained through face to face interviews. The association between interpersonal trust and suicidal ideation was assessed using multiple logistic regression models adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics, health status, family relationship and psychological distress.Results7.1% of participants reported suicidal ideation in the past 12months, which was related to gender, resident area, marital status, educational level, self-rated economic, chronic disease, self-rated health status and family relationship within 1 month, psychological distress and interpersonal trust. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors, health status, family relationship and psychological distress, interpersonal mistrust was associated with two times odds of suicidal ideation when compared to interpersonal trustConclusionsThe interpersonal trust was associated with suicidal ideation among elderly in Shandong, China. Intervention approaches regarding inducing and promoting interpersonal trust should be developed to prevent suicide.

AB Objectives. Suicidal behavior is a serious public health problem which is partly heritable. Identifying the genes and the neurobiologic pathways relevant to suicidal behavior is important for preventative strategies. One family-based study reported an association between sodium channel voltage gated type VIII alpha (SCN8A) and suicidal behavior. In the present study, we aimed to search for SCN8A polymorphisms conferring genetic susceptibility to suicide in the Chinese population. Methods. A total of 626 subjects was recruited for the study, including 297 suicide attempters and 329 non-attempters from Shanghai, China. We conducted a case-control association analysis of five SNPs (rs10506302, rs1601012, rs4762004, rs12581041, rs17126078) within the region of SCN8A gene. Results. we found that two genetic polymorphisms showed statistically significant differences between cases and controls (rs1601012, P=0.004; rs12581041, P=0.01). Moreover, no haplotypes were significantly associated with suicidal behavior in psychiatric disorders after the false discovery rate (FDR) correction. In the analysis of schizophrenia subgroup, three genetic polymorphisms showed statistically significant differences between cases and controls (rs10506302, P=0.024; rs1601012, P=0.004; rs12581041, P=0.004). Conclusions. Our findings suggest that the SCN8A gene may be involved in the susceptibility to suicidal behavior among psychiatric disorder patients in the Han Chinese population.

AB Purpose: The objective of this study was to examine the influence of sexual identity and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among rural high school students in less developed areas of China. Methods: Behavior risk factors data collected from 1810 students from a high school in Jiangxi province, China. Five measures of childhood abuse and household dysfunction were summarized, and ACE was divided into 0, 1, 2, 3-5 ACEs. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the influence of sexual identity, adverse childhood experiences, and their interaction with non-suicidal self-injury. Results: Compared with heterosexual students, high school students who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) have a higher tendency of non-suicidal self-injury (AOR = 3.250, 95% CI = 1.69-6.28, p < 0.01). There was also a graded relationship between cumulative ACEs exposure and non-suicidal self-injury behaviors (AOR = 1.627, 95% CI = 1.02-2.60, p < 0.05). Odds for NSSI are higher among students with both experienced ACEs and identified as LGB (AOR = 2.821, 95% CI = 1.51-5.29, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Non-suicidal self-injury is associated with ACEs exposure and with those who identify as LGB, and the NSSI odds are greater when students identify as LGB and have experienced ACEs. More interventions to reduce non-suicidal self-injury should focus on LGB and ACEs and more attention needs to be paid to those who identify as LGB and have been exposed to ACEs.

AB Background: Little is known about the demographic and clinical features of the atypical subtype of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients in China. This study set out to investigate the prevalence of atypical depression in MDD patients in China, and identify its demographic and clinical features.
   Methods: The study was conducted in 13 major psychiatric hospitals or in the psychiatric units of general hospitals in China, and recruited a sample of 1172 patients diagnosed with MDD. The patients' demographic and clinical features and prescriptions of psychotropic drugs were collected using a standardized questionnaire designed for the study.
   Results: The prevalence of atypical depression was 15.3%. In multiple logistic regression analyses, compared to the non-atypical depression patients, the atypical depression patients were more likely to have depressive episodes with suicide ideation and attempts (OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.06, 2.10, P = 0.023), depressive episodes with psychotic features (OR = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.43, 3.22, P < 0.001), seasonal depressive episodes (OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.12, 2.78, P = 0.014), an earlier age of onset (OR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.96, 0.99, P = 0.001), and lifetime depressive episodes (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.13, P = 0.020).
   Limitations: The assessment of atypical features was not based on a validated rating scale. Conclusion: Our results indicate that atypical depression is common in Chinese patients with MDD. MDD with atypical features may be more severe and debilitating than patients with non-atypical features.

DE electroconvulsive therapy; inpatients; China; correlates
ID HEALTH-CARE; SCHIZOPHRENIA
AB Purpose: Little is known about the frequency of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) use in China. This study examined the frequency of ECT and its relationship with demographic and clinical characteristics in a large psychiatric institution in China.
   Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of all the 19,982 inpatients aged 18 to 59 years treated during the period of 8 years (2007-2013) in a tertiary psychiatric institution in Beijing. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from the electronic chart management system for discharged patients.
   Results: The frequency of ECT use was 57.7% in the whole sample, 68.4% in bipolar disorders, 66.3% in major depression, 55.2% in schizophrenia, and 28.6% in other psychiatric disorders. Patients who received ECT (ECT group) had shorter length of hospitalization compared with the non-ECT group. In multiple logistic regression analysis, ECT use was independently associated with age younger than 30 years; higher risk for suicide and aggression at time of admission; mood disorders; lower risk for falls; more treatment with antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and antidepressants; less health insurance coverage and major medical conditions; as well as non-local residency status. Compared with 2007 (35.5%), ECT use significantly increased in the period of 2008 (49.1%) to 2013 (61.9%). All these significant correlates combined explained 20% of the variance of ECT use (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: In a major psychiatric center in China, the use of ECT was much more common than the figures reported from most countries around the world. Reasons for this difference and variances in outcomes between settings with higher and lower ECT use should be studied.

ID ACUTE-POISONING DEATHS
AB The unnatural death investigation in China seems vague to the world. Shanghai is one of the largest city located in Yangtze River Delta in the East China. This study is committed to lift the veil of unnatural death investigation and describe the epitome of China's unnatural deaths. Based on the 7302 forensic report archives from 1990 to 1999 in Shanghai Public Security Bureau, statistics were carried out in 5 areas according to the manner of death. In 3502 accidental deaths; there was a rapid increase during the 1990s, and 71.6% were involved in traffic accidents whose major cause of death was head and neck injuries. The first 3 causes of death in nontraffic accidents (994) were head and neck injuries (42.8%), poisoning (11.8%), and drowning (9.0%). In 2456 homicides, sharp force injury (36.7%), blunt force injury (35.8%), and manual strangulation (12.9%) were the first 3 causes of death. In 563 suicides, drug/chemical intoxication (40.1%), hanging (23.4%), and injuries because of fall from height (11.4%) were the 3 leading causes of death, especially pesticides ingestion. The causes of natural deaths were diseases mainly in circulatory system (23.1%), central nervous system (12.8%), and respiratory system (6.4%). However, the cause of death remained undetermined in 500 victims. Childhood fatalities were different. The victims of accidents and homicides were nearly equal, and the main cause of homicide was manual strangulation. Besides, 1997 was the landmark year when drug abuse began to emerge in Shanghai.

   PROCEDURE; HIV; TRANSMISSION
AB Background: Although amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS) use is an important issue that has caused growing concerns in China as well as other countries, the knowledge of long-term patterns of ATS use in China is limited. This study explored long-term patterns of ATS use in Shanghai, China, and compared the differences by ATS use trajectory groups, seeking to identify risk factors that have implications for the development of targeted intervention programs.
   Methods: A total of 377 ATS users were recruited from the Compulsory Isolation Center for Drug Rehabilitation in Shanghai. Group-based trajectory modeling was applied to identify distinctive trajectories of ATS use over 8 years at the time of interviews conducted in 2012. The mean number of days using ATS per month over a year from years 2005 to 2012 was analyzed with a censored normal model.
   Results: Three distinctive groups were identified: high-use (19.1%), low-use (66.0%), and increasing-use (14.9%). Relative to the low-use group, the high-use and increasing-use groups were more likely to report having used opiate-type drugs and to have more craving experiences. Psychiatric symptoms following ATS use were frequently reported, with ATS users in the increasing-use and high-use groups more likely to report depression symptoms and suicide behaviors compared to the low-use group. The low-use and increasing-use groups reported more months in drug abuse treatment programs compared to the high-use group.
   Conclusions: Addressing ATS use should take into consideration patients' use-related psychiatric symptoms as well as other risk factors, particularly among those with persistent high-level ATS use trajectories. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Quality of life (QOL) is an important primary care outcome, but the QOL of older adults treated in primary care is understudied in China. This study examined QOL and its associated factors in older adults treated in Chinese primary care.
   Methods. A total of 752 older patients (65+ years) were consecutively recruited from 13 primary care centers in Wuhan, China, and interviewed with a standardized questionnaire, concerning socio-demographics, major medical conditions, loneliness, and depression. QOL and depression were measured with the Chinese six-item QOL questionnaire and the shortened Geriatric Depression Scale, respectively. Multiple linear regression was used to identify factors associated with poor QOL.
   Results. The average QOL score of primary care older adults was (20.7 +/- 2.5), significantly lower than that of the Chinese general population. Factors significantly associated with poor QOL of Chinese primary care older adults included engaging in manual labor before older adulthood (unstandardized coefficient [beta]: -0.702, P < 0.001), no living adult children (beta: -1.720, P = 0.001), physical inactivity (beta: -0.696, P < 0.001), having >= four major medical conditions (beta: -1.813, P < 0.001), hearing problem (beta: -1.004, P = 0.017), depression (beta: -1.153, P < 0.001), and loneliness (beta: -1.396, P < 0.001).
   Conclusions. Older adults treated in Chinese primary care have poorer QOL than the general population. Addressing psychosocial problems at Chinese primary care settings could be helpful in improving QOL in Chinese older adults.

AB Introduction: The prescribing of clozapine in China is common because of its outstanding efficacy and low price. There have been many cases of clozapine overdose in China. However, studies about the pharmacokinetics after overdose in the Chinese have rarely been reported. Population pharmacokinetics (PopPK) can analyze sparse data, and it is appropriate to compute clozapine pharmacokinetics after overdose.
   Methods: There were 47 clozapine overdose cases. We constructed a single-compartment first-order elimination PopPK model. We also considered some covariates that can influence the pharmacokinetics parameters.
   Results: 21 cases were included in the analysis. When the reported toxic dosage was 3 740 mg, the elimination rate constant of the population was 0.0258(h(-1)). The elimination half-life was 26.9 h. The coefficient of random variation was 17 %.
   Discussion: PopPK can solve the problem of sparse data after overdose. The area under the concentration-time curve after clozapine overdose exhibited the "two peaks phenomenon." The reported toxic dosage could impact clozapine elimination after overdose. Delayed absorption of clozapine is the best explanation for this finding.

AB Background: This study aimed to assess whether Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) had a significantly elevated prevalence of psychiatric disorders compared to urban males in China.
   Methods: 807 MSM were recruited using a respondent-driven sampling (RDS) method in urban area of northeast China. Psychiatric disorders were assessed employing the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI. Version 1.0) according to the criteria of the DSM-III-R.
   Results: Chinese MSM had a significantly elevated standardized prevalence ratios (SPR) for lifetime prevalence of any disorder (SPR = 2.8; 95%CI: 2.5-3.2), mood disorder (SPR = 3.0; 95%CI: 2.3-3.7), anxiety disorder (SPR = 5.5; 95%CI: 4.6-6.5), alcohol use disorder (SPR = 2.4, 95%CI: 2.0-2.8), and combination of disorders (SPR = 4.2; 95%CI: 3.4-5.1).
   Conclusions: Chinese MSM had significantly elevated prevalence and comorbidity of psychiatric disorders. RDS is a suitable sampling method for psychiatric epidemiological survey in MSM population.

DT Review
AB What did people from la Sarthe think of all the countries located between India and the extreme east of the Asian continent between 1860 and 1914? Is Asian culture really part of their lives?
   We can find the answers to these two questions by studying local newspapers.
   The country written about the most is China followed by Indonesia; with Japan and India far behind them.
   The image given of these countries is rather contradictory: on the one hand they were portrayed as the land of plenty with an abundance of wealth of all kinds, but on the other hand they were described as lands of death and catastrophe. They were also ruthless societies where torture and ritual suicides were said to be commonplace and where Hindu and Chinese women were physically and morally abused Chinese people are viewed with both despise and admiration. Japan was entering the Meiji era and was highly praised, mostly for her military victories over China and then Russia. Even if Asian objects were rarely to be seen in the home of Sarthe inhabitants, the Catholics from La Sarthe supported them vigorously.

AB Methods: Two hundred and fifty-five clinically stable schizophrenia outpatients were randomly selected in Hong Kong. Counterparts matched according to gender, age, age at onset, and length of illness were recruited in Beijing, China. All of the subjects at both sites were interviewed by the same investigator using standardized assessment instruments.
   Results: The combined Beijing-Hong Kong sample contained 251 male and 254 female patients. On univariate analysis more male patients were employed, they had a significantly higher monthly income, and took higher doses of antipsychotic drugs. No difference was found, however, in any of the QOL domains between the genders. On multivariate analysis being employed, taking a higher dose of antipsychotic drugs, having more severe extrapyramidal side-effects, and a higher score on the physical domain of QOL were independently associated with male gender.
   Conclusion: Female gender is independently associated with lower scores on the physical aspects of QOL, but there is no difference between the genders in the psychological, social and environmental aspects.

AB Background: As a major public health issue in China and worldwide, late-life depression is associated with physical limitations, greater functional impairment, increased utilization and cost of health care, and suicide. Like other chronic diseases in elders such as hypertension and diabetes, depression is a chronic disease that the new National Health Policy of China indicates should be managed in primary care settings. Collaborative care, linking primary and mental health specialty care, has been shown to be effective for the treatment of late-life depression in primary care settings in Western countries. The primary aim of this project is to implement a depression care management (DCM) intervention, and examine its effectiveness on the depressive symptoms of older patients in Chinese primary care settings.
   Methods/Design: The trial is a multi-site, primary clinic based randomized controlled trial design in Hangzhou, China. Sixteen primary care clinics will be enrolled in and randomly assigned to deliver either DCM or care as usual (CAU) (8 clinics each) to 320 patients (aged >= 60 years) with major depression (20/clinic; n = 160 in each treatment condition). In the DCM arm, primary care physicians (PCPs) will prescribe 16 weeks of antidepressant medication according to the treatment guideline protocol. Care managers monitor the progress of treatment and side effects, educate patients/family, and facilitate communication between providers; psychiatrists will provide weekly group psychiatric consultation and CM supervision. Patients in both DCM and CAU arms will be assessed by clinical research coordinators at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 months. Depressive symptoms, functional status, treatment stigma and clients' satisfaction will be used to assess patients' outcomes; and clinic practices, attitudes/knowledge, and satisfaction will be providers' outcomes.
   Discussion: This will be the first trial of the effectiveness of a collaborative care intervention aiming to the management of late-life depression in China primary care. If effective, its finding will have relevance to policy makers who wish to scale up DCM treatments for late-life depression in national wide primary care across China.

TI "Officials' Heartache" Depression, Bureaucracy, and Therapeutic
   Governance in China
SO CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ANTHROPOLOGY; MEDICINE
AB This article offers an anthropological approach to the study of therapeutic governance that emphasizes the role of experts in psychosocial programs by focusing on nonexpertise diagnosis and those subject to psy power. I examine the informal diagnosis of depression for Chinese government officials who have committed suicide and the experiences of those subject to such diagnosis. By pathologizing those officials as psychomedically depressed, Chinese media and the government implicitly cultivate an ideal subject for the state's autocratic bureaucracy, one who is rational, masterful, and psychologically healthy and who promotes social harmony and self-actualizes through public service. This biomedical approach turns bureaucratic politics into mental health management as it implements new forms of regulation and control through psychological care and permissive empathy. I demonstrate that while resonating with reductive Western therapeutic governance, which replaces substantial social, economic, and political progress with psychosocial practices, the Chinese mode of therapeutic governance diverges from its Western counterpart by de-emphasizing psy expertise and varying according to groups. It is a devolved exercise of power manifest in mass adherence to China's political project of social harmony and stigma, invoking informal diagnosis and drawing on both Western and local healing practices.

AB Background and Aims: No systematic study has focused on the characteristics and outcome of acute clozapine intoxication, although clozapine is the most widely used antipsychotic agent in China. The study reported herein examined the features of clozapine intoxication and the therapeutic effect of hemoperfusion (HP).
   Methods: In a retrospective chart review, the notes of 47 patients who attempted suicide by ingesting large amounts of clozapine and were treated at the only psychiatric emergency service in Beijing were analyzed. Of the 20 unconscious patients with plasma clozapine concentrations of more than 2000 ng/mL, 14 received a combination of HP and symptomatic treatment, whereas the other 6 and the remaining 27 patients received only symptomatic treatment. Patients' psychiatric conditions and both plasma clozapine and norclozapine concentrations were closely monitored and registered.
   Results: One patient died of pulmonary edema and subsequent heart failure, but the rest of the patients recovered without any sequelae. Patients who received HP regained consciousness significantly faster than their counterparts with the same level of clozapine plasma concentration (> 2000 ng/mL) who did not receive HP.
   Conclusions: A combination of HP and symptomatic treatment is the best therapeutic option when plasma clozapine concentration is high.

AB AimLittle is known about the long-term change in quality of life (QoL) among children in rural China. This study longitudinally examined changes and predictors of QoL among children in one rural county between 2009 and 2011.
   MethodsWe interviewed 816 children from seven to 16years of age in 2009 and 2011 using a range of QoL tools. Multivariate forward stepwise linear regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between follow-up QoL and socio-demographic, family environment and psychosocial factors.
   ResultsOverall QoL scores improved significantly from 71.114.6 to 72.8 +/- 16.3 (p=0.005). QoL was positively related to annual family income (=0.14, p<0.001) and baseline QoL (=0.21, p<0.001) and negatively related to older age (=-0.19, p<0.001), being female (=-0.08, p=0.011), being left in the care of family members by working parents (=-0.09, p=0.004), negative coping styles (=-0.10, p=0.005) and depression (=-0.11, p=0.006).
   ConclusionQuality of life significantly improved among children in rural China over a two-year period from 2009 to 2011. It was positively related to annual family income and baseline QoL and negatively related to older age, being female, being left in the care of family members by working parents, negative coping styles and depression.

AB Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) remained as 'no men's land' since the times of the British rule and was governed under the Frontier Crime Regulation (FCR), a draconian law based on collective responsibility of the tribesman. The non-integration of FATA has kept it backward and deprived it from the fruits of a civilized life on one hand while on the other hand; it remained open for the intruders from the outside world. For instance, the Taliban and terrorists found a safe haven in FATA after the American attack on Afghanistan because of the absence of direct administrative system there. Their cadres included not only the tribal madrassa students but also the Afghans, Arabs and Uzbeks who have not only hijacked FATA but also posed a potential threat to the rest of the country. In order to counter the menace of the Taliban and terrorists, Pakistan's army launched various operations and proclaimed successes but such claims were usually followed by a fresh wave of terrorist and suicide attacks in the country. For a permanent solution to the problem and for the security of the road project which is being constructed from Xinxiang in the north-west China to Gwadar port in Baluchistan under the newly signed CPEC agreement with China, integration and mainstreaming of FATA with KP is indispensable which automatically will help in closing the nurseries of such unwelcomed Taliban and terrorist outfits.

AB Objective: Despite a growing economy, unemployment remains a severe socio-economic problem in China. This study aimed to examine whether risk of self-rated poor health is related to employment status, and if any such relationship varies across sociodemographic groups.
   Study design: A cross-sectional analysis in a random sample survey conducted in three north-western Chinese cities in 2005.
   Methods: Subjects were 7796 adults aged 20-59 years who reported being either employed or unemployed but actively seeking work. Multinomial generalized estimating equation models were performed for ordered logistic regression to estimate the relative risk of self-reporting poor health on an ordinal five-point scale with regard to employment status.
   Results: Unemployment was associated with self-rated poor health (odds ratio 1.4, 95% confidence interval 1.25-1.55). This association was stronger for people who resided in Xining, were older, frequently consumed alcohol and possessed a strong social network. Likelihood of self-rated poor health increased with duration of unemployment up to 5 years, but then decreased.
   Conclusion: This study found that unemployment is detrimental to health, and that the relationship is modified by certain personality characteristics and social factors. An optimal strategy would incorporate such heterogeneity into Chinese programmes aimed at alleviating poor health among the unemployed.

AB Background. In Western countries, a history of major depression (MD) is associated with reports of received parenting that is low in warmth and caring and high in control and authoritarianism. Does a similar pattern exist in women in China?
   Method. Received parenting was assessed by a shortened version of the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) in two groups of Han Chinese women: 1970 clinically ascertained cases with recurrent MD and 2597 matched controls. MD was assessed at personal interview.
   Results. Factor analysis of the PBI revealed three factors for both mothers and fathers : warmth, protectiveness, and authoritarianism. Lower warmth and protectiveness and higher authoritarianism from both mother and father were significantly associated with risk for recurrent MD. Parental warmth was positively correlated with parental protectiveness and negatively correlated with parental authoritarianism. When examined together, paternal warmth was more strongly associated with lowered risk for MD than maternal warmth. Furthermore, paternal protectiveness was negatively and maternal protectiveness positively associated with risk for MD.
   Conclusions. Although the structure of received parenting is very similar in China and Western countries, the association with MD is not. High parental protectiveness is generally pathogenic in Western countries but protective in China, especially when received from the father. Our results suggest that cultural factors impact on patterns of parenting and their association with MD.

AB Objective
   This present study aims to estimate the structural validity, internal consistency reliability of the LSNS-6 and examine the associations between the LSNS-6 and suicidal outcomes among mainland Chinese older adults.
   Methods
   This validation study used a big representative sample (N = 2819) of older adults in Beijing from the Sample Survey on Aged Population in Urban/Rural China. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were applied to examine the factor structures of the Chinese version of LSNS-6. Internal consistency reliability of the LSNS-6 was examined by Cronbach's alpha coefficient and the corrected item-total correlation. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the associations between the LSNS-6 and late-life death wishes, suicidal ideation in mainland Chinese.
   Findings
   This present study showed good internal consistency and consistent factor structure of the LSNS-6 as well as its subscales. The present data demonstrated the LSNS-6 could be a useful tool for assessing social networks among older mainland Chinese. Interestingly, among the mainland Chinese, late-life suicidality was highly associated with the LSNS-6 family subscale, rather than the friends subscale.
   Conclusion
   The LSNS-6 could be a useful tool for assessing social networks among older mainland Chinese. In addition, suggestion is made to improve social networks, especially in family bonds and support, as a promising strategy in reducing late-life suicide risks in mainland China.

AB In recent years, speech-based depression detection has gained some initial interest in China, but the lack of publicly available Chinese depression corpus leads to the difficulty of comparing its features and results. According to psychological theory, the pervasive hopelessness and high risk of suicide in depressive patients suggested that the self might be abnormal among them. It highlights many of the advantages of self-related processing can contribute to corpus design. In this paper, a novel design idea of Chinese depression spoken speech corpus based on psychological self-related processing is outlined in this paper. To do so, we therefore introduce some novel methods such as different psychological self and psychological experimental paradigms. The data and collection method have been used in our study.

AB Objectives: To test the psychometric properties of the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ) among Chinese high school students. Methods: The reliability and validity of SIQ were analyzed with data of 505 high school students in Jinan, China. Results: The Cronbach's coefficient alpha of SIQ was above 0.95 and the Cronbach's coefficients alphas of SIQ when each item was deleted were relatively stable. The convergent validity analyses showed that there were statistically significant correlations between SIQ total scores and DSD total scores by gender. Exploratory factor analysis produced four factors of SIQ. Conclusion: The SIQ has a high level of reliability and validity and should be a reliable measure for suicide ideation in Chinese high school students.

AB Introduction: People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) have a higher rate of suicide compared to the general population. Psychosocial factors closely correlate with suicidal ideation and it is essential to explain the relationships between related factors among PLWHA.
   Objectives: To establish a structural equation model and examine direct and indirect effects of social support, coping strategy, depression symptoms and suicidal ideation among PLWHA.
   Patients and methods: A total of 504 PLWHA completed a set of questionnaires in the HIV clinic of Changsha Infectious Disease Hospital between December 2015 and January 2016.
   Results: Among the 504 respondents, a total of 27.2% (n=137) had experienced suicidal ideation in their lifetime. The goodness of fit for the two structural equations model was highly satisfactory. Depression symptoms had a significant direct impact on suicidal ideation (beta(1)=0.401, beta(2)=0.422), while problem-focused coping (beta=-0.067), emotion-focused coping (beta=-0.081) and social support (beta=-0.137) had a significant indirect effect with suicidal ideation via depression symptoms. Factors of total effects were ranked from large to small as follows: depression, social support, emotion-focused coping and problem-focused coping.
   Conclusion: Findings provide more understanding of direct and indirect associations between variables, suggesting that depression screening services, and the strengthening of social support and psychological care services among PLWHA can potentially prevent suicide.

ID MORTALITY; PATTERN; TRENDS; STATES
AB Objectives
   To analyze the gender difference in life expectancy in Chinese urban people and explore the age-specific and cause-specific contributions to the changing gender differences in life expectancy.
   Methods
   Data of life expectancy and mortality were obtained from "Annual statistics of public health in China." The gender difference was analyzed by decomposition method, including age-specific decomposition and cause-specific decomposition.
   Results
   Women lived much longer than men in Chinese urban areas, with remarkable gains in life expectancy since 2005, respectively. The gender difference reached a peak in 2007. Mortality difference between men and women in the 60-79 age group made the largest contributions to the gender gap in life expectancy in all 6 years. Among causes of death, cancers, circulatory diseases and respiratory diseases made the largest contributions to the gender gap. 33-38% of the gender gap were caused by cancers, among which lung cancer contributed 0.6 years of the overall gap. The contribution of cancers to the gender gap reduced over time, mostly influenced by the narrowing effect of liver cancer on gender gap. Traffic accidents and suicide were the external causes influencing the gender gap, contributing 10-16% of the overall difference.
   Conclusion
   Public health efforts to reduce excess mortalities for cancers, circulatory disease, respiratory diseases, and suicide among men in particular might further narrow the gender gap in life expectancy in Chinese cities.

AB Purpose: This study aimed to assess the cause and cause-specific risks of hospitalization for epilepsy patients in East China. Further analysis was performed for inpatient hospitalization days, hospital mortality and costs.
   Method: This study was performed on epilepsy patients admitted to our hospital including 21 community health centers in East China from January 2011 to April 2017. Case records including patient data, length of hospitalization, reasons for admission, hospital mortality, and the costs incurred for hospitalization of epilepsy patients were reviewed.
   Results: The three principal reasons for admission were: 1) cerebral vascular disease (CVD), 2) newly diagnosed epilepsy with unknown etiology; and 3) frequent seizures including status epilepticus. The median length of hospitalization was 13 days. The three major reasons regarding inpatient days were: 1) Parkinson's Disease (PD), 2) dementia, 3) trauma. The average hospital mortality was 14.819,00 (17/1148) with 1) lung infection (mainly pneumonia), 2) depression (deaths occurred by suicide) and 3) frequent seizures including status epilepticus being the three top reasons. The three major financial cost incurred for in-patients with epilepsy were: 1) PD, 2) arteriovenous malformation and 3) trauma.
   Conclusions: The most common hospitalized reasons for epilepsy patients were CVD, PD and dementia, which all were common diseases in the elderly. Consequently, the hospitalization days of these patients were longer and their financial burden was heavier. Epilepsy patients with comorbid depression should be closely monitored to prevent suicide from the onset of epilepsy.

AB While self-interest is depreciated in Confucian ethics the processes of family relations in traditional China are animated by the self-interested actions of family members. The paper outlines the Confucian ideology of filial piety which is commensurate with the governance of family life organized hierarchically and through the senior male's management of the joint-family's collective property. The structure, operations and principles of membership in traditional Chinese families are indicated, highlighting the tensions within them between consanguinity and conjugality and their material bases. The differential operation of self-interested actions by husbands and wives is also presented. A non-Confucian model of the relational-self is outlined in which both the collective context of Chinese families and the self-interested actions of individual family members within them is explicated.

AB Objective: This study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation among Chinese elderly aged >= 60 years.
   Methods: Two reviewers independently searched the potentially relevant studies through electronic database (PubMed-Medline, Embase, Wanfang Data, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and Chongqing VIP) using key terms 'suicid*', 'suicidal ideation' combined with 'aged', 'elderly' and 'old people'. All selected studies should meet the eligibility criteria in this study. Chi-square based Q test and 12 statistic assessed the heterogeneity. Forest plots were used to display results graphically. Potential publication bias was assessed by the funnel plot and Begg's test. Prevalence rate was meta-analysed.
   Results: In total, 11 studies were included with 11,526 subjects. The prevalence of suicidal ideation among Chinese elderly ranged from 2.2% to 21.5%. The pooled prevalence of all 11 studies was 11.5% (95% CI: 8.3%-14.8%). Subgroup analyses showed the prevalence for males was 11.0%, and for the females was 15.6%. In three subgroups for age, 60-69, 70-79 and >= 80, the prevalence was 9.1%, 12.1% and 18.9% respectively. A slightly higher prevalence in rural areas was calculated than in urban (14.7% vs. 11.8%). In mainland China, the prevalence was 12.6%. And in Taiwan and Hongkong, the pooled prevalence was 9.2%.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of suicidal ideation was relatively high among elderly in China, and it should attract enough attention. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective To determine the status of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and the association of multiple ACEs with both parental alcoholism and latter personal alcohol among Chinese medical students with a view of improving adolescent health and reducing alcohol abuse among them. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 2073 Chinese medical students completed a survey on ten categories of ACEs in Anhui province of China. The association of parental alcoholism with ACEs and personal alcohol abuse was assessed by logistic regression analyses. Results The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for each category of ACEs in the subjects whose parents (either fathers or mothers or both) had alcohol abuse was 2 to 14 times higher than that in those with parental alcoholism (P<0.05). Subjects with bi-parental alcoholism had the highest likelihood of ACEs. Compared with the subjects without ACEs, the risk of personal alcohol abuse was increased by 2-4-folds in the subjects with ACEs, irrespective of parental alcoholism (P<0.05). The total number of ACEs (ACE score) had a graded relationship to 4 categories of personal alcohol abuse with or without parental alcoholism. The prevalence of personal alcohol abuse among the subjects with parental alcoholism was higher, which was independent of ACE scores. Conclusion The prevalence of ACEs is generally serious in China. Efforts should be made to prevent and treat children with ACEs and subsequently to reduce alcohol abuse and later problems.

Among Southeast Asian boys and girls, smokers had elevated hopelessness in comparison to nonsmokers but among Central-Eastern European students, this relationship was true only for girls and there was no relationship for boys. Across the country samples, there was only association of smoking with loneliness among Southeast Asian girls and Central-Eastern European girls. While Southeast Asian girls who smoked scored higher on loneliness than nonsmokers, the opposite was true among Central-Eastern European girls, with smokers scoring lower on loneliness.

AB Background: This pilot study examined rates of major depression and suicidality and their associations with daily functioning in HIV infected (HIV+) and uninfected (HIV-) persons in China.
   Method: HIV+ participants (N=28) and demographically matched HIV- controls (N=23) completed the Chinese Composite International Diagnostic Interview to determine lifetime rates of major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicidality. Current mood and suicidal ideation were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-I. The impact of depression and HIV infection on daily functioning was measured by an Activity of Daily Living questionnaire.
   Results: Mean duration of known HIV+ status was 2 years. Almost 79% (n = 22) of HIV+ but just 4% (n = 1) of HIV- groups reported lifetime major depression. Of the 22 HIV+ individuals with lifetime MDD, only one had onset before learning of HIV status. The remainder developed MDD within 6 months after testing HIV positive. In those HIV+ subjects who met MDD criteria after HIV diagnosis, only two (9%) had received depression treatment, yet four (18%) had persisting active suicidal thoughts. Depression and HIV+ status independently predicted worse daily functioning.
   Limitations: Representativeness is limited in this small sample of convenience.
   Conclusion: This preliminary study presents evidence of high rates of major depression and suicidality in HIV-infected persons in China. Despite this, few had sought mental health assistance, suggesting a need to increase awareness of psychiatric comorbidity and access to mental health services. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Ms. X" was a 29-year-old married woman living with her teenage daughter and her parents-in-law in a farming village of 700 in central China while her husband worked in a coastal city. For many years, Ms. X had experienced her in-laws as contemptuous and resentful because she had not produced a son for the family. Increasingly, she had been struggling with feelings of powerlessness and worthlessness. She lamented that she would be "better off dead." She never openly expressed sadness, but she felt guilty for her thoughts. She stopped socializing. She blamed her husband for not standing up for her. The home was usually coldly silent; her daughter spent most of her time with friends. The village, including the local physician, was also talking about her strange changes. One day, Ms. X unexpectedly cried out loud at the store over some critical comments about her daughter being neglected. Feeling ashamed and angry, she drank some pesticide stored in her back-yard, yelling to her mother-in-law, "I will show you what happens when your family treats me so badly!" She was rushed to a regional hospital; the local physician's referral note said, "Domestic conflict and impulsive behavior problems."

AB Newly-diagnosed people living with HIV (NPLWH) are at high risk of suicide. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of suicidal behaviors among NPLWH, and explore the relationships between HIV-related stress, depression, anxiety, and social support and suicidal ideation after diagnosed with HIV infection. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a standard set of questionnaires during 1 March 2013 and 30 September 2014 in the HIV/AIDS Voluntary Counseling and Testing Clinic of the Changsha Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Among 557 NPLWH, 27.5% (n=153) had lifetime suicidal ideation, and 25.0% (n=139) had suicidal ideation after HIV diagnosis. The results of multiple regression analyses indicated that suicidal ideation after HIV diagnosis was associated with HIV-related clinical symptoms (OR=2.50), HIV-related stress (OR=3.64), the co-morbidity of positive depressive and anxiety symptoms (OR=3.30), and social support (OR=0.52). Overall, the prevalence of suicidal behaviors is high among NPLWH in Changsha emphasizing the need of suicidality monitoring and tracking, depression and anxiety screening, with an additional focus on stress management and social support enhancement in this vulnerable group.

AB Background: Injury and poisoning are a growing public health concern in China due to rapid economic growth, which has resulted in many cases with an injury-prone environment, such as overcrowded traffic, booming construction, and work-related stress. This study investigates the distribution and trends of deaths from injury and poisoning in Tianjin, China, by age, sex and urban/rural status, from 1999 to 2006.
   Methods: The study used data from the all-cause mortality surveillance system maintained by the Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Each death certificate recorded 53 variables. Cause of death was coded using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Standardized mortality rates and proportions of deaths were analyzed.
   Results: Traffic accidents, suicide, poisoning, drowning and fall were the leading causes of fatal injuries in Tianjin from 1999 to 2006. Injury mortality rates were high in males, in rural areas, and in the older age groups. Despite low injury mortality rates, injury accounted for close to 50% of all deaths amongst the 529 year age group. Traffic accident mortality rates increased, although not significantly so, during the period from 1999 to 2006.
   Conclusion: Injury prevention and control is a high public health priority in Tianjin. Our detailed table on the number of deaths by causes of fatal injuries and by age group provides important information to set prevention strategies in the nurseries, schools, workplace and seniors homes.

AB Objectives: To date, no studies have investigated the prescription patterns of mood stabilizers (MSs) in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. This study examined the frequency and sociodemographic and clinical correlates of MS prescription for outpatients with schizophrenia in Hong Kong (HK) and Beijing (BJ), China.
   Methods: Five hundred five clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia were randomly selected and interviewed in HK and BJ using standardized assessment instruments. Basic sociodemographic and clinical data and psychotropic drug prescriptions were collected at the time of a diagnostic interview.
   Results: Thirty-four (6.7%) of the patients were prescribed MSs in the whole sample, with 10.2% and 3.2% of the HK and BJ samples, respectively. Use of MSs was associated with a history of violence, number of admissions, and severity of extrapyramidal side effects. In multiple logistic regression analysis, number of admissions, study site, sex, and length of illness were significantly associated with MSs.
   Conclusions: Although the ethnic and clinical characteristics of the 2 samples were nearly identical, there was a wide variation in the frequency of MS prescriptions between HK and BJ.

AB Previous studies have indicated that self-injury is a maladaptive coping strategy with a high prevalence among left-behind adolescents in rural China. However, few studies have been conducted on the factors influencing left-behind adolescents' self-injury. The current study explored the roles of parental migration and parent-child attachment on self-injury. In total, 1110 adolescents were selected from four rural middle schools in Hunan province. Data on demographic and left-behind characteristics were collected and the Adolescent Self-Harm Scale and Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment were administered. The results indicated that compared with non-left-behind children and children with one parent migrating, there was a higher prevalence of self-injury among children with two parents migrating. Those with lower levels of parent-child attachment had a higher prevalence of self-injury than those with higher levels of parent-child attachment. There were also significant differences in terms of frequency, severity, and overall level of self-injurious behavior by patterns of parental migration and levels of parent-child attachment. Thus, parental migration, parent-child attachment, and the interaction between parental migration and mother-child attachment can predict adolescents' self-injury.

AB Postpartum depression has been described as a thief that steals motherhood. It can result in tragedy and sometimes in headline-gripping maternal suicide or infanticide. Because one of the highest priorities for nursing is to continually advance the knowledge the underlies nursing practice, it is essential that we understand what nurse researchers have done to advance the knowledge base of postpartum depression. This integrative review is a two-part series for MCN that summarizes 141 postpartum depression studies conducted by nurse researchers from around the globe, including United States, Australia, Canada, China (Hong Kong, Taiwan), Finland, Iceland Sweden, Turkey, and Malaysia. Specific areas of postpartum depression to which nurse researchers have devoted their primary attention include epidemiology, risk factors, transcultural perspectives, instrument development, screening, interventions and mother-infant interactions.

DE Xu Chi; modernization; modernism
AB Xu Chi was closely related. to modernism all his life. Although after 1949 he published a collection of his poetry War, Peace and Progress, these poems proved less popular and artistically less mature than the poems he composed at his youth. The poet, known as "politically progressive but artistically retrogressive," had a sudden change of his view of art since the end of the 1970s. In the journal of Foreign Literature Studies, Xu Chi wrote to call for the coming of modernism and modernization of Chinese literature. His masterpiece, Modernization and Modernism, deals with a series of forward theoretical issues concerning the tolerance and the possibility of modernism in China. He was thus not accepted by the mainstream discourse for his sharp ideas and was severely attacked during the movement of purging spiritual pollution. Later, he had to commit suicide to leave this world, where he bad been so long spiritually repressed and suffocated by an innate desperate gloominess.

AB In parts of rural China male-biased sex ratios at birth, combined with out-migration of women, have led to highly male-biased adult sex ratios, resulting in large numbers of men being unable to marry, in a culture where marriage and reproduction are an expectation. The aim of this study was to test the hypotheses that older unmarried men are more predisposed to depression, low self-esteem and aggression than both those who are married, and those who are younger and unmarried. Self-completion questionnaires were administered among men aged 20-40 in 48 villages in rural Guizhou province, southwestern China. Tools used included the Beck Depression Inventory, the Rosenberg's Self-esteemScale and the Bryant-Smith Aggression Questionnaire. Regression models assessed psychological wellbeing while adjusting for socio-demographic variables. Completed questionnaires were obtained from 957 never-married men, 535 married men aged 30-40, 394 partnered men and 382 unpartnered men aged 20-29. After adjusting for socio-demographic variables, never-married men were more predisposed to depression (p < 0.05), aggression (p < 0.01), low self-esteem (p < 0.05) and suicidal tendencies (p < 0.001). All the psychological measures deteriorated with age in never-married men. In contrast, married men remained stable on these dimensions with age. Never-married men are a psychologically highly vulnerable group in a society where marriage is an expectation. Since the highest birth sex-ratio cohorts have not yet reached reproductive age, the social tragedy of these men will last for at least another generation.
   This article is part of the themed issue 'Adult sex ratios and reproductive decisions: a critical re-examination of sex differences in human and animal societies'.

   SYMPTOMS
AB Background: Previous studies in developed countries have found that living in rapidly urbanizing areas is associated with higher risk of mental illness and that social capital had a protective effect on individual mental health. However, the literature is missing empirical studies of the relationship between urbanization, neighborhood social capital and mental health in rapidly urbanizing countries. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigated the effects of urbanization on depressive symptoms in China, with an emphasis on the mediating role of neighborhood social capital in the relationship between urbanization and individual-level depressive symptoms.
   Methods: Nationally representative survey data from the 2016 wave of China's Labor-force Dynamics Survey were used. A sample of 20,861 individuals was obtained from 401 neighborhoods in 158 prefecture-level divisions of 29 provinces. Depressive symptoms were measured using CES-D scores. Neighborhood social capital was assessed by three individual-level variables aggregated to the neighborhood level: perceptions of neighborly trust, the extent of neighborly reciprocity, and membership to neighborhood social groups. Multilevel linear regression and mediation analyses were used to estimate the statistical relationships.
   Results: The multilevel linear regression analyses found negative relationships between urbanization rate and CES-D score. The mediation analysis found that neighborhood-level social capital was an inconsistent mediator in the relationship between urbanization rate and CES-D score. Interaction terms between urbanization rate and two measures of neighborhood-level social capital were statistically significant, indicating that the protective effects of neighborly reciprocity and membership to neighborhood social groups on CES-D scores (negative relationships) were stronger in the relatively more urbanized areas.
   Conclusion: Urbanization supports mental health in the Chinese context, although it might undermine residents' mental health by reducing neighborhood social capital. The protective effect of neighborhood-level reciprocity and social group membership on mental health increased with urbanization.

AB Background
   The delivery of mental health services in rural China has been notably limited due to lack of qualified mental health professionals among other impeding factors. A village doctor-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention may be one way of improving accessibility. The purpose of this study was to explore the advantages and challenges of implementing this intervention, as delivered by trained village doctors, to treat late-life depression in rural China.
   Methods
   We conducted one focus group discussion with 10 village doctors, 10 individual interviews with each of the village doctors, and individual interviews with 19 older adults. The topic guides were advantages and challenges of the intervention program from the perspective of the village doctors and older adults. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded using NVivo 8, and analyzed using thematic analysis.
   Results
   The village doctors stressed the importance of role-playing and using instructive manuals in the training. Proper supervision was also a key component of the program. The benefits received from the intervention for the village doctors and the elders were positive such that both the doctors and the older adults were willing to implement/receive this intervention. Cultural and political factors (renqing and perceived policy consideration) facilitated the elders' access to mental health services. Challenges included a lack of real therapy (in contrast to role-playing) demonstrated in the training and lack of a step-by-step manual based on different types of problems encountered. Other impediments to the successful implementation of the intervention included the time constraints of village doctors and the presence of other people when conducting the intervention.
   Conclusions
   The present study has demonstrated that the intervention program is likely to be an acceptable geriatric depression intervention in rural China if several challenges are appropriately addressed.

AB Study Objectives To determine the prevalence of insomnia, its sociodemographic and clinical correlates, and treatment patterns in Chinese people.
   Design A total of 5,926 subjects were randomly selected in the urban and rural areas of Beijing and interviewed using standardized assessment tools. Basic sociodemographic and clinical data were also collected.
   Setting Urban and rural regions of Beijing municipality, China.
   Patients or Participants Adult residents older than 15 years.
   Interventions N/A.
   Measurements and Results The prevalence of at least one type of insomnia was 9.2%; the rates of difficulty initiating sleep (DIS), difficulty maintaining sleep (DMS), and early morning awakening (EMA) were 7.0%, 8.0%, and 4.9%, respectively. Increased age (age >44 and 24 years in the urban and rural samples, respectively), female sex, married, divorced, separated, or widowed marital status; having a major medical condition; and suffering from a psychiatric disorder were risk factors for all types of insomnia in both the urban and rural samples. A low level of education (primary school or illiteracy) was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of all types of insomnia in the urban sample. Current smokers and current drinkers were less likely to report any type of insomnia in the rural sample. Unemployment was associated with DMS in the urban sample, while it was associated with DIS and DMS in the rural sample. Only 5.4% of the participants with any type of insomnia reported their symptoms to medical practitioners. In contrast, nearly one-third of the subjects with insomnia reported taking benzodiazepines as sleep-enhancing drugs.
   Conclusions Nationwide epidemiologic surveys are needed to further explore the prevalence of insomnia in China. The low percentage of subjects treated for insomnia indicates a major public health problem that should be addressed. Strict controls on use of benzodiazepines are warranted.

The World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was used to assess major depressive episode (MDE) according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV criteria.
   Results. The lifetime prevalence and 1-year prevalence estimates of DSM-IV/CIDI MDE were 3.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.8-4.4%] and 1.8% (95% CI 1.2-2.4%,) respectively. No significant gender difference was found in these estimates. Respondents born in 1967 or later were at elevated lifetime risk compared with respondents born in earlier cohorts. The mean age of onset was 30.3 years. Among those reporting 1-year MDE, 15.7, 51.8, 25.3 and 6.4% reported mild, moderate, severe and very severe symptoms, respectively; 4.8, 2.6 and 3.2%, reported suicidal ideation, plans, and recent attempts in the same year respectively. Respondents with 1-year MDE reported a mean of 27.5 days Out of role owing to their depression it) the year before interview. Significant co-morbidity was found between MDE and other mental disorders [odds ratio (OR) 22.0] and chronic physical disorders (OR 3.2). Only 22.7%, of respondents with 1-year MDE Sought treatment.
   Conclusions. The low prevalence and insignificant gender difference, but not patterns of onset, course, co-morbidity and impairment, distinguish the epidemiological profile of MDE in metropolitan China from those in other countries.

TI Effort-reward Imbalance at Work, Parental Support, and Suicidal Ideation

   HEALTH; EXPERIENCES; INITIATION
AB Background: In contemporary China, most parents are dual-earner couples and there is only one child in the family. We aimed to examine the associations of parents' work stress with suicidal ideation among the corresponding adolescent. We further hypothesized that low parental support experienced by adolescents may mediate the associations.
   Methods: Cross-sectional data from school students and their working parents were used, with 907 families from Kunming City, China. Stress at work was measured by the effort-reward imbalance questionnaire. Perceived parental support was assessed by an item on parental empathy and their willingness to communicate with the adolescent. Suicidal ideation was considered positive if students reported thoughts about suicide every month or more frequently during the previous 6 months. Logistic regression was used to examine the associations.
   Results: We observed that parents' work stress was positively associated with low parental support, which was in turn associated with adolescent suicidal ideation. The odds ratio for parents' work stress and adolescent suicidal ideation was 2.91 (95% confidence interval: 1.53-5.53), and this association was markedly attenuated to 2.24 (95% confidence interval: 1.15-4.36) after additional adjustment for parental support. Notably, mothers' work stress levels exerted stronger effects on children's suicidal ideation than those of fathers.
   Conclusion: Parents' work stress (particularly mother's work stress) was strongly associated with adolescent's suicidal ideation, and the association was partially mediated by low parental support. These results need to be replicated and extended in prospective investigations within and beyond China, in order to explore potential causal pathways as a basis of preventive action.

AB Background: Beijing municipal government launched a Free Drug Program (FDP) in 2013 to reduce the financial burden of schizophrenia patients. Objectives: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a FDP designed for schizophrenia patients in Beijing, China. Methods: In all, 2007 schizophrenia patients enrolled in an FDP (FDP group) and 2001 schizophrenia patients who were not enrolled (non-FDP group) were randomly selected for a cross-sectional survey in August 2015. The study sought to develop a cost-effectiveness model to assess the FDP from the societal perspective in Beijing, China. Scenario analyses explored the potential strategies to further improve the cost-effectiveness of the FDP. Results: The FDP group was associated with lower socioeconomic status and more advanced disease than the non-FDP group (unemployment rate: 48.8% vs 37.3%, p < .001; disability rate: 91.2% vs 64.1%, p < .001; overall comorbidity rate: 34.9% vs 28.8%, p < .001). The two groups exhibited similar disease severity and quality of life. However, the FDP group was associated with significantly lower direct medical costs (coefficient -.342, p = .003) and indirect costs (coefficient -.473, p < .001) than the non-FDP group. The base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per gained quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for the FDP group relative to the non-FDP group was 1.480 times of 2015 China's gross domestic product per capita. Home drug delivery and long-lasting injection treatment could reduce the ICER for the FDP group relative to the non-FDP group by 57.8% and 29.8%, respectively. Conclusion: The FDP was attractive to schizophrenia patients with lower socioeconomic status and more advanced disease. The cost-effectiveness of the FDP was acceptable and could be further improved by home drug delivery and long-lasting injection treatment.

AB We aimed to assess suicidality risk amongst people who had had anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis. All people with a definitive diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis in West China Hospital between June 2012 and February 2017 were identified and their notes were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic and clinical characteristics and risk predictors for suicidality were summarized; those with suicidality were compared to those without. 17 of 133 people (13%) presented with suicidality symptoms: 7 (5%) with suicidal ideation; 8 (6%) who attempted suicide; and 2 (1.5%) who completed suicide. Median age was 27 (16-78) years, most were female [13 (76%)]. Compared with those with no suicidality, psychiatric symptoms as the initial symptoms were more frequent in those who reported suicidality (p = 0.039); insomnia, aggression, mania, depression and delusion were also more common (p < 0.05). The use of antidepressants (p < 0.001) and recurrence of encephalitis (p = 0.020) were higher in people with suicidality than in those without. Other characteristics were not significantly different in those who had suicidality and those who did not. Suicidality is a common and potentially lethal risk for people with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Those presenting with psychiatric symptoms as the initial symptom and with insomnia, aggression, mania, depression and delusion should be carefully screened for suicidality. Closely monitoring people who have been treated with antidepressants is necessary.

AB This long-term study in Sri Lanka explored the complexities behind self-inflicted pesticide poisonings by 166 Sri Lankans. Using or threatening to use pesticides for self-harm has become a response to stressful events and a powerful message towards a specific individual, or to the outside world in general, conveying misgiving, anger, sadness, hopelessness, frustration, or simply a way to manipulate a situation to one's own advantage. The effects of alcohol misuse are especially important in understanding self-harm at the community level in terms of the impact they have on the domestic environment. Also, issues around "love affairs," arranged marriages and domestic physical, sexual or psychological abuse in the domestic environment are referred to by many self-harmers or their relatives as a reason for ingesting poison. Clearly, easy access to lethal pesticides by impulsive individuals often living under economically or psychosocially stressful conditions, combined with insufficient treatment facilities and limited outreach programs, can be a deadly blend. A strategy aimed at reducing the availability of the most toxic pesticides and improving case management should be implemented, as it is likely to reduce death from pesticides although unlikely to impact on the number of episodes. Support to families plagued by domestic violence and male alcohol misuse is essential to improve the quality of life for the most vulnerable and to reduce the number of self-harm episodes in the long-term.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to validate the Chinese version of the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDIE) as a suicidality screening tool in Chinese people with epilepsy (PWE).
   Methods: A consecutive cohort of PWE was recruited from West China Hospital and 363 Hospital. Each patient received a psychiatric evaluation with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the Chinese version of the NDDIE (C-NDDIE). Demographic and clinical characteristics were collected. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted. The best possible cutoff was identified with the highest Youden index. Specificity, sensitivity, positive, and negative predictive values were calculated.
   Results: Among a total of 355 participants, 41 (11.5%) had a moderate to high suicide risk according to the Suicidality Module (SM) of the MINI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that item 4 ("I'd be better off dead") of the NDDIE had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.930 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.884-0.977), a sensitivity of 80.5%, a specificity of 94.9%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 68.0%, a negative predictive value (NPV) of 97.7%, and the largest Youden index of 0.754 for a cutoff score of >2.
   Conclusion: Item 4 of the NDDIE is a valuable tool for screening suicidality in Chinese PWE. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background A comprehensive evaluation of the burden of injury is an important foundation for selecting and formulating strategies of injury prevention. We present results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 of non-fatal and fatal outcomes of injury at the national and subnational level, and the changes in burden for key causes of injury over time in China.
   Methods Using the methods and results from GBD 2017, we describe the burden of total injury and the key causes of injury based on the rates of incidence, cause-specific mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in China estimated using DisMod-MR 2.1. We additionally evaluated these results at the provincial level for the 34 subnational locations of China in 2017, measured the change of injury burden from 1990 to 2017, and compared age-standardised DALYs due to injuries at the provincial level against the expected rates based on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite measure of development of income per capita, years of education, and total fertility rate.
   Findings In 2017, in China, there were 77.1 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 72.5-81.6) new cases of injury severe enough to warrant health care and 733 517 deaths (681 254-767 006) due to injuries. Injuries accounted for 7.0% (95% UI 6. 6-7. 2) of total deaths and 10.0% (9.5-10.5) of all-cause DALYs in China. In 2017, there was a three-times variation in age-standardised injury DALY rates between provinces of China, with the lowest value in Macao and the highest in Yunnan. Between 1990 and 2017, the age-standardised incidence rate of all injuries increased by 50.6% (95% UI 46.6-54.6) in China, whereas the age-standardised mortality and DALY rates decreased by 44.3% (41.1-48.9) and 48.1% (44.6-51.8), respectively. Between 1990 and 2017, all provinces of China experienced a substantial decline in DALY rates from all injuries ranging from 16.3% (3 .1-28. 6) in Shanghai and 60.4% (53.7-66.1) in Jiangxi. Age-standardised DALY rates for drowning; injuries from fire, heat and hot substances; adverse effects of medical treatments; animal contact; environmental heat and cold exposure; self-harm; and executions and police conflict each declined by more than 60% between 1990 and 2017.
   Interpretation Between 1990 and 2017, China experienced a decrease in the age-standardised DALY and mortality rates due to injury, despite an increase in the age-standardised incidence rate. These trends occurred in all provinces. The divergent trends in terms of incidence and mortality indicate that with rapid sociodemographic improvements, the case fatality of injuries has declined, which could be attributed to an improving health-care system but also to a decreasing severity of injuries over this time period.

AB Purpose. China has a high prevalence of smoking, but the characteristics of social smoking in Chinese college students have not been investigated. We examined the pattern of social smoking and explored the association between social smoking and personal cessation efforts and mental health factors among Chinese male college students.
   Design. Study design was a cross-sectional survey.
   Setting. P. R. China was the setting of the study.
   Subjects. Participants were a random sample of 1327 male college students.
   Measures. All participants completed a self-administered questionnaire that examined their smoking behaviors and a group of specific mental health factors (loneliness, self-harm, suicide, depression, and anxiety).
   Analysis. Analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics, (2) analysis, and multivariate logistic regression.
   Results. Of a total of 207 current smokers, 102 (49.3%) were identified as social smokers. Compared with nonsmokers, social smokers had increased risks for depression (odds ratio, 1.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.65). Among daily smokers, social smokers were less likely to have an intention to quit smoking than nonsocial smokers (odds ratio, .08; 95% confidence interval, .01-.57).
   Conclusion. This study reveals unique psychologic characteristics related to social smoking. College students are a particular group of interest because unhealthy behaviors initiated during adolescence may continue through adulthood. Our findings provide evidence for future tobacco control intervention among this population.

AB Background: There has been a dramatic increase in internal migrant workers in China over recent decades, and there is a recent concern of poor mental health particularly amongst younger or "new generation" migrants who were born in 1980 or later.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Guangzhou city between May and July in 2012. Mental wellbeing was measured using the World Health Organization Five-item Well-Being Index Scale and the 36 Item Short Form Health Survey mental health scale. Linear and logistic regression models were used to investigate the differences between migrant workers and their urban counterparts and between younger and older migrants.
   Results: Migrant workers (n = 914) showed a small but significant advantage in mental wellbeing compared to their urban counterparts (n = 814). There was some evidence for age modification effect (p for interaction = 0.055-0.095); better mental wellbeing in migrants than urbanites were mainly seen in the older compared to the younger group, and the difference attenuated somewhat after controlling for income satisfaction. Older migrants showed better mental health than younger migrants. Factors that were independently associated with poor mental health in migrants included being male, longer working hours, and income dissatisfaction, whilst older age, factory job, high income, and increased use of social support resources were associated with reduced risk.
   Conclusions: Efforts to promote mental health amongst migrant workers may be usefully targeted on younger migrants and include measures aimed to improve working conditions, strengthen the social support network, and address age-specific needs.

AB The influence of marriage on the long-term outcomes of schizophrenia is largely unknown. This study was to examine the impact of marriage on the 14-year outcomes and identify the correlates of marriage among persons with schizophrenia in rural community. All study participants with schizophrenia (n = 510) were identified in 1994 in an epidemiological investigation of 123,572 people aged 15 years and older and followed up in 2004 and 2008 in Xinjin County, Chengdu, China. The Patients Follow-up Schedule (PFS) was used in 2004 and 2008. The rate of follow-up in 2008 was 95.9%. Unmarried individuals in 1994 had higher rates of homelessness and suicide, and lower rate of survival in 2004 and 2008 than those married. In 14-year follow-up, unmarried individuals were more likely to be male, to have higher level of psychiatric symptoms and lower rate of full remission of illness, and to report lower level of work functioning, as well as with fewer family members and caregiver, and lower family economic status. The predictors of being married in 2008 included being married in 1994, shorter duration of illness, being female, and lower level of education. Being married is predictive of more favorable 14-year outcomes of persons with schizophrenia in the rural community. Given that marriage can be instrumental for enhancing family-based support and caregiving, as well as improving the community tenure of persons with schizophrenia, it is important to develop programs to enhance opportunity for persons with schizophrenia to get and stay married.

AB Objective: Rapid economic growth and social change in China in recent years have been accompanied by increased rates of mental health problems among the country's adolescents. This study examined rates of mental health service use and associated factors among Chinese adolescents. Methods: A survey of 1,891 high school students in grades ten through 12 from three high schools in Shantou, China, was conducted in 2009. Measures of mental health status, service need (perceived and objective), mental health service use, and informal help seeking were obtained. Results: Twenty-five percent of the adolescents reported a perceived need for the services of a mental health professional. Only 5% of the sample had used school-based mental health services and only 4% had used non school-based services. Three factors emerged as independently associated with adolescent use of both school-based and non school-based services: perceiving a need for mental health services, having turned to a teacher for help, and having turned to a relative other than one's parents for help. Male gender, being a 12th grader, and being an only child were independently associated with use of school-based services only, whereas a suicide attempt and having turned to one's parents for help were independently associated with use of non school-based services. Conclusions: Findings indicate a high level of unmet need for mental health services among Chinese adolescents and highlight the need to improve the mental health knowledge of parents, teachers, and other significant individuals in adolescents' lives to facilitate adolescents' access to the mental health services that they need.

AB Few studies have investigated the associations between ambient air pollution and mental disorders (MDs), especially in developing countries. We conducted a time-series study to explore the associations between six criteria air pollutants and daily hospital admissions for MDs in Shanghai, China, from 2013 to 2015. The MDs data were derived from the Shanghai Health Insurance System. We used over-dispersed, generalized additive models to estimate the associations after controlling for time trend, weather conditions, day of the week, and holidays. In addition, we evaluated the effect of modification by age, sex, and season. A total of 39,143 cases of hospital admissions for MDs were identified during the study period. A 10-mu g/m(3) increase in 2-day, moving-average concentration of inhalable particulate matter, sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide was significantly associated with increments of 1.27% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.28%, 2.26%], 6.88% (95% CI, 2.75%, 11.00%), and 0.16% (95% CI: 0.02%, 0.30%) in daily hospital admissions for MDs, respectively. We observed positive but insignificant associations of fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ozone. The estimated association of SO2 was relatively robust to the adjustment of simultaneous exposure to other pollutants. We found generally stronger associations of air pollutants with MDs in warm seasons than in cool seasons. There were no significant differences in the associations between different sex and age groups. This study suggested that short-term exposure to air pollution, especially to sulfur dioxide, was associated with increased risk of hospital admissions for MDs in Shanghai, China.

AB Mortality in many parts of the world has a seasonal pattern, with a marked excess of deaths during winter. To date, however, there is very little published evidence on the nature of this wintertime excess in low- and middle-income countries. In this study, we aimed to quantify the extent of the death peak in winter and to assess effect modification on excess winter death (EWD) by individual characteristics and cause of deaths in China. We used a Cosinor model to examine seasonal patterns for specific causes of deaths and a case-only analysis of deaths in winter compared with other seasons to assess effect modification by individual characteristics. A total of 398,529 deaths were investigated between January 2010 and December 2013 in Zhejiang Province, China. Deaths peaked in winter, and overall mortality was around 30% higher in winter than in summer. Although diseases of the respiratory and circulatory systems were highly seasonal, surprisingly we observed that deaths from mental and behavioral disorders exhibited greater fluctuation. Males, the elderly and illiterate individuals suffered high EWD. EWDs were also particularly common in emergency rooms, at home, on the way to hospitals, and in nursing homes/family wards. This study highlighted the high EWD in some previously unreported groups, indicating new information to facilitate the targeting of necessary preventive measures to those at greatest risk in order to mitigate wintertime death burdens.

AB Objective To assess the prevalence and characteristics of unintentional injuries among 5 to 9 grades students for both urban and migrant children groups, and probe the major socio-demographic and psychosocial risk factors.
   Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted from May to June in 2013 with 2266 urban and 1770 migrant children among 5 to 9 grades from 13 schools in Yinzhou, Southeast China. Unintentional injuries and psychosocial factors were measured via self-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were employed in data analysis.
   Results The annual prevalence of unintentional injury in the past year was 38%. Compared with urban children, migrant children reported lower prevalence of sprains/fractures (15.5 vs. 18.7%), but higher in animal bites (15.7 vs. 9.6%), burns (20.7 vs. 16%), nonfatal drowning (6 vs. 2.7%), and unintentional injury (40.9 vs. 35.7%). Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that male, young age, attending migrant children school, scoring high in emotional symptoms, conduct problems or hyperactivity, with suicide ideation, and experiencing verbal maltreatment were associated with unintentional injury incidence in the past 12 months.
   Conclusions The annual prevalence of unintentional injury among 5 to 9 grades schoolchildren in Yinzhou was high. Child unintentional injuries were associated with multi-level psychosocial factors. Although the direct correlation between migrant status and unintentional injuries was unobserved, migration could have an indirect relationship with injury. The findings could inform some implications for prevention strategies in urban area.

   in China
SO LEPROSY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID DIAGNOSIS; AREA
AB Objectives: To understand the situation of child leprosy patients in the low prevalence situation pertaining in China.
   Method: A retrospective survey by questionnaire was carried out in all 32 provinces of mainland of China in 2011. All data concerning child cases detected from January 2005 to December 2009 were collected by professional health workers working at county level.
   Results: During the study, only 165 questionnaires were collected for analysis. Among 165 child cases, 96 were boys, 69 were girls with an average age of 11.7 years old. 80% of child cases were members of families with other leprosy affected people. 145 (85%) child cases took their MDT secretly (nobody outside the family knew the child suffered from leprosy), and three (1.8%) children died, one each from dapsone syndrome, suicide and severe pneumonia. During follow-up, four child cases developed new disability increasing the Grade 2 disability rate to 13.3% (22/165). At end of the study, 8.2% of children had discontinued their study at school, and 7.5% had moved to a remote place to do casual work, while 6.3% stayed at home. 31% of child patients thought that leprosy caused a negative impact on their daily life. Two children had a hostile attitude toward society due to the stigma caused by leprosy.
   Conclusions: In both high and low endemic areas, as long as there is an infectious source of leprosy in the family, there is a possibility for children to develop leprosy. Contact surveys should be done to detect early disease, especially when there are children in the household.

AB Purpose: Although adolescents' mental health problems and self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) have been a serious public health concern worldwide, descriptions of risk factors for SITBs often fail to take migration into account. There are roughly 35.8 million migrant children in China who, with their parents, moved from original rural residence to urban areas. Little is known about migrant children's mental health status and levels of SITBs. This study aims to explore the mental health status and SITBs of migrant children living in eastern coastal China in comparison to their urban counterparts.
   Methods: This study was a cross-sectional survey conducted in 13 schools. Mental health status and SITBs were measured via self-administered questionnaires. Associations between strengths and difficulties questionnaire outcomes and SITBs were investigated.
   Results: Data from 4217 students (1858 migrant children and 2359 urban children) were collected. After controlling for gender, age, family economic status, parent's education level and parents' marital status, migrant children scored higher for total difficulties (p < 0.001) and externalizing problems (p < 0.001) than did urban children and reported higher rates of suicidal ideation (p < 0.05) and self-injurious behaviors (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Migrant children, compared with urban children, have a higher risk of externalizing problems and SITBs. It is urgent to address these problems by providing both mental health services at migrant-exclusive schools and equitable education and social welfare to migrant children.

AB Effective health care models to scale up combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) are needed in rural southwestern China. We aimed to evaluate the ART treatment outcomes and their associations with patients' demographic characteristics and pre-treatment clinical features in a scaled-up provincial ART program serving eight heavily HIV-affected prefectures in Yunnan Province. We abstracted information from a computerized database for adults initiating ART between July 2007 and September 2008. Survival functions of mortality and treatment failure were calculated by age group, gender, transmission mode, and baseline CD4 count. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were conducted to find independent associations of various demographic and baseline clinical features with outcome variables. Of the 1967 patients in the mortality analysis, there were 110 deaths, of which 16 were coded as accidents or suicides. Adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) associated with mortality were greater for patients with baseline CD4 counts <100 cells/mu l vs. patients with CD4 counts 200 cells/mu l, for male vs. female, for single vs. married, and for those acquired HIV through injection drug use (IDU) vs. other modes of transmission. Successful treatment was 81.3% at six months after treatment started. Immunologic treatment failure was associated with baseline CD4 counts but not with demographic characteristics. Overall loss to follow-up rate was 2.1%. Collaboration between clinics and community networks are distinctive features of Yunnan's model for scaling up ART across a diverse, poor, and rural population. This study finds that the strategy can succeed even if 40% of the patients have a history of IDU.

AB Purpose - This chapter explores the protest self-immolations since 2009 of over 100 Tibetans in China. It investigates whether these events have ecological as well as social causes and may thus be relevant to the emerging discipline of 'EcoHealth'.
   Method - Targeted literature review and reflective analysis, presented as a narrative.
   Findings - Chinese citizens identifying as Tibetan have experienced substantial ethnically based discrimination for over 60 years, manifest as attempted cultural destruction, pervasive disrespect and linguistic suppression. Tibetans, now a minority in much of their former territory, have witnessed and at times been forced to participate in ecological destruction, much of it led by Chinese settlers, endorsed by occupying authorities. Tibetans have for decades protested against the Chinese they regard as invaders and occupiers, but Tibetan acts of protest self-immolation are a recent response. Academic analysis has been scarce, particularly by Chinese scholars. Until now, EcoHealth practitioners have also denied any relevance, as if in a waltz led by the Chinese government.
   Practical and social implications - Attempts to identify rational causes for Tibetan self-immolation conflict with themes of liberation and fairness central to Communist Chinese ideology. Most Chinese analysis of Tibetan self-immolation is superficial, nationalistic and unsympathetic. Also disturbing is the reaction to these issues shown by the International Association of Ecology and Health. It is suggested that this illustrates a failure to translate rhetoric of 'speaking truth to power' to reality, a retreat from idealism common to many social movements.
   Originality and value - Increasing human demand on a limited biosphere necessitates a deepened understanding of eco-social factors. Practitioners concerned with sustaining our civilisation are encouraged to explore the integrated dimensions revealed by this case study.

AB To examine patterns of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cause-specific deaths, risk factors, and the effect of interactions on mortality, we conducted a retrospective cohort study in Zhejiang, China, from 2006 to 2013. All data were downloaded from the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) Prevention and Control Information System. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess predictors of cause-specific death. The relative excess risk due to interaction and ratio of hazard ratios (RHR) were calculated for correlations between HAART, late diagnosis, and age. A total of 13,812 HIV/AIDS patients were enrolled with 31,553 person-years (PY) of follow-up. The leading causes of death of HIV patients were accidental death and suicide (21.5%), and the leading cause of death for those with AIDS was AIDS-defining disease (76.4%). Both additive and multiplicative scale correlations were found between receiving HAART and late diagnosis, with RERI of 5.624 (95% CI: 1.766-9.482) and RHR of 2.024 (95% CI: 1.167-2.882). The effects of HAART on AIDS-related mortalities were affected by late diagnosis. Early detection of HIV infection and increased uptake of HAART are important for greater benefits in terms of lives saved.

AB Little is known about suicidality in Chinese men who has sex with men (MSM) infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This study investigated suicidality and its clinical correlates in Chinese MSM with HIV infection. Suicidality, demographic and clinical characteristics were assessed in 410 MSM with HIV infection consecutively recruited from a public HIV clinic in China. The prevalence of suicidality was 10.7% in Chinese HIV-infected MSM. Compared with those without suicidality, MSM with suicidality were more likely to be younger, unmarried and unemployed, and have more frequent insomnia, lower CD4 lymphocyte counts, and higher GAD-7 and CSE-D total scores. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that suicidality was independently associated with unemployment (p = 0.03, OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1-0.9), age (p < 0.01, OR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.8-0.9), CD4 lymphocyte counts (p = 0.02, OR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.9-1.0), and the GAD-7 total score (p < 0.001, OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.1-1.5). Suicidality is common in Chinese MSM with HIV infection. There is an urgent need to develop comprehensive suicide prevention program and mental health services for this population.

AB Background: Many self-harmers do not present in hospitals due to the self-harm. It is still unclear on the differences between medically treated and untreated self-harm in China. This study described the differences of the two groups of self-harmers using the largest psychological aid hotline data.
   Methods: The present observational study recruited 3,403 hotline callers who reported episodes of self-harm before the call. In routine assessment, information about the most recent episode of self-harm was collected, including the method of self-harm, the wish to die, goals of the self-harm, and any medical treatment (irrespective of psychological services) in the hospital. The callers were divided into two groups: those who received hospital-based medical treatment due to the most recent self-harm (treated self-harm callers) and those who did not (untreated self-harm callers).
   Results: In the most recent episode of self-harm, 65% (n = 2,217) of callers were untreated and 55% (1,226/2,217) of the untreated self-harm callers reported a wish to die. A total of 67% of the callers reported that their main goal of self-harm was to relieve suffering. The most common self-harm methods were using instruments (knife or rope) and overdosing on medicines. Compared with treated self-harm callers, the untreated self-harm callers were less likely to have a wish to die (OR = 0.57), engage in self-harm outside the home (OR = 0.71 and 0.78), and attribute their self-harm to romantic relationship problems (OR = 0.76); however, they were more likely to use instruments, to jump, or to choose other methods (OR = 3.73, 3.83, and 7.71, respectively).
   Conclusions: Among hotline callers, many episodes of self-harm did not receive medical treatment, despite over half reporting a wish to die. Characteristics of self-harm behaviors were different between treated and untreated self-harm callers. Our findings suggest that more strategies should improve access to hospital-based medical treatment and coverage for post-intervention for self-harmers who are not presented in hospitals.

   HOSTILITY
AB Purpose: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in adolescent has drawn increasing attention because it is associated with subsequent depression, drug abuse, anxiety disorders, and suicide. In the present study, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in a school-based sample of Chinese adolescents and to explore the association between aggression and NSSI.
   Methods: This study was part of a nationwide study on aggression among adolescents in urban areas of China. A sample of 2907 school students including 1436 boys and 1471 girls were randomly selected in Guangdong Province, with their age ranging from 10 to 18 years old. NSSI, aggression, emotional management and other factors were measured by self-administrated questionnaire. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the association between aggression and NSSI, after adjustment for participants' emotional management, and other potential confounding variables.
   Results: The one year self-reported prevalence of NSSI was 33.6%. Of them, 21.7% engaged in 'minor NSSI', 11.9% in 'moderate/severe NSSI'. 96.9% of self-injuries engaged in one to five different types of NSSI in the past year. Hostility, verbal and indirect aggression was significantly associated with self-reported NSSI after adjusting for other potential factors both in 'minor NSSI' and 'moderate/severe NSSI'. Hostility, verbal and indirect aggression was significantly associated with greater risk of 'minor NSSI' and 'moderate/severe NSSI' in those who had poor emotional management ability.
   Conclusion: These findings highlight a high prevalence of NSSI and indicate the importance of hostility, verbal and indirect aggression as potentially risk factor for NSSI among Chinese adolescents.

AB Background: College students with suicidal ideation (SI) are at high risk of suicide. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are important risk factors for suicidal behavior. Most research in this area has been restricted to 10 conventional ACEs and suggests negative long-term developmental effects from other common childhood adversities such as peer victimization, peer isolation/rejection, exposure to community violence, and low socioeconomic status.
   Objective: To test the unique and cumulative associations of 14 different ACEs with SI among young adults.
   Participants and Setting: Participants were 989 college students from two universities in China's provincial-leveled Hui Autonomous Region.
   Methods: Associations between ACEs and SI were analyzed by logistic regression. A Chi-square trend test was used to examine the association between cumulative ACEs and SI.
   Results: The rates of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts among the cohort were 11.9%, 3.7%, and 1.6%, respectively; 43.9% had experienced at least one ACE. The strongest predictor of SI in adulthood was peer isolation/rejection, followed by emotional neglect, then low socioeconomic status. There was a cumulative effect of ACEs and SI, whereby the greater the number of ACEs, the greater the likelihood of SI,
   Conclusion: Peer isolation/rejection, emotional neglect, and low socioeconomic status were associated with increased risk of SI in adulthood. Two (peer isolation/rejection and low socioeconomic status) of the three factors that emerged from the analysis are not typically included in ACEs research. There was a cumulative effect of 14 kinds of ACEs on SI among young adults. Early recognition of risk factors is therefore important.

AB IMPORTANCE Human trafficking and exploitation of children have profound health consequences. To our knowledge, this study represents the largest survey on the health of child and adolescent survivors of human trafficking.
   OBJECTIVE To describe experiences of abuse and exploitation, mental health outcomes, and suicidal behavior among children and adolescents in posttrafficking services. We also examine how exposures to violence, exploitation, and abuse affect the mental health and suicidal behavior of trafficked children.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A survey was conducted with 387 children and adolescents aged 10 to 17 years in posttrafficking services in Cambodia, Thailand, or Vietnam, which along with Laos, Myanmar, and Yunnan Province, China, compose the Greater Melong Subregion. Participants were interviewed within 2 weeks of entering services from October 2011 through May 2013.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, suicidal ideation, self-injury, and suicide attempts. RESULTS Among the 387 children and adolescent study participants, most (82%) were female. Twelve percent had tried to harm or kill themselves in the month before the interview. Fifty-six percent screened positive for depression, 33% for an anxiety disorder, and 26% for posttraumatic stress disorder. Abuse at home was reported by 20%. Physical violence while trafficked was reported by 41% of boys and 19% of girls. Twenty-three percent of girls and 1 boy reported sexual violence. Mental health symptoms were strongly associated with recent self-harm and suicide attempts. Severe physical violence was associated with depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.55; 95% CI, 1.64-7.71), anxiety (AOR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.12-4.05), and suicidal ideation (AOR, 3.68; 95% CI, 1.77-7.67). Sexual violence while trafficked was associated with depression (AOR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.22-4.23) and suicidal ideation (AOR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.80-6.54).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Children and adolescents in posttrafficking care showed high symptom levels of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder, which are strongly associated with self-harm or suicidal behaviors. Mental health screening and reintegration risk assessments are critical components of posttrafficking services, especially in planning for family reunification and other social integration options.

AB Background: Previous studies have found that suicide rates are likely to increase after the occurrence of earthquakes. Most existing studies that examined the relationship between PTSD and suicidally focus on risk factors. It remains unclear whether protective factors, such as post-traumatic growth (PTG) and social support, play a role in this relationship.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of PTG and social support in the association between PTSD and suicidally, using data from a cross-sectional study conducted in China.
   Methods: 1,369 participants were recruited from two study sites that were severely affected by the Wenchuan earthquake. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between PTSD, PTG, social support, and suicidally.
   Results: The results indicate that the prevalence of suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and suicide attempts among adult survivors were 9.06%, 2.97% and 3.31%, respectively, even after 8 years following the Wenchuan earthquake. Furthermore, the findings show that PTSD was significantly associated with suicidally (OR = 1.96; 95% CI = 1.53, 2.52). Additionally, individuals reporting lower levels of social support and the acquisition of PTSD (OR = 5.99; 95% CI = 1.66, 21.56) were significantly related to suicidally. Moreover, compared to individuals who reported no presence of PTSD and high PTG, those who lived with PTSD and lower levels of PTG (OR = 2.33; 95%CI = 1.00, 5.42) were more likely to report suicidally.
   Limitations: The cross-sectional design of this study limits our ability to determine causal relationships. Effects of other related factors, such as cultural and life events, were not examined in this study.
   Conclusions: Suicidally is a long-term health issue among survivors of the Wenchuan earthquake. PTG and social support play important roles on the association between PTSD and suicidally and are important contributing factors to understanding this relationship. These results contribute new knowledge of suicidal risk for a number of years after an earthquake and have implications for further mental health promotion following earthquakes.

Data were collected from 475 emerging adults in their early career stages in China The results showed that both career success criteria clarity and career decision-making self-efficacy mediated the relationship between career exploration and affective well-being. Career decision-making self-efficacy exhibited a stronger mediating effect on this relationship than career success criteria clarity. These findings reveal some important mechanisms underlying the role of career exploration in generating affective well-being and contribute to the social cognitive career theory model. Implications both for researchers and practitioners are discussed.

AB PurposeTo determine the frequency and socio-demographic/clinical correlates of insomnia in patients with chronic hepatitis B, hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver failure, and cirrhosis.
   Design and MethodsUp to 120 patients with HBV-related diseases and 40 matched healthy controls were recruited. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, early, middle, and late insomnia were measured.
   FindingsThe frequency of 1 type of insomnia was 64.2% in patients and 35.0% in controls; frequencies of early, middle, and late insomnia in patients were 39.2%, 42.5%, and 48.3%, respectively, compared to 22.5%, 10.0%, and 25.0% in controls. Urban residency was independently associated with less insomnia of any type, accounting for 22.6% of the variance.
   Practice ImplicationsA considerable proportion of patients with HBV-related diseases suffer from insomnia that warrants more attention in clinical practice.

AB Very little information is available regarding psychiatry in North Korea, which is based on the legacy of Soviet psychiatry. This paper reviews the characteristits of psychiatry in former socialist countries and discusses its implications for North Korean psychiatry Under socialism, psychiatric disorders were attributed primarily to neurophysiologic or neurobiological origins. Psychosocial or psychodynainic etiology was denied or distorted in line with the political ideology of the Communist Party Psychiatry was primarily conterned with psychotic disorders, and this diagnostic category was sometimes applied based on political considerations. Neurotic disorders were ignored by psychiatry or were regarded as the remnants of capitalism. Several neurotic disorders characterized by high levels of somatization were considered to be neurological or physical in nature. The majority of "mental patients" were institutionalized for a long periods in large-scale psychiatric hospitals. Treatment of psychiatric disorders depended largely on a few influenced by the

AB Aims: To date there have been no studies investigating prescription patterns of benzodiazepine agents (BZDs) in Chinese outpatients with schizophrenia. This study examined the frequency and socio-demographic and clinical correlates of BZD prescription in Hong Kong (HK) and Beijing (BJ), China.
   Methods: Five hundred and five clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia were randomly selected and interviewed in HK and BJ using standardized assessment instruments. Basic socio-demographic and clinical data and psychotropic drug prescriptions were collected at the time of a diagnostic interview.
   Results: One-hundred and fifty one (29.9%) patients were prescribed BZDs in the whole sample; 25.1 % and 34.8% of the HK and BJ samples, respectively. Use of BZDs was associated with sex, employment status, history of suicide, less use of clozapine, more frequent use of typical antipsychotics (APs), higher doses of APs, severity of positive symptoms, extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) and insomnia. In multiple logistic regression analysis, severity of depressive symptoms, study site, sex, employment status, less use of clozapine and history of suicide remained significantly associated with BZDs.
   Conclusion: Although the ethnic and clinical characteristics of the two samples were nearly identical, there was a wide variation in the frequency of BZD prescriptions between HK and BJ suggesting that socio-cultural and economic factors as well as traditions of psychiatric training and practice all played a role in determining the use of BZDs. Prescription of BZDs in either site was not in line with current recommendation.

TI Your petitioners are in mortal terror': The violent world of Chinese

SO JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Sixty-three thousand Chinese indentured labourers helped resuscitate South Africa's ailing gold mining industry in the aftermath of the South African War of 1899-1902. This short-lived experiment - the first men arrived in 1904 and by 1910 all surviving labourers had been repatriated to China - has attracted the attention of various historians who have focused on the labour shortage that led to the employment of Chinese workers and the political consequences of importation for both Britain and South Africa. However, very little is known about the lives of the Chinese men who actually worked in the Witwatersrand gold mines. Much like African migrant labourers, Chinese mineworkers had to contend with oppressive labour practices, restrictive living conditions and various manifestations of violence. Africans and Chinese were routinely assaulted by white supervisors, and labour protests were often brutally suppressed by state police and mine security forces; but much of the violence took place within the labouring populations themselves. While African miners were 'notorious' for engaging in group confrontations known as 'faction fights', murder and suicide were the predominant forms of violence in the Chinese compounds. Powerful syndicates, directed by the Chinese police force, controlled gambling operations on all the mines that employed Chinese labourers. These syndicates mercilessly pursued debt defaulters, many of who were murdered or committed suicide to escape persecution. Vendettas were common and the violence spilled over into the surrounding countryside when deserters from the mines raided nearby farms and shops. Scholars have noted the ways in which management practices, economic fluctuations and changing political conditions generated violence on the South African gold mines. This article argues that migrant cultures also shaped the nature of mine violence.

AB Aims: This study aimed to examine the associations between stressful life events, insomnia, and suicidality including suicidal ideation (SI), suicide plan (SP) and suicide attempt (SA) in a large sample of Chinese adolescents.
   Methods: A total of 11,831 adolescents who participated in the baseline survey of Shandong Adolescent Behavior and Health Cohort were included for the analysis. Participants were sampled from 8 middle/high schools in 3 counties of Shandong, China. Participants completed a structured behavior and health questionnaire, including suicidality, demographics, depression/anxiety, stressful life events (SLEs), and insomnia in November-December 2015. A series of logistic regression models and mediation analyses were performed to examine the associations between SLEs, insomnia and suicidality.
   Results: The prevalence rates of overall suicidality, SI, SP and SA in the last year were 13.1%, 12.5%, 3.3%, and 1.5%, respectively. SLEs were significantly associated with overall suicidality, SI, and SP. Insomnia was an independent risk factor of suicidality and a mediator of the association between SLEs and suicidality. The total effect of SLEs on overall suicidality was 0.597 (95%CI: 0.534-0.661), including 0.457 (95%CI: 0.391-0.523) for direct effect and 0.158 (95%CI: 0.138-0.178) for indirect effect. Insomnia also mediated the associations of SLEs with SI, SP and SA, respectively.
   Limitations: Causal relationship could not be concluded because this study is cross-sectional.
   Conclusions: Stressful life events and insomnia are directly associated with suicidality in adolescents. The association between SLEs and suicidality is partially mediated by insomnia.

AB Objective: Female injection drug users who are also sex workers (FSW-IDUs) occupy a pivotal population in HIV transmission, whereas their mental health problems are largely overlooked. We aimed to investigate prevalence and associated socio-ecological factors of depression, suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts among FSW-IDUs in China.
   Methods: Using snowball sampling methods, 200 FSW-IDUs were recruited from communities in Liuzhou, China. Anonymous face-to-face interviews were administered by trained doctors.
   Results: Thirty-nine percent of participants had severe or extremely severe depression, 44.7% had suicidal ideation in the last six months and 26.8% had suicidal attempts in the last six months. After adjusting for background variables, self-stigma was significantly associated with severe or extremely severe depression (OR = 1.18,95% CI: 1.07-1.31). Self-stigma (OR = 1.08,95% CI: 1.01-1.15), depression (OR = 1.11,95% CI: 1.05-1.18), having completely broken up with family (OR = 2.60, 95% CI: 1.35-5.02) and having been abused by clients or gatekeepers (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.32-3.50) were associated with suicidal ideation in the last six months, while self-stigma (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.10-1.16), depression (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.04-1.20) and being abused by clients or gatekeepers (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.09-4.24) were associated with suicidal attempt in the last six months. In mediation analyses, the associations between self-stigma and the two suicidal outcomes were fully mediated by depression.
   Conclusions: There are unmet mental health needs of FSW-IDUs. Screening of mental health problems should be integrated into current HIV-related services. Psychological intervention efforts should include components such as self-stigma, family support and abuse. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: School bullying is an emerging problem in China. The present study aimed to measure the prevalence of bullying behaviors among Chinese adolescents and to examine the association of bullying and being bullied with family factors, school factors and indicators of psychosocial adjustment.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 8,342 middle school students were surveyed in four cities in the Guangdong Province. Self-reports on bullying involvement and information regarding family factors, school factors and psychosocial adjustment were collected. Descriptive statistics and multi-level logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate the prevalence of school bullying and explore potentially influential factors.
   Results: Of the total sample, 20.83% (1,738) reported being involved in bullying behaviors. Of the respondents, 18.99% were victims of bullying, 8.60% were bullies and 6.74% both bullied themselves and bullied others. Factors that were determined to be correlated with bullying behaviors included grade, parental caring, consideration of suicide, running away from home, time spent online per day and being in a physical fight.
   Conclusion: Bullying was determined to be prevalent among Chinese adolescents. Given the concurrent psychosocial adjustment, family and school factors associated with bullying, as well as the potential long-term negative outcomes for these youth, this issue merits serious attention, both for future research and preventive intervention.

AB It has been eight years since the Wenchuan earthquake. We don't know how the lives of those affected by the disaster may remain blighted by its effects, or how many remain thus affected. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship of disaster exposure, PTSD, depression and suicidal behaviors, using data from a cross-sectional survey conducted in earthquake-affected areas of China. 1369 participants were recruited from two different sites that were severely affected by the Wenchuan earthquake. The survey assessed suicidality (suicidal ideation, plans and attempts) and other mental health issues. Probable PTSD was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) Chinese edition was used to assess depressive symptoms. The results showed that 11.2% of participants felt that their lives had not yet recovered from the effects of the Wenchuan earthquake, even after eight years. Suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts were reported by 9.1%, 2.9%, and 3.3%, respectively, of the respondents. PTSD, depression, and perceived non -recovery were highly associated with suicidality. These results indicate that suicidality can be a long-term mental health sequela of disaster. Targeted, long-term suicide prevention programs for adult survivors should be further developed.

TI Being Bullied and Psychosocial Adjustment Among Middle School Students

ID BULLYING BEHAVIORS; PREVALENCE; VIOLENCE; GENDER; YOUTH; RISK
AB METHODS: A total of 9015 students in middle schools in Beijing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, and Urumqi completed the Chinese version of the GSHS. Researchers analyzed the results from 2 questions about the frequency and form of being bullied and 11 questions about psychosocial adjustment. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used in the analysis.
   RESULTS: About 25.7% of middle school students reported being bullied on 1 or more of the past 30 days. Rates of being bullied were similar for males and females, but the forms of being bullied were different. Being bullied was significantly lower in Beijing than in the other 3 cities. There were significant psychosocial differences between students who had been bullied and students who had not been bullied. Students who had been involved in a physical fight, often felt lonely, or had considered suicide in the past 30 days were more likely to report being bullied. Students who thought that other students in their school were often kind and helpful, who felt parents often understood their troubles, or who were taught in school how to handle stress were less likely to report being bullied.
   Conclusions: Being bullied is not uncommon in Chinese middle schools. Chinese schools typically place great emphasis on academic achievement, perhaps at the expense of the social climate of the school. Results indicated schools could implement changes to the school climate to reduce the likelihood of students' being bullied.

TI Differences in mortality and suicidal behaviour between treated and

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY

DT Article
ID UNTREATED PSYCHOSIS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRY; 10-YEAR COHORT; COMMUNITY;
   DURATION; RISK; PREVALENCE; TRIALS
AB Background
   Many people with schizophrenia remain untreated in the community. Long-term mortality and suicidal behaviour among never-treated individuals with schizophrenia in the community are unknown.
   Aims
   To explore 10-year mortality and suicidal behaviour among never-treated individuals with schizophrenia.
   Method
   We used data from a 10-year prospective follow-up study (1994-2004) among people with schizophrenia in Xinjin County, Chengdu, China.
   Results
   The mortality rate for never-treated individuals with schizophrenia was 2761 per 100000 person-years during follow-up. There were no significant differences of rates of suicide and all-cause mortality between never-treated and treated individuals. The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) for never-treated people was 10.4 (95% CI 7.2-15.2) and for treated individuals 6.5 (95% CI 5.2-8.5). Compared with treated people, never-treated individuals were more likely to be older, poorer, have a longer duration of illness, marked symptoms and fewer family members.
   Conclusions
   The never-treated individuals have similar mortality to and a higher proportion of marked symptoms than treated people, which may reflect the poor outcome of the individuals without treatment. The higher rates of mortality, homelessness and never being treated among people with schizophrenia in low- and middle-income nations might challenge presumed wisdom about schizophrenia outcomes in these countries.

AB Recent longitudinal data suggest a close association between depression and lifestyle. Little work to date has estimated the prevalence of depression in the nursing workforce in China, nor considered what lifestyle factors might be correlated with it-a gap filled by the present study. The study's web-based cross-sectional survey solicited data from qualified nurses aged between 21 and 65 registered with the Hong Kong Nursing Council. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 was used to measure 850 nurses for depression, anxiety and symptoms of stress; a generalized linear regression model examined associations between lifestyle factors and depression. Mean depression symptom scores show a downward linear trend for male and female participants. Gender and age, however, did not emerge as significant predictors of depression. Three lifestyles factors (sleep, entertainment and hobbies) showed a significant association with depression. Nurses should make therapeutic lifestyle changes to improve their work-life balance and safeguard their functioning at work and personal well-being.

TI Public Mood and Consumption Choices: Evidence from Sales of Sony Cameras
   on Taobao
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Previous researchers have tried to predict social and economic phenomena with indicators of public mood, which were extracted from online data. This method has been proved to be feasible in many areas such as financial markets, economic operations and even national suicide numbers. However, few previous researches have examined the relationship between public mood and consumption choices at society level. The present study paid attention to the "Diaoyu Island" event, and extracted Chinese public mood data toward Japan from Sina MicroBlog (the biggest social media in China), which demonstrated a significant cross-correlation between the public mood variable and sales of Sony cameras on Taobao (the biggest Chinese e-business company). Afterwards, several candidate predictors of sales were examined and finally three significant stepwise regression models were obtained. Results of models estimation showed that significance (F-statistics), R-square and predictive accuracy (MAPE) all improved due to inclusion of public mood variable. These results indicate that public mood is significantly associated with consumption choices and may be of value in sales forecasting for particular products.

AB In China, with one-child family being the predominant form, the psychosocial study of only child is particularly important. In a random sample of 4502 Chinese adolescents in Hong Kong, controlling the underlying socio-demographic variables like gender, age, level of study, economic well-being, family structure, and migrant status, we found very distinctive differences in psycho-behavioural characteristics between only children and children with siblings. In compliance to previous research, relative to their counterparts with siblings, the only children had similar level of mental health and high satisfaction in academic performance. In many areas not covered in the literature, the only children outperformed. They had health advantages in three areas, overall health, physical health, and activity limitation. In life satisfaction, they also had higher levels in overall life and most specific life domains. They had less participation in violent behaviour like fighting, self-injury, and suicide, and higher involvement in making donation to benevolent organizations.

AB YouTube videos offer a rare opportunity to gain an insight into the sequestered world of neojihadism. This study examines and compares the lines of the visual narrative associated with two Asian insurgencies that help to form the global Islamic social movement: the insurgency in Chechnya (North Caucasus) and that in Xinjiang (China). The purpose of the article is to describe the narratives used by the Islamic militants addressing the conflict and to identify similarities and differences in the use of visual rhetorical techniques by neojihadist groups to propagate their worldview. The study of the visual narratives promoted in the videos will help to provide a better understanding of the impact of the neojihadist narratives on the creation of collective identities. Our findings suggest that these narratives have similar features, which can be identified in a set of sub-narratives. Within the common pattern, however, significant differences can be found, especially in the interpretation of the videos by the audiences.

AB 'Utopia or dystopia - to where will the "digital revolution" lead human society?' is a question that remains unanswered. Negotiating between two opposing standpoints, this article, looking at a form of trans-border activism originally driven by suicides and protests of Foxconn workers who produce iPhones, iPads, and many other i-gadgets for the world's consumers, is an attempt to explore a politics of online and offline resistance against anti-digital capitalism. Based in Hong Kong (HK), SACOM is a leftist student group which works to support Chinese workers in campaigning against corporate power and generating trans-border networks through media exposure, international activism, and localized organizing. Combining online and offline activism, SACOM strives to extend the reach of their worker-consumer campaign to the worldwide audience by transgressing dominance of capital and political control of the Chinese state. The most intriguing question to us is could this proactive activism be possible and, if so, how could it act at the grid of China's transformation and incorporation into global capitalism?

AB Introduction: That schizophrenia has a better course and outcome in developing countries has become an axiom in international psychiatry. This is based primarily on a series of cross-national studies by the World Health Organization (WHO). However, increasing evidence from other research indicates a far more complex picture. Methods: Literature review and tabulation of data from 23 longitudinal studies of schizophrenia outcomes in 11 low- and middle-income countries. Results: We reviewed the evidence about the following domains: clinical outcomes and patterns of course, disability and social outcomes (marital and occupational status, in particular), and untreated samples and duration of untreated psychosis. Outcomes varied across the studies and the evidence suggests a need to reexamine the conclusions of the WHO studies. Additionally, assessments of outcomes should take excess mortality and suicide into account. Conclusions: It is time to reexamine presumed wisdom about schizophrenia outcomes in low- and middle-income countries.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a significant behavioral problem among adolescents all over the world. This study examined the longitudinal relationship between peer victimization and NSSI, as well as the buffering effects of self-compassion and family cohesion on this relationship. Data were collected at two time points from 525 secondary school students (226 girls; Mage = 12.97, SD = 1.02) in China. Results showed that peer victimization (marginally) significantly predicted NSSI over time even after controlling for Wave 1 NSSI. This association was weakened under the condition of high levels of self-compassion. Findings of this study emphasize the buffering effect of self-compassion in the relationship between peer victimization and NSSI, and are informative for prevention and intervention of this behavioral problem.

AB The aim of this study was to identify anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation disparities among Chinese Americans and how immigration-related factors affected the outcomes. We tried to explain the differences as a function of the Chinese culture. Data were derived from the National Latino and Asian American Study, the first national epidemiological survey of these populations in the United States. We used only the Chinese sample (N = 600) and focused on depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and suicidal ideation. The United States-born Chinese and those Chinese who immigrated to the United States at 18 years or younger were at higher risk for lifetime depressive or anxiety disorders or suicidal ideation than were their China-born counterparts who arrived in the country at or after 18 years of age. For Chinese Americans, immigration-related factors were associated with depression and anxiety disorders and suicidal ideation. The higher prevalence of these disorders might be attributed to the psychological strains experienced by those who are at higher risk of cultural conflicts.

ID ONE-CHILD FAMILY; PERSONALITY-TRAITS; SIBLING CHILDREN
AB Aims: To determine whether only children differ in terms of morbidity, nutritional status, risk behaviours, and utilisation of health services from children with siblings, in China.
   Methods: A cross sectional survey was carried out using self completion questionnaires, anthropometry, and haemoglobin measurement in middle schools (predominant age 12-16 years) in three distinct socioeconomic areas of Zhejiang province, eastern China.
   Results: Data were obtained for 4197 participants. No significant differences were found between only children and those with siblings for some key indicators: underweight 19% v 18% suicide ideation 14% v 14%, and ever smoking 17% v 15%. Only children were more likely to be overweight (4.8% v 1.5%), and to have attended a doctor (71% v 63%) or dentist (17% v 10%) in the past year. Sibling children are significantly more likely to be anaemic (42% v 32%) and to admit to depression (41% v 21 %) or anxiety (45% v 37%). However, after adjusting for area, sex, and parental education levels only two differences remained: sibling children are more likely to be bullied (OR 1.5, 1.1-2.0; p = 0.006) and are less likely to confide in parents (OR 0.6, 0.3-0.8, p = 0.009). There were no significant differences in the key parameters between first and second born children.
   Conclusions: We found no detrimental effects of being an only child using the indicators measured.. Being an only child may confer some benefits, particularly in terms of socialisation.

AB Recently, researchers have shed light on the link between personality and meaning in life. The present study was designed to explore this association by investigating the relationships between the Dark Triad personality traits (i.e.,Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and narcissism), meaning in life, and patience. Notably,patience is a construct derived from the Buddhist six perfections theory. It is composed of (1) the patience to endure suffering willingly (PES), (2) the patience to not retaliate against harm (PNH), and (3) the patience to thoroughly scrutinize phenomena (PSP). We also examined the potentail mediating role of patience in the links between the Dark Triad personality traits and meaning in life. Participants in the present study were 434 company employees in China. A battery of questionnaires measuring the Dark Triad personality traits, patience, and meaning in life was admininstered to the participants. The results showed that the Dark Triad personality traits were negatively correlated with patience and meaning in life. Results also indicated that patience fully mediated the relationships between the Dark Triad personality traits and meaning in life. Taken as a whole, the findings suggest that the lack of meaning in life among the working population in China might be associated with inadequate patience. The present study reveals the possible mechanism governing the associations between the Dark Triad personality traits and meaning in life and contributes to the process of bridging Buddhism and psychology.

AB Background: To provide an overview of phantom limb pain (PLP) in China. This includes the prevalence of PLP and possible risk factors.
   Methods: In a retrospective study, telephone interviews were conducted with 391 amputation patients who underwent extremity amputations at a tertiary hospital in China.
   Results: PLP was found in 29% of the amputees. Pre-amputation pain (OR = 10.4, P = 0.002) and postoperative analgesia (OR = 4.9, P = 0.008) were identified as high-risk factors for PLP. 82.1% of PLP patients experienced pre-amputation pain. The average pain intensity of PLP was 5.1 +/- 2.2, with 31.9% having severe intensity. The effects of PLP on the quality of the PLP patients were as follows: 7.8% of the patients had to limit their daily life and 29.0% of the patients had to limit their social activities. 17.3 and 25.7% of patients experienced depression and sleeping disorder respectively, while 18.9% had loss of interest and even 16.1% of PLP patients had attempted suicide. No effective treatments were found in 78.9% of these patients.
   Conclusions: PLP has markedly affected the lives of patients. Pre-amputation pain and postoperative epidural analgesia might be risk factors for the phantom limb pain after amputation. Prevention of pre-amputation pain and sudden post-amputation deafferentation should be recommended to the amputees.

AB Background: Chinese patients with depression have limited access to mental health specialty care because of myriad barriers at different levels. Recently, there has been increased interest in targeting primary care settings for managing depression, because most depressed individuals visit their primary care physicians (PCPs) during the course of their depressive episodes. The present study examined PCPs' perceived barriers on the management of depression.
   Methods: A total of 295 PCPs completed a 36-item survey by mail. The survey questions included demographics, years in primary care, mental health training experience, and perceived barriers regarding the management of depression in their clinical and current practices. Chi-square and t-test analyses were used to compare the difference of demographic variables between the two districts. For the correlates of PCPs' clinical practices and their perceived barriers, logistic regression models were used.
   Results: At the practice level, lack of access to mental health specialists (37.8%) was the most commonly reported barrier and at patients' level, reluctance toward diagnosis of depression (34.6%) was the high barrier. Results have indicated that most PCPs (69.2%) felt comfortable discussing psychological issues with patients. Mental health training is significantly related to PCPs' clinical practice. When PCPs perceived moderate to high-level practice level barriers, prescription and referral were mostly preferred.
   Conclusion: PCPs in China perceived some barriers in the management of depression, but they were open to modifications and enhancement of their skills related to managing depression.

AB Background Peer victimization has been recognized as a common social problem affecting children and adolescents in all parts of the world. This study aims to examine the prevalence of different types of peer victimization and to evaluate the associations between peer victimization and health correlates.
   Methods Using a large population sample of 18,341 adolescents aged 15-17 years from 6 cities in China, this study estimated the prevalence of different types of peer victimization, addictive behaviors, and health-related variables with self-administrated questionnaires. A three-phase logistical regression analysis was conducted to investigate the associations between peer victimization and addictive behaviors as well as health-related factors among adolescents.
   Results A total of 42.9% of the surveyed Chinese adolescents have been bullied by peers, with boys reporting higher rate on overt victimization (36.9%) and girls on relational forms (33.9%). School environment (34.7%) was the most frequent scene of peer violence, followed by neighborhood, family, and internet. Addictive behaviors except substance abuse were found related to higher possibility of peer victimization (aOR 1.21-1.73, P<0.001). Peer victimization was significantly associated with more depressive symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, and suicide ideation and deliberate self-harm (aOR 1.05-2.27, P<0.001), and poorer self-esteem and health-related quality of life (aOR 0.95-0.97, P<0.001).
   Conclusion Possible explanations of the associations found in this study are discussed and implications for future services are raised.

AB Strong evidence indicates that central serotoninergic system dysfunction is associated with suicidal behavior. The relationship between the serotonin transporter protein (5-HTT) gene of psychotic patients in Han Chinese with suicidal behavior was studied since the 5-HTT plays an important role in serotoninergic transmission. Two hundred and seventy-two psychotic inpatients with suicidal behavior (suicide group) and 275 psychotic inpatients without suicidal behavior (patient control group) were recruited from six mental health facilities in Shanghai, China. Another 628 healthy adults (healthy control group) without suicidal behavior and mental disorder history were enrolled from Shanghai, China. All subjects were Han Chinese. The genotypes and the alleles of 5-HTT genes of the three groups were examined by PCR amplification. Neither the intron 2 variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism and 5-HTTLPR (5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic region), nor the haplotype frequencies of this gene have significant differences between the suicide group and the two control groups. However, there was a significant difference in 5-HTTLPR polymorphism between inpatients with a first episode of suicidal behavior and those with recurrent suicidal behavior. Except for the possible heterogeneity between inpatients with a first episode of suicidal behavior and those with more than one, the 5-HTT gene was unlikely to be associated with suicidal behavior of psychotic patient in Han Chinese.

AB Objectives Patients with advanced disease sometimes express a wish to hasten death (WTHD). In 2012, we published a systematic review and meta-ethnography of qualitative studies examining the experience and meaning of this phenomenon. Since then, new studies eligible for inclusion have been reported, including in Europe, a region not previously featured, and specifically in countries with different legal frameworks for euthanasia and assisted suicide. The aim of the present study was to update our previous review by including new research and to conduct a new analysis of available data on this topic.
   Setting Eligible studies originated from Australia, Canada, China, Germany, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Thailand and USA.
   Participants Studies of patients with life-threatening conditions that had expressed the WTHD.
   Design The search strategy combined subject terms with free-text searching of PubMed MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL and PsycInfo. The qualitative synthesis followed the methodology described by Noblit and Hare, using the 'adding to and revising the original' model for updating a meta-ethnography, proposed by France et al. Quality assessment was done using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist.
   Results 14 studies involving 255 participants with life-threatening illnesses were identified. Five themes emerged from the analysis: suffering (overarching theme), reasons for and meanings and functions of the WTHD and the experience of a timeline towards dying and death. In the context of advanced disease, the WTHD emerges as a reaction to physical, psychological, social and existential suffering, all of which impacts on the patient's sense of self, of dignity and meaning in life.
   Conclusions The WTHD can hold different meanings for each individual-serving functions other than to communicate a genuine wish to die. Understanding the reasons for, and meanings and functions of, the WTHD is crucial for drawing up and implementing care plans to meet the needs of individual patients.

AB Purpose: The incidence of paraquat (PQ) poisoning in China is increasing, so it is important to identify the characteristics of fatalities in children with acute PQ poisoning in order to prevent and treat future cases.
   Methods: A prospective study that enrolled 146 children with PQ poisoning was performed. A novel evaluation system called the score of lethal factors for PQ poisoning (SLFPP) was established, including 1 contributing factor and 4 weakening factors. Comparisons with the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) score, the Poisoning Severity Score (PSS) in admission and the SLFPP were made to determine their values for prognosis.
   Results: Younger patients (71/146, < 10 years) had accidental exposure to PQ (64/71, 90.14%), whereas older patients (75/146, >= 10 years) had ingested PQ intentionally (46/75, 61.33%) (p<0.01); 21/146 (14.38%) died of PQ poisoning. Of these 21 children, 20 committed suicide with ages >= 10 years. Significant differences (p<0.01) were found between nonsurvivors and survivors with regard to the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) scores (19.76 +/- 18.44 vs. 4.17 +/- 5.98), PSS in admission (2.48 +/- 0.60 vs. 1.43 +/- 0.59), the SLFPP (10.40 +/- 1.07 vs. 3.60 +/- 1.89). In PELOD score and PSS in admission, there were relative large overlaps in scores between nonsurvivors and survivors. But for SLFPP, there were smaller overlaps.
   Conclusions: Deliberate ingestion of PQ to commit suicide occurred mainly in older children (>= 10 years), while accidental exposure to PQ occurred mainly in younger children (< 10 years). Owing to small overlaps, the SLFPP may exceed PELOD and PSS in predicting the prognosis of PQ poisoning, but the SLFPP scores still require further clinical validation.

AB Background: A reversed gender pattern has been observed in the suicide rate in China compared to elsewhere. Like suicidal behaviour, non-suicidal self-injurious (NSSI) behaviour is a health-risk behaviour. We examined whether a reversed gender pattern existed in the prevalence of NSSI.
   Methods: Online literature databases were searched for English and Chinese articles on NSSI behaviours among the Chinese. A meta-analysis with a random-effects model and a subgroup analysis were used to estimate the odds ratios of gender differences in NSSI prevalence among Chinese adolescents including college students, middle school students, and clinical samples, as well as rural, urban, and Hong Kong middle school students.
   Results: There was a male bias in NSSI prevalence among college students (OR = 1.56, 95% CI = [1.30, 1.87], p < 0.001), and a female bias among middle school students (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = [0.73, 0.94], p < 0.01), but there was no gender difference among clinical samples (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = [0.41, 1.89], p > 0.1). The NSSI prevalence among middle school students had a female bias in the rural (OR = 0.58, 95% CI = [0.47, 0.72], p < 0.001) and Hong Kong areas (OR = 0.91, 95% CI = [0.86, 0.96], p < 0.001), with the gender difference in NSSI prevalence in the Hong Kong areas being greater than in rural areas. No gender difference in NSSI prevalence was found in urban areas (OR = 1.01, 95% CI = [0.84, 1.22], p > 0.1) among middle school students.
   Conclusions: Our analysis indicated the existence of specific gender and age patterns in NSSI prevalence among Chinese adolescents. The sample type, age, and the areas that have different gender norms and culture could partly explain this pattern.

AB This study compared the subjective quality of life (SQOL) in schizophrenia patients living with their families in Hong Kong (HK) and Beijing (BJ) and explored the relationship between SQOL and basic socio-demographic and clinical factors.
   Two hundred and sixty-four clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia were randomly selected in HK and 258 counterparts matched according to age, sex, age at onset, and length of illness in BJ. SQOL and psychiatric status were assessed with standard rating instruments.
   There was no significant difference in any of SQOL domains between the two cohorts after controlling for potentially confounding variables. Positive, depressive and anxiety symptoms and drug-induced extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) were all significantly correlated with SQOL. Multiple regression analysis revealed that only depressive symptoms predicted all SQOL domains in both groups. Having removed depressive symptoms from the model, positive symptoms predicted all domains, anxiety predicted all but social domains, use of benzodiazepines (BZD) predicted all but physical domains, EPS predicted physical domain, and history of suicide predicted social domain in HK; anxiety predicted all domains, positive symptoms predicted all but physical domains, EPS, use of BZD and history of suicide all predicted physical domains, and length of illness predicted environmental domain in BJ.
   Despite considerable differences between the two sites in terms of health care delivery and the economic conditions of the subjects, SQOL did not differ between HK and BJ. The conclusion is in line with previous studies that suggested that patients' SQOL was independent of their living standard as long as it reached a certain minimum level. SQOL was more strongly related to the severity of depressive symptoms and had weak association with socio-demographic factors.

   THOUGHTS
AB Objective: Epidemiological evidence suggests that work stress is associated with suicidal ideation (SI). However, only few studies in this area have drawn on well-established theoretical work stress models (i.e., the job-demand-control [JDC] model, the effort-reward-imbalance [ERI] model, and the model of organizational injustice [OM. Utilization of such models allows though for theory-based assessments and workplace interventions. Since evidence on those models' relationship with suicide-related outcomes is currently inconclusive (with regard to JDC), markedly sparse (OJ) or lacking (ERI), we aimed to provide additional or initial evidence.
   Methods: We drew on original data from six cross-sectional studies, which were conducted in four countries (i.e., South Korea, China, Australia, and Germany). Work stress was measured by established questionnaires and was categorized into tertiles. In each study, SI was assessed by either one or two items taken from validated scales. Associations of work stress with SI were estimated for each study and were pooled across studies using multivariate random-effects logistic modeling.
   Results: In the pooled analyses (n = 12,422) all three work stress models were significantly associated with SI with odds ratios fluctuating around 2. For instance, the pooled odds ratios for highest versus lowest work stress exposure in terms of job strain, OJ, and ERI equalled 1.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.52, 2.41), 1.98 (95% CI = 1.48, 2.65), and 2.77 (95% CI = 1.57, 4.88), respectively. Patterns of associations were largely consistent across the individual studies.
   Conclusion: Our study provides robust evidence of a positive association between work stress and SI. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background Public health is a priority for the Chinese Government. Evidence-based decision making for health at the province level in China, which is home to a fifth of the global population, is of paramount importance. This analysis uses data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 to help inform decision making and monitor progress on health at the province level.
   Methods We used the methods in GBD 2017 to analyse health patterns in the 34 province-level administrative units in China from 1990 to 2017. We estimated all-cause and cause-specific mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), summary exposure values (SEVs), and attributable risk. We compared the observed results with expected values estimated based on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI).
   Findings Stroke and ischaemic heart disease were the leading causes of death and DALYs at the national level in China in 2017. Age-standardised DALYs per 100 000 population decreased by 33.1% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 29.8 to 37.4) for stroke and increased by 4.6% (-3.3 to 10.7) for ischaemic heart disease from 1990 to 2017. Age-standardised stroke, ischaemic heart disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and liver cancer were the five leading causes of YLLs in 2017. Musculoskeletal disorders, mental health disorders, and sense organ diseases were the three leading causes of YLDs in 2017, and high systolic blood pressure, smoking, high-sodium diet, and ambient particulate matter pollution were among the leading four risk factors contributing to deaths and DALYs. All provinces had higher than expected DALYs per 100 000 population for liver cancer, with the observed to expected ratio ranging from 2.04 to 6.88. The all-cause age-standardised DALYs per 100 000 population were lower than expected in all provinces in 2017, and among the top 20 level 3 causes were lower than expected for ischaemic heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, headache disorder, and low back pain. The largest percentage change at the national level in age-standardised SEVs among the top ten leading risk factors was in high body-mass index (185%, 95% UI 113.1 to 247.7]), followed by ambient particulate matter pollution (88.5%, 66.4 to 116.4).
   Interpretation China has made substantial progress in reducing the burden of many diseases and disabilities. Strategies targeting chronic diseases, particularly in the elderly, should be prioritised in the expanding Chinese health-care system. Copyright (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and predictors of service utilization for mental health problems of the first-generation migrant population in Shenzhen, China, a city that attracts millions of unskilled rural laborers each year. Methods: Using the structured World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview, the investigators conducted face-to-face surveys between September 1, 2005, and January 30, 2006. A total of 7,134 respondents age 18 years and above finished the surveys. The main outcomes were prevalence of mental disorders according to DSM-IV criteria, as well as prevalence of mental health services used in different sectors. Results: Nine percent of the sample had ever used some type of service for mental health issues, and 6.3% used services outside of the health service sector, such as human services and complementary and alternative medicine. In addition, DSM criteria for a mental disorder over the lifetime were met by 18.1% of respondents; of the respondents with a mental disorder, 18.3% had used mental health services at least once. Migrants who were unmarried, had high family income, were raised in metropolitan areas, had histories of homelessness or attempted suicide, had a psychotic disorder, or had an anxiety disorder were more likely to use services for mental health care. Conclusions: In Shenzhen, few migrants used mental health services and most used complementary and alternative medicine services. Future studies of service utilization patterns in migrant populations should give special attention to personal characteristics, such as family support.

AB Background: People living with HIV may suffer from mental disorders. We aimed to explore the prevalence of and factors associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) among HIV-positive individuals in Guangdong, China, about which little is known.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to recruit HIV-positive individuals from the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control of Guangzhou, Zhongshan, and Yangjiang from September 2007 to September 2008. Data were collected by questionnaires. MDD was diagnosed and assessed by two psychiatrists using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders-Patient Edition (SCID-I/P) based on the DSM-IV criteria. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore the factors associated with MDD.
   Results: The prevalences of lifetime MDD and current MDD among the 339 included participants were 22.71% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 18.25-27.17%) and 12.09% (95% CI: 8.62%-15.57%), respectively. The results of multiple logistic regression showed that patients with AIDS had a higher risk of lifetime MDD (odds ratio [OR] = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.38-5.26) and current MDD (OR = 3.51, 95% CI: 1.59-7.75) than HIV-infected individuals. Participants with more number of negative life events were more likely to have lifetime MDD (OR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.34-4.06) and current MDD (OR = 3.77, 95% CI: 1.76-8.09) than individuals with fewer negative life events. Individuals with higher score of social support were less likely to have lifetime MDD (OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.26-0.80) and current MDD (OR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.21-0.97) than individuals with less social support.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of MDD was high among HIV-positive individuals in China. AIDS diagnosis, decreased social support, and an increased number of negative life events were risk factors for MDD.

AB Xinjiang is an autonomous region where multiple terrorist attacks have occurred in recent years. Troops were deployed to this area to fight against the terrorist activities. This study examined the prevalence and the risk factors associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in ethno-racially diverse veterans in the Xinjiang region of China. A total of 303 veterans (145 from Uyghur ethnic minorities, 122 from the Han majority, and 36 from other ethnic minorities) who served in combat zones and resided in the Xinjiang region were randomly selected and included in the study. A mail survey was sent to all participants to collect information about their social demographic factors, combat exposure, psychological resilience, social support, social connectedness, and self-disclosure of their mental health problems. The Post-Traumatic Stress Checklist-Civilian Version based on DSM-IV criteria were used to assess PTSD. The Uyghur veterans were significantly less likely to be identified as having PTSD (29.0%, 42/145) than other ethnic minorities (44.4%, 16/36), and the Han majority (44.2%, 54/122). Results of hierarchical logistic regression analyses indicated that psychological resilience and social support during the deployment were negatively associated with PTSD. However, self-disclosure of mental health problems was not significantly associated with PTSD among the ethno-racially diverse veterans. Ethno-racial and resilience factors were associated with PTSD. Understanding these factors could improve our understanding of PTSD and help policy makers take preventive actions to prevent PTSD among diverse ethnic veterans.

AB Monitoring the educational level of farmers and retailers on pesticide use would be useful to assess the appropriateness of information for reducing or/and avoiding the risks from pesticides in rural regions. The levels of knowledge and awareness of the dangers to the environment and human health were investigated by questionnaires for farmers (209) and retailers (20) in two rural regions (Qianyang County (S1) and Chencang County (S2)) of the Wei River catchment in China where the modes of farming and the state of erosion are very different. The results showed that farmers learned the use and dangers of pesticides mainly by oral communication (p < 0.01). Protective measures were inadequate; 65% (51) and 55% (S2) of farmers never used any protective measures during spraying (p < 0.05). Washing hands (>70%) was the most common mode of personal hygiene, relative to wearing masks, showering, and changing clothes, but no significant differences were observed between the selected regions. Most pesticide wastes were dumped directly onto the land or into water, suggesting that educational measures should be taken to address the potential risks from the residues in the wastes. Over 85% of farmers (S1 and 52) claimed to use illegal pesticides, but the reasons for their use varied (p < 0.01). Retailers were well-informed and highly conscious of their responsibility for the safe use of pesticides, especially in S2 (p < 0.01). A canonical correspondence analysis indicated that educational level and age differed between the two regions and contributed greatly to the risks from pesticide use (p < 0.01). Educational programmes targeted to age groups, proper disposal of pesticide waste, and sufficient supervision from authorities should consequently be considered for improving the levels of knowledge and awareness of the dangers of pesticides to human health and environmental pollution in the Wei River catchment China.

AB From the Americas to Asia, neoliberal policy restructuring continues to present major challenges to educational equity. In Hong Kong, teacher educators grapple with training students in pedagogy they believe in, versus the daily status quo of high-stakes exam prep, privatized shadow education, and a system seemingly pushed to the brink of neoliberal social efficiency. Indeed, in recent years, Hong Kong has recorded top rankings on the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study and the Programme for International Student Assessment, along with record-setting protests and student suicides. Like in the USA, neoliberalization of teacher education in Hong Kong has proffered dilemmas of standardized curricula, evaluation, and licensure, often under the guise of 21st century skills and technology. Both regions also face perpetual threats of being under- or de-funded, based on data-driven decision-making and leadership that are supposedly more accountable and efficient. Unsurprisingly, neoliberal policies and practices have often exacerbated inequities in teaching and learning, especially for communities labelled as minority or working-class. Within traditions of critical pedagogy, this article's authors engage in a discussion on how educators and students are navigating the neoliberal behemoth and developing more inclusive spaces across local contexts of language, class, and culture. Based on the authors' research in the Americas and Greater China, this article interrogates some of the junctures and ruptures of neoliberal education in Hong Kong, long-held as bridge between East and West. The article draws from the first author Benji Chang's action research projects with pre-and in-service teachers in the region, which examines how they are critiquing and challenging dominant discourses of neoliberalism (e.g., positivism, standardization, and market-economy), and what brings hope. Given Hong Kong's history of colonization with Europe and the USA, and the ever-expanding dominance of mainland China, this article makes a contribution to international scholarship concerned with teacher education and social justice.

TI Prevalence of Deliberate Self-harm Among Chinese Patients With Heroin

LA English
DT Review
DE deliberate self-harm; prevalence; heroin dependence; detoxification;
   meta-analysis

AB Background: There is paucity of data regarding the prevalence and methods of deliberate self-harm (DSH) in patients with heroin dependence in international literature. In China, there have been a few studies investigating the prevalence of DSH in heroin-dependent patients (HDPs), but their rates varied widely. We thus conducted a meta-analysis of studies assessing the prevalence of DSH among Chinese HDPs.
   Methods: Relevant studies were retrieved from major Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang data, and SinoMed) and western databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycInfo). Two authors independently identified eligible studies and extracted data. Studies that included a representative sample of Chinese HDPs and ascertained DSH caseness in a reliable way were considered as high quality. Statistical analysis was performed using R software.
   Results: In total, 15 eligible studies with a total of 37,243 Chinese HDPs were included. All included studies were conducted in heroin detoxification settings. Only two studies were rated as high quality. The pooled prevalence of DSH in Chinese HDPs was 4.4% (95% CI: 2.9, 6.2%), but the heterogeneity of prevalence rates across studies was significant (I-2 = 98%, P < 0.001). Studies rated as high quality had significantly higher prevalence of DSH than those rated as low quality (13.2 vs. 3.4%, P < 0.001). Swallowing foreign objects was the most common method of DSH, with a combined prevalence of 2.7% (95% CI: 1.6, 4.4%). Extreme DSH methods such as cutting off fingers and jumping from height were also not uncommon in this patient population.
   Conclusion: Due to methodological problems in available studies, we find a relatively low prevalence of DSH among Chinese HDPs receiving detoxification treatment. Nevertheless, the self-harmers of Chinese HDPs are more likely to harm themselves in a dangerous or life-threatening way. Restricting the availability of DSH methods may be an effective way to prevent or reduce DSH in China's detoxification treatment settings.

AB Background: Burnout has been a major concern in the field of occupational health. However, there is a paucity of research exploring the factors related to burnout among Chinese doctors. Investigation of these factors is important to improve the health of doctors and the quality of healthcare services in China.
   Methods: The study population consisted of 1,618 registered hospital doctors from Liaoning province of China. Burnout was measured using the Chinese version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey. Occupational stress was measured using the Chinese versions of the Job Content Questionnaire and the Effort-Reward Imbalance Questionnaire. Data were collected on the respondents' demographic characteristics and work situations. Of the doctors solicited for enrollment, 1,202 returned the completed questionnaire (555 men, 647 women), giving a response rate of 74.3%. A general linear regression model was applied to analyze the factors associated with burnout.
   Results: The burnout mean scores were 11.46 (7.51) for emotional exhaustion, 6.93 (5.15) for cynicism, and 24.07 (9.50) for professional efficacy. In descending order of standardized estimates, variables that predicted a high level of emotional exhaustion included: high extrinsic effort, dissatisfaction with doctor-patient relationship, high overcommitment, working >40 h per week, low reward, and high psychological job demands. Variables that predicted a high level of cynicism included: high extrinsic effort, low reward, dissatisfaction with doctor-patient relationship, high overcommitment, low decision authority, low supervisor support, and low skill discretion. Variables that predicted a low perceived professional efficacy included: high psychological job demands, low coworker support, high extrinsic effort, low decision authority, low reward, and dissatisfaction with doctor-patient relationship.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that occupational stress is strongly related to burnout among hospital doctors in China. Strategies that aim to improve work situations and decrease occupational stress are necessary to reduce burnout, including health education, health promotion, and occupational training programs.

AB IntroductionThis study was to assess differences in the symptom profile of depressive illness across various countries/territories in Asia. The study was a part of the Research on Asia Psychotropic Prescription project. The participating countries/territories include China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand.
   MethodsThe pattern of depressive symptoms in 1,400 subjects with depressive disorder from 42 psychiatric centers in 10 Asian countries/territories was assessed. We collected information on socio-demographic and clinical characteristics with a standardized protocol and data collection procedure.
   ResultsThe most common presentations of depressive symptoms were persistent sadness, loss of interest, and insomnia. Similar findings were found regardless of the region, country, or its income level. Patients with depressive disorder from high-income countries presented significantly more with vegetative symptom cluster (P<0.05), while those from the upper middle-income countries had significantly more with both mood (P<0.001) and cognitive symptom clusters (P<0.01). In lower middle-income countries, patients with depressive symptoms had significantly less mood symptom cluster (P<0.001) but significantly more cognitive symptom cluster (P<0.05).
   DiscussionThis study demonstrates that in Asia, despite variations in the initial symptom reported by the patients, across different countries/territories, core depressive symptoms remain the same. Variations have been found in presentation of depressive symptoms with regards to the level of income of countries. Physical or vegetative symptoms were reported more by centers in higher income countries, while depressive cognition and suicidal thoughts/acts were more frequently reported from lower income countries.

Traditional Chinese medicine therapy is one unique treatment method in China. Nevertheless, most patients in the existing studies on anxiety and depression were treated in western medical hospitals. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the prevalence and risk factors of these emotional disorders in lung cancer patients treated in traditional Chinese medical hospitals. These findings may assist in clinical intervention.
   Patients and methods: A total of 315 patients with lung cancer were enrolled. Individuals completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to assess their levels of anxiety and depression. Demographic and clinical data were also collected. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors that significantly predicted anxiety and depression.
   Results: The anxiety and depression prevalence rates of lung cancer patients were 43.5% and 57.1%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, patients without surgery, who were young, or who received radiotherapy were more likely to experience anxiety. Patients without surgery, who were young, or who had late-stage cancer, were more likely to experience depression. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors of both anxiety and depression were lack of surgery and young and middle age (<65, especially 45-65 years).
   Conclusion: Anxiety and depression were very common in lung cancer patients. Lack of surgery, young, and middle age, were independent risk factors for anxiety and depression. Therefore, medical workers should pay close attention to the emotional changes of young or middle-aged patients, or patients without the chance to undergo surgery.

TI The Prevalence of Distress and Depression among Women in Rural Sichuan
   Province
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SUICIDE; VALIDITY; STIGMA; SCALE; RELIABILITY; CHINESE
AB Background
   In this paper, we report findings regarding the prevalence of expressed distress and depressive conditions among women living in a rural region of Sichuan Province. As well, we know of no data among women in rural China that examine whether "depression," as categorically defined in classifications such as the DSM, adequately captures the expressed distress and symptomatic complaints of women in rural China.
   Methods
   A multistage sampling method was employed to recruit the target population. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to measure distress symptoms, and MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was employed to determine the prevalence of diagnosable depression and other disorders.
   Results
   Among 1898 rural women, 12.4%(236) scored >= 16 on the CES-D, indicative of distress, and a subset of 7.7% (146) had scores >= 21, highly suggestive of a clinically significant disorder. We found that 49.8% women with >= 16 CES-D score were identified as showing features consistent with a current major depressive episode (MDE) vs. 1.9% in a sample of randomly selected women with <16 CES-D score. Among respondents, 30 of 84 (35.7%) scoring 16-20 and 83 of 143 (58.0%) scoring >= 21 reported symptoms consistent with MDE. 25.1% of women with a positive CES-D score did not describe symptoms consistent with any DSM-IV disorder.
   Conclusions
   We found a higher portion of women reporting significant distress than previously described. Among them, there was a clear gradient, such that 41.7% of women with moderate distress did not have a psychiatric diagnosis, and even among those with more severe symptoms, 15.4% did not manifest a DSM-specific psychiatric condition.

TI A study of suicidal ideation in acute ischemic stroke patients
SO HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES

DT Article
DE Ischemic stroke; Suicidal ideation; Depression; Risk factor
ID RISK-FACTORS; FREQUENCY; ILLNESS; CHINA
AB Background: Increasing evidences indicate that stroke confers a substantial risk for suicidal ideation. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors of suicidal ideation in acute ischemic stroke patients.
   Method: A total of 271 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke were recruited in Huai-He hospital or the First People's Hospital, Kaifeng City, China. Demographic and clinical variables were collected and evaluated. Suicidal ideation was assessed using the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSI). Multivariate logistic regression was applied to determine the risk factors of suicidal ideation.
   Results: Suicidal ideation was identified in 29 patients (10.7%). It was more frequent in patients who lived in rural region, with pre-/post-stroke depression or diabetes, had a higher NIHSS score, had no confidence in disease treatment, or had a poor coping style. Living in rural region (OR 2.59, 95% CI 1.02-6.58), the presence of pre-stroke depression (OR 11.74, 95% CI 4.45-31.01), stroke severity (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08-1.33), having no confidence in disease treatment (OR 14.70, 95% CI 2.60-83.15), and post-stroke depression (OR 16.22, 95% CI 6.40-41.10) were independent risk factors of suicidal ideation.
   Conclusion: Several factors may be associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in acute ischemic stroke patients, including pre-/post-stroke depression, more severe stroke, having no confidence in treatment, as well as living in rural region. Our findings may have implication in risk assessment and intervention for acute ischemic stroke patients in reducing the burdens of suicidal ideation.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of low-voltage electrocution deaths in Guangdong, China. Three thousand three hundred seventy autopsy reports from the Department of Forensic Pathology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, over a period of 10 years (2001-2010) were reviewed, of which 71 low-voltage electrocution cases were identified. The descriptive statistical analyses were carried out with the application of SPSS 19.0 software. Electrocution accounted for 2.11% of all autopsied cases. The age range was 3 to 57 years with a mean age of 31.77 +/- 11.0 years. The average age of male victims was 33.08 +/- 10.77 years, and that of female victims was 22.63 +/- 11.06 years. The majority of the victims (87.33%) were male. Among the circumstances leading to electrocution, most of them occurred in factory and in the street. Considering the contact details, deaths were caused most frequently by touching electrical wires (n = 27, 38.02%), followed by touching charged machine (n = 20, 28.17%). There were no suicide and homicide cases. Of all electrocution cases, 50.70% occurred during the summer period from June through August. The upper extremity was the most frequently involved contact site (59.72%). No electrical burn marks were present in 14 cases (19.72%). Our results indicated that most deaths from electrocution occur more often in factories, in summer seasons, and to young male workers, which can help in the development of a differentiated strategy for the prevention of electrocution, while taking into consideration sex, age, occupation, and season of the year.

TI What Impedes General Practitioners' Identification of Mental Disorders
   at Outpatient Departments? A Qualitative Study in Shanghai, China
SO ANNALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH

DT Article
ID PRIMARY-CARE; SUICIDE RISK; HEALTH; SERVICES; VERSION; ADULTS
AB Background: Mental disorders endanger people's health and lives. General practitioners (GPs) play a valuable role in identifying and treating mental disorders in outpatient clinical settings. However, there are obstacles for GPs' identification in developing countries.
   Objective: This study's aim was to identify the related obstacles and to propose optimized strategies.
   Methods: We conducted qualitative interviews with 26 GPs from seven randomly sampled community healthcare centers in Shanghai, China. The interview guide was based primarily on the items from mental status evaluation. After transcribing, coding, condensing, and categorizing talking content, we summarized the theme structure and results.
   Findings: GPs lacked the confidence and skills to conduct psychiatric evaluation and seldom conducted it. Patients' behaviors also influenced whether evaluations were conducted. The GPs expressed that they were short of strategies and wished to be well trained and have sufficient practice. We found that two major reasons impeded GPs' identification. First, the GPs had difficulty making a diagnosis: they lacked diagnostic ability and confidence, they had misunderstandings about diagnoses, and they had unclear qualifications for making psychiatric diagnoses. Second, the GPs lacked skills for evaluation and reevaluation: their evaluation had inadequacies of contents and subjects; they lacked mental state examination evaluation, communication, and severity assessment skills and knowledge.
   Conclusions: This study found that it is difficult for GPs in developing countries to become competent in the diagnosis and systematic evaluation of mental disorders without external help. Unclear qualification also limited GPs' diagnoses of mental disorders. We proposed that optimized strategies to overcome these challenges lie in support of changes in policy, programs, and utilizing effective tools, such as the mhGAP, GMHAT/PC, BVC, Grille's assessment tool, and telemedicine.

TI Looking beyond 'buildings of chrome and glass': Hong Kong's 'uncanny
   postcoloniality' in photographs of Tin Shui Wai
SO VISUAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Hong Kong has a unique postcolonial identity. After being colonised by Britain for over a century and a half, it was ceremoniously handed over to China in 1997, without necessitating any bloody wars or even skirmishes. Hong Kong has continued to enjoy a privileged status within China due to the doctrines enshrined in the 'one country two systems' policy. She has benefited from becoming part of a nation with the fastest growing economy in the world, and the people of Hong Kong have for the most part acquiesced to the reduction in levels of political freedom. However, recent events like the Umbrella Movement spearheaded mainly by student protesters has brought to the fore the cracks in Hong Kong's postcolonial identity and the city finds itself once again precariously poised in a moment of transition.
   Theorising a connection between Hong Kong's postcolonial predicament and the city state's physical landscape, I analyse Hong Kong photographer Derrick Chang's photos of Tin Shui Wai, a remote new town located on Hong Kong's northwestern edge. Tin Shui Wai is a failed new town -it was developed to house workers who would serve the industries that were projected to develop there in the 1990s. However, these labour-intensive industries never materialised due to the meteoric rise of Guangdong's manufacturing industry. Instead Tin Shui Wai has now come to be known as the 'city of sadness', notorious for its gruesome murders, high rate of domestic abuse and tragic suicides. Through an analysis of Chang's photographs of Tin Shui Wai depicting isolation, stagnation and urban detritus, this article argues that the uncanny, spectral spaces of encounter raise questions and provide an alternative and more disquieting narrative of Hong Kong's postcolonial identity.

ID ABUSE; PREVALENCE; WOMEN; DEPRESSION; NEGLECT; VIOLENCE; PEOPLE; RATES
AB Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the association of elder mistreatment subtypes and suicidal ideation in adults age 60 years and older residing in a Chinese rural community. Methods: We conducted a population-based cross-sectional survey in 2010 and 2,039 adults age 60 and older, living in Macheng city of Hubei province, China, were interviewed face-to-face using a structured questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the independent effect of elder mistreatment to suicidal ideation among older adults. Results: Older adults who endorsed mistreatment had a significantly higher rate of suicidal ideation than those without elder mistreatment both in men (17.4% versus 2.4%; chi(2) = 58.04, p < 0.01) and women (15.8% versus 4.0%; chi(2) = 50.24, p < 0.01). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, psychological mistreatment (OR: 5.0; 95% CI: 2.5-9.8) and financial mistreatment (OR: 4.1; 95% CI: 1.2-14.7) were positively associated with suicidal ideation. Among men, psychological mistreatment (OR: 5.4; 95% CI: 2.6-11.2) and financial mistreatment (OR: 4.2; 95% CI: 1.1-16.2) were positively associated with suicidal ideation. Among women, physical mistreatment (OR: 4.5; 95% CI: 2.2-9.2) and psychological mistreatment (OR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.5-4.4) were positively associated with suicidal ideation. Conclusion: This is the first study that demonstrates that elder adults who experienced mistreatment are at increased risk for suicidal ideation. Our findings suggest that clinicians need to consider mistreatment exposure in older patients who have suicidal ideation. Victims of elder mistreatment should be the targets for suicide monitoring and prevention programs.

AB Objective To investigate the prevalence and correlating factors of binge drinking among middle and high school students in Zhejiang Province, China.
   Methods We performed a cross-sectional study using data from a school-based survey. A total of 23 543 (response rate=97.5%) eligible adolescents from 442 different schools (including middle schools, academic high schools and vocational high schools) were asked to fill in an anonymous self-administered behaviour questionnaire between April and May 2017. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the associations of sociodemographic and behavioural factors with binge drinking.
   Results The mean (SD) age of participants was 15.6 (1.7) years and 51.3% were boys. The proportions of students from middle schools, academic high schools and vocational high schools were 51.9%, 27.5% and 20.6%, respectively. In total, 22.8% (95% CI 21.6 to 23.9) of students reported drinking alcohol in the past 30 days and 9.2% (95% CI 8.5 to 10.0) of students reported binge drinking (defined as drinking four or more alcoholic drinks in 1-2 hours period among girls and five or more alcoholic drinks among boys) during the past month. The prevalence of binge drinking was highest among vocational high school students (17.9% vs 6.3% and 7.7% among middle school and academic high school students, respectively). Older age, studying at high school, poor academic performance, higher levels of physical activity, excessive screen-time, loneliness, insomnia, previous suicide attempt, cigarette smoking, fighting, being bullied and sexual experience were found to be positively associated with adolescent binge drinking.
   Conclusions Binge drinking is common among middle and high school students in Zhejiang, China. Efforts to prevent binge drinking may need to address a cluster of sociodemographic and behavioural factors. Our findings provide information to enable healthcare providers to identify students at high-risk of binge drinking and to inform planning of intervention measures for at-risk students.

AB Background: Little has been known about the demographic and clinical features of the melancholic subtype of major depressive disorder (MDD) in Chinese patients. This study examined the frequency of melancholia in Chinese MDD patients and explored its demographic and clinical correlates and prescribing patterns of psychotropic drugs.
   Methods: A consecutively collected sample of 1,178 patients with MDD were examined in 13 psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric units of general hospitals in China nationwide. The cross-sectional data of patients' demographic and clinical characteristics and prescriptions of psychotropic drugs were recorded using a standardized protocol and data collection procedure. The diagnosis of the melancholic subtype was established using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Medications ascertained included antidepressants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines.
   Results: Six hundred and twenty nine (53.4%) of the 1,178 patients fulfilled criteria for melancholia. In multiple logistic regression analyses, compared to non-melancholic counterparts, melancholic MDD patients were more likely to be male and receive benzodiazepines, had more frequent suicide ideations and attempts and seasonal depressive episodes, while they were less likely to be employed and receive antidepressants and had less family history of psychiatric disorders and lifetime depressive episodes.
   Conclusions: The demographic and clinical features of melancholic MDD in Chinese patients were not entirely consistent with those found in Western populations. Compared to non-melancholic MDD patients, melancholic patients presented with different demographic and clinical features, which have implications for treatment decisions.

AB The field of gene therapy offers promising treatment innovations that may prove to be fundamental in helping cancer patients. In this review, recent advances in this field are discussed, with particular emphasis on new trends that have emerged in clinical trials between 2005 and 2006. Notably, among these trials only 5% were phase III trials, reflecting a lack of sound clinical advancement and, possibly, underscoring reduced enthusiasm and financial support by pharmaceutical companies in western countries. Viral vectors continue to be the preferred delivery system, with an increase in exploitation of oncolytic viruses. Nevertheless, the persistent crucial hurdle - the transfer of the therapeutic gene into sufficient numbers of tumor cells - remains. Future clinical trials will aim to identify promising combinations of genetic and conventional medicine. Multicenter trials with a broad patient enrolment will be mandatory to establish definitive proof of efficacy. In this regard, China has recently emerged as a country with growth potential in this sector and it may be the country where evidence of clinical efficacy of cancer gene therapy will first be achieved.

AB Vibrio alginolyticus is one of the important fish pathogen in China, bringing about serious economic loss to aquaculture. sRNA (Small non-coding RNA, sRNA) modulate the target genes on the post-transcriptional level with the aid of the chaperon protein, Hfq and play essential roles in the regulation of various physiological functions, like virulence. In this paper, a quorum regulatory sRNA, Qrr1, was screened and cloned. Besides, An in-frame deletion was made in qrr1 by allelic exchange, using the suicide plasmid. Meanwhile, the plasmid, pMMB206 was utilized to carry the contact qrr1 gene into the mutant strain Delta qrr1 to generate the complemented strain, qrr1(+). The roles of this gene in different physiological functions of Vibrio alginolyticus were characterized. The results demonstrated that Qrr1 obviously promoted the growth of Vibrio alginolyticus during exponential and stationary stage. Moreover, the ability of mobility was almost absent, the biofilm formation and extracellular protease production were all impaired in the Delta qrr1 mutant strain, contrast to the wild-type strain, which means Qrr1 participates in the virulence regulation as an important regulator in Vibrio alginolyticus.

ID SOCIAL SUPPORT; MENTAL-DISORDERS; DISABILITY; MORTALITY; VERSION
AB Depression and acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are both common public health challenges. Patients with ACS often develop depression, which in turn adversely affects prognosis. Low-cost, sustainable, and effective service models that integrate depression care into the management of ACS patients to reduce depression and improve ACS outcomes are critically needed. Integrating Depression Care in ACS patients in Low Resource Hospitals in China (I-CARE) is a multicenter, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of an 11-month integrated care (IC) intervention compared to usual care (UC) in management of ACS patients. Four thousand inpatients will be recruited and then randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an IC intervention consisting of nurse-led risk factor management, group-based counseling supplemented by individual problem-solving therapy, and antidepressant medications as needed, or to UC. The primary outcomes are depression symptoms measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 at 6 and 12 months. Secondary endpoints include anxiety measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7; quality of life measured by the EQ-5D at 6 and 12 months; and major adverse events including the combined end point of all-cause death, suicide attempts, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and all-cause rehospitalization at yearly intervals for a median follow-up of 2 years. Analyses of the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of IC also will be performed. I-CARE trial will be the largest study to test the effectiveness of an integrated care model on depression and cardiovascular outcomes among ACS patients in resource-limited clinical settings.

AB The relationship between religious orientation and suicidality can be more complex in samples of low religious rate. The present study was conducted in China, one of the least religious countries, with the purpose of exploring different aspects of religious orientation and their relationships to suicidality. Among a university sample of 2074 respondents, 122 respondents reported being religious and responded to our measures of religious orientation and suicidality. Extrinsic religious orientation, while being distinct from intrinsic religious orientation, could be subdivided into personally-oriented and socially-oriented dimensions to predict suicidality in our sample. Results from regression analysis showed that respondents with higher intrinsic religious orientation and lower personally-oriented extrinsic religious orientation are more likely to have lower suicidality. These findings support that intrinsic orientation is embodied with positive outcomes whereas extrinsic orientation is embodied with negative outcomes. It is noteworthy that socially-oriented extrinsic religious orientation did not predict suicidality in our sample, as it was speculated that the role of socially-oriented extrinsic religious orientation cannot function when there are few religious people to socialize with in the community.

AB Background: Chinese rural elderly are at higher risk of committing suicide. However, little is known about the suicidal ideation (SI) of institutional elderly residents in rural China. Methods: 250 participants aged 60 or above living in Chinese rural nursing homes were recruited. Data were collected on subjects' SI, social-demographic characters, physical illness and psychological factors. Univariate comparisons and path analysis were conducted then. Results: 19.5% (40/205) of the participants reported a current SI. Hopelessness and depression had significant direct impacts on SI, and self-esteem and loneliness can impact SI through the mediating of depression and hopelessness. Visiting frequency of children, number of physical illnesses and social activities can also affect SI through the mediating of loneliness or self-esteem. Conclusion: As the first study on path analysis of SI of rural institutional elderly, the findings are significant. All these factors in our model should be considered when interventions are being conducted. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DT Article
ID DEVELOPING-WORLD; DEATHS; SUICIDE
AB To investigate the characteristics of pesticide poisoning in Jiangsu province and provide a scientific basis for measures for the prevention of pesticide poisoning. Information from pesticide poisoning report cards from 2007 to 2016 was derived from the Occupational Disease and Occupational Health Information Monitoring System, and the characteristics of pesticide poisoning patients were assessed via descriptive analysis. A total of 30,789 pesticide poisoning cases were reported in Jiangsu Province. Of these cases, 23,557 were non-occupational poisonings, accounting for 76.5% of the reported cases. There were 1705 deaths from pesticide poisoning, and the fatality rate was 5.5%. Numerous cases occurred in northeast Jiangsu. Pesticide poisoning cases were primarily concentrated in individuals 36-60 years of age. Pesticide poisoning primarily occurred in the summer. The top types of pesticides causing poisoning were organophosphates. The fatality rate of intentional pesticide poisoning was the lowest among the age group of 0 to 14 years, while the highest was noted among people over 61 years. Therefore, pesticide poisoning is a major problem in Jiangsu Province. We need to strengthen the management of highly toxic pesticides and implement effective health education on the use of pesticides.

AB Objective: To describe the epidemiology and trends of traumatic deaths among children and adolescents in Manipal, Southern India.
   Methods: Analysis of all trauma deaths in children and adolescents aged between 1 and 19 years, autopsied between January 1994 and December 2005. The study is based on autopsy records, information furnished by the police, and chemical analysis report.
   Results: There has been a substantial decline in the incidence of traumatic deaths among children and adolescents during 1994 to 2005. Road traffic injuries were responsible for maximum mortalities (38.4%), followed by those because of burns (24.9%) and poisoning (15.9%). Males comprised 59.6% of cases. Male-to-female ratio was 1.5:1. Males predominantly died of traffic injuries (45.2%), whereas females as a result of burns (37.4%). There was more than two-fold increase in injury-related mortalities from childhood to adolescence (1:2.3).
   Conclusion: Among children and adolescents, traffic injuries and burns are responsible for maximum injury-related mortalities in males and females, respectively. More injury reducing measures are required for effective reduction in traumatic deaths.

AB BackgroundNo systematic reviews have been conducted into the prevalence of personality disorders (PD) in Asian populations. This review aims to investigate the prevalence of all PD subtypes within community and clinical Asian (Chinese, Indian, Japanese and South Korean) populations worldwide.
   MethodSeven databases were searched in addition to manual examination and reference tracking. Exclusion criteria were applied with the remaining studies subjected to quality appraisal.
   ResultsNineteen studies were included for review. Results were grouped by community studies in Asian countries, clinical studies in Asian countries and comparative studies. Prevalence of PD assessed by clinical judgement was lower than that by diagnostic tools. The highest rates of PD were found in suicidal cohorts within the various countries. Four of the five comparative studies found lower prevalence rates of PD in Asians compared with the overall sample.
   ConclusionInsufficient consistent research has been published to ascertain the prevalence of PD in Asians and whether it is higher or lower than in Western cohorts. Asians presenting with suicidal ideation may benefit from PD assessment. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Poverty in Global Perspective: Is Shame a Common Denominator?
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Focussing on the psychosocial dimensions of poverty, the contention that shame lies at the 'irreducible absolutist core' of the idea of poverty is examined through qualitative research with adults and children experiencing poverty in diverse settings in seven countries: rural Uganda and India; urban China; Pakistan; South Korea and United Kingdom; and small town and urban Norway. Accounts of the lived experience of poverty were found to be very similar, despite massive disparities in material circumstances associated with locally defined poverty lines, suggesting that relative notions of poverty are an appropriate basis for international comparisons. Though socially and culturally nuanced, shame was found to be associated with poverty in each location, variably leading to pretence, withdrawal, self-loathing, 'othering', despair, depression, thoughts of suicide and generally to reductions in personal efficacy. While internally felt, poverty-related shame was equally imposed by the attitudes and behaviour of those not in poverty, framed by public discourse and influenced by the objectives and implementation of anti-poverty policy. The evidence appears to confirm the negative consequences of shame, implicates it as a factor in increasing the persistence of poverty and suggests important implications for the framing, design and delivery of anti-poverty policies.

AB The present study investigated the prevalence of psychological problems and their relationships with relevant HIV prevention behaviors among female sex workers (FSWs). An anonymous cross-sectional survey was conducted. With a mapping exercise, 293 Chinese FSWs were recruited from a red-light district in Hong Kong. Results showed high prevalence of psychological problems among FSWs: substance use (40.4%), probable depression (53.9%), self-harm tendencies (34-38%), poor self-esteem (48-52%), and pessimistic future outlook (46-47%). Inconsistent condom use was common (51% with clients, 23% with one-night-stand sex partner, and 73% with boyfriends). Over 70% had not used HIV-related prevention services in the last 6 months. Multivariate analyses indicated that psychological problems were significantly associated with inconsistent condom use and non-use of prevention services. The poor psychological well-beings of FSWs have important public health implications. Relevant professional services should be provided and integrated with HIV prevention efforts.

AB We investigated the psychometric properties of the modified 8-item Chinese version of the Revised Posttraumatic Growth Inventory for Children (PTGI-C-R) among 3256 adolescents in Chengdu, China, after the Sichuan Earthquake in 2008. The PTGI-C-R showed good reliability (Cronbach's alpha = .86; composite reliability = 0.87). A single factor was extracted by exploratory factor analysis and confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis in 2 randomly split half subsamples. Multigroup analyses showed that the single-factor structure was stable across gender groups and age groups (age <15 years and >= 15 years). The PTGI-C-R was negatively correlated with depression (r = -0.21) and positively correlated with resilience, social support, and perceived importance of health, family, and friendship (r ranged from 0.34 to 0.40). Our findings support the idea that the PTGI-C-R is a reliable and valid measure of posttraumatic growth among Chinese adolescents having experienced a natural disaster. Validation of the scale in the context of other traumatic events is warranted.

AB Oncolytic adenovirotherapy presents a novel approach for cancer therapy. Oncolytic adenoviruses are modified to replicate and induce oncolytic cell death in cancer cells but not in normal somatic cells. The first oncolytic adenovirus to be developed was ONYX-015, an E1B-55 kDa gene-deleted oncolytic adenovirus; after which many inventive oncolytic adenoviruses have followed. H101, an oncolytic adenovirus with very similar gene constructs as ONYX-015, was approved in China as the world's first adenovirus cancer treatment in humans in 2005. Many clinical trials have revealed that oncolytic adenoviruses produce synergistic antitumor effects in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents, radiation, and some molecular targeted agents, although monotherapy with oncolytic adenoviruses shows limited effects. In this chapter, we discuss the developments of oncolytic adenoviruses, focusing on their synergistic effects when combined with other treatment modalities. Then we discuss the problems that must be overcome for adenoviruses to become more attractive as cancer treatment agents and to expand their clinical applications.

TI Trends in cause-specific mortality among children aged 5-14 years from
   2005 to 2016 in India, China, Brazil, and Mexico: an analysis of
   nationally representative mortality studies
SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article
ID SURVEILLANCE; BURDEN
AB Background With global survival increasing for children younger than 5 years of age, attention is required to reduce the approximately 1 million deaths of children aged 5-14 years occurring every year. Causes of death at these ages remain poorly documented. We aimed to explore trends in mortality by causes of death in India, China, Brazil, and Mexico, which are home to about 40% of the world's children aged 5-14 years and experience more than 200 000 deaths annually at these ages.
   Methods We examined data on 244 401 deaths in children aged 5-14 years from four nationally representative data sources that obtained direct distributions of causes of death: the Indian Million Death Study, the Chinese Disease Surveillance Points, mortality data from the Mexican Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia, and mortality data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. We present data on 12 main disease groups in all countries, with breakdown by communicable and nutritional diseases, non-communicable diseases, injuries, and ill-defined causes. To calculate age-specific and sex-specific death rates for each cause, we applied the national cause of death distribution to the UN mortality envelopes for 2005-16 for each country.
   Findings Unlike Brazil, China, and Mexico, communicable diseases still account for nearly half of deaths in India in children aged 5-14 years (73 920 [46.1%] of 160 330 estimated deaths in 2016). In 2016, India had the highest death rates in nearly every category, including from communicable diseases. Fast declines among girls in communicable disease mortality narrowed the gap by 2016 with boys in India (32.6 deaths per 100 000 girls vs 26.2 per 100 000 boys) and China (1.7 vs 1.5). In China, injuries accounted for the greatest proportions of deaths (20 970 [53.2%] of 39 430 estimated deaths, in which drowning was a leading cause). The homicide death rate at ages 10-14 years was higher for boys than for girls in Brazil, increasing annually by an average of 0.7% (0.3-1.1). In India and China, the suicide death rates were higher for girls than for boys at ages 10-14 years. By contrast, in Mexico it was higher for boys than for girls, increasing annually by an average of 2.8% (2.0-3.6). Deaths from transport injuries, drowning, and cancer are common in all four countries, with transport accidents among the top three causes of death for both sexes in all countries, except for Indian girls, and cancer in the top three causes for both sexes in Mexico, Brazil, and China.
   Interpretation Most of the deaths that occurred between 2005 and 2016 in children aged 5-14 years in India, China, Brazil, and Mexico arose from preventable or treatable conditions. This age group is important for extending some of the global disease-specific targets developed for children younger than 5 years of age. Interventions to control noncommunicable diseases and injuries and to strengthen cause of death reporting systems are also required.

AB Objectives Most data on self-poisoning in rural Asia have come from secondary hospitals. We aimed to: assess how transfers from primary to secondary hospitals affected estimates of case-fatality ratio (CFR); determine whether there was referral bias according to gender or poison; and estimate the annual incidence of all self-poisoning, and of fatal self-poisoning, in a rural developing-world setting.
   Methods Self-poisoning patients admitted to Anuradhapura General Hospital, Sri Lanka, were reviewed on admission from 1 July to 31 December 2002. We audited medical notes of self-poisoning patients admitted to 17 of the 34 surrounding peripheral hospitals for the same period.
   Findings A total of 742 patients were admitted with self-poisoning to the secondary hospital; 81 died (CFR 10.9%). 483 patients were admitted to 17 surrounding peripheral hospitals. Six patients (1.2%) died in peripheral hospitals, 249 were discharged home, and 228 were transferred to the secondary hospital. There was no effect of gender or age on likelihood of transfer; however, patients who had ingested oleander or paraquat were more likely to be transferred than were patients who had taken organophosphorus pesticides or other poisons. Estimated annual incidences of self-poisoning and fatal self-poisoning were 363 and 27 per 100 000 population, respectively, with an overall CFR of 7.4% (95% confidence interval 6.0-9.0).
   Conclusion Fifty per cent of patients admitted to peripheral hospitals were discharged home, showing that CFRs based on secondary hospital data are inflated. However, while incidence of self-poisoning is similar to that in England, fatal self-poisoning is three times more common in Sri Lanka than fatal self-harm by all methods in England. Population based data are essential for making international comparisons of case fatality and incidence, and for assessing public health interventions.

TI Gendering Ethnic Religion in 1940s and 1950s Yunnan: Sexuality in the
   Gua sa la Festival and the Worship of the Goddess Baijie
SO NAN NU-MEN WOMEN AND GENDER IN CHINA
LA English
DT Article
DE sexuality; Yunnan; Dali; minzu; zongjiao
AB Chinese intellectuals adopted the concepts minzu (ethnicity or "nationality") and zongjiao (religion) from Japan in the late nineteenth century as part of the wider discourse of modernity. This article examines the gendered dimensions of these concepts through writings about sexuality in two examples from Dali, Yunnan (home to the Bai minzu) from the late Republican period (1911-49) to the early years of the People's Republic of China. The first example, the Gua sa la festival, involves sexually explicit songs, cross-dressing, and possibly also sexual encounters with strangers. The second example, the cult of the local goddess Baijie, celebrates the fidelity and chastity of an eighth-century queen who committed suicide rather than marry her husband's killer. The examination of writings about Gua sa la and Baijie demonstrates how intellectuals in the 1940s and 1950s selectively invoked concepts of minzu, zongjiao, and sexuality to affirm these apparently opposing phenomena as representations of Bai ethnic culture. Though the political and discursive climate changed significantly throughout this period, in the 1940s and 1950s Gua sa la and Baijie both remained positive images, which was only possible because intellectuals elided either zongjiao or sexuality in their descriptions.

AB Hong Kong has recently witnessed heightened public awareness of the issues of rights, civil society and citizenship. Contested relations with the Beijing government and slower economic growth in mainland China have seen more Hong Kong citizens become involved in civic engagement and identity politics. Youth service providers thus find themselves forced to respond to a rapidly changing society and changing youth needs while being situated in institutions with their own structural constraints and work culture. The result is that occupational stress is increasingly common amongst Hong Kong secondary school teachers and social workers. This paper presents the findings of a qualitative ethnographic study involving 16 in-depth interviews with community leaders, teachers and school-based social workers. How does a changing society affect youth work in general? How does greater discussion of democracy and human rights in the public sphere affect the way that youth service providers perform youth work? What are the changing roles and responsibilities of these providers in offering support to Hong Kong youth? The research themes that emerged include changing demographics and youth scene, a democratising public sphere in relation to Chinese youth and professionalism as a youth service provider.

AB In the recent decades, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been found to be increasing in males in some countries. In China, HCC ranked second of cancer mortality since 1990s. Hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) and dietary aflatoxin intake remain the major causative factors of HCC. Surgery plays a major role in the treatment of HCC, particularly for small HCC. Downstaging unresectable huge HCC to smaller HCC and followed by resection will probably be a now approach for further study. Liver transplantation is indicated for small HCC, however, some issues remain to be solved. Different modes of "regional cancer therapy for HCC" have been tried. Systemic chemotherapy has been disappointing in the past but the future can be promising. Biotherapy, such as cytokines, differentiation inducers, anti-angiogenic agents, gene therapy and tumor vaccine will probably play a role, particularly in the prevention of tumor recurrence. HCC invasiveness is currently the major target of study. Tremendous works have been done at the molecular level, which will provide clues for biomarker of HCC progression as well as targets for intervention.

AB Objective: Depression is a common mental disorder in older adults. We examined the prevalence and risk factors for depression in older adults in the Beijing area.
   Method: We used data from a cross-sectional survey conducted in July 2006 in Beijing. As part of the national survey for older Chinese adults, 2002 older adults were interviewed. The 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale was used to assess depression. Demographics as well as other personal information were also collected.
   Results: Among Beijing older adults, 13.01% were categorized as depressed. Prevalence rates of depression in rural and urban older adults were 26.63% and 10.79%, respectively. Poor economic status, high activities of daily living (ADL) score, poor physical health, impious offspring, and feeling old were important predictors of depression in older adults in Beijing. For the urban sample, poor economic status, poor physical health, high ADL score, and impious offspring were risk factors for depression. For the rural sample, depression was significantly associated with poor economic status and poor physical health.
   Conclusions: Depression is a common mood disorder among older adults in the Beijing area. Filial piety is a unique predictor for depression in older Chinese adults, compared with findings in Western cultures.

TI A new definition of health? An open letter of autochthonous peoples and
   medical anthropologists to the WHO
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE

DT Article
DE Public health; Wellbeing; Ecology; Medical anthropology; Suicide
AB Currently, formany practitioners (hospital and liberals) and researchers (including public health), the WHO definition of health is outdated: first it seems more utopian than pragmatic; then, it proves unsuitable for a large part of the world population. There is clearly a need to refine this definition or propose additional criteria to be more relevant or discriminating. In this perspective, what can indigenous people offer in the elaboration of a new definition of health?
   In this article, leaders or representatives of autochthonous peoples, anthropologists and physicians from many cultural origins (Amazonia, Patagonia, Papua New-Guinea, Inuit, North-American Indian, sub-Saharan Africa, India, China, Melanesia and Polynesia) have tried to identify and explain several key concepts that WHO should reintegrate into its new definition of health: human equilibrium in nature, accepted spirituality and adaptation. On the sidelines of the application of COP21 decisions that should give back to man his place into the environment, autochthonous people leaders, anthropologists and MDs explain why these three concepts are fundamental and universal health determinants, and need to be included in a new WHO definition of health.

AB Background: This study investigated the association between suicidal ideation and family environment. The sample included 5183 Chinese university students. A number of studies on suicidal ideation have focused on individuals rather than families. This paper reviews the general principles of suicidal ideation and the consequences resulting from the family environment. Methods: This study used six different colleges as the dataset, which included 2645 males and 2538 females. Students were questioned with respect to social demographics and suicidal ideation factors. The data were analyzed with factor and logistic analyses to determine the association between suicidal ideation and poor family environment. Results: The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 9.2% (476/5183). Most participants with suicidal ideation had significant similarities: they had poor family structures and relationships, their parents had unstable work, and their parents used improper parenting styles. Female students were more likely to have suicidal thoughts than male students. Conclusions: This study shows that suicidal ideation is a public health issue among Chinese university students and demonstrates the importance of considering the family environment when examining university students' suicidal ideation. Understanding family-related suicidal ideation risk factors can help to predict and prevent suicides among university students.

AB This study explored urban-rural variations in the magnitude and patterns of fatal injuries in South Africa. The National Injury Mortality Surveillance System was utilised to select South African mortality cases for the 2007 period and a cross-sectional methodology was employed in order to comparatively analyse injury mortality rates in the urban province of Gauteng and the rural province of Mpumalanga. The results reveal several differences in urban-rural injury trends across the two South African provinces. Overall, homicide and unintentional (non-transport) injury death rates were significantly higher in the urban province (40.28/100,000 versus 28.48/100,000; (RR = 1.41 [1.32-1.51]) and 18.30/100,000 versus 13.19/100,000; (RR = 1.39 [1.25-1.54]), respectively), whilst transport-related injury mortality rates were significantly higher in the rural province (66.57/100,000 versus 45.83/100,000; (RR = 0.69 [0.66-0.71])). Such results could be attributed to economical, environmental, and infrastructural differences between urban-rural locations and suggest that injury control strategies could be better targeted to the needs of specific geographic populations in South Africa.

AB IntroductionThe study was designed to assess the association of gay-related stressful events (GRSEs) and emotional distress with suicidal behaviors over a 12-month period in Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM).
   MethodsA total of 807 MSM were recruited using a respondent-driven sampling method from 4 cities in northeastern China. The GRSEs were measured using the Gay-related Stressful Life Events Scale, depression using the Self-rating Depression Scale, and anxiety using the Self-rating Anxiety Scale.
   ResultsA total of 26.0% of study participants experienced GRSEs during the 3months, and their average Self-rating Depression Scale and Self-rating Anxiety Scale scores were significantly lower than the national norms. Over a 12-month period, the prevalence of suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt was 9.7%, 4.0%, and 3.0%, respectively, each of which is at least 3 to 4 times greater than that of male adults in the general population of China. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that GRSEs significantly increased the risk of suicidal ideation (odds ratio [OR]=2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-3.7) and plan (OR=2.8, 95% CI, 1.3-6.0). Depressive symptoms significantly increased the risk of suicidal ideation (OR=3.5, 95% CI, 2.1-5.8), plan (OR=4.4, 95% CI, 2.0-9.6), and attempt (OR=5.6, 95% CI, 21.94.8). Anxiety symptoms (OR=3.4, 95% CI, 1.4-8.4) and cohabitation with a same sex partner (OR=3.0, 95% CI, 1.2-7.9) significantly increased the risk of suicide attempt.
   DiscussionMore efforts to reduce GRSE are worth investigating as a strategy to reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors in Chinese MSM.

AB Background: The paper reviews alcohol consumption patterns and alcohol-related social and health issues among 15-29-year old young people in Asian countries, and discusses strategies for preventing and controlling alcohol use and related harms.
   Methods: We searched Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science for reports, reviews and journal articles published in English between 1st Jan 1990 and 31st August 2016.
   Results: Forty-one reports, reviews and journal papers were identified and included in the final review. The current drinking levels and prevalence among young people are markedly different between eight included Asian countries, ranging from 4.2% in Malaysia to 49.3% in China. In a majority of the selected Asian countries, over 15% of total deaths among young men and 6% among young women aged 15-29 years are attributable to alcohol use. Alcohol use among young people is associated with a number of harms, including stress, family violence, injuries, suicide, and sexual and other risky behaviours. Alcohol policies, such as controlling sales, social supply and marketing, setting up/raising a legal drinking age, adding health warning labels on alcohol containers, and developing a surveillance system to monitor drinking pattern and risky drinking behaviour, could be potential means to reduce harmful use of alcohol and related harm among young people in Asia.
   Conclusions: The review reveals that drinking patterns and behaviours vary across eight selected Asian countries due to culture, policies and regional variations. The research evidence holds substantial policy implications for harm reduction on alcohol drinking among young people in Asian countries - especially for China, which has almost no alcohol control policies at present.

AB Objectives: To identify risk factors, and their interactions, for suicidal ideation among the elderly in rural communities of Hunan and to provide some scientific basis for suicide prevention.
   Design, setting and participants: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among the elderly in rural communities in China's Hunan Province. Thirteen areas were selected by multi-staged cluster random sampling, and 1887 rural elders were investigated via face-to-face interviews.
   Main outcome measures: Measures included sociodemographic information, suicidal ideation, activities of daily living (ADL), major depression disorder (MDD), drinking, stressful life events and social support. Non-conditional logistic regression was preformed to explore the influencing factors for suicidal ideation, and additive interaction was used to analyse the interaction between risk factors.
   Results: Incidence of suicidal ideation among the elderly was 14.5% (95% CI 12.9% to 16.1%) in rural communities of Hunan. The independent influencing factors for suicidal ideation were annual personal income (OR 3.14; 95% CI 2.15 to 4.59), MDD (OR 17.04; 95% CI 11.91 to 24.39), chronic diseases (OR 2.99; 95% CI 1.84 to 4.85) and ADL (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.37 to 2.94). Additive interactions were detected between MDD and ADL with a relative excess risk of interaction (RERI) of 21.18 (95% CI 5.47 to 36.89), and between MDD and annual personal income with an RERI of 35.00 (95% CI 9.00 to 61.00).
   Conclusions: The independent risk factors for suicidal ideation are annual personal income (<= 2200 CNY), MDD, chronic diseases and disabled ADL status. MDD has additive interactions with ADL and annual personal income. These findings have significant implications for the prediction and prevention of suicidal behaviours.

AB Background: There is a growing body of research investigating adolescent risk behaviors in China, however, a comprehensive measure that evaluates the full spectrum of relevant risk behaviors is lacking. In order to address this important gap, the current study sought to develop and validate a comprehensive tool: the Health-Risk Behavior Inventory for Chinese Adolescents (HBICA).
   Methods: Adolescents, ages 14-19 years (n = 6,633), were recruited from high schools across 10 cities in mainland China. In addition, a clinical sample, which included 326 adolescents meeting DSM-IV criteria for Conduct Disorder, was used to evaluate predictive validity of the HBICA. Psychometric properties including internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha), test-retest reliability, convergent validity, and predictive validity were analyzed.
   Results: Based upon item analysis and exploratory factor analysis, we retained 33 items, and 5 factors explained 51.75% of the total variance: Suicide and Self-Injurious Behaviors (SS), Aggression and Violence (AV), Rule Breaking (RB), Substance Use (SU), and Unprotected Sex (US). Cronbach's alphas were good, from 0.77 (RB) to 0.86 (US) for boys, and from 0.74 (SD) to 0.83(SS) for girls. The 8 weeks test-retest reliabilities were moderate, ranged from 0.66 (AV) to 0.76 (SD). External validities was strong, with Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 was 0.35 (p < 0.01), and with aggressive behavior and rule-breaking behavior subscales of the Youth Self Report were 0.54 (p < 0.01) and 0.68 (p < 0.01), respectively. Predictive validity analysis also provided enough discriminantity, which can distinguish high risky individual effectively (cohen' d = 0.79 - 2.96).
   Conclusions: These results provide initial support for the reliability and validity of the Health-Risk Behavior Inventory for Chinese Adolescents (HBICA) as a comprehensive and developmentally appropriate assessment instrument for risk behaviors in Chinese adolescents.

AB Knowing the specific pattern of forensic toxicology cases in a region is vital to help the local government establish an effective prevention and treatment system; currently, there have been no published reports investigating various types of forensic toxicology cases based on a large autopsy series and city size. The data in this study were obtained from records kept at the Academy of Forensic Science (AFS) between February 2017 and December 2017, and the cases were mainly from the Public Security Organs People's Police in Shanghai, China. There were 299 autopsies; the leading cause of death was traffic accidents (37.1%), and the manners of death were mainly accidental (54.8%). From a total of 9083 cases, 1992 involved traffic accidents, 6787 were drug abuse, 269 were poisonings, and 35 were drug-facilitated sexual assaults (DFSAs). We also investigated the pattern of unnatural deaths and the alcohol-positive (with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) >= 0.20 mg/ml) rate among the various cases. The BAC ranged from 0.08 to 7.24 mg/ml in traffic cases, and the mean BAC of the total alcohol-positive drivers was 1.44 mg/ml. It was found that 80.8% of the drivers involved had a BAC >= 0.20 mg/ml (limit of civil offense), and 72.8% had a BAC >= 0.80 mg/ml (limit of criminal offense). Among the drug abuse cases, there were 4073 cases (60.0%) that were positive for at least one euphoriant; the most frequently abused drug group was amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS). Poisonings by natural toxins (such as scopolamine and tetrodotoxin) account for a significant portion of accidental deaths. Pesticide poisoning was also constituted a large portion, and organophosphorus were the cause of the majority of those cases. Suicide by pesticide showed the highest frequency in the present study. Among the 35 DFSA cases, dexmedetomidine was frequently detected in our study, which has rarely been reported previously in DFSA cases. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study explored the magnitude and clinical correlates of anxiety in three groups of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD): those with comorbid anxiety disorders (the COM group), those with subthreshold core anxiety disorder symptoms that are the screening items for anxiety disorders on the MINI (the SUB group), and those with neither anxiety disorders nor subthreshold core anxiety disorder symptoms (the NON group). Anxiety symptomatology of 1052 patients from 8 psychiatric settings in mainland China, who met DSM-IV TR criteria for MDD, was assessed using the MINI. The presence of core anxiety symptoms was determined by patient endorsement of any screening item of panic disorder, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, or generalized anxiety disorder. The prevalences of comorbid subthreshold core anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders were 13% and 28.7%, respectively. The SUB and COM cases showed similar patterns of clinical presentation. Both were more likely than the NON cases to be characterized by younger age, concurrent dysthymia and OCD, suicidal ideation and attempted suicides. These findings highlight the importance of assessing both anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders in the presence of MDD, and suggest the need for novel assessments capable of addressing different levels of anxiety in depressed patients.

AB Background: The role of physical symptoms on suicidal ideation in adolescents is incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to discover the potential physical symptoms predictors for suicidal ideation in college freshmen.
   Methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in a randomly selected freshmen population in Wuhan China (N = 2449). Questionnaire evaluated suicidal ideation as well as related psychosocial risks and gastrointestinal (GI) physical symptoms. The association between the suicidal ideation and potential predictors was analyzed by Mann-Whitney test and multiple logistic regression analysis.
   Results: A total of 2053 (83.8%) completed this survey and 64 (3.1%) was reported to have suicidal ideation. Anxiety (OR 5.44(2.40-12.35)), depression (OR 8.36(3.90-17.94)) and chronic abdominal discomfort (OR 2.06(1.07-3.94)) were independent predictors for suicidal ideation. In freshmen with chronic abdominal discomfort, interestingly, defecation disorder(P = 0.01) and low satisfaction of defecation (P = 0.04) was associated with high risk for suicidal ideation.
   Conclusion: Defecation disorders were associated with high risk of suicidal intention in young adult with chronic abdominal discomfort. Our result implied that clinicians should be vigilant for suicidal ideation in chronic abdominal discomfort patients, especially those with defecation disorders.

AB In order to obtain up-to-date information on the pattern of severe acute poisoning and the characteristics and outcomes of these patients, 265 consecutive patients admitted to an intensive care unit in Hong Kong for acute poisoning from January 2000 to May 2008 were studied retrospectively. Benzodiazepine (25.3%), alcohol (23%), tricyclic antidepressant (17.4%), and carbon monoxide (15.1%) were the four commonest poisons encountered. Impaired consciousness was common and intubation was required in 67.9% of admissions, with a median duration of mechanical ventilation of less than 1 day. The overall mortality was 3.0%. Among the 257 survivors, the median lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and acute hospital (excluding days spent in psychiatric ward and convalescent hospital) were less than 1 day and 3 days, respectively. Factors associated with a longer length of stay included age of 65 or older, presence of comorbidity, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 25 or greater, and development of shock, rhabdomyolysis, and aspiration pneumonia, while alcohol intoxication was associated with a shorter stay. This is the largest study of its kind in the Chinese population and provided information on the pattern of severe acute poisoning requiring intensive care admission and the outcomes of the patients concerned.

AB We present four cases that use entomological data to estimate postmortem interval (PMI). In the first case, the body was found in an outdoor environment at 26 degrees C and was at the fresh stage. However, the PMImin estimated using maggots collected from the corpse was more than 68 h. This was certainly an incorrect estimation because the degree of the body decomposition was light, and it may have been caused by flies invading the corpse before death occurred. In the second case, a corpse of an adult male was found in a semi-closed room, and the body was highly decomposed and mummified. In this case, we used Dermestes maculatus DeGeer (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) to successfully estimate the PMI. The third case involved a female body discovered in her room after she committed suicide by consuming excessive clozapine and alcohol. The PMImin estimated through entomological data did not match the time of death that the other evidence indicated. Thus, we speculated that clozapine and alcohol may have influenced the development of fly larvae. The fourth case occurred in the winter. The murderer killed the victim and burned and dumped the corpse. However, the burned body still attracted necrophagous insects and we successfully calculated the PMImin by using insect evidence.

DE pesticides; poisoning; risk factors; self-harm; Sri Lanka
ID SUICIDE; RATES; CHINA
AB This report describes the characteristics of patients with acute pesticide poisoning in a rural area of Sri Lanka and, for intentional self-poisoning cases, explores the relative importance of the different determinants. Data were collected for 239 acute pesticide-poisoning cases, which were admitted to two rural hospitals in Sri Lanka. Sociodemographic characteristics, negative life events and agricultural practices of the intentional self-poisoning cases were compared with a control group. Most cases occurred among young adults and the large majority (84%) was because of intentional self-poisoning. Case fatality was 18% with extremely high case fatality for poisoning with the insecticide endosulfan and the herbicide paraquat. Cases were generally younger than controls, of lower educational status and were more often unemployed. No agricultural risk factors were found but a family history of pesticide poisoning and having ended an emotional relationship in the past year was clearly associated with intentional self-poisoning. The presence of mental disorders could only be assessed for a subsample of the cases and controls and this showed that alcohol dependence was a risk factor. This study shows that acute pesticide poisoning in Sri Lanka is determined by a combination of sociodemographic and psychological factors. Suggestions are given for interventions that could control the morbidity and mortality due to acute pesticide poisoning in developing countries.

AB Illness representations play a significant role on mental health across various health conditions. The present study explores the associations between illness representations of HIV and mental health (suicidal ideation and depression), and the mediation effects of emotional representations on the associations between cognitive representations and mental health among men who have sex with men who were newly diagnosed with HIV (ND-MSM) in China. A total of 225 ND-MSM were recruited from a non-governmental organisation and were invited to complete a cross-sectional survey. Results showed that 48.0% had suicidal ideation since HIV diagnosis and 48.4% scored higher than the cut-off for mild depression or above. Stepwise regression analyses showed that higher levels of emotional representations of HIV and lower levels of treatment control were associated with both suicidal ideation and depression. Emotional representations were shown to mediate the associations between some cognitive representations variables and mental health. Findings suggest that both cognitive and emotional representations of HIV were important factors of mental health among ND-MSM. Interventions to promote the mental health of ND-MSM are warranted and should seek to improve their cognitive and emotional representations of HIV.

AB Suicide rates are higher at high altitudes, and some hypothesize that hypoxia is the cause. There may be a significant correlation between rates of depression and altitude, but little data exist outside the United States. The purpose of the present study is to conduct a survey of depression among the elderly highlanders in Asia. We enrolled 114 persons aged 60 years or older (mean, 69.2 +/- A 6.7 years; women, 58.8 %) in Domkhar (altitude, 3800 m), Ladakh, India and 173 ethnic Tibetans (mean, 66.5 +/- A 6.1 years; women, 61.3 %) in Yushu (altitude, 3700 m), Qinghai Province, China. The two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and the geriatric depression scale were administered. A psychiatrist interviewed the subjects who had a positive score on the PHQ-2. The results of the interview with the residents conducted by the specialist showed that two cases (1.8 %) from Domkhar and four (2.3 %) from Qinghai had depression. Despite the high altitude, the probability of depression was low in elderly highlander in Ladakh and Qinghai. Our finding seems to indicate that cultural factors such as religious outlook and social/family relationship inhibit the development of depression.

AB Background: Depression is a mood disorder that may lead to severe outcomes including mental breakdown, self-injury, and suicide. Potential causes of depression include genetic, sociocultural, and individual-level factors. However, public understandings of depression guided by a complex interplay of media and other societal discourses might not be congruent with the scientific knowledge. Misunderstandings of depression can lead to under-treatment and stigmatization of depression. Against this backdrop, this study aims to achieve a holistic understanding of the patterns and dynamics in discourses about depression from various information sources in China by looking at related posts on social media.
   Method: A content analysis was conducted with 902 posts about depression randomly selected within a three-year period (2014 to 2016) on the mainstream social media platform in China, Sina Weibo. Posts were analyzed with a focus on attributions of and solutions to depression, attitudes towards depression, and efficacy indicated by the posts across various information sources.
   Results: Results suggested that depression was most often attributed to individual-level factors. Across all the sources, individual-level attributions were often adopted by state-owned media whereas health and academic experts and organizations most often mentioned biological causes of depression. Citizen journalists and unofficial social groups tended to make societal-level attributions. Overall, traditional media posts suggested the lowest efficacy in coping with depression and the most severe negative outcomes as compared with other sources.
   Conclusions: The dominance of individual-level attributions and solutions regarding depression on Chinese social media on one hand manifests the public's limited understanding of depression and on the other hand, may further constrain adoption of scientific explanations about depression and exacerbate stigmatization towards depressed individuals. Mass media's posts centered on description of severe outcomes of depression without suggestions of solutions' effectiveness, which may induce more anxiety among depressed individuals. Campaigns promoting comprehensive understandings about depression and popular works translating scientific findings on depression to the public are called for.

AB Doctors constitute the main workforce in hospitals and are known to experience occupational stress. High level of stress is believed to affect doctors' physical and mental health. Thus, it is essential to study doctors' occupational stress well to improve their quality of lives. The aim of this study was to explore factors associated with occupational stress among Chinese doctors in public hospitals.
   A cross-sectional study was conducted during the period of May/June 2008. The study population comprised 1989 doctors registered and working in the 20 national hospitals in Liaoning province, China. A questionnaire pertaining to occupational stress that was assessed based on the Chinese Version Personal Strain Questionnaire (PSQ), demographic characteristics, work situations, occupational roles, and personal resources was distributed to these doctors. A total of 1,587 effective respondents (673 men, 914 women) became our subjects (effective response rate 79.8%). The general linear model (GLM) was employed to explore the factors related to occupational stress. All data analysis was performed separately in men and women.
   The average PSQ score was 86.92 in the total study population, 89.4 in men and 85.1 in women among Chinese doctors. GLM showed that PSQ was significantly associated with, in standard estimate (beta) sequence, role boundary, role insufficiency, responsibility, social support, rational/cognitive coping, doctor-patient relationship and role overload in men; whereas with role insufficiency, role boundary, social support, responsibility, self-care, role overload, education, chronic disease, and doctor-patient relationship in women.
   These results indicate that the major factors associated with occupational stress differed between male and female doctors in China. Overall, role boundary and role insufficient were the most crucial factors in male and female doctors, respectively. Therefore, occupational health education and occupational training programs with the purpose to improve doctor's knowledge and ability to copy with their task should be considered to lessen occupational stress among Chinese doctors.

AB Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a recurrent, complex illness and often misdiagnosed and treated as a major depressive disorder (MDD). This study set out (1) to investigate the proportion of BD in patients treated for MDD using DSM-IV diagnostic criteria; (2) to test the usefulness of the screening tool the - 32-item Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32) in Chinese patients; and (3) to assess whether MDD patients with subthreshold manic features (patients who screened positive for BD on the HCL-32, but did not meet the diagnostic criteria for DSM-IV BD as measured by Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)) differ from those with BD, and from those suffering from MDD without manic features in terms of basic demographic and clinical variables.
   Methods: A total of 1487 patients treated for MDD were consecutively examined in 13 mental health centers in China. The patients' socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded using a standardized protocol and data collection procedure. The HCL-32 was self-completed by patients to identify hypomanic symptoms, and the MINI was used by clinicians to establish DSM-IV diagnoses.
   Results: The proportions of undiagnosed BD (all types), BD-I and BD-II were 20.8%, 7.9% and 12.8%, respectively. The HCL-32 had low positive predictive value (0.43). Compared to MDD patients without subthreshold manic features, MDD patients with subthreshold manic features were younger at onset, less likely to be married and had more depressive episodes on a seasonal basis, and more frequent depressive episodes overall. Compared to BD patients, MDD patients with subthreshold manic features had an older age at onset and less frequent depressive episodes and less family history of psychiatric disorders, appetite, weight gain and time spent sleeping, suicide ideation and attempts and psychotic symptoms.
   Conclusions: At least one fifth of Chinese patients treated for MDD may have an undiagnosed BD. The HCL-32 is useful to identify broader subthreshold bipolar features. The findings need to be confirmed by longitudinal studies using more comprehensive, standardized instruments. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID RISK-FACTORS; ADOLESCENTS; SUICIDE; SAMPLE; HARM
AB Background: This study investigated the nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) presentation and the features of coping methods among college students, in addition to analyzing the factors that influence self-injury behavior.
   Methods: From April to November 2016, 2,520 undergraduate students who were studying in some colleges in Anhui Province in China were surveyed using the Self-Injury Behavioral Survey Questionnaire and the Coping Styles Questionnaire (CSQ).
   Results: The detection rate of self-injury behavior among college students was 13.73%. Frequent Internet use and smoking were associated with self-injury behavior (P < 0.05). There were statistically significant differences between the self-injury group and the non-self-injury group in terms of the coping methods of problem solving, self-reproach, help-seeking, and illusions (P < 0.01). According to the logistic regression analysis of the students, their place of origin, mother's education, family finances, family type, family relationships, gender, frequent Internet use, and smoking were associated with self-injury behavior (P< 0.01). Self-reproach and withdrawal were risk factors for self-injury behavior while problem-solving and rationalization were protective factors for self-injury behavior.
   Conclusion: Students who frequently use the Internet and smoke are more prone to self-injury. College students' choices of problem-solving and rational coping styles in the face of pressure are conducive to preventing nonsuicidal self-injury.

AB Objective: This is an epidemiological study to determine the prevalence of suicidal behavior and its association with generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) in a nationally representative sample.
   Method: Suicidal ideation, plans and attempts were assessed in face-to-face interviews of respondents selected by a multistage probability sampling using items on suicidality from the WHO SUPRE-MISS questionnaire. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used to generate DSM-IV diagnoses of GAD and MDD. A total of 19309 subjects were studied. Multivariate regression analysis was conducted controlling for demographic characteristics such as age, gender and ethnicity.
   Results: The prevalence estimates for suicide ideation, plans and attempts were 1.7% (95% CI: 1.4-1.9), 0.9% (CI: 0.7-1.1) and 0.5% (CI: 0.4-0.7) respectively. Younger people (16-24 years) had higher risk of suicidal behavior (OR: 2.6, CI: 1.08-6.2). Females (OR: 1.6, CI: 1.2-2.1) and Indians (OR: 3.3, I: 2.2-4.9) also had higher risk.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of suicidal behavior in Malaysia is low, but it broadly corresponds to the pattern described in other countries. This national study confirms that Malaysians of Indian descent have much higher rates of suicidal behavior than other groups. The younger age group, females and the Indian ethnic group would need focused preventive efforts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the common malignant tumors in China. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are the main therapy methods for NPC. To enhance the specific antitumor effect, a novel vector with radiosensitivity and tumor specificity was constructed in this study, which enables the reduction of dosage of radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs due to its double killing effect. Four DNA elements, Egr-1 promoter, Cytosine deaminase (CD) gene, hTERT promoter, Survivin antisense oligonucleotides were amplified and constructed in pcDNA3.1 vector. CD and Survivin gene expression in CNE2 cells were detected by RT-PCR. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed to determine the transformation from the prodrugs 5-FC to 5-FU. Hoechst33258 staining of the nuclei and methylthiazolyl tetrazolium(MTT) assay were applied to detect apoptosis and cell survivability, respectively. In addition, the anti-tumor effects were examined in vivo by injecting cells with different vectors into nude mice. Our results revealed a notable killing effect of combined treatment with 5-FC and radiation on CNE-2 cells transfected with vectors in vitro. This effect was especially notable on pEC-TS transferred cells, which showed 57% of cells were killed. In vivo, an obvious suppression of tumor was displayed in pEC-TS group, which was significantly different from other groups (p < 0.05). Consequently, this expression cassette may have a great therapeutic potential for the treatment of NPC.

AB Introduction and Aim: Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite infecting approximately 30% of the global human population. It has often been suggested that chronic infection with T. gondii is related to personality changes and various mental disorders including depression. It is not known whether this includes post-partum blues or depression. In this study, we test the hypothesis that there is a relationship between T. gondii infection and post-partum blues by measuring the association between infection and postpartum blues.
   Methods: A total of 475 Chinese women who have just given birth were detected serology for Toxoplasma IgG and IgM antibodies, and evaluated the degree of depression by Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) score. Data were analyzed by Chi-square or Fisher's Exact tests using SPSS software.
   Results: We found an overall Toxoplasma seroprevalence of 5.68% (27/475; 95% CI: 3.59-7.77) which was broken down into a prevalence of 6.60% (7/106; 95% CI: 1.80-11.41) in mothers with post-partum blues and 5.42% (20/369; 95% CI: 3.10-7.74) in non-affected mothers. There was no significant association between infection and post-partum blues (p= 0.64).
   Conclusion: The results suggest that there is no relationship between T. gondii infection and postpartum blues, at least in this sample of patients from China.

AB OBJECTIVE Warangal district in Andhra Pradesh, southern India, records > 1000 pesticide poisoning cases each year and hundreds of deaths. We aimed to describe their frequency and distribution, and to assess quality of management and subsequent outcomes from pesticide poisoning in one large hospital in the district.
   METHODS We reviewed data on all patients admitted with pesticide poisoning to a district government hospital for the years 1997 to 2002. For 2002, details of the particular pesticide ingested and management were abstracted from the medical files.
   FINDINGS During these 6 years, 8040 patients were admitted to the hospital with pesticide poisoning. The overall case fatality ratio was 22.6%. More detailed data from 2002 revealed that two-thirds of the patients were < 30 years old, 57% were male and 96% had intentionally poisoned themselves. Two compounds, monocrotophos and endosulfan, accounted for the majority of deaths with known pesticides in 2002. Low fixed-dose regimens were used in the majority of cases for the most commonly used antidotes (atropine and pralidoxime). Inappropriate antidotes were also used in some patients.
   CONCLUSIONS It is likely that these findings reflect the situation in many rural hospitals of the Asia Pacific region. Even without an increase in resources, there appear to be significant opportunities for reducing mortality by better medical management and further restrictions on the most toxic pesticides.

AB The migration makes an influence on children's mental health and behaviors. However, the majority of studies investigate the families and people in migration rather than left-behind groups in their home countries. OBJECTIVE: to assess the possible impact of parents' migration on emotional and behavioral problems of their left-behind children. The study comprised 10-19-year-old adolescents from five urban secondary schools (n = 1292). The cross-sectional study was conducted in Kaunas city (Lithuania). Main measures were self-reported scales - Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) as well as items on subjective perceptions and feelings towards the change of relationship with a missing parent due to migration or divorce. Findings show that left-behind children report more risky behaviors and emotional problems, they tend more to feel unloved (OR = 2.34, p < 0.05), longing for missing parent (OR = 4.72, p < 0.05), contemplating suicide or self-injuring behavior (OR = 3.92, p < 0.05). Emotional and behavioral problems are more prevalent among 15-19-year-old male adolescents (OR = 1.71, p < 0.05). The left-behind children report more emotional and behavioral problems compared to the children from divorced families. The findings suggest that parental migration has specific negative effects on left-behind children's emotional state and behaviors.

AB The Chinese population is aging rapidly while both the pension systemis underdeveloped and the traditional family care arrangement is in retreat. This article's objective is to assess the relationship between concerns over retirement saving sufficiency and the mental health status of middle-aged and older Chinese adults, and identify the socioeconomic and demographic profile of those with insufficient retirement savings. A survey from about 2000 respondents collected information on self-assessed physical and mental health status based on the EQ-5D-5L framework, self-assessed longevity, retirement plans and financial preparedness and socioeconomic status. Multivariate ordered logistic regressions are used to identify the relationship between mental health status, financial preparedness for retirement and self-assessed longevity, as well as socioeconomic factors associated with mental health status and financial preparedness for retirement respectively. It is found that 59% of the respondents thought that they have not saved, or will not be able to save enough for their retirement. For these people, the odds of having less anxiety or depression are 0.36 ( 95% CIs: 0.16-0.43) times lower than those who are financially prepared. Havingmore external sources of financial assistance including family and governments, did not help ease mental distress. Rural people are half as likely to be financially prepared for retirement, regardless of whether they remain in rural areas or migrate to cities. Health promotion strategies should consider the role for financial planning in improvingmental health.

AB Corporate social responsibility (CSR) refers to the responsibilities of the enterprises in their commercial operations. A corporation in the society should be responsible for its various stakeholders. However, some of them do not practiced very well especially in developing countries. For example, Foxconn, one of largest electronic OEM manufacturer in the world, would not begin to pay attention to the working and living conditions of its workers until more than ten suicides within three months happened in Shenzhen. This is all because the corporations lack of CSR perception and ignore the interests of their workers. In this paper, according to the stakeholder theory of CSR, we try to figure out what Foxconn should do to perform social responsibility better, and what the government should do to avoid similar tragedies. We analyze the government roles on promoting corporation to practice CSR in two aspects: the stakeholders and the life-cycle framework. While the local governments concern economic revenues of corporations, they should pay more attention to ethical aspect of CSR like working condition. Meanwhile, what the responsibility of government must be taken in different life-circle stages. Moreover, this paper discusses the causes of local government failure in this event and suggests local government should change the ways of thinking like encouraging firm to build the labor union. Only in this way can it play a key role to avoid the similar tragedies.

AB Background: In Cambodia, there has been an increase in entertainment work as a result of the breakdown of the traditional brothel-based sex industry, presenting new challenges to addressing the health issues and needs of people working in the entertainment industry. This study aims to identify factors associated with psychological distress among female entertainment workers (FEWs) in Cambodia.
   Methods: A two-stage cluster sampling method was used to randomly select 657 FEWs from entertainment establishments in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap in April and May 2014 for interviews using a structured questionnaire. Psychological distress was measured using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted.
   Results: Almost half of FEWs (43.2 %) had a higher level of psychological distress (GHQ-12 > 3), while 19.5 % reported having suicidal thoughts, and 7.3 % reported having attempted to commit suicide in the past 3 months. Controlling for confounding factors, women with a higher level of psychological distress were significantly more likely to rate their overall health (AOR = 1.88, 95 % CI 1.20 to 2.94) and quality of life (AOR = 2.39, 95 % CI 1.47 to 3.87) as poor. They were also significantly more likely to have suicidal ideation (AOR = 2.41, 95 % CI 1.45 to 3.76), rate their HIV risk as higher than the general population (AOR = 0.48, 95 % CI 0.31 to 0.74), have been forced to drink at work (AOR = 1.77, 95 % CI 1.19 to 2.62), have had clients requesting not to use a condom (AOR = 3.48, 95 % CI 1.14 to 10.62), be not able to find condoms when they needed it (AOR = 0.64, 95 % CI 0.45 to 0.93), have had a family member who said hurtful things to them during childhood (AOR = 1.84, 95 % CI 1.24 to 2.75), and have had a parent or guardian who had been physically abused (AOR = 1.93, 95 % CI 1.34 to 2.82).
   Conclusions: FEWs in Cambodia experience high levels of psychological distress, which likely stems from both past negative experiences and current working conditions. For women that are experiencing psychological distress, intervention programs aimed at improving mental health should specifically address substance use, condom availability and negotiation skills, and suicide risk.

AB Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death among men who have sex with men (MSM) and suicidal ideation may put individuals at higher risk of suicide. A great disparity of lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation among MSM was observed across studies, indicating the importance of a reliable estimation of the pooled lifetime prevalence. However, the only one published meta-analysis estimating the pooled lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation among MSM was conducted in 2008 with only 2 eligible studies. Subsequently, there was a rapid increase of publications about lifetime suicidal ideation among MSM, suggesting that an update on the pooled lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation among MSM was necessary. Therefore, this study aimed to update the estimation of the pooled lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation among MSM.
   Methods: Electronic databases of PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus (social science), Embase and PsycInfo were searched until September 2017 to identify relevant studies. Cross-sectional studies exploring the lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation among MSM were enrolled. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the Cochran Q test and quantified using the I-2 statistic. The possibility of publication bias was assessed using both Begg's rank test and Egger's linear test, and an Egger's funnel plot for asymmetry was presented. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the geographic area, sample source and HIV status.
   Results: Nineteen studies with a total of 26,667 MSM were included, of which 9374 were identified with suicidal ideation. A high degree of heterogeneity (P = 0.001, I-2 = 99.2%) was observed among the eligible studies, with the reported prevalence ranging from 13.18 to 55.80%. The pooled lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation among MSM by a random effects model was 34.97% (95% confidence interval: 28.35%-41.90%). Both the Begg's rank test and Egger's linear test indicated low possibility of publication bias. Subgroup analyses showed that the lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation among MSM differed significantly by geographic area, sample source and HIV status (P< 0.05).
   Conclusions: The high pooled lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation among MSM found in this meta-analysis significantly underscores the importance of early assessment of suicidal ideation among MSM, as well as the need for strengthening the psychological interventions.

AB We aimed to explore the relationships and develop an inter-theoretical model among psychological variables in the progression to suicidal ideation among men who have sex with men (MSM). A cross-sectional study was conducted among 547 MSM in four districts in Shanghai from March to May in 2014. Socio-demographic, psychological, and behavioral information of the participants was collected. A structural equation model (SEM)-Path Analysis was constructed to interpret the intricate relationships among various psychological variables. Suicidal ideation among MSM during the past year was 10.6%. The developed model agreed well with existing suicide models and had a good fit to the data (chi(2)/df = 2.497, comparative fit index = 0.983, root mean squared error of approximation = 0.052). Suicidal ideation was predicted by perceived defeat and entrapment (beta = 0.21, p < 0.001), which was in turn predicted by temperament (beta = 0.60, p < 0.001) and perceived social support (beta = 0.34, p < 0.001). Perceived social support fully mediated the relationships among mood states, perceived social status, and perceived defeat and entrapment. MSM with certain types of temperament might be predisposed to a higher perception of defeat and entrapment. Perceived social support can effectively alleviate the negative appraisals and emotions and lower the risk for suicidal ideation among MSM. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB ObjectiveThis study aims to define the characteristics of adolescents who have engaged in self-harm behavior and ascertain the risk factors.
   MethodsFrom January 2013 to January 2014, 4,176 adolescents from senior middle schools in Linyi, China, were administered four questionnaire surveys to ascertain the following: incidence of self-harm behavior regarding the frequency of different self-harm behaviors by group (never/one to five times/greater than five times in the last 6months) and then comparing the self-harm behavior of the different subgroups; symptom self-check, comparing the differences between the adolescents with self-harm behavior and without in nine subscales (somatization, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, fear, paranoid, and psychosis); Adolescent Self-Rating Life Events Check List scores; and Egna Minnenav Barndoms Uppfostran (EMBU) scores. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors of self-harm in adolescents.
   ResultsThe incidence of adolescent self-harm was 27.60%; the occurrence of adolescent self-harm was closely related to their mental health status, stressful life events, and EMBU. Being female, an urban student, or an only child; having poor school performance or experiences of stressful life events, harsh parenting styles, or excessive interference; and poor mental health were the risk factors for adolescent self-harm.
   ConclusionsThe incidence of adolescent self-harm was high, and their mental health status, stressful life events, and EMBU affected the occurrence of adolescent self-harm, which is an issue that needs greater attention.

AB Psychiatric disability is a population health problem, and understanding its magnitude is essential to informing population health policies. This paper aims to describe the prevalence rates, causes, and severity of psychiatric disability in Chinese adults, and to explore daily activities and social functions for people with psychiatric disability. We used the second China National Sample Survey on Disability, comprising 2,526,145 persons from 771,797 households. Identification and classification for psychiatric disability was based on consensus manuals. We used standard weighting procedures to construct sample weights considering the multistage stratified cluster sampling survey scheme. Population weighted prevalence and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were evaluated. An estimate of 8 million adults with psychiatric disability was identified. The weighted prevalence rate of psychiatric disability was 8.14 per 1000 people (95% CI, 7.95-8.33). More rural residents suffered from psychiatric disability than their urban counterparts, and more females had psychiatric disability than males. Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders accounted for more than half of the psychiatric disability in Chinese adults. People with psychiatric disability had more severe difficulties in most daily activities and social functions than in people with other disabilities. This study demonstrates psychiatric disability causes social burden to the Chinese communities. Strategies including case identification, treatment, and rehabilitation should be developed and countermeasures are warranted for females and rural residents to reduce the burden caused by psychiatric disability.

AB Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is an important porcine and human zoonotic pathogen. Few virulence factors have been identified and the pathogenesis of infection is not fully understood. We have identified a novel virulence-related gene, virA, of S. suis 2. To investigate its role in pathogenesis. a virA deletion mutant of S. suis 2 wild-type strain ZY458, 458 Delta vir, was constructed using suicide vector pSET4s, and a functionally complemented strain 458 Delta vir(pvir) was constructed using shuttle plasmid pAT18 containing the virA gene. All rabbits infected with ZY458 and 458 Delta vir(pvir) exhibited body weight loss and developed severe clinical symptoms. All 5 rabbits infected with ZY458, and 4 of 5 infected with 458 Delta vir (pvir), died within 6 days of infection. In contrast, all 5 rabbits inoculated with 458 Delta vir gained weight normally and none developed any clinical symptoms during the entire course monitored. These results indicate that virA plays an important role in the pathogenicity of S. suis serotype 2. To investigate the virA gene further, we compared and analyzed the sequences of virA from wild-type virulent and avirulent strains. Results showed that functional virA appears to exist only in virulent strains and has been structurally mutated in avirulent strains. In conclusion, virA gene is a novel identified virulence-relate gene. It may play a key role in the evolution and pathogenicity of S. suis serotype 2. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a new way of recycling aluminum and iron in boiler slag derived from coal combustion plants for the production of a sulfate-based complex coagulant containing ferric sulfate and aluminum sulfate. The boiler slag sample was determined for more complete characterization by means of scanning electron microscopy(SEM), X-ray diffraction(XRD), X-ray fluorescence(XRF) and other techniques. An analysis for the boiler slag sample collected from Baotou Steel Plant located in Inner Mongolia, PR China showed that the quantity of iron and aluminum oxides, in general, accounted for about 35% of the boiler slag. XRD analysis indicates that predominate minerals such as kaolinite, quartz, calcium suicide, hematate and metakoalin exist in this boiler slag. This boiler salg was evaluated to determine the efficiency of converting the iron and aluminum components of the material into a sulfate-based complex coagulant when heated with sulfuric acid at different temperatures and reaction times. The maximum concentrations of Fe3+ and Al3+ in the complex coagulant prepared from the boiler slag were obtained at 130 degrees C and after 3 h of reaction time. These concentrations were 0.04 M Fe3+ and 0.46 M Al3+, respectively. The corresponding conversion efficiencies of aluminum and iron were 66.2 and 95.0% in the boiler slag, respectively. Finally, the prepared sulfate-based complex coagulant proved to be an effective agent for reducing the turbidity and chemical oxygen demand(COD) of a typical domestic sewage sample.

ID RECEPTOR SUBTYPES; PLASMA
AB Diphenidol hydrochloride (DPN), a nonphenothiazinic antiemetic agent used primarily in patients with Meniere disease and labyrinthopathies to treat vomiting and vertigo, is considered to be a relatively safe drug. Since it was first approved in the United States in 1967, this drug has been widely used in Latin America and Asia and has contributed to sporadic suicidal and accidental poisonings in mainland China and Taiwan. However, its toxic or lethal concentration ranges have not yet been determined. We report a case of a 23-year-old female who suffered from DPN poisoning that resulted in death. At autopsy, there were no typical pathological findings, except for cerebral edema with high acetylcholinesterase expression. Postmortem analysis of DPN revealed 45 A mu g/ml in heart blood, 39 A mu g/ml in femoral vein blood, 141 A mu g/g in the liver, and 53 mg in the gastric contents. These concentrations indicated that the cause of death was DPN poisoning. The circumstances indicated that the manner of death was suicide. We also present a retrospective study, in which we review and summarize the literature from 1998 to 2014 and describe 16 cases of poisoning, including information from autopsy reports and postmortem drug concentrations. In forensic practice, drug residues at the scene, patients with convulsions and disturbance of consciousness, and rapidly occurring deaths, should draw attention to the possibility of this drug. Toxicological analysis and the exclusion of other diseases may ultimately be used to confirm DPN poisoning.

AB Background/Aims
   The role of psychosocial factors on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in adolescents is incompletely understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between the psychosocial factors and the risk of developing IBS in college freshmen.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a randomly selected freshmen population in Wuhan China (n = 2449). Questionnaire evaluated demographics and psychosocial risks. The population was divided into 3 groups: non-discomfort, chronic abdominal discomfort and IBS. The association between the development of IBS and psychosocial factors was analyzed by ordinal and multiple logistic regression analysis.
   Results
   A total of 2053 (83.8%) completed this survey (mean age, 18.2 +/- 0.9 years; female, 35.6%). Among them, 82 (4.0%) fulfilled the Rome III criteria for IBS. Female (odds ratio [OR], 3.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.47-4.45), experience of abuse (OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.10-5.56), and suicidal intention (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.15-4.17) were more likely to have IBS. Compared with chronic abdominal discomfort, however, depression (OR, 5.55; 95% CI, 1.36-22.71) was the only dependent risk factor for IBS.
   Conclusion
   The prevalence of IBS in college freshmen is 4.0%, and to the freshmen, psychosocial factors such as experience of abuse, depression, and suicidal intention were associated with high risk of developing IBS.

AB Background. Despite substantial research, uncertainty remains about the clinical and etiological heterogeneity of major depression (MD). Can meaningful and valid subtypes be identified and would they be stable cross-culturally?
   Method. Symptoms at their lifetime worst depressive episode were assessed at structured psychiatric interview in 6008 women of Han Chinese descent, age >= 30 years, with recurrent DSM-IV MD. Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed in Mplus.
   Results. Using the nine DSM-IV MD symptomatic A criteria, the 14 disaggregated DSM-IV criteria and all independently assessed depressive symptoms (n=27), the best LCA model identified respectively three, four and six classes. A severe and non-suicidal class was seen in all solutions, as was a mild/moderate subtype. An atypical class emerged once bidirectional neurovegetative symptoms were included. The non-suicidal class demonstrated low levels of worthlessness/guilt and hopelessness. Patterns of co-morbidity, family history, personality, environmental precipitants, recurrence and body mass index (BMI) differed meaningfully across subtypes, with the atypical class standing out as particularly distinct.
   Conclusions. MD is a clinically complex syndrome with several detectable subtypes with distinct clinical and demographic correlates. Three subtypes were most consistently identified in our analyses: severe, atypical and non-suicidal. Severe and atypical MD have been identified in multiple prior studies in samples of European ethnicity. Our non-suicidal subtype, with low levels of guilt and hopelessness, may represent a pathoplastic variant reflecting Chinese cultural influences.

ID RISK-FACTORS; DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES; CHINESE CHILDREN; ENURESIS;

AB Background: Nocturnal enuresis and delayed attainment of nocturnal bladder control are associated with increased risk for psychopathology in children and adolescents. It has long been known that psychopathology is a major risk factor for youth suicide. However, no studies have examined the association between the age of attainment of nocturnal bladder control and adolescent suicidal behavior.
   Methods: A community sample of 1920 adolescents aged 11-16 years from one prefecture of mainland China participated in the study. Parents completed a structured questionnaire including adolescents' developmental history, suicidal behavior, depressive symptoms, aggressive behavior, and family environment.
   Results: Multivariate logistic regression models indicated that attaining nocturnal bladder control after 3 years was significantly associated with increased risk for adolescent suicidal behavior, after controlling for a number of child and family covariates. A dose-response relationship between the age of attaining nocturnal bladder control and suicidal behavior was observed (OR = 2.1 for children attaining bladder control at 3-4 years and OR = 3.6 for children attaining bladder control at 5 years or later). Mediating models indicated that depression and aggressive behavior mediated, at least in part, the effect of delayed nocturnal bladder control on suicidal behavior.
   Limitations: This is retrospective Study. Suicidal behaviors were reported by parents.
   Conclusions: Delayed nocturnal bladder control may be an earlier neurodevelopmental predictor of youth suicidal behavior. Further research is suggested to explore earlier neurodevelopmental risk factors and potential mechanisms of youth suicidal behavior. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB According to Fanny Law Fan Chiu-fun, the former Permanent Secretary for Education and Manpower, the most significant education policy in recent years in Hong Kong was undoubtedly the new academic structure commonly known as "334." As schools, universities, and the community at large seemed to accept the new academic structure in principle, the areas of contention would mostly lie in the timing and details. Sparked by the suicides of two teachers, a wave of unprecedented protests and opposition against the government's education policy followed, which led to the departure of the former Permanent Secretary for Education and Manpower Fanny Law Fan Chiu-fun and the Secretary for Education and Manpower Arthur Li Kwok- cheung from the education portfolio. This situation suggests that something was wrong with the teachers' working environment. This article aims to make sense of these discursive events through a critical discourse analysis of the "334" education policy with materials taken from documents, speeches, and press releases published by the government as well as newspaper articles drawn from South China Morning Post, which is a rich source of contested ideas. An eclectic approach is drawn from both "state-centered" and "policy cycle" perspectives synthesized and adopted for this article. Upon this contested terrain in which individual policy actors struggle to achieve the desired political outcomes, the intention of this article is to explore how the state and other interest groups acted, reacted, and interacted in the policy processes of the 334 Education Reform.

AB This research aimed to estimate the effect of perceived social factors in the community stress and problems on the residents' psychopathology such as depression and suicidal behaviors.
   Subjects of this study were the informants (N = 1618) in a psychological autopsy (PA) study with a case control design. We interviewed two informants (a family member and a close friend) for 392 suicides and 416 living controls, which came from 16 rural counties randomly selected from three provinces of China.
   Community stress and problems were measured by the WHO SUPRE-MISS scale. Depression was measured by CES-D scale, and suicidal behavior was assessed by NCS-R scale.
   Multivariable liner and logistic regression models and the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were applied to probe the correlation of the depression and the suicidal behaviors with some major demographic variables as covariates.
   It was found that community stress and problems were directly associated with rural Chinese residents' depression (Path coefficient = 0.127, P < 0.001). There was no direct correlation between community stress and problem and suicidal behaviors, but community stress and problem can affect suicidal behaviors indirectly through depression. The path coefficient between depression and suicidal behaviors was 0.975. The current study predicts a new research viewpoint, that is, the depression is the intermediate between community stress and problem and suicidal behaviors. It might be an effective route to prevent depression directly and suicidal behaviors indirectly by reducing the community stress and problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Psychiatry has been considered as one of the most stressful medical specialities, and psychiatrists are likely to experience impaired health-related quality of life (HRQOL). However, few studies are available in regard to related factors of HRQOL among psychiatrists in China. This study aims to evaluate the condition of HRQOL of psychiatrists and explore its predictive factors, especially the effects of occupational stress and psychological capital.
   Methods: A cross-sectional, multicenter survey was conducted among psychiatrists from different regions of Liaoning province, China, during August 2013-April 2014. Self-administrated questionnaires including the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Chinese version Psychological Capital Questionnaire, effort-reward-imbalance (ERI) scale and participants' basic characteristics were distributed to 500 psychiatrists from 10 psychiatric hospitals of 8 major cities in Liaoning province. Overall, 373 psychiatrists became our final research objects. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis (HMR) was performed to explore the predictors of psychiatrists' HRQOL.
   Results: The mean (SD) scores of PCS and MCS among psychiatrists were 79.78 (16.55) and 71.50 (19.24) respectively. The mean (SD) of ERR were 0.777 (0.493), and 89 (23.9%) had ERR scores above 1 (ERR > 1). Hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that, psychiatrists' basic characteristics that significant correlated with PCS and MCS were educational level, turnover intention, and exercise; age, weekly working hours were associated with MCS; psychiatrists' experienced occupational stress (both ERR and overcommitment), and PsyCap were significant predictors for PCS and MCS.
   Conclusions: Chinese psychiatrists experienced relatively good physical QOL but impaired mental QOL, and they experienced high level of occupational stress. For the sake of psychiatrists' HRQOL, the reduction of occupational stress should be implemented. The enhancement of PsyCap could be a new intervention strategy and should be paid attention to in improving HRQOL of psychiatrists. Proportionate occupational reward (money, esteem, career opportunities) to their high work demands, psychological counseling, and stress management courses should be provided to psychiatrists to improve their QOL. PsyCap, as a personal coping resource open to change, should be managed and developed among psychiatrists.

AB Background: The prevention of suicidal ideation plays a key role in reducing suicide rates. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of suicidal ideation among college students in Jilin Province, China, and to analyse the risk factors associated with suicidal ideation.
   Methods: A total of 6284 valid data collection sheets were collected using the stratified cluster sampling method. The data collected were divided into four sections, namely, socio-demographic information, family and social interactions, daily habits, and mental health self-rating scales.
   Results: The prevalence of suicidal ideation in the past 12 months was 9.2%. A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that being a senior (OR = 1.769, 95% CI: 1.225-2.555), general family relationships (OR = 1.641, 95% CI: 1.172-2.298), frequent parental quarrels (OR = 1.398, 95% CI: 1.027-1.902)/parental separation (OR = 2.497, 95% CI: 1.414-4.408), the level of satisfaction with motherly love (OR = 2.261, 95% CI: 1.454-3.515), having only one or two friend(s) (OR = 1.530, 95% CI: 1.038-2.254), frequent excursions to bars/karaoke halls/song and dance halls (OR = 1.673, 95% CI: 1.257-2.229) or billiard halls with friends (OR = 1.865, 95% CI: 1.270-2.740), smoking (OR = 2.175, 95% CI: 1.603-2.951), moderate sleep quality (OR = 1.636, 95% CI: 1.115-2.402), and depressive symptoms (OR = 2.078, 95% CI: 1.710-2.525) were risk factors for suicidal ideation. Family factors had the most influence on suicidal ideation, whereas depression symptoms were identified to be a mediating factor between family, social interactions, or daily habits and suicidal ideation, and it only exerted direct effects.
   Limitations: This cross-sectional study cannot provide causal interpretations.
   Conclusion: Our findings showed the prevalence of suicidal ideation among college students in Jilin province. Among all the risk factors associated with suicidal ideation, family factors should be the main concern in the prevention of suicidal ideation, and interventions that target depression symptoms are key to reducing suicidal ideation.

AB Few longitudinal studies have examined the psychological symptoms that may lead to non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among Chinese adolescents and young adults. This study determined the predictive effects of psychological symptoms for NSSI during a 9-month follow-up period.
   Data from 17,622 students, 12-24 years of age, were analyzed in a cross-sectional fashion with respect to associations between psychological symptoms and NSSI. Follow-up surveys were performed 3, 6, and 9 months later. Incident cases of NSSI during follow-up were correlated with the psychological symptoms at baseline.
   A total of 3,001 (17.0 %) students reported that they had NSSI in the 12 months before the initial assessment. The total rate of NSSI revealed no statistically significant differences by gender, but marked differences between grades. The response rate 3, 6, and 9 months later was 91.8, 81.8, and 79.1 %, respectively. Our cross-sectional study demonstrated statistically significant associations between emotional problems, conduct problems, social adaptation problems, psychological problems, and NSSI (P < 0.01). In the longitudinal study, emotional problems, conduct problems, social adaptation problems, and psychological problems at baseline had statistically significant associations with incident NSSI in follow-up involving the adolescents, while the association in young adults was attenuated after adjustment for confounding variables. Moreover, psychological symptoms at baseline showed a monotonic dose-response relationship with NSSI in follow-up involving adolescents.
   The findings suggest that adolescents with psychological symptoms are a group with elevated risks for later NSSI. The prevention programs of NSSI should target attenuating the severity of psychological symptoms.

AB The ICD-10 is widely used in Japanese clinical and other mental health services settings. Since the publication of the Japanese translation, the most significant event was the renaming of the term schizophrenia in Japanese in 2002. In addition, the Japanese term equivalent to dementia was changed to a supposedly less stigmatizing term in 2006. The renamed versions are now widely accepted by both clinicians and patients and their families.
   In addition to the renaming movement, what is notable as part of psychiatry in Japan is the clinical research projects that are being performed, including neuroimaging and molecular studies. Situations about suicide in Japan, which is one of the biggest problems in the mental health field with the number of victims exceeding 30,000 since 1998, are also discussed.
   Concerning contributions to the ICD revision process, the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology (JSPN) organized the ICD committee under the Committee of International Affairs, and the committee has held a meeting every 4 months. In addition, the JSPN organized the ICD-11 committee which collaborates with the Japanese Society for Psychiatric Diagnosis, consisting of subgroups for F1 - F9 category and a comprehensive group. The ICD-11 committee is reviewing all proposals, and will submit particularly relevant opinions for the revision process of the ICD-10.
   Finally, concerning use of the ICD-10 and DSM-IV in Asian countries, the survey showed that psychiatrists in China and Japan routinely use the ICD-10, while the DSM-IV was dominant in Korea and Taiwan. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Given the differences between general high school (GHS) and vocational high school (VHS) students, this study aimed to investigate the lifetime prevalence of non-medical use of prescription pain relievers (NMUPPR) among high school students as well as the associations between NMUPPR and individual-level factors and school category.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in GHS and VHS students in 2012 in Chongqing, and 11 906 students' questionnaires were completed and qualified for the survey. Self-reported NMUPPR and information regarding individual-level determinants and school category were collected. A multilevel multivariate logistic regression model was fitted to explore independent predictors of NMUPPR.
   Results: The total lifetime prevalence of NMUPPR was 11.3%, and NMUPPR was more prevalent among VHS students (15.8%) compared with GHS students (9.8%). Overall, the results indicated that VHS students were more likely to be involved in NMUPPR (adjusted OR (AOR)=1.64, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.89). Regarding the individual-level predictors of NMUPPR, below-average family economic status was negatively correlated with NMUPPR (AOR=0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.98), and students with more pocket money were more likely to be engaged in NMUPPR. Students who had difficult family relationships, had poor relationships with teachers, had parents or friends who engaged in non-medical prescription drug use, and considered or attempted suicide were more likely to be engaged in NMUPPR.
   Conclusions: NMUPPR among high school students is a multidetermined phenomenon. The current findings indicate that VHS students are an important subgroup of adolescents and highlight the need for additional research as well as targeted prevention and intervention programmes for NMUPPR.

AB Background: To date, there have been no studies examining non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in Chinese heroin dependent patients (HDPs) receiving methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). This study determined the prevalence of NSSI and its methods in HDPs under MMT as well as factors significantly associated with NSSI.
   Method: We recruited a cross-sectional sample of 652 HDPs from three MMT clinics in Wuhan, China. In total, 603 HDPs (92.5%) completed standardized questionnaires concerning demographic, clinical, and psychosocial data. The presence and methods of NSSI were assessed with two standardized questions.
   Results: The one-month prevalence of NSSI in Chinese HDPs receiving MMT was 13.8%. The most common three methods of NSSI were burning (59%), cutting (19.3%), and hitting (9.6%). Significant factors associated with NSSI in multiple logistic regression analysis were unemployment (OR [95%CI] = 2.54 [1.26, 5.10], P = 0.009), a short duration of MMT (OR [95%CI] = 1.04 [1.01, 1.09], P = 0.034), pain (OR [95%CI] = 2.31 [1.05, 5.35], P = 0.028), depression (OR [95%CI] = 4.32 [2.09, 9.00], P < 0.001), anxiety (OR [95%CI] = 3.74 [1.61, 8.70], P = 0.002), and loneliness (OR [95%CI] = 3.04 [1.27, 7.26], P = 0.012).
   Conclusions: NSSI is common among Chinese HDPs of MMT clinics. Services for HDPs in MMT settings should include periodic screening for NSSI, adequate pain treatment, and appropriate psychosocial treatment for depression, anxiety, and loneliness.

AB Background: Years of education are inversely related to the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD), but the relationship between the clinical features of MDD and educational status is poorly understood. We investigated this in 1970 Chinese women with recurrent MDD identified in a clinical setting.
   Methods: Clinical and demographic features were obtained from 1970 Han Chinese women with DSM-IV major depression between 30 and 60 years of age across China. Analysis of linear, logistic and multiple logistic regression models were used to determine the association between educational level and clinical features of MDD.
   Results: Subjects with more years of education are more likely to have MDD, with an odds ratio of 1.14 for those with more than ten years. Low educational status is not associated with an increase in the number of episodes, nor with increased rates of co-morbidity with anxiety disorders. Education impacts differentially on the symptoms of depression: lower educational attainment is associated with more biological symptoms and increased suicidal ideation and plans to commit suicide.
   Limitations: Findings may not generalize to males or to other patient populations. Since the threshold for treatment seeking differs as a function of education there may an ascertainment bias in the sample.
   Conclusions: The relationship between symptoms of MDD and educational status in Chinese women is unexpectedly complex. Our findings are inconsistent with the simple hypothesis from European and US reports that low levels of educational attainment increase the risk and severity of MDD. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB In Remnants of Auschwitz: The Witness and the Archive, Agamben develops a subtle analysis of the irreducible ambiguity inherent to the verb "to survive." "From the beginning," writes Agamben, "the verb also has a reflexive form when referred to human beings, which designates the striking idea of survival with respect to oneself and one's own life. In this form, the one who survives and the person to whom something survives thus coincide" (132). Strangely enough, it is exactly what is at stake in the performance around which Wang Xiaoshuai's movie Frozen (1996) revolves. Qi Lei puts into work his own suicide, letting everybody believe that he is actually dead; everybody but the curator of the exhibit, who will take care of the artist's secret "survival," and Qi Lei's sister, who, as a doctor, signs a false death certificate. Therefore, technically, the movie displays an artist who has survived performatively to himself. How to interpret the remnants of this performance? What has happened, what has "passed," what has been lost in this passage between life and death? What does this movie tell us about life-that-continues after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre and China's entrance into the global economy? Showing the precarious condition of a small Beijing performance art community, Wang Xiaoshuai's Frozen offers a convincing and well-informed allegory of the aftermaths of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, as well as an interesting glance at what has become one of the most dynamic sectors of Chinese underground culture of the end of the 20th century and beyond.

AB Suicidal ideation is considered to be the first step on the pathway to suicide. Despite the fact that suicidal ideation is surprisingly prevalent among preadolescent children in China and elsewhere, and despite its possible increase during the transition into adolescence, its developmental patterns and predictors during this period are unclear, thus precluding a meaningful understanding of its determinants and possible trajectories. Thus, this study aimed to identify suicidal ideation trajectories and multisystemic predictors covering the transition from middle childhood to early adolescence. A total of 715 Chinese elementary school students (M-age = 8.95, SD = 0.71; 54.5% was male) participated in assessments at six time points, using six-month assessment intervals. Growth mixture modeling analyses extracted three distinct trajectories of suicidal ideation: "low-stable" (86.4%), "moderate-increasing" (7.1%) and "high-start" (6.5%). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that social anxiety and academic anxiety served as risk factors for the adverse developmental trajectories of suicidal ideation; whereas self-esteem, life satisfaction, and academic achievement served as protective factors for the positive developmental trajectory of suicidal ideation. The identification of three subgroups with unique predictors highlights the importance of individual difference considerations in understanding the progression of suicidal ideation in childhood and adolescence and the need for specific programs tailored to the unique characteristics of the relevant trajectories. Furthermore, given that suicidal ideation may start in a proportion of middle childhood youths and continue into adolescence, the middle childhood period should provide an important window of opportunity for large-scale screening and prevention of the escalation of suicidality in adolescence.

AB Background: Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is common among medical students, but may have some serious consequences. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and correlates of EDS among the medical students of Hunan Province, China. The correlation between EDS and suicidal ideation in our participants was also explored.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was employed among 4882 students from three medical schools in Hunan Province. Each student completed a survey on demographic variables, daytime sleepiness (Epworth sleepiness scale), anxiety (Self-Rating Anxiety Scale), depression (Self-Rating Depression Scale), and suicidal behaviors. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the risk factors for EDS among all participants and suicidal behaviors among those with EDS.
   Results: Overall, the prevalence of EDS in this population was 24.6%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that being female, alcohol consumption, a history of physical disorder, body mass index, anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation were independent correlates for EDS. Moreover, the prevalence of suicidal ideation among EDS participants was 38.6%, variables such as physical disorder history, age, anxiety, or depression were independently associated with suicidal ideation.
   Limitations: No causal relationships could be established as this was a cross-sectional study. Recall biases might exist due to the utilization of self-reported measurements. Moreover, participants were primarily female medical students (89%,4345/4882).
   Conclusion: EDS is very common among medical students. Special attention should be paid to students with EDS, especially when risks for suicidal ideation are particularly high among this population. These data are valuable for healthcare professionals in assessing the risks of suicide among participants with EDS.

AB Background: Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time an organism is expected to live. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of injury-related mortality on life expectancy in Zhejiang Province.
   Methods: Our study used standard life tables to calculate life expectancy and cause-removed life expectancy based on mortality data from the Zhejiang Chronic Disease Surveillance System.
   Results: Life expectancy of residents in Zhejiang was 77.83 years in 2013, with females having a higher life expectancy than males. The decrease in life expectancy caused by injury-related deaths was 1.19 years, the effect of which was reduced for females and urban residents compared with males and rural residents. The greatest impact on life expectancy was road traffic injuries (RTIs), (0.29 years lost overall, 0.36 for men vs. 0.21 for women and 0. 26 for urban residents vs. 0.31 for rural residents). The main causes were falls (0.29 years lost overall, 0.30 for men vs. 0.28 for women and 0.28 for urban residents vs. 0.30 for rural residents), followed by drowning (0.15 years lost), suicide (0.11 years lost), and poisoning (0.04 years). For children less than 5 years old and elders aged over 65, drowning had a greater impact than falls.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that injury deaths had a major impact on life expectancy in Zhejiang. More attention should be paid to road traffic injury, and preventive action should be taken to reduce injury-related deaths to increase life expectancy, especially in children under five years of age and the elders over 65 years of age.

AB Over the past century, the dominant model for addressing mental illness has been the treatment of individuals, largely by individual therapists who assume the availability of individual psychological resources. That form of therapy is a scarce commodity in capitalist societies, and social models of healing have been largely marginalized and forgotten. From the point of view of an indigenous psychology of religion, this essay (1) reports on local cultural and community models of healing that honor the common good, draw on local, communal narratives, and involve a given community in the process of healing. However, because it is not simply community in itself that is therapeutic, the authors argue (2) that healing cultures have communities that are guided by their moral vision and are committed to justice, moral integrity, and the sharing of resources. They draw on intergenerational studies that detail the effects in Inuit communities where a moral vision and a sense of community was present but then was eroded. Therapists whose interventions draw on the moral resources of the community may facilitate healing, as demonstrated by the use of allocentric imaging in more communal traditions. Finally, it is not simply communities with moral ideals that are therapeutic but (3) indigenous communities whose structures and whose role models embody their ethic that is critical for healing. The authors examine ecological communities in China committed to Confucian values and protection of the earth. The L'Arche communities begun in France by Jean Vanier and Alcoholics Anonymous groups around the world serve as examples of embodied moral communities.

AB Although the ideal body, which consistently appears in the revolutionary manifestos, transformative movements, and artworks, plays an important role in imagining a Utopian humanity of modern China, it proves to be impossible because of the destructive acceleration and fragmentation of the questionable local modernity. Probing into the last Chinese horror film before the Sino-Japan War, I would explore the strategies that artists experimented with to manifest, memorize, and mask the perceptive discomfort aroused by the deformed city and corporality. A nice young man from a roving theatrical troupe is identified by a disfigured artist-revolutionist as his ideal friend who shares the same objet petit a in the struggle for a brighter future. Set against the complicated social condition as well as the consumption culture, Song at Midnight articulates the conflicting discourses and the cinematic technologies to encapsulate the traumatic experiences. The monstrous hero, who lives in a fiercely expressionist world, calls himself "a historian suffering from the excruciation" that hints being deprived of any sexual interaction with his lover, a psychopath expelled by her wealthy and tyrannic father. Eventually, the healthy and handsome actor becomes the incarnation of Song who commits suicide, while the dandy vitriol-throws and inhumanly murders. Virilio quotes Renoir's remarks that the war "subverts the proper experience of sex and death." (2009, p. 28) As a reference to both the social and the psychological disorders, the film stirs and releases the public obsession with subjective purity. The wounded won't quiet, keeping the two approaches to produce prosthesis embodied in the occupational shift of Lu Xun in suspense. The deceased will "sits up in his tomb, saying 'when I turn to ashes, you will see me smile.'"(Lu Xun, 2003, p.82)

AB Recent studies have revealed a high rate of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) behavior in Chinese students, but quantitative syntheses of pooled prevalence are sparse. There have been several NSSI prevalence meta-analyses in other populations. However, given the existence of cultural diversity, racial difference, educational system difference and so on, these results may not be ideal for Chinese populations. Furthermore, the above-mentioned meta-analyses did not include Chinese database which may have led to unintentional bias. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of NSSI in Chinese middle-school students.
   The databases searched included PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CBM (Chinese database), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data (Chinese database) and the Weipu database (Chinese database). The search terms included: self-injury/self-harm/self-abuse/nonsuicidal self-injury/deliberate self-harm, adolescen*/youth/teen/students, and China/Chinese. All relevant articles published between January 2000 to November 2017, in either Chinese or English, were included. Two investigators were engaged in this process, and any disagreements were settled by a third investigator. A random effects model was then used to calculate the pooled prevalence.
   A total of 420 studies with 160,348 participants were retrieved. The pooled prevalence was 22.37% (95% CI: 18.84%-25.70%). Substantial heterogeneity in prevalence estimates was revealed. Subgroup analyses showed that the pooled estimate of prevalence of life time NSSI was 14.5% (95% CI: 0.06%-22.7%), and 6-24 months NSSI was23.3% (95% CI: 20.5%-26.1%).
   The prevalence for males was 20.6% (95% CI: 16.1%-25.0%), and for females was 21.9% (95% CI: 17.6%-26.2%). The prevalence of NSSI in Chinese middle-school students is relatively high. More attention should be paid to the current situation.

AB Background: Although occupational stress is an identified predictor of depressive symptoms, the mechanism behind the association is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to examine how psychological capital (PsyCap), a positive psychological state, mediates the association between occupational stress and depressive symptoms among Chinese physicians.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Liaoning Province, China, during September-October 2010. Self-administered questionnaires including items on depressive symptoms assessed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, occupational stress assessed by the effort-reward imbalance scale and PsyCap estimated by a 24-item Psychological Capital Questionnaire, together with age, gender, marital status and education were distributed to 1300 physicians employed in large general hospitals. The final sample consisted of 998 participants. Asymptotic and resampling strategies were used to examine how PsyCap mediates the association between occupational stress and depressive symptoms.
   Results: Both the effort/reward ratio (ERR) and overcommitment were significantly associated with depressive symptoms among male and female physicians. There was a gender difference in the mediating role of PsyCap on the occupational stress-depressive symptoms association. For male physicians, PsyCap did not mediate the association between occupational stress and depressive symptoms. For female physicians, ERR and overcommitment were negatively associated with PsyCap, and PsyCap was negatively associated with depressive symptoms. As a result, PsyCap significantly mediated the associations of ERR and overcommitment with depressive symptoms. The proportion of PsyCap mediation was 19.07% for ERR, and 24.29% for overcommitment.
   Conclusions: PsyCap could be a positive resource for combating depressive symptoms in Chinese physicians. In addition to reducing occupational stress, PsyCap development should be included in depression prevention and treatment strategies, especially for female physicians.

AB Background: Most epidemiological studies on adolescent survivors' mental health have been conducted within 2 years after the disaster. Longer-term psychological consequences remain unclear. This study explored psychological symptoms in secondary school students who were living in Sichuan province 6 years after the Wenchuan earthquake.
   Methods: A secondary data analysis was performed on data from a final survey of survivors conducted 6 years after the Wenchuan earthquake as part of the five-year mental health and psychosocial support project. A total of 2641 participants were divided into three groups, according to the level of traumatic experience exposure during the earthquake (0, 1, and 2 or more). ANCOVA was used to compare the mean scores of the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) among the three groups, adjusting for covariates such as age, gender, ethnicity, having a sibling, parents' divorce, and socio-economic status. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify relationships between the traumatic experiences and suicidality after the disaster.
   Results: Having two or more kinds of traumatic experiences was associated with higher psychological symptom scores on the SCL-90 (Cohen's d=0.23-033) and suicidal ideation (OR 1.98, 95% Cls:1.35-2.89) and attempts (OR 3.32, 95% Cls:1.65-6.68), as compared with having no traumatic experience.
   Limitations: Causality cannot be inferred from this cross-sectional survey, and results may not generalize to other populations due to convenience sampling.
   Conclusions: Severely traumatized adolescent survivors of the earthquake may suffer from psychological symptoms even 6 years after the disaster. Long-term psychological support will be needed for these individuals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the early hours of November 30, 1905, Min Yonghwan took his own life in protest against the Japan-Korea Protectorate Treaty that had been forced on the Korean cabinet in the wake of Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) thus ended the career of an elite member of Korea's Confucian ruling class, who had unique experience in dealing with foreign diplomatic officials due to his two visits to the West in 1896 and 1897. Four years later An Chunggun, a convert to Roman Catholicism, was hung for the assassination of Ito Hirobumi, the Japanese statesman responsible for the protectorate treaty This article examines the ideas of these two men as expressed in their writings, namely, Min's policy essay Ch'onilch'aek (One policy out of one thousand) and other pieces from his collected works Min Ch'ungjonggong yugo (Posthumous works of Min Yonghwan), which were not inherently antagonistic to the Western powers other than Russia and focused primarily on exposing the aggressive intentions of Japan, and An's treatise, Tongyang p'yonghwaron (A treatise on peace in the East), which viewed the West as posing a common threat to China, Japan and Korea that required a collective response based on racial solidarity and the mutual recognition of each state's sovereignty and independence. The article will also examine their ideas in the context of Western views of the region as well as the responses of Western commentators to their final acts of protest.'

TI Successful Treatment of Paraquat Poisoning by <i>Xuebijing</i>, an
   Injection Concocted from Multiple Chinese Medicinal Herbs: A Case Report
SO JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID TOXICITY
AB Background and objectives: 1,1'-Dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium dichloride (Paraquat) poisoning remains a significant global health problem. Despite noteworthy research and clinical efforts worldwide in the last few decades, little improvement has been made in reducing fatality from Paraquat poisoning with conventional treatment strategies. We herein report a case of successful management of Paraquat poisoning by Xuebijing, a newly developed injection concocted from multiple traditional Chinese medicinal herbs.
   Settings/location, subjects, and interventions: A 25-year-old male patient was brought to the Emergency Department at the First Affiliated Hospital of Jilin University in Changchun, China approximately 23 hours after ingestion of approximately 50 mL of 20% (w/v) Paraquat in a suicide attempt. On admission, the patient presented with clinical symptoms as well as significantly abnormal results in the liver and kidney function tests that were typical of severe Paraquat poisoning. Following the routine emergency procedures for pesticide poisoning to minimize the poison exposure and relieve the poisoning symptoms, an intravenous drip of Xuebijing together with dexamethasone was given daily to the patient until discharge 10 days after admission. The patient was followed up for 15 months after discharge, during which monthly chest radiography was performed.
   Treatment outcomes: At the time of discharge, the patient had recovered well: His symptoms of poisoning in the mouth and gastrointestinal tract were all diminishing; his liver and kidney functions were recovering with the major test parameters improving; his chest radiograph was clear, showing no signs of pulmonary fibrosis. During the postdischarge follow-up period, the monthly chest radiographs were all normal.
   Conclusions: This case report suggests that Xuebijing has great potential as a novel effective alternative to the conventional management of Paraquat poisoning. This potential needs to be further evaluated in a substantially larger number of clinical cases in the future.

   THREATS; EMPIRE; POLICY; CHINA
AB There are millions of Americans who are systematically forgotten and mistreated by our government. They have been described by the Supreme Court as "alien races" and "utterly unfit for American citizenship," but they continue to fight and die defending our Constitution. They survive catastrophic storms, but do not receive the assistance that is freely given to other Americans. They are subject to federal laws and regulations, but have no meaningful voice or vote in Washington. They are the millions of Americans in Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands-the unincorporated territories of the United States.
   This Article is about these forgotten Americans, their longstanding political plight, and the pragmatic legal policies that could improve their lives and make them fully and equally American. It begins by providing a brief overview of each territory. Next, it investigates the plight of the territories, focusing on how interconnected factors relating to political powerlessness, economic dependence, military presence, and geographic isolation have created heavy burdens for people in the territories. Moving from problems to solutions, this Article examines past efforts to aid the territories. In particular, it analyzes past pursuits of litigation, statehood, and independence. It explains why these prior paths did not lead to progress, and discloses critical obstacles that continue to obstruct these routes. Finally, this Article proposes three workable ways for the federal government to assist the territories in the near term. Specifically, it argues that the territories and their supporters should focus on working with the federal government to obtain: (1) an extended temporary waiver of the costly maritime law known as the Jones Act, (2) most-favored state status in federal veterans and disaster relief appropriations, and (3) special economic empowerment zone designations. Ultimately, this Article aspires to offer a new, workable roadmap for policymakers to think and act with greater urgency about the forgotten Americans of our territories.

AB Background: Suicide risk is greatly increased in depression. Detection of those at risk is clinically important. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and identify independent risk factors associated with suicidal ideation (SI) in a widespread symptomatology within and outside DSM framework.
   Methods: This study was part of the National Survey on Symptomatology of Depression (NSSD) which was designed to investigate the magnitude of symptoms of current major depressive episode in China. Stepwise multivariable logistic regression was performed to examine the independent risk factors for SI, including variables that are statistically significant in univariate analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was used to evaluate the performance of the regression model.
   Results: A total of 3275 patients (1293 males and 1982 females) were included in our analysis. Of these, 1750 patients (53.4%) had SI. Independent risk predictors included crying (P = 0.000; odds ratio = 1.827), helplessness (P = 0.000; odds ratio = 1.514), worthlessness (P = 0.001; odds ratio = 1.359), hopelessness (P = 0.000; odds ratio = 1.805), unusually restless (P = 0.005; odds ratio = 1.276), self-harm (P = 0.000; odds ratio = 3.385), mood-incongruent psychosis (P = 0.000; odds ratio = 2.782), feeling losing control of oneself (P = 0.009; odds ratio = 1.352), hypersomnia (P = 0.000; odds ratio = 1.805), sensory system complaints (P = 0.000; odds ratio = 1.546), derealization (P = 0.006; odds ratio = 1.580), guilt (P = 0.002; odds ratio = 1.332), suicidal attempts (P = 0.000; odds ratio = 2.841), male gender (P = 0.001; odds ratio = 0.756), the total course of depression (P = 0.010; odds ratio = 1.003) in the regression model. In addition, the areas under the curve of the ROC and the accuracy for the regression model were 0.80 and 0.76, respectively.
   Conclusions: This study provided an effective risk model for SI in MDD and indicated that all these factors in our model allow better the employment of preventative measures.

DE High-stakes test; Consequential validity
AB Many educational systems use official examinations in order to certify competencies that have been developed or knowledge that has been acquired at the end of a programme or course of study. These exams avec often considered as high-stakes tests because of the impact they may have on the future of the examinees. Results become factors of social promotion as they give access to some educational programmes or better jobs. At the individual level, the implementation of these tests may result in high anxiety and encourage strategies such as cramming. At the social level, they reflect relations between groups and reinforce particular values.
   The concept of high-stakes test does not apply only to certification situations. In fact, different mode of learning assessment may have major consequences depending on the cultural environment in which they take place. We see, for example, that comparable tests have a different impact when they are administered in Asia rather than America. Some examples of high-stakes tests in the Eastern world and the Western world raise issues with regard of consequential validity - this concept being defined as the interaction between the stakeholders, the purpose, and the context.
   High-stake tests are recent in Europe and America. However, in China, the Keju system used high-stakes tests as early as 606. Under the Ming dynasty, a Keju syndrome emerged with anxiety, depression or even suicide; it is still persistent in many countries of Asia. In Nepal, a strict national exam system has been set in place. In 2015, the Government decided to eliminate the passing note, thus reducing dramatically the negative consequences. Our research aims at clarifying the rationale for such a reform and analyse the impact of moving from a must pass exam to a no fail exam the stakeholders and the curriculum.
   We observe that the negative consequences that are associated with a test are in fact related to its use and vary according to the cultural and social environment. It is important to envision the consequential validity from an ecological perspective.

AB Background: Paraquat (PQ) poisoning is one of the leading causes of suicide attempts in China signature by acute onset of respiratory distress with massive matrix production resulting in progressive pulmonary fibrosis. There is no specific antidote and mortality remains high without effective treatment available. The cellular mechanisms underlying PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis remain largely unknown.
   Objectives: To determine the origin of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) migrated to the lung after PQ exposure and their roles in PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis, to further explore the possible mechanisms involved in these processes, and to help finding novel therapies.
   Methods: We used a combination of lineage tracking techniques to investigate the contributions of several cells of MSCs, marked by Nestin or CXCL12, and traced their co-expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), a marker for fibrosis, or their co-location with matrix production, marked by collagen-1 production (Col1-GFP) following PQ exposure. Then, we used a CXCL12flox/flox; Prx1-Cre mice and a pharmacologic agent AMD3100 to selectively deplete chemotactic mechanism of the MSCs, and tested pro-fibrotic pathways, fibrotic processes and survival of mice after PQ exposure.
   Results: Our results showed that after paraquat exposure, the residential Nestin + MSCs were quickly expanded and contributed to extracellular matrix production. Moreover, when we used a CXCL12flox/flox; Prx1-Cre mice to selectively deplete chemotactic mechanism of the MSC, we found that PQ exposure in these mice failed to activate pro-fibrotic pathways including TGF-beta, Wnt and EGFR signaling. Furthermore, when the chemotactic effect of MSCs via CXCL12 was blocked by a pharmacologic agent, AMD3100, it alleviated the development of the fibrotic process and improved survival rate in mice exposed to PQ.
   Conclusion: Collectively, our data suggest paraquat intoxication rapidly activated Nestin + MSCs and that blocking chemotactic effects of MSCs by perivascular CXCL12 inhibition may effectively protect pulmonary injury following paraquat exposure. Our results revealed a novel mechanism for post-PQ lung injury and indicated a novel therapeutic option to attenuate fibrosis induced by paraquat.

AB Objectives:
   Local workforces play a critical role in disaster relief and reconstruction. However, the mental health of local relief workers might be affected by disasters, threatening the sustainability of local workforces. In this study, we tried to address this concern by investigating the well-being of local relief workers and its association with suicidal ideation.
   Design:
   A retrospective study was conducted. Surveys were designed to collect data from a purposive sample of local disaster relief workers who survived a disaster. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to test hypotheses.
   Setting and Participants:
   The study sample was from a population of local relief workers in the worst quake-hit regions in China in 2008. The respondents were local relief workers from a town in these regions. All of the 83 local relief workers were invited 11 months after the earthquake, and 70 joined the study, resulting in a response rate of 84.3%.
   Main Outcome Measures:
   The dependent variable was postdisaster suicidal ideation. The independent variables were bereavement, depression and posttraumatic stress, daily work hours, job burnout, work-family conflict, and work engagement.
   Results:
   Approximately 21.4% of participants reported suicidal ideation after the earthquake in comparison with 7.1% before the earthquake. One potential risk factor was an interaction effect of job burnout and work-family conflict (odds ratio [OR] = 3.738; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.086-12.868). Potential protective factors included daily work hours (OR = 0.317; 95% CI, 0.106-0.952) and work engagement (OR = 0.297; 95% CI, 0.091-0.969).
   Conclusions:
   Findings suggest that for local relief workers who are also disaster survivors, meaningful engagement such as participation in disaster relief could be salutary to their mental health, but overwork and interference with personal life could be harmful and increase the risk of suicidal ideation. Discretion is needed in managing local workforces, particularly with long work hours and work-family balance.

TI Lethal wood pellets. Carbon monoxide poisoning due to inappropriate

AB Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning either accidental or as suicide, is a common cause of death encountered in routine medicolegal autopsies. It is less well known that CO can also be formed from the resin in wood fibers. Wood pellets emit the highest amount of CO in the weeks following production. Insufficient ventilation, particularly during storage of freshly made wood pellets in storage bunkers for heating devices, therefore leads to accumulation of dangerous concentrations of CO.
   This article aims to alert the readership to the dangers of CO poisoning resulting from inappropriate storage of wood pellets.
   The dangers are exemplified by the case of a 43-year-old man who was found dead in a storage room for wood pellets. The cause of death was CO poisoning due to a blood carboxyhemoglobin concentration of 75 %. The findings were compared with 14 further fatal cases of asphyxia involving wood pellets and wood products published in the literature for the time period 2002-2014. The first scientific investigations on this phenomenon were carried out particularly in the USA, Canada, Sweden and China as large-scale producers of wood pellets and were included in the assessment of the literature.
   The evaluation of the currently available literature showed that the dangers associated with the storage of wood pellets as a purportedly harmless source of energy are to a large extent unappreciated and have already led to fatal accidents. Under this aspect it is conspicuous that due to the expansion of the market into private dwellings, private users have also suffered fatal accidents so that an official risk assessment with a clear and uniform identification of hazards appears to be necessary.
   The public awareness of the dangers resulting from the storage of wood pellets must be increased. Official, uniform danger markings and recommendations for handling (e.g. only entering a pellet bunker with a CO detection warning device and/or breathing mask) should be made public in order to avoid fatal accidents by CO poisoning.

AB The aim of this paper was to describe the prevalence of deliberate self-harm (DSH) and to determine the socio-demographic, behavioral, and psychological correlates of DSH behaviors in Chinese adolescents and young adults in a representative sample of the general population. The data were obtained from an epidemiologic study involving adolescents and young adults from junior and senior schools and colleges located in eight provinces of China. A total of 17,622 cases were retained for analysis. The relationship between the explanatory variables with self-harm was analyzed using a Pearson chi (2) test and a multinomial logistic regression model. A total of 3,001 (17.0%) students reported that they had harmed themselves deliberately in the past 12 months. The act of DSH occurring 1 and > 2 times accounted for 4.2% (742) and 12.8% (2,259) of all respondents, respectively. The most frequently reported form of DSH was self-hitting. If the reference category was No DSH, the findings indicated that family composition, father's education, perceived family economic status, cigarette use, perceived body image, and higher scores in depression scales were important concomitants of repeat-incidents of DSH. The students, in western areas, who were younger, reported that having unhealthy weight control behaviors, and alcohol use had a higher risk for both types of DSH. Regarding students of age 15-18 years perceived body image (too fat), having unhealthy weight control behaviors or a high level of depression symptoms demonstrated an elevated risk for repeat-incident DSH when single-incident DSH was used as the reference category, whereas the students in middle area reported family composition (both parents), education of the father (less than college) or alcohol use had a decreased risk for repeat-incident DSH. The results of this study suggest that both types of DSH are associated with other wide-ranging problems in the students' lives. Despite their common features, these phenomena also differed from each other. It is necessary to investigate the possible neurobiologic underpinnings of DSH within a longitudinal study to enhance the knowledge of this behavior.

AB Background: Previous studies have concentrated on predictors of exceptional longevity, however, relevant studies have rarely extended to other fields of functioning. To date, little is known about what contributes to the experience of negative emotion in a very old population.
   Objective: We aimed to provide a comprehensive key domain of functioning, including physical, cognitive, behavior, and negative emotion in older adults (OAs), followed by determination of predictors of negative emotion.
   Methods: Data were collected from a nationally representative sample of 2570 Chinese OAs (aged 60 and above) from the 2014 wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. Physical function was assessed using activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) measures. Cognitive function was assessed by the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (mMMSE). Participants' behavior included smoking, drinking, exercise, physical labor, and social activities. Negative emotion was assessed using four items on affective experiences to create an index of emotional well-being. The associations between various covariates and multiple health outcomes were examined using Pearson's correlation. Multiple linear regressions were established to verify significant variables associated with respondents' negative emotion.
   Results: The mean age was 80.20 years (SD=8.60). The mean ADL total score of the sample was 17.78 (SD-0.89), mean IADL total score was 21.93 (SD-3.69), the mean mMMSE total score was 21.63 (SD=2.23), the mean negative emotion total score was 8.89 (SD=2.64). Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that negative emotion was associated with self-perceived low economic status, poor self-rated health condition, poor sleep quality, low IADL function, less regular exercising, living in rural, and being female.
   Conclusion: Limited physical functioning and social resources in rural residence may restrict the outpouring of emotion in OAs. Nevertheless, further intensive studies are warranted to provide guidance for the development of better living environment for this elderly population.

AB According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4 out of the 10 leading causes of disability in the US and other developed countries are mental disorders. Major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are among the most common mental disorders that currently plague numerous countries and have varying incidence rates from 26 percent in America to 4 percent in China. Though some of this difference may be attributable to the manner in which individual healthcare providers diagnose mental disorders, this noticeable distribution can be also explained by studies which show that a lack of certain dietary nutrients contribute to the development of mental disorders. Notably, essential vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids are often deficient in the general population in America and other developed countries; and are exceptionally deficient in patients suffering from mental disorders. Studies have shown that daily supplements of vital nutrients often effectively reduce patients' symptoms. Supplements that contain amino acids also reduce symptoms, because they are converted to neurotransmitters that alleviate depression and other mental disorders. Based on emerging scientific evidence, this form of nutritional supplement treatment may be appropriate for controlling major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and anxiety disorders, eating disorders, attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD), addiction, and autism. The aim of this manuscript is to emphasize which dietary supplements can aid the treatment of the four most common mental disorders currently affecting America and other developed countries: major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
   Most antidepressants and other prescription drugs cause severe side effects, which usually discourage patients from taking their medications. Such noncompliant patients who have mental disorders are at a higher risk for committing suicide or being institutionalized. One way for psychiatrists to overcome this noncompliance is to educate themselves about alternative or complementary nutritional treatments. Although in the cases of certain nutrients, further research needs to be done to determine the best recommended doses of most nutritional supplements, psychiatrists can recommend doses of dietary supplements based on previous and current efficacious studies and then adjust the doses based on the results obtained.

AB Introduction: St John's wort is a popular herbal remedy recommended by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners and licensed and widely prescribed for depression in many European countries. However, conflicting data regarding its benefits and risks exist, and the last large meta-analysis on St John's wort use for depression was done in 2008, with no updated meta-analysis available.
   Methods: Using the keywords [St John's Wort OR Hypericum perforatum OR hypericin OR hyperforin OR johanniskraut ORL] AND [depression OR antidepressant OR SSRI], a preliminary search (without language restriction) on the PubMed, Ovid, Clinical Trials Register of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group, Cochrane Field for Complementary Medicine, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and WanFang database yielded 5428 papers between 1-Jan-1960 and 1-May-2016.
   Results: 27 clinical trials with a total of 3808 patients were reviewed, comparing the use of St John's wort and SSRI. In patients with depression, St John's wort demonstrated comparable response (pooled RR 0.983, 95% CI 0.924-1.042, p < 0.001) and remission (pooled RR 1.013, 95% CI 0.892-1.134, p < 0.001) rate, and significantly lower discontinuation/dropout (pooled OR 0.587, 95% CI 0.478-0.697, p < 0.001) rate compared to standard SSRIs. The pooled SMD from baseline HAM-D scores (pooled SMD-0.068, 95% CI-0.127 to 0.021, p < 0.001) also support its significant clinical efficacy in ameliorating depressive symptoms. Limitations: Evidence on the long-term efficacy and safety of St. John's wort is limited as the duration of all available studies ranged from 4 to 12 weeks. It is also unclear if St John's wort would be beneficial for patients with severe depression, high suicidality or suicide risk.
   Conclusion: For patients with mild-to-moderate depression, St John's wort has comparable efficacy and safety when compared to SSRIs. Follow-up studies carried out over a longer duration should be planned to ascertain its benefits.

AB Background: There has been little previous research on self-harm among people of Chinese origin living in the UK, although this population has grown substantially in recent years and China is now the largest source of international students at UK universities.
   Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study using self-harm presentation data (1997-2011) collected from three hospitals in the City of Manchester, which has the largest Chinese population across all UK Local Authorities. Rate ratios between the Chinese and White groups were calculated using Poisson regression models. Chi-square tests (or Fisher's exact tests), logistic regression, and log-binomial regression were used to examine differences in characteristics and clinical management between groups.
   Results: Ethnicity was known in the study cohort for 23,297 (87%) amongst 26,894 individuals aged 15 years and above. A total number of 97/23,297 (0.4%) people of Chinese ethnic origin presented with self-harm over the study period and 20,419 (88%) were White people. Incidence of self-harm in the Chinese group (aged 16-64 years) was less than one fifth of that found in White people (0.6 versus 3.2 per 1000 person-years; rate ratio 0.18, 95% confidence interval 0.13-0.24), and was particularly low amongst men of Chinese origin. Individuals of Chinese origin who presented with self-harm were younger, more likely to be female and students, and more likely to self-injure and describe relationship problems as a precipitant than White people. They were less likely to have clinical risk factors such as drug/alcohol misuse and receiving psychiatric treatment, and were rated to have lower risk of self-harm repetition by treating clinicians.
   Conclusion: Future research needs to investigate whether the low incidence of self-harm presenting to hospitals amongst people of Chinese origin truly reflects a lower frequency of self-harm, or alternatively is due to markedly different post-episode help-seeking behaviours or student overrepresentation in this ethnic group. Relevant healthcare professionals need to be aware of the risk characteristics of people of Chinese origin who self-harm.

AB Background: Exposure to fine particulate matter (<= 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter; PM2.5) has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of mortality due to cardiovascular, respiratory, and other pulmonary diseases. However, fewer studies have investigated the relationship between ambient PM2.5 and human mortality for a wider range of causes of death, or for more specific causes of death within these broader categories, especially at the high PM2.5 concentrations currently experienced in Chinese megacities. Beijing, China, has a very large population and a wide range of PM2.5 exposures, allowing a prime opportunity to estimate such risks across a broad spectrum of causes, including rarer causes of death.
   Objective: To estimate the relative risk of cause-specific mortality associated with PM2.5 for a spectrum of causes of death, as well as characterize the time course of cause-specific mortality following PM2.5 exposure, in a location where PM2.5 concentrations are representative of common exposures in Chinese megacities.
   Methods: We collected daily data on mortality counts of Beijing residents and Beijing weather and air pollution measurements for January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2012. We used a time-stratified case-crossover study design to estimate the association between ambient PM2.5 concentrations and risk of death from several broad causes of death and from more refined specific causes within these broader categories. Primary results were estimated for risks the day of and the day following exposure (lag 0-1), but the time pattern of associated risk was also explored up to seven days following exposure.
   Results: Increased concentrations of PM2.5 were associated with increased risks at lag days 0-1 of all-cause mortality (0.26% increase per 10 mu g/m(3); 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.12%-0.39%), non-accidental deaths (0.25%; 95% CI: 0.11%-0.38%), circulatory deaths (0.39%; 95% CI: 0.21%-0.59%), respiratory deaths (0.43%; 95% CI: 0.05%-0.81%), intentional self-harm deaths (1.94%; 95% CI: 0.19%-3.73%) and nervous system deaths (0.9%; 95% CI: -0.2%-2%), although the observed increase was not statistical significant for the final one rarer cause of death. In addition to these five broad death outcomes, risk also increased following PM2.5 exposure at lag days 0-1 for deaths from several specific causes, including most of the specific circulatory causes considered. The largest observed increased risk by far was for one of the rarest causes of death considered, extrapyramidal and movement disorders (2.35%; 95% CI: 0.03%-4.72%).
   Conclusions: This study indicates that exposure to PM2.5 in a study location more representative of exposures in developing cities is associated with an increased risk of mortality from broad range of causes of death, including some causes rarely studied previously in association with PM2.5 exposure.

   PREVALENCE; EXPERIENCE; RISK; DEPRESSION; SEPARATION
AB Background Globally, a growing number of children and adolescents are left behind when parents migrate. We investigated the effect of parental migration on the health of left behind-children and adolescents in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).
   Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PsychINFO, Global Index Medicus, Scopus, and Popline from inception to April 27, 2017, without language restrictions, for observational studies investigating the effects of parental migration on nutrition, mental health, unintentional injuries, infectious disease, substance use, unprotected sex, early pregnancy, and abuse in left-behind children (aged 0-19 years) in LMICs. We excluded studies in which less than 50% of participants were aged 0-19 years, the mean or median age of participants was more than 19 years, fewer than 50% of parents had migrated for more than 6 months, or the mean or median duration of migration was less than 6 months. We screened studies using systematic review software and extracted summary estimates from published reports independently. The main outcomes were risk and prevalence of health outcomes, including nutrition (stunting, wasting, underweight, overweight and obesity, low birthweight, and anaemia), mental health (depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, conduct disorders, self-harm, and suicide), unintentional injuries, substance use, abuse, and infectious disease. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) using random-effects models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017064871.
   Findings Our search identified 10 284 records, of which 111 studies were included for analysis, including a total of 264 967 children (n=106 167 left-behind children and adolescents; n=158 800 children and adolescents of non-migrant parents). 91 studies were done in China and focused on effects of internal labour migration. Compared with children of non-migrants, left-behind children had increased risk of depression and higher depression scores (RR 1.52 [95% CI 1.27-1.82]; SMD 0.16 [0.10-0.21]), anxiety (RR 1.85 [1.36-2.53]; SMD 0.18 [0.11-0.26]), suicidal ideation (RR 1.70 [1.28-2.26]), conduct disorder (SMD 0.16 [0.04-0.28]), substance use (RR 1.24 [1.00-1.52]), wasting (RR 1.13 [1.02-1.24]) and stunting (RR 1.12 [1.00-1.26]). No differences were identified between left-behind children and children of non-migrants for other nutrition outcomes, unintentional injury, abuse, or diarrhoea. No studies reported outcomes for other infectious diseases, self-harm, unprotected sex, or early pregnancy. Study quality varied across the included studies, with 43% of studies at high or unclear risk of bias across five or more domains.
   Interpretation Parental migration is detrimental to the health of left-behind children and adolescents, with no evidence of any benefit. Policy makers and health-care professionals need to take action to improve the health of these young people. Copyright (c) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Offshoring and layoffs: How about a little decency?
SO CHEMICAL PROCESSING
LA English
DT Article
AB "Offshoring," or the movement of U.S. engineering and technical jobs over-seas, is striking a raw nerve, sparking political debate and concerns over the. future of the U.S. economy and basic R&D. The IT and telecommunications sector, where the U.S. Jobless rate continues to hover at 7 percent, has been first and hardest hit. The Communication Workers of America reckon that 400,000 U.S. jobs have moved offshore. According to Cambridge Mass., based Giga Information, 200 of the Fortune 500 shipped nearly $7.7 billion worth of IT work overseas last year. Although there are no firm statistics right now, more chemical process design, R&D and engineering jobs also appear to be moving abroad.
   The economic reasons for off-shoring, outsourcing, or "lower-cost arbitrage," whatever you choose to call the trend, are compelling. But they're compelling only in the short term. And, whether they're eliminating positions or moving them offshore, many U.S. companies are "clearing the decks" in an extremely degrading way. We read, for example, of IT companies giving senior engineers just enough notice to allow them to train their less-costly replacements, here on H-1 B or L-1 visas. One chemical company reportedly laid off 17 people last month, asking those who were "off " that day to come in, then gave them all of 30 minutes to get their things and leave.
   Police cars have become a fixed presence in company parking lots during U.S. layoffs, just in case anyone decides to "go postal." Given the way that layoffs are handled, it's a wonder that more people don't! Suicides and severe depressions have resulted, in some extreme cases.
   Xenophobic or knee-jerk responses would be counterproductive. We're living in a global economy, and, if researchers and engineers in Russia or India can most effectively solve a technical problem, why shouldn't they? Ph.D. engineers in Russia earn one-tenth what their American peers do. In many parts of the world today, trained professionals employed by national institutes routinely "moonlight" driving cabs or whatever they can to make ends meet. Surely they deserve more professional opportunities to use their talents.
   More U.S. chemical companies are planning to tap that underutilized labor pool. Earlier this month, for example, Raymond LeBoeuf, CEO of Pittsburghbased PPG Industries, said that he sees his company "bringing new research to market" - research that, he says, will be increasingly carried out in the former Soviet Union, India and China.

TI Efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the

ID ADD-ON RTMS; MAINTENANCE TREATMENT; CLINICAL-EVALUATION; MAJOR

AB Background: Depression is a chronic illness that generally requires lifelong therapy. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive technique with few side effects that has been reported to be useful in the treatment of depression. However, no studies to date have evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) the efficacy of rTMS for maintenance treatment of depression.
   Methods/design: In this article, we report the design and protocol of a randomized, single-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study in China to evaluate the efficacy of rTMS in the prevention of relapse of depressive symptoms. In total, 540 patients, aged 18 to 60 years, diagnosed with depression and experiencing an acute exacerbation of depressive symptoms, will be enrolled. The study will consist of four phases: a screening/tolerability phase of up to 7 days; an open-label, flexible-dose lead-in phase of 8 weeks; an open-label, fixed-dose stabilization phase of 6 weeks; and a single-blind relapse prevention phase of 12 months. During the open-label phase, all patients will be treated with venlafaxine. Remitters with Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17) score <= 7 will be eligible to enter the single-blind phase and will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: group 1 on active rTMS and venlafaxine; group 2 on sham rTMS and venlafaxine; and group 3 on venlafaxine alone. Efficacy will be evaluated during the study using relapse assessment (time between subject randomization to treatment and the first occurrence of relapse). Secondary outcome measures will include: symptom changes, measured by the HAM-D17; illness severity changes, measured by the Clinical Global Impression of Severity for Depression (CGI-S-DEP); and changes in subject functioning, assessed with the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale. Safety will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiography (ECG), and measurements of vital signs (temperature, pulse, and blood pressure) and weight. Suicidality will be assessed by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).
   Discussion: The result of this trial will assess the efficacy of rTMS in the prevention of relapse of symptoms of depression by determining whether rTMS in combination with an antidepressant is more efficacious than the antidepressant alone for maintenance of the clinical response.

AB Background: Primary trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a common clinical refractory neuralgia. Severe pain is experienced during episodes, severely impacting the patient's quality of life. Long-term suffering from the disease can lead to anxiety, depression, and even suicide. The pathological processes involved in TN are complex, the mechanisms of pathogenesis are unknown, and effective treatment is lacking.
   Objective: This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of computed tomography (CT)guided pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) combined with low-temperature continuous radiofrequency (CRF) thermocoagulation in V2/V3 primary trigeminal neuralgia.
   Study Design: This research used a retrospective comparative study design.
   Setting: The research took place at Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University.
   Methods: A total of 80 hospitalized patients with TN were selected between January 2014 and December 2015 and randomly assigned to 2 groups differentiated by therapeutic method: CRF (CRF group, n = 40) and PRF + CRF (PCRF group, n = 40). Radiofrequency therapy was performed under the guidance of CT. Follow-up measures assessed preoperative conditions, pain remission, complications and side effects, recovery time, and recurrence rate over the 2 years following the surgery.
   Results: The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores decreased in both groups after surgery. After one month, the decrease in the VAS score in the PCRF group was more apparent, and this difference was maintained for 2 years. The total efficiency rates in the CRF and PCRF groups were 85% and 97.5%, respectively, at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years post-surgery. The differences in total efficiency rate of pain between the 2 groups at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years were statistically significant. Recovery times in the PCRF group were shorter than those in the CRF group. Specifically, recovery times for facial numbness in the CRF and PCRF groups were 3.12 +/- 1.21 months and 2.23 +/- 1.02 months, respectively. Recovery times for masticatory muscle weakness were 4.33 +/- 1.54 months and 3.42 +/- 0.98 months, respectively.
   Limitations: This study is limited by being a retrospective study, and by having a relatively small sample size from a single center.
   Conclusions: CT-guided PRF combined with low-temperature CRF thermocoagulation for treating V2/V3 primary TN effectively relieves pain, increases late-stage pain remission rate, reduces complications, and reduces the rate of recurrence.

AB Background
   Quetiapine is a widely used atypical antipsychotic drug for schizophrenia that has been on the market for over a decade. However, It is not clear how the effects of quetiapine differ from typical antipsychotics.
   Objectives
   To review the effects of quetiapine in comparison with typical antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychosis.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (March 2010), and inspected references of all identified studies.
   Selection criteria
   We included all randomised control trials comparing oral quetiapine with typical antipsychotic drugs in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis.
   Data collection and analysis
   We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random-effects model. We presented chosen outcomes in a 'Summary of findings' table and comparative risks where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) based on a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias for included studies.
   Main results
   The review includes 43 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 7217 participants. Most studies were from China. The percentages of participants leaving the studies early were similar (36.5% in quetiapine group and 36.9% in typical antipsychotics group) and no significant difference between groups was apparent for leaving early due to any reason (23 RCTs n = 3576 RR 0.91 CI 0.81 to 1.01, moderate quality evidence), however, fewer participants in the quetiapine group left the studies early due to adverse events (15 RCTs, n = 3010, RR 0.48 CI 0.30 to 0.77).
   Overall global state was similar between groups (no clinically significant response; 16 RCTs, n = 1607, RR 0.96 CI 0.75 to 1.23, moderate quality evidence) and there was no significant difference in positive symptoms (PANSS positive subscore: 22 RCTs, n = 1934, MD 0.02 CI - 0.39 to 0.43, moderate quality evidence). General psychopathology was equivocal (PANSS general psychopathology subscore: 18 RCTs, n = 1569, MD - 0.20 CI - 0.83 to 0.42) between those allocated to quetiapine and typical antipsychotics. However, quetiapine was statistically significantly more efficacious for negative symptoms (PANSS negative subscore: 22 RCTs, n = 1934, MD - 0.82 CI 1.59 to - 0.04, moderate quality evidence), however, this result was highly heterogeneous and driven by two small outlier studies with high effect sizes. Without these two studies, there was no heterogeneity and no statistically significant difference between quetiapine and typical antipsychotics.
   Compared with typical antipsychotics, quetiapine might cause fewer adverse effects (9 RCTs, n = 1985, RR 0.76 CI 0.64 to 0.90 number needed to treat to induce harm (NNTH) 10, CI 8 to 17), less abnormal ECG (2 RCTs, n = 165, RR 0.38 CI 0.16 to 0.92, NNTH 8, CI 4 to 55), fewer overall extrapyramidal effects (8 RCTs, n = 1,095, RR 0.17 CI 0.09 to 0.32, NNTH 3, CI 3 to 3, moderate quality evidence) and fewer specific extrapyramidal effects including akathisia, parkinsonism, dystonia and tremor. Moreover, it might cause lower prolactin level (4 RCTs, n = 1034, MD - 16.20 CI - 23.34 to - 9.07, moderate quality evidence) and less weight gain compared with some typical antipsychotics in the short term (9 RCTs, n = 866, RR 0.52 CI 0.34 to 0.80, NNTH 8, CI 6 to 15).
   However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in suicide attempt, suicide, death, QTc prolongation, low blood pressure, tachycardia, sedation, gynaecomastia, galactorrhoea, menstrual irregularity and white blood cell count.
   Authors' conclusions
   Quetiapine may not differ from typical antipsychotics in the treatment of positive symptoms and general psychopathology. There are no clear differences in terms of the treatment of negative symptoms. However, it causes fewer adverse effects in terms of abnormal ECG, extrapyramidal effects, abnormal prolactin levels and weight gain.

AB Background Schizophrenia is a leading cause of disability, and a shift from facility- to community-based care has been proposed to meet the resource challenges of mental healthcare in low- and middle-income countries. We hypothesized that the addition of mobile texting would improve schizophrenia care in a resource-poor community setting compared with a community-based free-medicine program alone.
   Methods and findings In this 2-arm randomized controlled trial, 278 community-dwelling villagers (patient participants) were randomly selected from people with schizophrenia from 9 townships of Hunan, China, and were randomized 1:1 into 2 groups. The program participants were recruited between May 1, 2015, and August 31, 2015, and the intervention and follow-up took place between December 15, 2015, and July 1, 2016. Baseline characteristics of the 2 groups were similar. The patients were on average 46 years of age, had 7 years of education, had a duration of schizophrenia of 18 years with minimal to mild symptoms and nearly one-fifth loss of functioning, and were mostly living with family (95%) and had low incomes. Both the intervention and the control groups received a nationwide community-based mental health program that provided free antipsychotic medications. The patient participants in the intervention group also received LEAN (Lay health supporters, E-platform, Award, and iNtegration), a program that featured recruitment of a lay health supporter and text messages for medication reminders, health education, monitoring of early signs of relapses, and facilitated linkage to primary healthcare. The primary outcome was medication adherence (proportion of dosages taken) assessed by 2 unannounced home-based pill counts 30 days apart at the 6-month endpoint. The secondary and other outcomes included patient symptoms, functioning, relapses, re-hospitalizations, death for any reason, wandering away without notifying anyone, violence against others, damaging goods, and suicide. Intent-to-treat analysis was used. Missing data were handled with multiple imputations. In total, 271 out of 278 patient participants were successfully followed up for outcome assessment. Medication adherence was 0.48 in the control group and 0.61 in the intervention group (adjusted mean difference [AMD] 0.12 [95% CI 0.03 to 0.22]; p = 0.013; effect size 0.38). Among secondary and other outcomes we noted substantial reduction in the risk of relapse (26 [21.7%] of 120 interventional participants versus 40 [34.2%] of 117 controls; relative risk 0.63 [95% CI 0.42 to 0.97]; number needed to treat [NNT] 8.0) and re-hospitalization (9 [7.3%] of 123 interventional participants versus 25 [20.5%] of 122 controls; relative risk 0.36 [95% CI 0.17 to 0.73]; NNT 7.6). The program showed no statistical difference in all other outcomes. During the course of the program, 2 participants in the intervention group and 1 in the control group died. The limitations of the study include its lack of a full economic analysis, lack of individual tailoring of the text messages, the relatively short 6-month follow-up, and the generalizability constraint of the Chinese context.
   Conclusions The addition of texting to patients and their lay health supporters in a resource-poor community setting was more effective than a free-medicine program alone in improving medication adherence and reducing relapses and re-hospitalizations. Future studies may test the effectiveness of customization of the texting to individual patients.

AB Objectives To assess in a developing Asian country the impact of pesticide regulation on the number of deaths from poisoning. These regulations, which were implemented in Sri Lanka from the 1970s, aimed to reduce the number of deaths - the majority from self-poisoning - by limiting the availability and use of highly toxic pesticides.
   Methods Information on legislative changes was obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture, national and district hospital admission data were obtained from the Sri Lanka Health Statistics Unit, and individual details of deaths by pesticide poisoning were obtained from a manual review of patients' notes and intensive care unit records in Anuradhapura.
   Findings Between 1986 and 2000, the total national number of admissions due to poisoning doubled, and admissions due to pesticide poisoning increased,by more than 50%. At the same time, the case fatality proportion (CFP) fell for total poisonings and for poisonings due to pesticides. In 1991-92, 72% of pesticide-induced deaths in Anuradhapura were caused by organophosphorus (OP) and carbamate pesticides - in particular,the WHO class I OPs monocrotophos and methamidophos. From 1991, the import of these pesticides was reduced gradually until they were banned for routine use in January 1995, with a corresponding fall in deaths. Unfortunately, their place in agricultural practice was taken by the WHO class II organochlorine endosulfan, which led to a rise in deaths from status epilepticus - from one in 1994 to 50 in 1998. Endosulfan was banned in 1998, and over the following three years the number of endosulfan deaths fell to three. However, at the end of the decade, the number of deaths from pesticides was at a similar level to that of 1991, with WHO class II OPs causing the most deaths. Although these drugs are less toxic-than class I OPs, the management of class II OPs remains difficult because they are, nevertheless, still highly toxic, and their toxicity is exacerbated by the paucity of available facilities.
   Conclusion The fall in CFP amidst a rising incidence of self-poisoning suggests that Sri Lanka's programmes of pesticide regulation were beneficial. However, a closer inspection of pesticide-induced deaths in one hospital revealed switching to other highly toxic pesticides, as one was banned and replaced in agricultural practice by another. Future regulation must predict this switching and bear in mind the ease of treatment of replacement pesticides.. Furthermore, such regulations must be implemented alongside other strategies, such as integrated pest management, to reduce the,overall pesticide availability for self-harm.

AB Objective: To investigate associations of television and of video game or non-educational computer use (VG/CU) exposure volumes in a typical school day with psychiatric symptoms and suicidal ideation/self-injurious behavior (self-harm), in mainland Chinese adolescents.
   Methods: Secondary school pupils (N = 13,659; mean age: 15.18 +/- 1.89) from 10 urban areas sampled from different regions of mainland China were recruited. The subjects were divided into the following four screen exposure volume groups for television and VG/CU respectively based on a self-administered questionnaire: 0 h/day, >0 to <= 1 h/day, >1 to <= 2 h/day, and >2 h/day. Demographic and psychiatric symptoms were recorded for each respondent. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for several types of psychological problems and self-harm were calculated.
   Results: More than 2 h per school day television watching was associated with higher risk of depression in both boys (OR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.02-1.73) and girls (OR = 1.62, 95%CI: 1.19-2.21), of anxiety in boys (OR = 1.43, 95%CI: 1.05-1.95), of general emotional, behavioral, and social problems (GEBSPs; OR = 1.55, 95%CI: 1.01-2.39), and of oppositional defiant problems (OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.09-2.50) in girls, compared with no television exposure. Conversely, television exposure of no more than 1 h per school day was associated with lower self-harm risk in boys (OR = 0.81, 95%CI: 0.67-0.99) compared with no television exposure. High school day VG/CU time (> 2 h) compared with no VG/CU were associated with higher risks of anxiety (OR = 1.40, 95%CI: 1.06-1.86) and of attention deficit/hyperactivity problems (ADHPs; OR = 1.56, 95%CI: 1.02-2.38) in boys. And any school day VG/CU exposure was associated with higher risks of self-harm and all other psychiatric problems in boys and all psychiatric problems (including anxiety and ADHPs) in girls (ORs, 1.44-3.69), compared to no VG/CU exposure.
   Conclusion: For secondary school students, associations of psychiatric problems and self-harm were more strongly associated with exposure to VG/CU than with exposure to television. The findings suggest that VG/CU and television exposure on weekdays should be considered in psychiatric interventions for adolescents.

AB BackgroundThe objectives of this study were to assess the maintenance of effect of duloxetine 60mg once-daily (QD) in Chinese patients with chronic pain due to osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee or hip and to provide additional long-term safety data.MethodsThis was anopen-label, extension phase of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Eligible patients were outpatients who met the American College of Rheumatology clinical and radiographic criteria for OA with a rating4 on Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) 24-h average pain. After completing the 13-week placebo-controlled phase, patients originally assigned to placebo were titrated to duloxetine 60mg QD (PLA_DLX), whereas patients originally assigned to duloxetine 60mg QD remained on the same dose of duloxetine (DLX_DLX) for another 13weeks. The maintenance effect of duloxetine 60mg QD during the extension phase was evaluated by a 1-sided 97.5% confidence interval (CI) of the baseline-to-endpoint change in the extension phase for patients who took duloxetine and reported 30% reduction in BPI average pain at the end of placebo-controlled phase (placebo-controlled phase duloxetine responders). Other BPI severity and interference items, as well as safety and tolerability, were assessed.ResultsOf 342 patients entering the extension phase, 162 (97.6%) DLX_DLX-treated patients and 157 (89.2%) PLA_DLX-treated patients completed this phase. Most patients (76.0%) were female. Mean age was 60.6years. Mean BPI average pain was 5.5 at baseline of the placebo-controlled phase. Among 113 placebo-controlled phase duloxetine responders, mean change in BPI average pain during the extension phase was -0.59 (from 2.47 to 1.88); the upper bound of the 1-sided 97.5% CI was -0.31 and less than the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of a 1.5-point increase (p<0.001). Significant within-group improvements in all BPI items were observed for both PLA_DLX and DLX_DLX groups during the extension phase (all p<0.01). No deaths or suicide-related events occurred. Seven (4.0%) PLA_DLX-treated patients and no DLX_DLX-treated patients discontinued due to an adverse event.ConclusionThe analgesic effect of duloxetine 60mg QD among treatment responders was maintained for the entire duration of the extension phase. Duloxetine 60mg QD was well tolerated during the extension phase.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov identification number NCT01931475. Registered 29 August 2013.

TI Varenicline A Novel Pharmacotherapy for Smoking Cessation
SO DRUGS
LA English
DT Review
ID RECEPTOR PARTIAL AGONIST; SUSTAINED-RELEASE BUPROPION;

   CONTROLLED TRIAL; IN-VIVO; PLACEBO; ALPHA-4-BETA-2; THERAPY
AB Varenicline is an orally administered small molecule with partial agonist activity at the alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Varenicline was approved by both the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency of the EU in 2006 as an aid to smoking cessation. Subsequently, varenicline has been approved in over 80 other countries.
   Varenicline is almost entirely absorbed following oral administration, and absorption is unaffected by food, smoking or the time of day. Varenicline undergoes only minimal metabolism and approximately 90% of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged. Varenicline has a mean elimination half-life after repeated administration of approximately 24 hours in smokers. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve is increased in patients with moderate or severe renal failure. No clinically relevant varenicline-drug interactions have been identified.
   In two identical, randomized, double-blind, phase III clinical trials in healthy, motivated-to-quit, mainly Caucasian smokers aged 18-75 years in the US, 12 weeks of treatment with varenicline I mg twice daily was associated with significantly higher abstinence rates over weeks 9-12 than sustained-release bupropion 150mg twice daily or placebo. In a separate phase III trial, an additional 12 weeks of treatment in smokers achieving abstinence in the first 12 weeks was associated with greater abstinence through to week 52 than placebo treatment. Varenicline treatment was also associated with significantly higher rates of abstinence than placebo treatment in randomized, double-blind, clinical trials in smokers in China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. In a randomized, open-label, multi-national, phase III trial, varenicline treatment was associated with a significantly higher rate of abstinence than transdermal nicotine-replacement therapy. In these trials, varenicline treatment was associated with lower urge to smoke and satisfaction from smoking in relapsers than placebo or active comparators.
   In the two US phase III trials, 12 weeks of treatment with varenicline I mg twice daily had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. Nausea and abnormal dreams were the most common adverse events that occurred in more varenicline than placebo recipients. The incidence and prevalence of nausea were greatest in weeks I and 2 of treatment, and declined thereafter. The prevalence of early adverse effects can be reduced by individual dose titration. Adverse events associated with varenicline therapy have been reported in post-marketing surveillance, including neuropsychiatric events such as depressed mood, agitation, changes in behaviour, suicidal ideation and suicide. Currently, it is unclear whether the association of varenicline therapy with these adverse events is causal, coincidental or related to smoking cessation.
   Given the greater efficacy of varenicline compared with other pharmacotherapies, and the high risk of morbidity and mortality associated with continued smoking, varenicline is a valuable pharmacological aid to smoking cessation.

AB Background Efforts to establish the 2015 baseline and monitor early implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) highlight both great potential for and threats to improving health by 2030. To fully deliver on the SDG aim of "leaving no one behind", it is increasingly important to examine the health-related SDGs beyond national-level estimates. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017), we measured progress on 41 of 52 health -related SDG indicators and estimated the health-related SDG index for 195 countries and territories for the period 1990-2017, projected indicators to 2030, and analysed global attainment.
   Methods We measured progress on 41 health-related S DG indicators from 1990 to 2017, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2016 (new indicators were health worker density, sexual violence by non-intimate partners, population census status, and prevalence of physical and sexual violence [reported separately]). We also improved the measurement of several previously reported indicators. We constructed national-level estimates and, for a subset of health-related SDGs, examined indicator-level differences by sex and Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintile. We also did subnational assessments of performance for selected countries. To construct the health related SDG index, we transformed the value for each indicator on a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the 2.5th percentile and 100 as the 97.5th percentile of 1000 draws calculated from 1990 to 2030, and took the geometric mean of the scaled indicators by target. To generate projections through 2030, we used a forecasting framework that drew estimates from the broader GBD study and used weighted averages of indicator-specific and country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2017 to inform future estimates. We assessed attainment of indicators with defined targets in two ways: first, using mean values projected for 2030, and then using the probability of attainment in 2030 calculated from 1000 draws. We also did a global attainment analysis of the feasibility of attaining SDG targets on the basis of past trends. Using 2015 global averages of indicators with defined SDG targets, we calculated the global annualised rates of change required from 2015 to 2030 to meet these targets, and then identified in what percentiles the required global annualised rates of change fell in the distribution of country-level rates of change from 1990 to 2015. We took the mean of these global percentile values across indicators and applied the past rate of change at this mean global percentile to all health-related SDG indicators, irrespective of target definition, to estimate the equivalent 2030 global average value and percentage change from 2015 to 2030 for each indicator.
   Findings The global median health-related SDG index in 2017 was 59.4 (IQR 35.4-67.3), ranging from a low of 11.6 (95% uncertainty interval 9.6-14.0) to a high of 84.9 (83.1-86.7). SDG index values in countries assessed at the subnational level varied substantially particularly in China and India, although scores in Japan and the UK were more homogeneous. Indicators also varied by SDI quintile and sex, with males having worse outcomes than females for non-communicable disease (NCD) mortality, alcohol use, and smoking, among others. Most countries were projected to have a higher health-related SDG index in 2030 than in 2017, while country-level probabilities of attainment by 2030 varied widely by indicator. Under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and malaria indicators had the most countries with at least 95% probability of target attainment. Other indicators, including NCD mortality and suicide mortality, had no countries projected to meet corresponding SDG targets on the basis of projected mean values for 2030 but showed some probability of attaimnent by 2030. For some indicators, including child malnutrition, several infectious diseases, and most violence measures, the annualised rates of change required to meet SDG targets far exceeded the pace of progress achieved by any country in the recent past. We found that applying the mean global annualised rate of change to indicators without defined targets would equate to about 19% and 22% reductions in global smoking and alcohol consumption, respectively; a 47% decline in adolescent birth rates; and a more than 85% increase in health worker density per 1000 population by 2030.
   Interpretation The GBD study offers a unique, robust platform for monitoring the health -related SDGs across demographic and geographic dimensions. Our findings underscore the importance of increased collection and analysis of disaggregated data and highlight where more deliberate design or targeting of interventions could accelerate progress in attaining the SDGs. Current projections show that many health -related SDG indicators, NCDs, NCD-related risks, and violence -related indicators will require a concerted shift away from what might have driven past gains curative interventions in the case of NCDs towards multisectoral, prevention -oriented policy action and investments to achieve SDG aims. Notably, several targets, if they are to be met by 2030, demand a pace of progress that no country has achieved in the recent past. The future is fundamentally uncertain, and no model can fully predict what breakthroughs or events might alter the course of the S DGs. What is clear is that our actions or inaction today will ultimately dictate how close the world, collectively, can get to leaving no one behind by 2030.

AB Background
   Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic demonstrated to be superior in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia which causes fewer movement disorders. Clozapine, however, entails a significant risk of serious blood disorders such as agranulocytosis which could be potentially fatal. Currently there are a number of newer antipsychotics which have been developed with the purpose to find both a better tolerability profile and a superior effectiveness.
   Objectives
   To compare the clinical effects of clozapine with other atypical antipsychotics (such as amisulpride, aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone and zotepine) in the treatment of schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.
   Search strategy
   We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Register (June 2007) and reference lists of all included randomised controlled trials. We also manually searched appropriate journals and conference proceedings relating to clozapine combination strategies and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies.
   Selection criteria
   All relevant randomised, at least single-blind trials, comparing clozapine with other atypical antipsychotics, any dose and oral formulations, for people with schizophrenia or related disorders.
   Data collection and analysis
   We selected trials and extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on a random-effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) again based on a random-effects model.
   Main results
   The review currently includes 27 blinded randomised controlled trials, which involved 3099 participants. Twelve randomised control trials compared clozapine with olanzapine, five with quetiapine, nine with risperidone, one with ziprasidone and two with zotepine. Attrition from these studies was high (overall 30.1%), leaving the interpretation of results problematic. Clozapine had a higher attrition rate due to adverse effects than olanzapine (9 RCTs, n=1674, RR 1.60 CI 1.07 to 2.40, NNT 25 CI 15 to 73) and risperidone (6 RCTs, n=627, RR 1.88 CI 1.11 to 3.21, NNT 16 CI 9 to 59). Fewer participants in the clozapine groups left the trials early due to inefficacy than risperidone (6 RCTs, n=627, RR 0.40 CI 0.23 to 0.70, NNT 11 CI 7 to 21), suggesting a certain higher efficacy of clozapine.
   Clozapine was more efficacious than zotepine in improving the participants general mental state (BPRS total score: 1 RCT, n=59, MD -6.00 CI -9.83 to -2.17), but not consistently more than olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone. There was no significant difference between clozapine and olanzapine or risperidone in terms of positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia. According to two studies from China quetiapine was more efficacious for negative symptoms than clozapine (2 RCTs, n=142, MD 2.23 CI 0.99 to 3.48).
   Clozapine produced somewhat fewer extrapyramidal side-effects than risperidone (use of antiparkinson medication: 6 RCTs, n=304, RR 0.39 CI 0.22 to 0.68, NNT 7 CI 5 to 18) and zotepine (n=59, RR 0.05 CI 0.00 to 0.86, NNT 3 CI 2 to 5). More participants in the clozapine group showed decreased white blood cells than those taking olanzapine, more hypersalivation and sedation than those on olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine and more seizures than people on olanzapine and risperidone. Also clozapine produced an important weight gain not seen with risperidone.
   Other differences in adverse effects were less documented and should be replicated, for example, clozapine did not alter prolactin levels whereas olanzapine, risperidone and zotepine did; compared with quetiapine, clozapine produced a higher incidence of electrocardiogram (ECG) alterations; and compared with quetiapine and risperidone clozapine produced a higher increase of triglyceride levels. Other findings that should be replicated were: clozapine improved social functioning less than risperidone and fewer participants in the clozapine group had to be hospitalised to avoid suicide attempts compared to olanzapine.
   Other important outcomes such as service use, cognitive functioning, satisfaction with care or quality of life were rarely reported.
   Authors' conclusions
   Clozapine may be a little more efficacious than zotepine and risperidone but further trials are required to confirm this finding. Clozapine differs more clearly in adverse effects from other second generation antipsychotics and the side-effect profile could be key in the selection of treatment depending on the clinical situation and a patient's preferences. Data on other important outcomes such as cognitive functioning, quality of life, death or service use are currently largely missing, making further large and well-designed trials necessary. It is also important to take into account that the large number of people leaving the studies early limits the validity and interpretation of our findings.

AB Background
   Proponents of early intervention have argued that outcomes might be improved if more therapeutic efforts were focused on the early stages of schizophrenia or on people with prodromal symptoms. Early intervention in schizophrenia has two elements that are distinct from standard care: early detection, and phase-specific treatment (phase-specific treatment is a psychological, social or physical treatment developed, or modified, specifically for use with people at an early stage of the illness). Early detection and phase-specific treatment may both be offered as supplements to standard care, or may be provided through a specialised early intervention team. Early intervention is now well established as a therapeutic approach in America, Europe and Australasia.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the effects of: (a) early detection; (b) phase-specific treatments; and (c) specialised early intervention teams in the treatment of people with prodromal symptoms or first-episode psychosis.
   Search strategy
   We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (March 2009), inspected reference lists of all identified trials and reviews and contacted experts in the field.
   Selection criteria
   We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) designed to prevent progression to psychosis in people showing prodromal symptoms, or to improve outcome for people with first-episode psychosis. Eligible interventions, alone and in combination, included: early detection, phase-specific treatments, and care from specialised early intervention teams. We accepted cluster-randomised trials but excluded non-randomised trials.
   Data collection and analysis
   We reliably selected studies, quality rated them and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we estimated relative risks (RR), with the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where possible, we calculated the number needed to treat/harm statistic (NNT/H) and used intention-to-treat analysis (ITT).
   Main results
   Studies were diverse, mostly small, undertaken by pioneering researchers and with many methodological limitations (18 RCTs, total n=1808). Mostly, meta-analyses were inappropriate. For the six studies addressing prevention of psychosis for people with prodromal symptoms, olanzapine seemed of little benefit (n=60, 1 RCT, RR conversion to psychosis 0.58 CI 0.3 to 1.2), and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) equally so (n=60, 1 RCT, RR conversion to psychosis 0.50 CI 0.2 to 1.7). A risperidone plus CBT plus specialised team did have benefit over specialist team alone at six months (n=59, 1 RCT, RR conversion to psychosis 0.27 CI 0.1 to 0.9, NNT 4 CI 2 to 20), but this was not seen by 12 months (n=59, 1 RCT, RR 0.54 CI 0.2 to 1.3). Omega 3 fatty acids (EPA) had advantage over placebo (n=76, 1 RCT, RR transition to psychosis 0.13 CI 0.02 to 1.0, NNT 6 CI 5 to 96). We know of no replications of this finding.
   The remaining trials aimed to improve outcome in first-episode psychosis. Phase-specific CBT for suicidality seemed to have little effect, but the single study was small (n=56, 1 RCT, RR suicide 0.81 CI 0.05 to 12.26). Family therapy plus a specialised team in the Netherlands did not clearly affect relapse (n=76, RR 1.05 CI 0.4 to 3.0), but without the specialised team in China it may (n=83, 1 RCT, RR admitted to hospital 0.28 CI 0.1 to 0.6, NNT 3 CI 2 to 6). The largest and highest quality study compared specialised team with standard care. Leaving the study early was reduced (n=547, 1 RCT, RR 0.59 CI 0.4 to 0.8, NNT 9 CI 6 to 18) and compliance with treatment improved (n=507, RR stopped treatment 0.20 CI 0.1 to 0.4, NNT 9 CI 8 to 12). The mean number of days spent in hospital at one year were not significantly different (n=507, WMD, -1.39 CI -2.8 to 0.1), neither were data for 'Not hospitalised' by five years (n=547, RR 1.05 CI 0.90 to 1.2). There were no significant differences in numbers 'not living independently' by one year (n=507, RR 0.55 CI 0.3 to 1.2). At five years significantly fewer participants in the treatment group were 'not living independently' (n=547, RR 0.42 CI 0.21 to 0.8, NNT 19 CI 14 to 62). When phase-specific treatment (CBT) was compared with befriending no significant differences emerged in the number of participants being hospitalised over the 12 months (n=62, 1 RCT, RR 1.08 CI 0.59 to 1.99). Phase-specific treatment E-EPA oils suggested no benefit (n=80, 1 RCT, RR no response 0.90 CI 0.6 to 1.4) as did phase-specific treatment brief intervention (n=106, 1 RCT, RR admission 0.86 CI 0.4 to 1.7).
   Phase-specific ACE found no benefit but participants given vocational intervention were more likely to be employed (n=41, 1 RCT, RR 0.39 CI 0.21 to 0.7, NNT 2 CI 2 to 4). Phase-specific cannabis and psychosis therapy did not show benefit (n=47, RR cannabis use 1.30 CI 0.8 to 2.2) and crisis assessment did not reduce hospitalisation (n=98, RR 0.85 CI 0.6 to 1.3). Weight was unaffected by early behavioural intervention.
   Authors' conclusions
   There is emerging, but as yet inconclusive evidence, to suggest that people in the prodrome of psychosis can be helped by some interventions. There is some support for specialised early intervention services, but further trials would be desirable, and there is a question of whether gains are maintained. There is some support for phase-specific treatment focused on employment and family therapy, but again, this needs replicating with larger and longer trials.
