AB By focusing on the elderly suicide rates, this study lays out the different suicide regulation and prevention policies of three developed countries - Japan, the Netherlands, and South Korea. The main goal is to compare and analyze how these policies, with disparate ways of handling suicide, influence elderly suicide rates in relation with their countries' respective differing suicide determinants. By applying the 'Method for Synthesizing about Public Policies' created by Morestin, Gauvin, Hogue, and Benoit to check the status of efficiency and of any issues of public policies, it concludes that South Korea shows promise, while Japan's suicide rates have certainly been scaling down. Conversely, in terms of the use of euthanasia, suicide rates in the Netherlands have been continuously rising.

AB Background: Homicides followed by the suicide of the perpetrator are a rare yet very serious form of interpersonal violence which occurs mainly in partnerships and families. It typically leads to widespread public interest and unease. No systematic research on homicide-suicide has ever been conducted in the Netherlands.
   Aim: The aim of this study is to describe the nature and incidence of homicide-suicide in the Netherlands in the period 1992-2005, using cases reported in both national and regional newspapers.
   Results: On the basis of newspaper accounts, homicide-suicide occurred on average seven times per year during this time period. Spousal/consortial homicide-suicide was predominant, followed by homicide-suicide involving the perpetrator's own children and familicide-suicide. The perpetrators across all categories of homicide-suicide were predominantly male; the victims were predominantly women and children. Firearms were used in the majority of the homicides and subsequent suicides.
   Conclusion: The domestic nature of homicide-suicide events is discussed. Future research should aim to incorporate multiple methods in order to assess accurately the epidemiology of homicide-suicide in the Netherlands.

AB Homicides followed by the suicide of the perpetrator are a rare yet very serious form of interpersonal violence that occurs mainly in partnerships and families. No systematic research on homicide-suicide has ever been conducted in the Netherlands. This study provides an overview of the international homicide-suicide literature. Additionally, this article describes, for the first time, the incidence and patterns of homicide-suicide in the Netherlands and compares these to homicides not followed by suicide. To do so, an existing record containing all homicide cases in the Netherlands in the period 19922006 was used. Additional information on homicide-suicide events was retrieved through newspaper analysis. A total of 135 people died in 103 events. Homicide-suicide occurs with an annual incidence of 0.07 to 0.02 per 100,000 persons per year. People who commit homicide-suicide cannot be easily equated to those accused of other types of homicide.

AB The Netherlands is one of the very few countries that has guidelines for the practice of euthanasia. Each year there are about 9700 explicit requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (EAS), of which approximately 3600 patients are agreed upon in The Netherlands. Other countries have criticized the Dutch policy concerning EAS. First of all, it has been suggested that palliative care in The Netherlands is not adequate and that euthanasia is often requested by patients with depression. Additionally, part of the criticism is based on the regulation of the euthanasia procedure in The Netherlands.
   This chapter describes the guidelines for the procedure for euthanasia in The Netherlands, and focuses on some of the practical problems and issues of euthanasia. Also, the current situation concerning euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in The Netherlands is summarized and described.

AB Contrary to Durkheim's idea about suicide during wartime, the Netherlands had high suicide rates in 1940 and 1945. To explain these findings, we propose the social integration theory, according to which, people who expect to be excluded from society are more likely to commit suicide. We examine this idea using individual-level data on suicide in the Netherlands during the Second World War, assuming that Jews expected to be excluded by the occupying German forces, whereas political delinquents expected punishment after the war. In support of our theory, we found high suicide rates among Jews at the beginning of the war and high suicide rates among political delinquents when the Netherlands was liberated. These findings support the proposed theory and call for refinement of Durkheim's ideas.

DE suicide; seasons; circadian rhythm; railroads
ID VIOLENT SUICIDE; RHYTHMS; TIME; RAILWAYS; BEHAVIOR
AB Background: Annual patterns in suicide rates, peaking near the summer solstice, are well documented. It has been suggested that day length or total hours of sunshine has an impact on suicide rates. If these environmental factors are involved, we would expect changes in the daily pattern of suicide rates to occur over the year. To test this hypothesis, the 24-h patterns of suicide rate were investigated as a function of time of year. Method: Detailed information about the exact time of suicides in The Netherlands is only available for train suicides. Therefore, information concerning age, sex, time and place of occurrence of all verified train suicides over 15 years in The Netherlands (n = 2830) was obtained from The Netherlands Railways archives. Results: Daily patterns in train suicides show systematic variations of two kinds. First, independently of time of year, suicide rates at night drop to about 10% of their daytime values. Second. there are two daily peaks in the patterns which shift their timing over the year, with one peak occurring shortly after sunset, and the other one consistently occurring 9-10 h earlier. Both peaks shift with the 5.5-h shift in sunset time. Limitations: Train suicidal behaviour may not represent fatal suicidal behaviour in general. Conclusions: There are pronounced and systematic daily variations in train suicide rates in The Netherlands. One of these is related to clock time, the others are related to the light-dark cycle. The consistency of the patterns suggests a strong environmental influence on train suicidal behaviour. Research on 24-h patterns of suicide rates should control for time of year.

AB In the Netherlands there has been ongoing debate in the past 10 years about the availability of a hypothetical "suicide pill", with which older people could end their life in a dignified way if they so wished. Data on attitudes to the suicide pill were collected in the Netherlands from 410 physicians, 1,379 members of the general population, and 87 relatives of patients who died after euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. The general population and relatives were more in favor than physicians. Fifteen percent of the general population and 36% of the relatives thought a suicide pill should be made available.

AB World War II in the Netherlands lasted from May 1940 to May 1945. Suicide numbers peaked in these months, in the first case because of suicide by Jews, and in the second case because of suicide by collaborators with the German occupier. Suicide rates for Jews were higher in 1942 than in 1940 and even higher in 1943 than in 1942. Foreign Jews were more likely to die of suicide than Dutch Jews, and Jewish women more than Jewish men. Suicide of non-Jews was lower in the intermittent war years than in the years before and after World War II.

AB Homicide-suicides are a rare yet very serious form of lethal violence which mainly occurs in partnerships and families. The extent to which homicide-suicide can be understood as being primarily a homicide or a suicide event, or rather a category of its own is examined. In total, 103 homicide-suicides were compared to 3,203 homicides and 17,751 suicides. These are all events that took place in the Netherlands in the period 1992 to 2006. Logistic regression analyses show that homicide-suicides significantly differ from both homicides and suicides with regard to sociodemographic and event characteristics. The findings suggest that homicide-suicide might be considered as a distinct phenomenon from both homicide and suicide.

LA English
DT Article
DE suicide prevention; implementation; practice guidelines; educational
   outreach; suicide; quality improvement; national strategy
AB In The Netherlands, on average 40% of all suicides concern patients treated by mental healthcare institutions (MHIs). Recent evidence indicates that implemented guideline recommendations significantly reduce the odds for patients to die by suicide. Implementation of the multidisciplinary guideline for diagnosis and treatment of suicidal behaviors is a main objective of the Dutch National Suicide Prevention Strategy. To this end, 24 MHIs that collectively reported 73% of patient suicides in 2015 received an educational outreach intervention offered by the national center of expertise. Aim: To investigate changes in levels of implementation of guideline recommendations; and to assess the degree of variation on suicide prevention policies and practices between MHIs. Methods: Implementation study with a prospective cohort design studying change over time on all domains of a Suicide Prevention Monitor, a guideline-based instrument assessing suicide prevention policies and practices within MHIs. Data were collected in six-month intervals between 2015 and 2017. Results: MHIs improved significantly on four out of ten domains: the development of an organizational suicide prevention policy; monitoring and trend-analysis of suicides numbers; evaluations after suicide; and clinician training. No improvement was measured on the domains pertaining to multi-annual training policies; collaborative care with external partners; recording and evaluation of suicide attempts; routine assessment of suicidality in all patients; safety planning and involving next of kin and carers. Furthermore, marked practice variation between MHIs was found which did not decrease over time. Conclusion: This study shows significant improvement in the implementation of four out of ten guideline-based suicide prevention policies in 24 specialist mental healthcare institutions in The Netherlands. The implementation level of suicide prevention policies and practices still appears to vary significantly between MHIs in The Netherlands.

AB In the Netherlands, physician-assisted suicide may be justifiable for patients with physical illness as well as for patients with unbearable mental suffering. Explicit requests for physician-assisted suicide are frequently made, but in psychiatric practice they are infrequently granted. In this contribution, some information on the Dutch practices related to assisted death is presented, with emphasis on assisted suicide in patients with unbearable mental suffering. The aim of this contribution is to demonstrate that the Dutch law and jurisprudence permit clinicians to deal effectively with requests for assisted suicide.

DE assisted suicide; euthanasia; international; suicide
AB Suicide, assisted suicide and euthanasia are elusive and controversial issues worldwide. To discuss such issues from only one perspective may be limiting. Therefore, this paper was written by authors from various regions, each of whom has been asked to reflect on the issues. The countries/cultures are: Australia, China, Cuba, Ireland, India, Japan, Russia, South Africa, The Netherlands, North America (Turtle Island) and United States. Historically and today, suicide is viewed differently. Assisted suicide and euthanasia are equally seen from multifarious perspectives. Highlighting development in the Netherlands, Australia's Northern Territory and Japan (ie. the famous Yamanouchi Case), the review shows growing re-examination of the right to die. There appear, however, to be no uniform legal and ethical positions. Further debate and discussion globally is needed to avoid myopic perspectives.

AB This paper presents three different models of the legal regulation of assisted suicide in European countries. First, the current legal regime governing assisted suicide in the Netherlands is described where both euthanasia and assisted suicide have been legalised. This section also includes some empirical data on euthanasia and assisted-suicide practices in the Netherlands, as well as a comparison with the current legal legislation in Belgium and Luxembourg. Next, Switzerland is presented as a country where euthanasia is punishable by law but assisted suicide is legally allowed, provided it is not carried out with selfish motives. This section also focuses on the assisted-suicide related case law of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights. Last, the current legal situation regarding assisted suicide in Austria and Germany is described. While the Austrian Penal Code explicitly prohibits assisted suicide, assistance with suicide is not specifically regulated by the German Penal Code. However, medical doctors are not allowed to assist suicides according to the professional codes of conduct drawn up by the German medical associations under the supervision of the health authorities.

ID RAILWAYS; BEHAVIOR
AB Background: Little is known about train suicide and factors influencing its prevalence. This study tests the hypotheses that railway density, railway transportation volume, familiarity with railway transportation and population density contribute to train suicide. It also tests the relationship between train suicide and general population suicide and examines the prevalence and the characteristics of high-risk locations and their contribution to the grand total of train suicides.
   Methods: Trends in train suicides were compared with trends in railway track length, train kilometres, passenger kilometres and national suicide figures over the period 1950-2007. The geographical distribution over the national network over the period 1980-2007 was studied. Data were obtained from The Netherlands Railways, Prorail and Statistics Netherlands.
   Results:
   1. The incidence of train suicides is unrelated to railway parameters.
   2. Being familiar with railway transportation as a passenger is not a contributory factor.
   3. Train suicide rates are unrelated to regional population density.
   4. The incidence of train suicides parallels that of general population suicides.
   5. Half of the train suicides took place at a limited number of locations, the most important of which were situated within a village or town and were close to a psychiatric hospital.
   Limitations: Most conclusions are based on correlational relationships between variables.
   Conclusions:
   1. Train suicide trends reflect trends in general population suicides.
   2. Increased train transportation does not lead to more train suicides.
   3. The prevention of train suicide at high-risk locations (HRLs) in built-up areas and near psychiatric hospitals deserves first priority. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: In the Netherlands, suicide rates showed a sharp incline and this pertains particularly to the province of Noord-Brabant, one of the southern provinces in the Netherlands. This calls for a regional suicide prevention effort.
   Methods/design: Study protocol. A regional suicide prevention systems intervention is implemented and evaluated by a stepped wedge trial design in five specialist mental health institutions and their adherent chain partners. Our system intervention is called SUPREMOCOL, which stands for Suicide Prevention by Monitoring and Collaborative Care, and focuses on four pillars: 1) recognition of people at risk for suicide by the development and implementation of a monitoring system with decision aid, 2) swift access to specialist care of people at risk, 3) positioning nurse care managers for collaborative care case management, and 4) 12 months telephone follow up. Eligible patients are persons attempting suicide or expressing suicidal ideation. Primary outcome is number of completed suicides, as reported by Statistics Netherlands and regional Public Health Institutes. Secondary outcome is number of attempted suicides, as reported by the regional ambulance transport and police. Suicidal ideation of persons registered in the monitoring system will, be assessed by the PHQ-9 and SIDAS questionnaires at baseline and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after registration, and used as exploratory process measure. The impact of the intervention will be evaluated by means of the RE-AIM dimensions reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. Intervention integrity will be assessed and taken into account in the analysis.
   Discussion: The present manuscript presents the design and development of the SUPREMOCOL study. The ultimate goal is to lower the completed suicides rate by 20%, compared to the control period and compared to other provinces in the Netherlands. Moreover, our goal is to provide specialist mental health institutions and chain partners with a sustainable and adoptable intervention for suicide prevention.

ID PREVENTION; RISK
AB When compared to German rates, train suicides in the Netherlands have made up a larger proportion of the total number of suicides. This study examines whether this difference is attributable to railway parameters, familiarity with rail transport, or population density.
   Dutch and German train suicide rates from 2000 to 2007 were compared by means of Poisson regression analyses. Train suicide rate ratios were calculated and related to the railway parameters or population density in a Poisson regression model. The Dutch-German general suicide rate ratio was 0.72. In contrast, the train suicide rate in the Netherlands exceeded the German rate by 1.23. In the Poisson regression analyses, where suicide rate was related to railway density or passenger traffic intensity, the Dutch-German train suicide rate ratios became 1.49 and 1.20 respectively. When related to train traffic intensity or population density, however, rate ratios turned into 0.74 and 0.59 respectively. Train traffic intensity contributes to train suicide frequency. Population density also contributes, whereas railway density and familiarity with rail transport do not. In a cross-national comparison the availability hypothesis regarding the number of trains passing was confirmed, which leads to the recommendation of limiting access to the railway tracks.

TI Early evidence on the effects of regulators' suicidality warnings on
   SSRI prescriptions and suicide in children and adolescents
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENT; MENTAL-DISORDERS; RISK; DEPRESSION; PREVENTION
AB Objective: In 2003 and 2004, U.S. and European regulators issued public health warnings about a possible association between antidepressants and suicidal thinking and behavior. The authors assessed whether these warnings discouraged use of antidepressants in children and adolescents and whether they led to increases in suicide rates as a result of untreated depression.
   Method: The authors examined U.S. and Dutch data on prescription rates for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) from 2003 to 2005 in children and adolescents (patients up to age 19), as well as suicide rates for children and adolescents, using available data (through 2004 in the United States and through 2005 in the Netherlands). They used Poisson regression analyses to determine the overall association between antidepressant prescription rates and suicide rates, adjusted for sex and age, during the periods preceding and immediately following the public health warnings.
   Results: SSRI prescriptions for youths decreased by approximately 22% in both the United States and the Netherlands after the warnings were issued. in the Netherlands, the youth suicide rate increased by 49% between 2003 and 2005 and shows a significant inverse association with SSRI prescriptions. In the United States, youth suicide rates increased by 14% between 2003 and 2004, which is the largest year-to-year change in suicide rates in this population since the Centers or Disease Control and Prevention began systematically collecting suicide data in 1979.
   Conclusions: In both the United States and the Netherlands, SSRI prescriptions for children and adolescents decreased after U.S. and European regulatory agencies issued warnings about a possible suicide risk with antidepressant use in pediatric patients, and these decreases were associated with increases in suicide rates in children and adolescents.

AB In Suicide, Durkheim found that involvement in religious communities is inversely related to suicide risk. In this article, two explanations for this relationship are examined. One is that religious networks provide support. The other is that religious communities prohibit suicide. To examine these hypotheses, individual- level data on suicide in the Netherlands from 1936 to 1973 are used. The results show that with an increase in the proportion of religious persons in a municipality, the chances of committing suicide decrease for every denomination in that municipality, as well as among nonchurch members. Furthermore, along with the secularization of Dutch society, the impact of religious composition on suicide wanes. These results contradict the network-support mechanism and confirm the notion that religious communities have a general protective effect against suicide.

AB Background: Time trends are one of the most studied phenomena in suicide research; however, evidence for time trends in the Dutch population remains understudied. Insight into time trends can contribute to the development of effective suicide prevention strategies.
   Methods: Time trends in national daily and monthly data of 33,224 suicide events that occurred in the Netherlands from 1995 to 2015 were examined, as well as the influence of age, gender, and province, in a longitudinal population-based design with Poisson regression analyses and Bayesian change point analyses.
   Results: Suicide incidence among Dutch residents increased from 2007 until 2015 by 38%. Suicide rates peak in spring, up to 8% higher than in summer (p < 0.001). Suicide incidence was 42% lower at Christmas, compared to the December-average (IRR = 0.580, p < 0.001). After Christmas, a substantial increase occurred on January 1, which remained high during the first weeks of the new year. Suicide occurred more than twice as often in men than in women. For both genders, the results indicated a spring time peak in suicide incidence and a trough at Christmas. Suicide rates were highest in the elderly (age group, 80+), and no evidence was found of a differential effect by season in the age groups with regard to suicide incidence. No interaction effect was found with regard to province of residence for both season and Christmas, indicating that no evidence was found that these time trends had differential effects in the Dutch provinces in terms of suicide incidence.
   Conclusion: Evidence was found for time trends in suicide incidence in the Netherlands. It is recommended to plan (mental) health care services to be available especially at high-risk moments, at spring time, and in the beginning of January. Further research is needed to explore the protective effect of Christmas in suicide incidence.

ID SUICIDE RATES; RISK; HOMICIDE
AB There is an ongoing discussion on the relation between risk of violent behaviour and the use of antidepressants. The claim that the use of antidepressants can cause violent behaviour would gain credibility if a positive association between the two could be established.
   The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between homicide, suicide and homicide-suicide rates and the rates of antidepressant use by gender and age group.
   Nationwide data from the Netherlands on antidepressant prescriptions (ADs, SSRI and venlafaxine) and lethal violence were analysed over the 15-year period from 1994 to 2008.
   The findings indicated a significant negative association between lethal violence (homicide and suicide) and prescription of antidepressants in the Netherlands, indicating that in a period in which the exposure of the Dutch population to antidepressants increased, rates of lethal violence decreased.
   These data lend no support for an important role of antidepressant use in lethal violence.

AB Background: Several suicide and suicidal behaviour risk factors are highly prevalent in asylum seekers, but there is little insight into the suicide death rate and the suicidal behaviour incidence in this population. The main objective of this study is to assess the burden of suicide and hospital-treated non-fatal suicidal behaviour in asylum seekers in the Netherlands and to identify factors that could guide prevention.
   Methods: We obtained data on cases of suicide and suicidal behaviour from all asylum seeker reception centres in the Netherlands (period 2002-2007, age 15+). The suicide death rates in this population and in subgroups by sex, age and region of origin were compared with the rate in the Dutch population; the rates of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour were compared with that in the population of The Hague using indirect age group standardization.
   Results: The study included 35 suicide deaths and 290 cases of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour. The suicide death rate and the incidence of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour differed between subgroups by sex and region of origin. For male asylum seekers, the suicide death rate was higher than that of the Dutch population (N = 32; RR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.37-2.83). No difference was found between suicide mortality in female asylum seekers and in the female general population of the Netherlands (N = 3; RR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.15-2.07). The incidence of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour was high in comparison with the population of The Hague for males and females from Europe and the Middle East/South West Asia, and low for males and females from Africa. Health professionals knew about mental health problems prior to the suicidal behaviour for 80% of the hospital-treated suicidal behaviour cases in asylum seekers.
   Conclusions: In this study the suicide death rate was higher in male asylum seekers than in males in the reference population. The incidence of hospital-treated suicidal behaviour was higher in several subgroups of asylum seekers than that in the reference population. We conclude that measures to prevent suicide and suicidal behaviour among asylum seekers in the Netherlands are indicated.

AB During the summer of 1999, twenty-eight interviews with some of the leading authorities on the euthanasia policy were conducted in the Netherlands. They were asked: Why the Netherlands? What are the reasons that prompted the Dutch to adopt their policy? This study first provides background On the practice of euthanasia and its legal framework and then reports the interviewees' answers to the question. Multiple reasons were mentioned: historical, social, cultural, religious, and political as well as the pivotal importance of the local health-care system. A complex combination of factors brought the Netherlands to adopt a very tolerant attitude regarding euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide.

AB Background: The practice of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide has been compared between countries, but it has not been compared between regions within the Netherlands. This study assesses differences in the frequencies, characteristics, and trends of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide between five regions in the Netherlands and tries to explain the differences by demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related differences between these regions.
   Methods: Data on the frequencies, characteristics, and trends of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide for each region and each year from 2002 through 2014 were derived from the annual reports of the Regional Review Committees. Averages and trends were determined using a regression model with the regions and years as independent variables. Demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related variables for each region and each year were derived from the Central Bureau for Statistics and added to the model as covariates.
   Results: The frequencies, characteristics, and trends of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide differed between the regions, whereas the frequencies of non-assisted suicide did not differ. Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide were most frequent and were performed most often by general practitioners, in patients with cancer, in the patient's home, in North Holland. The regional differences remained after adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related differences between the regions.
   Conclusion: More detailed research is needed to specify how and why the practice of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide differs between regions in the Netherlands and to what extent these differences reflect a deficiency in the quality of care, such as other forms of regional variation in health care practice.

AB Assisted suicide has achieved an increasing importance in the international discussion of euthanasia. Developments in the Netherlands have resulted in vehement and passionate discussions. Questions of the patient's autonomy and last will have to be considered as well as the doctor's responsibility and care of the patient. When treating patients who are suicidal or express their requests for an assisted suicide, the physician has to deal with a basic ethical conflict as well as his own attitudes towards suffering, disease, old age, suicide, death and the process of dying. Legal permission for a doctor's assistance with suicide is out of the question. Not even exceptional circumstances will make a difference.

AB Homicides followed by the suicide of the perpetrator constitute a serious form of interpersonal violence. Until now no study has directly compared homicide-suicides to other violent deaths from multiple countries, allowing for a better understanding of the nature of these violent acts. Using country-specific data, this study describes and compares the incidence and patterns of homicide-suicide as well as the relationship between homicide-suicide, homicide, suicide and domestic homicide in the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United States. The results indicate that cross-nationally, homicide-suicides are more likely than other types of lethal violence to involve a female victim, multiple victims, take place in a residential setting and to be committed by a firearm. Although homicide-suicides display many similarities across the different countries, differences exist regarding age and the use of firearms in the offence. This study indicates that homicides followed by suicides differ from both homicides and suicides in similar ways internationally. Cross-national differences in the availability of firearms may explain the international variation of homicide-suicide rates and patterns. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Suicidal behaviour of young immigrant women in the Netherlands. Can we
   use Durkheim's concept of 'fatalistic suicide' to explain their high
   incidence of attempted suicide?

   Netherlands; behavioural autonomy; cultural factors
ID YOUTH
AB Young immigrant women of South Asian, Turkish and Moroccan origin in the Netherlands demonstrate disproportionate rates of non-fatal suicidal behaviour. Suicidal behaviour is usually explained from a psychological or medical tradition. However, we would like to emphasize sociological correlates, by examining the relevance of Durkheim's fatalistic suicide, characterized by overregulation. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 115 case files of young women who demonstrated suicidal behaviour, to illuminate their living conditions. The analysis included a comparison of class factors as well as psychiatric and psychological risk factors. In at least half of the cases, South Asian, Turkish and Moroccan women experienced specific stressful life events related to their family honour. Women's lives were often characterized by a lack of self-autonomy. It is concluded that the archetype of fatalistic suicide should be re-evaluated when interpreting the suicidal behaviour of young immigrant women in the Netherlands, and incorporated into strategies of prevention.

AB The European Alliance against Depression (EAAD) program is to be introduced in The Netherlands from 2017 onwards. This program to combat suicide consists of interventions on four levels: (1) increasing the awareness of suicide by local media campaigns; (2) training local gatekeepers, such as teachers or police officers; (3) targeting high-risk persons in the community; and (4) training and support of professionals in primary care settings. The implementation starts in seven Dutch pilot regions. Each region is designated as a Suicide Prevention Action NETwork (SUPRANET). This paper describes the SUPRANET program components and the evaluation of its feasibility and impact. The findings will be used to facilitate the national implementation of EAAD in The Netherlands and to add new findings to the existing literature on EAAD.

AB Euthanasia is a debatable issue. It is illegal all over the world. The Netherlands is the only country where euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are openly practised since the physician performing these acts will not be prosecuted under certain circumstances. There were several court cases and court decisions that affected the development of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in individual countries. When a patient asked for euthanasia, it was very important to find out the underlying reasons and make all legal means available to relieve the pain and other distressing symptoms.

AB Introduction: Both active euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal in The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg and, most recently, in Canada. Aim: Examination of national legislations of countries where both active euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal. The number of accomplished active euthanasia cases and that of assisted suicide cases. Method: Analysis of national statistical data. Comparison of statistical data before and after 2010. Comparison of the related practices in the surveyed countries. Results: The number of active euthanasia cases markedly predominates over the number of assisted suicide cases. Cancer is a main reason for active euthanasia, or assisted suicide. In countries with a larger population, the number of active euthanasia cases is higher than that in countries with a smaller population. Conclusions: Regarding the fact that the applicants for active euthanasia withdraw their requests in a smaller number than the applicants for assisted suicide, patients prefer the choice of active euthanasia. Since the related legislative product is too recent in Canada at present, it may be only presumed that a certain preference will also develop in the related practices in Canada.

   PHYSICIANS
AB The Netherlands, Oregon and Switzerland are the only areas in the world where assistance in dying has legally been practised in recent years. This article provides a detailed comparison of the history of the origins, legislation, monitoring systems and the extent of assistance in dying in these three places. It shows that the actual practice in Switzerland which, unlike Oregon, also allows assistance in suicide by means of infusions or gastric tubes, can today be technically quite similar to the permitted practice of active euthanasia on request in the Netherlands. Considering the preconditions restricting these practices, Swiss regulations are the most open, in that the law requires neither a medical second opinion (as in both the Netherlands and Oregon) nor the existence of a terminal illness (as in Oregon) as prerequisite to assistance in dying. In 2001, the proportion of assisted deaths (as reported to the authorities) in all deaths was almost ten times higher in the Netherlands (1.5% of all deaths) then in Oregon (<0.1% of all deaths) or Switzerland (0.2% of all deaths).
   The analysis of the different normative concepts underlying legislation reveals that in the Netherlands the basis for non-prosecution lies in the conflict of the physician's duties to respect life versus relief of suffering, while in the USA and in Switzerland the right-to-die concept plays a major role. These two concepts allow appreciation of distinctions between the roles of the physician in end-of-life practices and between assisted suicide and voluntary active euthanasia.

TI From Sin to Insanity? Suicide Trials in the Spanish Netherlands,
   Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries
SO SIXTEENTH CENTURY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID EARLY-MODERN ENGLAND; MEDIEVAL ENGLAND; VERDICTS
AB This article focuses on the relationship between suicide as an act inspired by the devil and suicide as an act of insanity in the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spanish Netherlands. It has become widely accepted that from the end of the seventeenth century on suicide became decriminalized, secularized, and medicalized, i.e., the devil disappeared from explanations for suicide and was replaced by madness, and so harsh penalties vanished. This article seeks to contribute to the complication of these notions. If one turns away from the eighteenth century as the age of change and instead focuses on the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, a broad view of coexisting and overlapping discourses about self-killings existed at an early date. By exploring the languages of demonic temptation and that of madness as judicial and discursive strategies, it is argued that both discourses competed with one another in the legal deciphering of suicide and thereby subverted any linear notion of secularization.

AB Introduction Improvement of the quality and safety of care is associated with lower suicide rates among mental healthcare patients. In The Netherlands, about 40% of all people that die by suicide is in specialist mental healthcare. Unfortunately, the degree of implementation of suicide prevention policies and best practices within Dutch mental healthcare services is variable. Sharing and comparing outcome and performance data in confidential networks of professionals working in different organisations can be effective in reducing practice variability within and across organisations and improving quality of care.
   Methods and analysis Using formats of professional networks to improve surgical care (Dutch Initiative for Clinical Auditing) and somatic intensive care (National Intensive Care Evaluation), 113 Suicide Prevention has taken the lead in the formation of a Suicide Prevention Action Network (SUPRANET Care), with at present 13 large Dutch specialist mental health institutions. Data on suicide, suicide attempts and their determinants as well as consumer care policies and practices are collected biannually, after consensus rounds in which key professionals define what data are relevant to collect, how it is operationalised, retrieved and will be analysed. To evaluate the impact of SUPRANET Care, standardised suicide rates will be calculated adjusted for confounding factors. Second, the extent to which suicide attempts are being registered will be analysed with the suicide attempt data. Finally, professionals' knowledge, attitude and adherence to suicide prevention guidelines will be measured with an extended version of the Professionals In Training to STOP suicide survey.
   Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects, The Netherlands. This study does not fall under the scope of the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO) or the General Data Protection Regulation as stated by the Dutch Data Protection Authority because data are collected on an aggregated level.

TI Natural environments and suicide mortality in the Netherlands: a
   cross-sectional, ecological study
SO LANCET PLANETARY HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Background Natural outdoor environments, such as green spaces (ie, grass, forests, or parks), blue spaces (ie, visible bodies of fresh or salt water), and coastal proximity, have been increasingly shown to promote mental health. However, little is known about how and the extent to which these natural environments are associated with suicide mortality. Our aim was to investigate whether the availability of green space and blue space within people's living environments and living next to the coast are protective against suicide mortality.
   Methods In this cross-sectional, ecological study, we analysed officially confirmed deaths by suicide between 2005 and 2014 per municipality in the Netherlands. We calculated indexes to measure the proportion of green space and blue space per municipality and the coastal proximity of each municipality using a geographical information system. We fitted Bayesian hierarchical Poisson regressions to assess associations between suicide risk, green space, blue space, and coastal proximity, adjusted for risk and protective factors.
   Findings Municipalities with a large proportion of green space (relative risk 0.879, 95% credibility interval 0.779-0.991) or a moderate proportion of green space (0.919, 0.846-0.998) showed a reduced suicide risk compared with municipalities with less green space. Green space did not differ according to urbanicity in relation to suicide. Neither blue space nor coastal proximity was associated with suicide risk. The geographical variation in the residual relative suicide risk was substantial and the south of the Netherlands was at high risk.
   Interpretation Our findings support the notion that exposure to natural environments, particularly to greenery, might have a role in reducing suicide mortality. If confirmed by future studies on an individual level, the consideration of environmental exposures might enrich suicide prevention programmes. Copyright (c) The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB IMPORTANCE The increasing legalization of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide worldwide makes it important to understand related attitudes and practices.
   OBJECTIVE To review the legal status of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide and the available data on attitudes and practices.
   EVIDENCE REVIEW Polling data and published surveys of the public and physicians, official state and country databases, interview studies with physicians, and death certificate studies (the Netherlands and Belgium) were reviewed for the period 1947 to 2016. FINDINGS Currently, euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide can be legally practiced in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Colombia, and Canada (Quebec since 2014, nationally as of June 2016). Physician-assisted suicide, excluding euthanasia, is legal in 5 US states (Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont, and California) and Switzerland. Public support for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in the United States has plateaued since the 1990s (range, 47%-69%). In Western Europe, an increasing and strong public support for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide has been reported; in Central and Eastern Europe, support is decreasing. In the United States, less than 20% of physicians report having received requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide, and 5% or less have complied. In Oregon and Washington state, less than 1% of licensed physicians write prescriptions for physician-assisted suicide per year. In the Netherlands and Belgium, about half or more of physicians reported ever having received a request; 60% of Dutch physicians have ever granted such requests. Between 0.3% to 4.6% of all deaths are reported as euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide in jurisdictions where they are legal. The frequency of these deaths increased after legalization. More than 70% of cases involved patients with cancer. Typical patients are older, white, and well-educated. Pain is mostly not reported as the primary motivation. A large portion of patients receiving physician-assisted suicide in Oregon and Washington reported being enrolled in hospice or palliative care, as did patients in Belgium. In no jurisdiction was there evidence that vulnerable patients have been receiving euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide at rates higher than those in the general population.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are increasingly being legalized, remain relatively rare, and primarily involve patients with cancer. Existing data do not indicate widespread abuse of these practices.

DE euthanasia; Dijkhuis Report; Groningen Protocol; the Netherlands;

ID END
AB During the past four decades, the Netherlands played a leading role in the debate about euthanasia and assisted suicide. Despite the claim that other countries would soon follow the Dutch legalization of euthanasia, only Belgium and the American state of Oregon did. In many countries, intense discussions took place. This article discusses some major contributions to the discussion about euthanasia and assisted suicide as written by Nigel (2004), Arthur J. Dyck (2002), Neil M. Gorsuch (2006), and John Keown (2002). They share a concern that legalization will undermine a society's respect for the inviolability and sanctity of life. Moreover, the Report of the House of Lords Select Committee on the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill (2005) is analyzed. All studies use ethical, theological, philosophical, and legal sources. All these documents include references to experiences from the Netherlands. In addition, two recent Dutch documents are analyzed which advocate further liberalization of the Dutch euthanasia practice, so as to include infants (Groningen Protocol, NVK 2005) and elderly people "suffering from life" (Dijkhuis Report, KNMG 2004).

   DEATH
AB Background and Methods: The characteristics and frequency of clinical problems with the performance of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are uncertain. We analyzed data from two studies of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in the Netherlands (one conducted in 1990 and 1991 and the other in 1995 and 1996), with a total of 649 cases. We categorized clinical problems as technical problems, such as difficulty inserting an intravenous line; complications, such as myoclonus or vomiting; or problems with completion, such as a longer-than-expected interval between the administration of medications and death.
   Results: In 114 cases, the physician's intention was to provide assistance with suicide, and in 535, the intention was to perform euthanasia. Problems of any type were more frequent in cases of assisted suicide than in cases of euthanasia. Complications occurred in 7 percent of cases of assisted suicide, and problems with completion (a longer-than-expected time to death, failure to induce coma, or induction of coma followed by awakening of the patient) occurred in 16 percent of the cases; complications and problems with completion occurred in 3 percent and 6 percent of cases of euthanasia, respectively. The physician decided to administer a lethal medication in 21 of the cases of assisted suicide (18 percent), which thus became cases of euthanasia. The reasons for this decision included problems with completion (in 12 cases) and the inability of the patient to take all the medications (in 5).
   Conclusions: There may be clinical problems with the performance of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. In the Netherlands, physicians who intend to provide assistance with suicide sometimes end up administering a lethal medication themselves because of the patient's inability to take the medication or because of problems with the completion of physician-assisted suicide.

AB Background: The Netherlands and Belgium legalized euthanasia in 2002.
   Aim: In this study we describe and compare cases of reported euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in the first 5 years of legislation.
   Design/Setting/participants: The databases of the cases reported in Belgium and the Netherlands were made available by the review committees. We compared characteristics of all cases reported between September 2002-December 2007.
   Results: In the Netherlands 10,319 cases were reported, in Belgium 1917. Gender and age distributions were similar in both countries. Most patients suffered from cancer (83-87%), but patients more often suffered from diseases of the nervous system in Belgium (8.3% vs. 3.9%). In the Netherlands, reported euthanasia more often occurred at home compared with Belgium (81% vs. 42%), where it occurred more often in hospital (52% vs. 9%). In the Netherlands, all cases were based on the oral request of a competent patient. In Belgium, 2.1% of the reported cases was based on an advance directive.
   Conclusions: We conclude that countries debating legislation must realise that the rules and procedures for euthanasia they would agree upon and the way they are codified or not into law may influence the practice that develops once the legislation is effected or what part of that practice is reported.

AB Background: There is an increased incidence of non-affective psychotic disorders (NAPD) among first- and second-generation migrants in Europe. The purpose of this population-based study was to compare the risk of suicide in Dutch natives and immigrants with or without NAPD.
   Methods: Cases of NAPD (n=12 580) from three Dutch psychiatric registers were linked to the cause of death register of Statistics Netherlands and were compared to matched controls (n=244 792) from the population register, who had no such diagnosis. Hazard ratios (HRs) of suicide were estimated and adjusted for age and gender by Cox regression analysis.
   Results: The presence of NAPD was strongly associated with suicide risk in each ethnic group. However, for all ethnic minority groups the HRs were somewhat lower than among Dutch natives, for whom the HR was 23.4 (95%-CI; 18.5-29.7). A closer examination revealed that suicide risk was influenced by the history of migration. While the risk for immigrants of the first generation, diagnosed with NAPD, was significantly lower than that for native Dutch patients (HR=0.45; 95%-CI: 0.28-0.73), the risk for those of the second generation was more similar to that for the Dutch (HR=0.85; 95%-CI: 0.51-1.40) (P value of history of migration=0.005).
   Conclusion: Immigrants diagnosed with NAPD of the first generation appear to be protected against suicide, whereas this protection is waning among those of the second generation. This is the first study worldwide on suicide in migrants with NAPD and the first study of suicide in patients with NAPD in the Netherlands. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recent studies suggested a favorable association between the ethnic density of the neighborhood and the risk of psychotic disorders among ethnic minorities. In this study, it was investigated whether this so-called 'ethnic density hypothesis' is also relevant to suicide risk, which is not sensitive to bias associated with ethnic differences in access to health care and reflects a broad range of mental health problems.
   Suicides in the four big cities in the Netherlands during 2000-2011 were ascertained using the cause of death register of Statistics Netherlands and analyzed in a multilevel Poisson model in relation to individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics.
   With increasing non-Western minority density, the adjusted rate ratio (RR) of suicide in non-Western immigrants compared to native Dutch persons decreased from 0.69 to 0.39 (P < 0.001). This was explained by higher suicide rates among Dutch persons (RR = 1.28, P = 0.048) and lower rates among non-Western persons (RR = 0.72, P = 0.004) in neighborhoods with high (> 55.9 %) compared to neighborhoods with low non-Western minority density (< 36.5 %). Similar results were found for Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese/Antillean and other non-Western subgroups separately. Compared to personally matched controls, non-Western cases (i.e., those who committed suicide) more often moved house to own-group high-dense areas and less often to own-group low-dense areas in the 5 years prior to suicide.
   Our findings support the beneficial influence of the presence of the own ethnic group in the neighborhood on suicide risk among non-Western minorities. As moving to minority more dense areas prior to suicide was observed, this influence of ethnic density as measured on population level may have been underestimated.

TI End-of-life practices in the Netherlands under The Euthanasia Act
SO NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID TERMINAL SEDATION; DECISION-MAKING; DEATH; EXPERIENCES; BELGIUM;
   OPIOIDS; CARE
AB BACKGROUND:
   In 2002, an act regulating the ending of life by a physician at the request of a patient with unbearable suffering came into effect in the Netherlands. In 2005, we performed a follow-up study of euthanasia, physician-assisted suicide, and other end-of-life practices.
   METHODS:
   We mailed questionnaires to physicians attending 6860 deaths that were identified from death certificates. The response rate was 77.8%.
   RESULTS:
   In 2005, of all deaths in the Netherlands, 1.7% were the result of euthanasia and 0.1% were the result of physician-assisted suicide. These percentages were significantly lower than those in 2001, when 2.6% of all deaths resulted from euthanasia and 0.2% from assisted suicide. Of all deaths, 0.4% were the result of the ending of life without an explicit request by the patient. Continuous deep sedation was used in conjunction with possible hastening of death in 7.1% of all deaths in 2005, significantly increased from 5.6% in 2001. In 73.9% of all cases of euthanasia or assisted suicide in 2005, life was ended with the use of neuromuscular relaxants or barbiturates; opioids were used in 16.2% of cases. In 2005, 80.2% of all cases of euthanasia or assisted suicide were reported. Physicians were most likely to report their end-of-life practices if they considered them to be an act of euthanasia or assisted suicide, which was rarely true when opioids were used.
   CONCLUSIONS:
   The Dutch Euthanasia Act was followed by a modest decrease in the rates of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. The decrease may have resulted from the increased application of other end-of-life care interventions, such as palliative sedation.

ID VIEWS
AB This article presents the attitudes of nurses towards three issues concerning their role in euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. A questionnaire survey was conducted with 1509 nurses who were employed in hospitals, home care organizations and nursing homes. The study was conducted in the Netherlands between January 2001 and August 2004. The results show that less than half (45%) of nurses would be willing to serve on committees reviewing cases of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. More than half of the nurses (58.2%) found it too far-reaching to oblige physicians to consult a nurse in the decision-making process. The majority of the nurses stated that preparing euthanatics (62.9%) and inserting an infusion needle to administer the euthanatics (54.1%) should not be accepted as nursing tasks. The findings are discussed in the context of common practices and policies in the Netherlands, and a recommendation is made not to include these three issues in new regulations on the role of nurses in euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide.

AB Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disease that causes progressive paralysis leading to respiratory failure. Patients with ALS may consider physician-assisted suicide. However, it is not known how many patients, if given the option, would actually decide to end their lives by physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia nor at what stage of the disease they would choose to do so.
   Methods: We identified physicians of 279 patients in the Netherlands with a diagnosis of ALS who died between 1994 and 1999. Physicians were asked to fill out a validated questionnaire about the end-of-life decisions that were made. Of 241 eligible physicians, 203 returned the questionnaire (84 percent).
   Results: Of the 203 patients, 35 (17 percent) chose euthanasia and died that way. An additional six patients (3 percent) died as a result of physician-assisted suicide. Patients to whom religion was important were less likely to have died as a result of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. The choice of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide was not associated with any particular characteristics of the disease or of the patient's care, nor was it associated with income or educational level. Disability before death was significantly more severe in patients who died as a result of euthanasia than among those who died in other ways. Physician-assisted suicide appeared to occur somewhat earlier in the course of the disease than did euthanasia. An additional 48 patients (24 percent) received palliative treatment, which probably shortened their lives.
   Conclusions: In the Netherlands, we found that one in five patients with ALS died as a result of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. (N Engl J Med 2002;346:1638-44.) Copyright (C) 2002 Massachusetts Medical Society.

AB Across the 10 westerly and 6 easterly states of Germany, better-than-average school-end grades, taken as a proxy for intelligence, corresponded to higher regional suicide rates. This finding adds to similar evidence from other countries (Austria, Belarus, British Isles, Denmark, Netherlands, and USA), suggestive of positive ecologic (group-level) associations between indicators for cognitive ability and suicide prevalence, whilst off setting prior inconclusive evidence for Germany from Voracek (2006) on the same question.

AB In the Netherlands, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) are considered acceptable medical practices in specific circumstances. The majority of cases of euthanasia and PAS involve patients suffering from cancer. However, in 1994 the Dutch Supreme Court in the so-called Chabot-case ruled that "the seriousness of the suffering of the patient does not depend on the cause of the suffering", thereby rejecting a distinction between physical (or somatic) and mental suffering. This opened the way for further debate about the acceptability of PAS in cases of serious and refractory mental illness. An important objection against offering PAS to mentally ill patients is that this might reinforce loss of hope, and demoralization. Based on an analysis of a reported case, this argument is evaluated. It is argued that offering PAS to a patient with a mental illness who suffers unbearably, enduringly and without prospect of relief does not necessarily imply taking away hope and can be ethically acceptable.

   of ethical decisions concerning suicide and euthanasia - A focus on the

SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR EVANGELISCHE ETHIK
LA German
DT Article
AB The author, former Minister of Justice in Germany, focuses on problems arising in the codification of ethical decisions concerning assistance in suicide, as it occurs in the Netherlands. He appreciates the precautions taken in Netherland's law to prevent abuse of the legalization of certain kinds of euthanasia. He states that the declared intention of a dying person to end his or her life is to be respected. Compassion and sympathy which finally lead to aiding the moribund person in suicide might be understandable although strictly forbidden. This ends up in a conflict which can not be subject to legal statutes but has to be a matter of a very serious decision of conscience. Thus, aid in suicide can not be allowed by law in general. The author claims that the focus on everyone's own responsible decision is a genuine position of Protestant ethics.

AB In this ecological study, we investigated whether help-seeking related to stigma, intentions, and attitudes toward suicide are associated with the suicide rates of 20 regions within the Netherlands and Belgium. Significant associations were found between regional suicide rates and the intention to seek informal help (=-1.47, p=.001), self-stigma (=1.33, p=.038), and shame (=.71, p=.030). The association between self-stigma and suicide rate was mediated by intentions to seek informal help. These results suggest that to promote suicide prevention at the level of the regional population, stigma, shame, and intentions to seek help should be targeted in the public domain.

AB Research on homicides followed by suicides has largely relied on very localized samples and relatively short time spans of data. As a result, little is known about the extent to which patterns within cases of homicide-suicides are geographically specific. The current study seeks to help fill this gap by comparing twenty years of homicide- suicide data for Sweden and a large U.S. county. Although some of the underlying patterns in the two countries are similar (e.g., decreasing rates), a number of important differences emerge, particularly with respect to incidence, weapons used, perpetrator age, and relationship of the perpetrator to the victim.

AB This article focuses on the legality of euthanasia and assisted suicide in the Netherlands. Euthanasia and assisted suicide are allowed in certain cases, but there is no consensus with respect to the extent of the situations in which physicians should not be prosecuted. I argue that the individual, and, more specifically, his suffering, should be the focal point, and that the present legislation falls short in this respect; no solution can as yet be offered to individuals whose suffering cannot be resolved through medical means and which cannot be subsumed under the terms the law specifies.

AB Until recently, suicides of mental health care users in the Netherlands had to be reported to the Health Care Inspectorate by treating clinicians and medical directors. Interview data from 38 clinicians who reported a suicide and directors of the 28 facilities where they worked indicated ambivalence about the procedure's usefulness, especially about the blame implied by the required reporting procedure. No interviewee reported that a suicide could have been prevented. In May 2011 the national policy was changed so that most suicides can be reported in a blame-free manner within the facility and fewer suicides must be reported to the inspectorate.

ID DISORDERS
AB Background: The objective of this study is to investigate mental healthcare status and psychiatric disorders in train suicides.
   Methods: Data of 4 published train suicide studies were combined with a study of 57 train suicides in The Netherlands.
   Results: 53% of all train suicides received psychiatric care at the time of suicide, with 49% of them being inpatients. These values are higher than those found in general suicides. When compared to general suicides, functional non-affective psychoses are overrepresented by 25% vs 14%. The percentage of affective disorders approximates that of general suicides namely: 39% vs 42%. "Other diagnoses" are underrepresented by 23% vs 40%.
   Limitations: All psychiatric diagnoses were based on clinical data, which may not accurately reflect the patient's psychiatric condition at the time of suicide.
   Conclusions: Train suicides receive mental healthcare more often than general suicides and are more often characterized by severe psychopathology. The study indicates that patients with affective and psychotic disorders in particular should be targeted in order to prevent train suicide. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using 4 cohorts of participants, authors generated SASH items and evaluated them with factor and content analyses and internal consistency statistics. The final measure was assessed for reliability and validity with collateral measures. The SASH assesses variables related to method, lethality and impulsivity of the act, likelihood of rescue, suicide intent or ambivalence and other motivations, consequences, and habitual self-injury. The SASH was found to have very good interrater reliability and adequate validity.

AB In the Netherlands, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are still subject to the penal code, but if the requirements for prudent practice are met, a physician can expect not to be prosecuted. This chapter will present data on the incidence of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, the circumstances under which it takes place and the quality assurance of its practice. In both 1990 and in 1995, nationwide studies were carried out to address these topics. They consisted of a death certificate study, in which the attending physicians of a stratified sample of deaths received a questionnaire, and interview study, in which a stratified sample of physicians were interviewed about their experiences with end-of-life decisions. Furthermore, the results of the evaluation of the project 'Support and Consultation on Euthanasia in Amsterdam' (SCEA), a project aimed at professionalizing consultation of another physician in cases of euthanasia, are described.
   In the Netherlands, in 1995 approximately 9700 explicit request for euthanasia were made, resulting in some 3600 cases of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. This is a slight increase compared to 1990, but there are no indicators to suggest that there is an increase in the practice of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide among vulnerable patient groups. In 1990, 18% of all cases were reported to the Public Prosecutor, whereas in 1995, 41% of all cases were reported. The SCEA project supported family physicians and increased the quality of consultations. Therefore networks like SCEA are being set up all over the country.

AB Consultation with another physician is considered to be an important safeguard of the practice of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. The objective is to describe the frequency and characteristics of consultation in cases of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (EAS) in the Netherlands, Data from two cross-sectional descriptive nationwide surveys, carried out in 1995, were used. Questionnaires were mailed to physicians attending 6060 deaths, identified from death certificates, and a stratified sample of 405 physicians were interviewed. In 1990, a cross-sectional descriptive postal survey of a random sample of 1042 general practitioners took place. Consultation took place in 63% of cases of EAS in the Netherlands, in 99% of the cases reported to the public prosecutor and in approximately 37% of unreported cases. In almost half of the unreported cases the decision had been discussed less formally with at least one colleague. In 1990, 7% of general practitioners met all 8 criteria for good consultation; this increased to 64% in 1995. Of the respondents, 26% had at some time advised against performing euthanasia or assisted suicide when acting as a consultant. This study shows that approximately two thirds of all cases of EAS are safeguarded by consultation. Although in the majority of these cases the consultation is of good quality, there is certainly still room for improvement. The quality of consultation could be improved, for instance, by appointing independent and specifically trained consultants. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this article is to describe the practice of psychiatric consultation with regard to explicit requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide in the Netherlands. Written questionnaires were sent to an unselected sample of 673 Dutch psychiatrists, about half of all such specialists in the Netherlands. The response rate was 83%. Of the respondents, 36% (199 of 549) had at least once been consulted about a patient's request for physician-assisted death. The annual number of such psychiatric consultations is estimated to be 400 (about 4% of all requests for physician-assisted death). About one in four consultations is initiated by another psychiatrist. Consultants were mainly asked to assess whether the patient had a treatable mental disorder (68%) or whether the patient's request was well considered (66%). Assessment of the influence of transference and countertransference was less frequently sought (24%). Of the 221 consultation cases described, 67 (30%) ended in euthanasia or assisted suicide, whereas another 124 (56%) did not. In most, but not all, cases where the patient's request for physician-assisted death was refused, the respondent had judged that the request was not well considered or that the patient had a treatable mental disorder, or that the decision-making was influenced by transference and countertransference. We conclude that psychiatric consultation for patients requesting physician-assisted death in the Netherlands is rare, as in other countries. The issue of psychiatric consultation with regard to requests for physician-assisted death, especially in patients with a physical disease, needs to be further addressed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: This study was performed to investigate the availability, content and quality of local guidelines for the assessment of suicide attempters in the Netherlands.
   Method: All university and general hospitals in the Netherlands were asked to provide their local guidelines. Published national guidelines and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Education (AGREE) instrument were used to evaluate the content and quality of the local guidelines.
   Results: Eighty-eight hospitals (90.7%) responded; 34 (38.6%) reported that they used local guidelines. Twenty-seven guidelines were submitted for evaluation. Most of the guidelines were more than 5 years old and had not been updated recently. The contents of the guidelines differed. Criteria addressing patient safety, staff attitude toward patients, reassessment of nonalert patients, relevant stressors, involvement of significant others and aftercare were found in less than 50% of the guidelines. Although psychiatric consultation was incorporated in almost 80%, the psychiatrist's tasks were specified infrequently. The guidelines seldom required monitoring of staff compliance. Only in the AGREE domain "clarity and presentation" was the mean score above 60% of the maximum. According to the instructions for the AGREE instrument, 10 (37.0%) of the 27 guidelines were recommended (with provisos or alterations) and I was strongly recommended for use in practice.
   Conclusions: In the Netherlands, a minority of hospitals reported use of local guidelines for the assessment of suicide attempters. When available, the guidelines were mostly not based on international standards, their contents varied greatly and their quality was unsatisfactory. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide rates may be affected by world news. Our objective was to investigate the possible impact of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, on suicidal behavior in the Netherlands. There was evidence of an increase in rates of suicide and deliberate self-harm in the weeks immediately following the attacks. These findings contrast with Durkheim's (1897) original suggestion that suicide rates decline in times of war and outside threat but are in line with findings of increases in suicidal behavior after media coverage of lethal violence.

AB Background: The gatekeeper training is designed to help identify suicidal individuals, respond to suicidal ideation and refer to help. The internationally widely used training shows promising results. This is the first study presenting its effectiveness in the Netherlands and the first study investigating the effect in different employment sectors.
   Methods: In an observational study, 113 Suicide Prevention - the Dutch suicide prevention expertise centre and lifeline - trained 526 professionals as gatekeepers. Changes in gatekeepers' identifying and referral behaviour, knowledge of suicide prevention and skills-confidence were studied, using a pre-post (6 weeks after training) self-report questionnaire. Outcomes were analyzed with General Linear Model (GLM) repeated measures with four employment sectors (healthcare-, educational-, socioeconomic and other sectors) as a between-subjects factor.
   Results: Pre-post self-reports of 174 respondents showed no change in the identification of suicidal people, referrals to the general practitioner (GP) or lifeline 113, but significant improvement in professionals' knowledge and confidence (p < .001). Results did not differ between employment sectors.
   Conclusions: The gatekeeper training significantly increases suicide prevention knowledge and skills confidence in abilities to address suicidality. Healthcare, education, socioeconomic and other professionals (e.g. security, justice, transport, church workers) benefit similarly from the training. Increasing the number of gatekeeper training programs in all sectors is recommended.

AB Relationships between bullying features and suicidal behavior of inmates were examined. The files of 95 suicide victims in jails and prisons in the Netherlands were examined for reports of bullying. In addition, 221 nonsuicidal jail inmates and 53 suicidal jail inmates were interviewed. The files of 34% of the suicide victims noted that the suicide victim had felt bullied. Bullying. especially serious bullying, was relatively often reported by suicidal inmates and by vulnerable inmates. Different types of bullies were associated with different forms of bullying and different degrees of suicide risk. Results suggest that bullying and suicide risk are related and that a distinction should be made between mild and serious features of bullying.

AB Objective
   To review the empirical claims made in: Pereira J. Legalizing euthanasia or assisted suicide: the illusion of safeguards and controls. Curr Oncol 2011;18:e38-45.
   Design
   We collected all of the empirical claims made by Jose Pereira in "Legalizing euthanasia or assisted suicide: the illusion of safeguards and controls." We then collected all reference sources provided for those claims. We compared the claims with the sources (where sources were provided) and evaluated the level of support, if any, the sources provide for the claims. We also reviewed other available literature to assess the veracity of the empirical claims made in the paper. We then wrote the present paper using examples from the review.
   Results
   Pereira makes a number of factual statements without providing any sources. Pereira also makes a number of factual statements with sources, where the sources do not, in fact, provide support for the statements he made. Pereira also makes a number of false statements about the law and practice in jurisdictions that have legalized euthanasia or assisted suicide.
   Conclusions
   Pereira's conclusions are not supported by the evidence he provided. His paper should not be given any credence in the public policy debate about the legal status of assisted suicide and euthanasia in Canada and around the world.

AB Dutch euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide stand on the eve of important legal changes. In the summer of 1999, a new government bill concerning euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide was sent to Parliament for discussion. This bill legally embodies a ground for exemption from punishment for physicians who conduct euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide and comply with certain requirements. On November 28, 2000, the Dutch parliament approved an adapted version of this bill. Since the approval by the Dutch Senate can be regarded as a formality, it is expected that the bill will come into force in the course of this year (2001). In this paper we discuss these new developments.

TI Non-physician-assisted suicide in The Netherlands: a cross-sectional
   survey among the general public
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID EUTHANASIA; LIFE; END; REQUESTS
AB Context In The Netherlands, approximately 45% of patients' requests for euthanasia are granted by a physician. After a rejected request, some patients approach non-physicians and ask them for assistance in suicide. Recently, a non-physician who assisted his mother's suicide was declared guilty without punishment.
   Aim The aim of the current study was to investigate the opinion of the Dutch general public on non-physician-assisted suicide.
   Methods A cross-sectional survey among the Dutch general public was performed. A total of 1113 respondents were included (response rate 80%). The survey covered two case descriptions in which a patient asks a non-physician for assisted suicide after a non-granted request for physician-assisted dying. In both cases, a son, friend or professional facilitates the suicide by either the provision of information or the purchase of lethal medication. Respondents were invited to give their opinion on these cases and in addition on 10 propositions on non-physician-assisted suicide.
   Results When a son provides information on how to acquire lethal medication in case of a patient with a terminal illness, this involvement is accepted by 62% of the respondents. The actual purchase of lethal medication receives less support (38%). If the patient suffers without a serious disease, both forms of assistance are less accepted (46% and 24%, respectively). In addition, only 21% support the legalisation of non-physician-assisted suicide. The Dutch public prefer involvement of a physician in assisted suicide (69%).
   Conclusions The Dutch general public consider non-physician-assisted suicide in some specific cases a tolerable alternative for patients with a rejected request for physician-assisted dying if the assistance is limited to the provision of information. However, the majority do not support the legalisation of non-physician-assisted suicide.

AB Introduction Environmental exposures are intertwined with mental health outcomes. People are exposed to the environments in which they currently live, and to a multitude of environments along their daily movements and through their residential relocations. However, most research assumes that people are immobile, disregarding that such dynamic exposures also serve as stressors or buffers potentially associated with depression and suicide risk. The aim of the Dynamic Urban Environmental Exposures on Depression and Suicide (NEEDS) study is to examine how dynamic environmental exposures along people's daily movements and over their residential histories affect depression and suicide mortality in the Netherlands.
   Methods and analysis The research design comprises two studies emphasising the temporality of exposures. First, a cross-sectional study is assessing how daily exposures correlate with depression. A nationally representative survey was administered to participants recruited through stratified random sampling of the population aged 18-65 years. Survey data were enriched with smartphone-based data (eg, Global Positioning System tracking, Bluetooth sensing, social media usage, communication patterns) and environmental exposures (eg, green and blue spaces, noise, air pollution). Second, a longitudinal population register study is addressing the extent to which past environmental exposures over people's residential history affect suicide risk later in life. Statistical and machine learning-based models are being developed to quantify environment-health relations.
   Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval (FETC17-060) was granted by the Ethics Review Board of Utrecht University, The Netherlands. Project-related findings will be disseminated at conferences and in peer-reviewed journal papers.

ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE
AB Empirical data on the rate of euthanasia, physician-assisted suicide, and other end-of-life decisions have greatly contributed to the debate about the role of such practices in modern health care. In the Netherlands, the continuing debate about whether and when physician-assisted dying is acceptable seems to be resulting in a gradual stabilisation of end-of-life practices. We replicated interview and death-certificate studies done in 1990 and 1995 to investigate whether end-of-life practices had altered between 1995 and 2001. Since 1995, the demand for physician-assisted death has not risen among patients and physicians, who seem to have become somewhat more reluctant in their attitude towards this practice.

AB Homicide-suicides, the murder of one or several individuals followed by the suicide of the perpetrator, are rare but have devastating effects on families and communities. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing perpetrators of homicide-suicides with perpetrators of simple homicides and suicides and examined the proportion of firearm use and its correlation with firearm availability. We searched Medline and Embase from inception to July 2012 and identified 27 eligible studies. Perpetrators of homicide-suicides were older and more likely to be male and married to or separated from their victims than perpetrator of simple homicides or suicides. Influence of alcohol and a history of domestic violence or unemployment were less prevalent in homicide-suicides than in homicides. The proportion of firearm use in homicide-suicides varied across countries and was highest in the USA, Switzerland and South Africa, followed by Australia, Canada, The Netherlands and England and Wales, with a strong correlation between the use of firearms and the level of civilian gun ownership in the country. Our results indicate that homicide-suicides represent a distinct entity, with characteristics distinguishing them both from homicides and suicides. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In 2014, there was still a shortage of available organs for transplantation, and 1044 patients were waiting for an organ in the Netherlands. Maximizing the pool of organ donors is part of the solution. In 2001, the Dutch Termination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide Act was adopted, legalizing euthanasia under strict conditions. In 2010, 3136 reports were made of euthanasia and assisted suicide; in 2014, 5306 reports were made. Among them were patients with a desire to donate their organs after their deaths. Although a potential source of donor organs, only a few cases of organ donation after active euthanasia have been described. Since 2012, 16 combinations of these procedures have been performed in the Netherlands. The literature mentions 16 Belgian cases between 2005 and 2013. This limited number can be the result of lack of knowledge about this subject among healthcare professionals or because of practical, ethical, and/or legal considerations. Performing this combination has possible advantages, both in number as well as in transplantation outcomes. By describing a recent case in our center, we will try to outline the state of the art in the Netherlands and disseminate knowledge about the possibilities and limitations of organ donation after active euthanasia.

ID EUTHANASIA; DEPRESSION
AB In suicidology, the common view is that 'rational' suicides occur only rarely, because the competence of people who want to end their lives is compromised by mental illness. In the Netherlands and Flanders, however, patients' requests for euthanasia or assistance in suicide are granted in 5300 and 1400 cases a year respectively, and in all these cases at least two doctors have confirmed the patient's competence. The combination of these two findings is puzzling. In other countries one would expect at least some of these people to end their own lives. The article argues that we can distinguish between two types of suicide with clustering characteristics. In cases of the first type, the agent doesn't carefully plan his action, doesn't communicate his plans to relatives or others, and uses violent means. In such cases it is reasonable to presume lack of competence. The other type has the opposite characteristics. The most plausible explanation of our problem is that suicides of the second kind are invisible to suicidology, because they tend not to be registered as suicides at all.

AB The highly charged debate about the moral status of assisted suicide features regularly in the news media in medically advanced countries. In the United Kingdom, the debate has been dominated in recent years by a new mode of death: assisted suicide in Switzerland, so-called suicide tourism. Drawing on in-depth interviews with people who were actively planning on going to Switzerland,' alongside participant-observation at a do-it-yourself self-deliverance workshop, I discuss how participants arrived at their decision to seek professionalized assistance. In doing so, I explore the constituent elements of people's suffering, examining how participants justified, rationalized, or sought authentication from a doctor for their decision to die in light of their own belief systems and aesthetic preferences for a good death.

ID TRAUMATIC GRIEF; HEALTH; IMPLEMENTATION
AB Methods. A cross-sectional survey among 488 GPs in the northern part of The Netherlands.
   Results. A 44% response was achieved (n = 214) during the last 3 years, 38 (18%) were exposed to suicide, 21 (10%) to help requests without being exposed to suicide and 52 (24%) to both suicide and help requests. Out of 106 requests, 69 (65%) were handled by the GP; 60 (57%) were either directly or additionally referred, principally for mental health care. Suicide exposure and female gender were associated with the doctor's perception that follow-up care following a loss through suicide is useful. The perception that help is useful increased the likelihood of GPs' referral for evidence-based follow-up care.
   Conclusions. GPs support the availability of evidence-based follow-up care for relatives of suicide victims. To modify GPs' key role in referring relatives for it, GPs should be well informed of its usefulness and to whom.

AB The debate surrounding the legalization of assisted suicide continues despite a limited body of empirical research. Relatively few studies have addressed interest in assisted suicide or the desire for hastened death (rather than approval of legalization) among medically ill patients, and this literature is plagued hy methodological limitations. ill general, this research has demonstrated a significant association between depression and desire for death; however, the magnitude of this association is unclear. Nevertheless, psychological and social factors have typically appeared more influential in determining patients' desire for death than physical symptoms such as pain. The impact of these findings on future legislative efforts to legalize assisted suicide is discussed.

AB Background: Evidence on the effect of community social capital on suicide mortality rates is fragmentary and inconsistent. The present study aims to determine whether geographic variations in suicide mortality across the Netherlands were associated with community social capital.
   Methods: We included 3507 neighbourhoods with 6207 suicide deaths in the period 1995-2000. For each neighbourhood, we measured perceived social capital using information from interview surveys, and we measured structural aspects of social capital using population registers. Associations with mortality were determined using Poisson regression analysis with control for confounders at individual level (age, sex, marital status, country of origin) and area level (area income, population density, religious orientation).
   Results: Suicide mortality rates were related to the measure of perceived social capital. Mortality rates were 8 percent higher (95% confidence interval (CI): 2 to 16 percent) in areas with low capital. In stratified analyses, this difference was found to be significantly larger among men (12 percent, CI: 2 to 22) than women (1 percent, CI: -9 to 13), larger among those age 0-50 (18 percent, CI: 8 to 29) than older residents (-2 percent, CI: -12 to 8), and larger among the unmarried (30 percent, CI: 16-45) than the married (-2 percent, CI: -12 to 9). Associations with the structural aspect of social capital were in the same direction, but weaker, and not statistically significant.
   Conclusions: This study contributed some evidence to assume a modest effect of community social capital on suicide mortality rates. This effect may be restricted to specific population groups such as younger unmarried men.

AB Objective: Multifaceted evidence (family, twin, adoption, molecular genetic, geographic and surname studies of suicide) suggests genetic risk factors for suicide. Migrant studies are also informative in this context, but underused. In particular, a meta-analysis of the associations of immigrant (IMM) and country-of-birth (COB) suicide rates is unavailable.
   Method: Thirty-three studies, reporting IMM suicide rates for nearly 50 nationalities in seven host countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, England, the Netherlands, Sweden and the USA), were retrieved.
   Results: Total-population IMM and COB suicide rates were strongly positively associated (combined rank-order correlation across 20 eligible studies: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.56-0.73, P < 10(-9)). The effect generalized across both sexes, host countries and study periods.
   Conclusion: Following the logic of the migrant study design of genetic epidemiology, the correspondence of IMM and COB suicide rates is consistent with the assumption of population differences in the prevalence of genetic risk factors for suicide.

AB Background Physicians who receive a request for euthanasia or assisted suicide may experience a conflict of duties: the duty to preserve life on the one hand and the duty to relieve suffering on the other hand. Little is known about experiences of physicians with receiving and granting a request for euthanasia or assisted suicide. This study, therefore, aimed to explore the concerns, feelings and pressure experienced by physicians who receive requests for euthanasia or assisted suicide. Methods In 2016, a cross-sectional study was conducted. Questionnaires were sent to a random sample of 3000 Dutch physicians. Physicians who had been working in adult patient care in the Netherlands for the last year were included in the sample (n = 2657). Half of the physicians were asked about the most recent case in which they refused a request for euthanasia or assisted suicide, and half about the most recent case in which they granted a request for euthanasia or assisted suicide. Results Of the 2657 eligible physicians, 1374 (52%) responded. The most reported reason not to participate was lack of time. Of the respondents, 248 answered questions about a refused euthanasia or assisted suicide request and 245 about a granted EAS request. Concerns about specific aspects of the euthanasia and assisted suicide process, such as the emotional burden of preparing and performing euthanasia or assisted suicide were commonly reported by physicians who refused and who granted a request. Pressure to grant a request was mostly experienced by physicians who refused a request, especially if the patient was >= 80 years, had a life-expectancy of >= 6 months and did not have cancer. The large majority of physicians reported contradictory emotions after having performed euthanasia or assisted suicide. Conclusions Society should be aware of the impact of euthanasia and assisted suicide requests on physicians. The tension physicians experience may decrease their willingness to perform euthanasia and assisted suicide. On the other hand, physicians should not be forced to cross their own moral boundaries or be tempted to perform euthanasia and assisted suicide in cases that may not meet the due care criteria.

AB Purpose Accessibility and availability of mental health care services are necessary but not sufficient for people to seek help for psychological problems. Attitudes and stigma related to help seeking also determine help seeking intentions. The aim of this study is to investigate how cross-national differences in attitudes and stigma within the general population are related to professional and informal help seeking intentions in low and high suicide rate regions.
   Methods By means of a postal structured questionnaire, data of 2999 Dutch and Flemish respondents between 18 and 65 years were gathered. Attitudes toward help seeking, perceived stigma, self-stigma, shame and intention to seek help were assessed.
   Results People in the Netherlands, where suicide rates are low, have more positive attitudes toward help seeking and experience less self stigma and shame compared to the people in Flanders, where suicide rates are relatively high. These attitudinal factors predicted professional as well as informal help seeking intentions. Perceived stigma was negatively associated with informal help seeking. Shame was positively associated with higher intention to use psychotropic drugs and perceived stigma was negatively associated with the intention to seek help from a psychotherapist in Flanders but not in the Netherlands.
   Conclusion Help seeking for psychological problems prevent these problems to aggravate and it is assumed to be a protective factor for suicide. Our results stress the importance of the promotion of positive attitudes and the reduction of stigma within the general population to facilitate help seeking from professional providers and informal networks. Focusing on these attitudinal factors is believed to be a key aspect of universal mental health and suicide prevention policies.

AB BackgroundThe main objectives of the mobile Psychiatric Emergency Services (PES) in the Netherlands are to assess the presence of a mental disorder, to estimate risk to self or others, and to initiate continuity of care, including psychiatric hospital admission. The aim of this study was to assess the associations between the level of suicidality and risk of voluntary or involuntary admission in patients with and without a personality disorder who were presented to mobile PES.MethodsObservational data were obtained in three areas of the Netherlands from 2007 to 2016. In total, we included 71,707 contacts of patients aged 18 to 65years. The outcome variable was voluntary or involuntary psychiatric admission. Suicide risk and personality disorder were assessed by PES-clinicians. Multivariable regression analysis was used to explore associations between suicide risk, personality disorder, and voluntary or involuntary admission.ResultsIndependently of the level of suicide risk, suicidal patients diagnosed with personality disorder were less likely to be admitted voluntarily than those without such a diagnosis (admission rate .37 versus .46 respectively). However, when the level of suicide risk was moderate or high, those with a personality disorder who were admitted involuntarily had the same probability of involuntary admission as those without such a disorder.ConclusionsWhile the probability of voluntary admission was lower in those diagnosed with a personality disorder, independent of the level of suicidality, the probability of involuntary admission was only lower in those whose risk of suicide was low. Future longitudinal studies should investigate the associations between (involuntary) admission and course of suicidality in personality disorder.

DT Article
ID ASSISTED SUICIDE; UNITED-STATES; EUTHANASIA; NETHERLANDS
AB Objective: To investigate the emotional feelings reported by physicians in the Netherlands after having performed euthanasia or other medical end-of-life decisions.
   Design: Nationwide interview study in the Netherlands, November 1995 through February 1996.
   Participants and setting: A random sample of 405 physicians (general practitioners, nursing home physicians, and clinical specialists).
   Main outcome measures: Subsequent feelings of physicians about their most recent cases (if any) of euthanasia, assisted suicide, life-ending without an explicit request from the patient, and alleviation of pain and other symptoms with high doses of opioids.
   Results: The response rate was 89%. In 52% of all cases of hastening death, physicians had feelings of comfort afterwards, which included feelings of satisfaction in 44% and of relief in 13%. Feelings of discomfort were reported in 42%, most frequently referred to as emotional (28%) or burdensome (25%). Feelings of discomfort were highest for euthanasia (75%; P < 0.000). 95% of physicians were willing to perform euthanasia or assisted suicide again in similar situations. Afterwards, 5% had doubts, but none had regrets, about performing euthanasia.
   Conclusions. Hastening the death of a patient evokes different feelings among physicians. Although performing euthanasia is often experienced as burdensome and emotional, granting the ultimate wish of a competent patient may also give physicians a feeling of having contributed to the quality of the dying process.

AB Previous research has shown for the most part positive correlations between intelligence and suicide prevalence on the national level. However, this study found proxies for regional intelligence in Australia (international average domain scores from the PISA 2000 study) to be significantly negatively correlated with the total, male, and female suicide rates of the different administrative divisions of Australia, and this finding was independent of regional wealth. A research synthesis of the current results and those from similar studies of other countries (positive correlations for Austria, Belarus, The British Isles, Denmark, and The Netherlands; inconclusive findings for France, Germany, and the USA) was conducted. This synthesis of research findings showed that positive ecological correlations of intelligence with suicide rate were more likely observed for nations with higher suicide rates and poorer general living conditions, whereas there was no relation with national IQ.

AB Background:Legal in some European countries and US states, physician-assisted suicide and voluntary active euthanasia remain under debate in these and other countries.Objectives:The aim of the study was to examine numbers, characteristics, and trends over time for assisted dying in regions where these practices are legal: Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Oregon, Washington, and Montana.Design:This was a systematic review of journal articles and official reports. Medline and Embase databases were searched for relevant studies, from inception to end of 2012. We searched the websites of the health authorities of all eligible countries and states for reports on physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia and included publications that reported on cases of physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia. We extracted information on the total number of assisted deaths, its proportion in relation to all deaths, and socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals assisted to die.Results:A total of 1043 publications were identified; 25 articles and reports were retained, including series of reported cases, physician surveys, and reviews of death certificates. The percentage of physician-assisted deaths among all deaths ranged from 0.1%-0.2% in the US states and Luxembourg to 1.8%-2.9% in the Netherlands. Percentages of cases reported to the authorities increased in most countries over time. The typical person who died with assistance was a well-educated male cancer patient, aged 60-85 years.Conclusions:Despite some common characteristics between countries, we found wide variation in the extent and specific characteristics of those who died an assisted death.

AB Introduction: Annually about 28% of the 5800 death of unnatural cause in the Netherlands are a result of suicide. In 2012 and 2013 a movie and a book were published about a "dignified end of life" which also described the suicide using the exit bag to establish asphyxia using helium. The purpose of this study is to investigate if the suicide methods changed since the publicity in 2013 about suicidal asphyxiation by using helium gas. This study especially focuses on suicide using the 'exit bag' with or without helium gas.
   Material and methods: In the period 2005 to 2014 all suicides in the region of Amsterdam-Amstelland and Zaanstreek-Waterland were analyzed and from these suicides cases using the exit bag were selected.
   Results: The study shows a rising trend with the use of the helium (P > 0.01) and a decreasing trend for suicide by asphyxia using an exit bag (P < 0.05). The data does not show a sudden difference, but there seems to be a gradually change.
   Discussion: The number of suicides using the helium method is rising in Amsterdam-Amstelland and Zaanstreek-Waterland, while suicides by asphyxiation without helium are decreasing. The specific publicity of books about suicides using helium may have influenced this transition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

TI A Life Fulfilled Should There Be Assisted Suicide for Those Who Are Done

SO CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY OF HEALTHCARE ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
DE fulfilled life; suicide; assisted suicide; human rights; right to life;
   privacy
AB The issue of assisted suicide for those with a fulfilled life is being hotly debated in the Netherlands. A large number of Dutch people feel that elderly people (i.e., people who have reached the age of 70) with a fulfilled life should have access to assisted suicide. Citizens have therefore requested Parliament to expand the existing legislation that governs euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. The Dutch constitution does not permit national legislation to be incompatible with higher international (human rights) law. An analysis of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights shows that a person's right to decide on the time and manner of his or her death should be regarded as an aspect of the right to privacy. Although no positive obligation has been imposed on parties to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms to facilitate suicide, they may do so, provided that certain conditions are met.

TI Should it be legal to assist suicide?
SO JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
DE assisted suicide; involuntary euthanasia; palliative care; 'slippery
   slope' argument; voluntary euthanasia
AB This paper argues that because it is a matter of dispute whether to assist suicide is ever morally right, the question whether assisted suicide should be legal should be decided independently of the moral issue and with reference to whether to assist suicide is genuinely to carry out the wishes of the person requesting it. It is then argued that it is possible to devise a set of criteria, based on those used in the Netherlands with regard to euthanasia, which would allow assisted suicide when the request is reasonable and genuine, but keep it illegal under other circumstances. It is further argued that there is no evidence that legalizing assisted suicide will lead us down the slippery slope to involuntary euthanasia. Finally, the question is raised to whether these assisted suicides should be legalized or, as at the moment in the UK, simply not prosecuted, but, as is about to happen, with the criteria for non-prosecution made explicit. It is suggested that, although it is in some ways both irrational and unjust, non-prosecution is politically easier to achieve and also more cautious as a first move.

DE Prisons; Suicide; Health services; Prisoners
ID ENGLAND; WALES; PREVALENCE; DISORDERS; COMMUNITY; HOMELESS; COHORT; RISK
AB Although suicide rates among prisoners are high and vary between countries, it is uncertain whether this reflects the importation of risk from the general population or is associated with incarceration rates.
   We collected data on suicides and undetermined deaths in 12 countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England and Wales, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, and Sweden) directly from their prison administrations for 2003-2007. These were compared with rates of suicides in the general population separately by gender using Pearson's correlations. In addition, they were compared with rates of incarceration. Linear regression was used to examine any association after adjustment for rates of incarceration.
   Data were collected on 861 suicides in prison, of which 810 were in men. In the men, crude relative rates of suicide were at least three times higher than the general population. Western European countries had similar rates of prisoner suicide which were mostly higher than those in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. There was no association between rates of suicide in prisoners and general population rates or rates of incarceration. In the women, inmate suicide rates varied widely and were mostly raised compared with rates in the general population. In addition, these rates did not appear to be associated with general population rates of suicide.
   Rates of prison suicide do not reflect general population suicide rates, suggesting that variations in prison suicide rates reflect differences in criminal justice systems including, possibly, the provision of psychiatric care in prison.

AB Background: Suicidal behavior is a severe public health problem. Aims: To determine the rates of attempted and completed suicide among ethnic groups in The Hague, The Netherlands (2002-2004). Methods: By analyzing data on attempted and completed suicide (from the psychiatric department of general medical hospitals; the psychiatric emergency service and the municipal coroners). Results: Turkish and Surinamese females aged 15 - 24 years were at highest risk for attempted suicide (age-specific rate 545 / 100,000 and 421 / 100,000 person-years, respectively). Both rates were significantly higher than in the same age group of Dutch females (246 / 100,000 person-years). Turkish (2%) and Surinamese (7%) had lower repeat suicide-attempt rates than did Dutch (16%) females aged 15-24. Significantly lower suicide- attempt rates were found for Surinamese than for Dutch females aged 35 - 54 years. Differences were not explained by socioeconomic living conditions. The ratio fatal/nonfatal events was 4.5 times higher in males than in females and varied across age, gender, and ethnicity strata. Completed suicide was rare among migrant females. No completed suicides were observed in the Turkish and Surinamese females aged 15-24 years. Conclusions: The study demonstrates a high risk of attempted suicide and a low risk of completed suicide among young Turkish and Surinamese females.

AB Objective: Family and twin studies suggest that liability for suicide attempts is heritable and distinct from mood disorder susceptibility. The authors therefore examined the association between common genomewide variation and lifetime suicide attempts.
   Method: The authors analyzed data on lifetime suicide attempts from genomewide association studies of bipolar I and II disorder as well as major depressive disorder. Bipolar disorder subjects were drawn from the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder cohort, the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium bipolar cohort, and the University College London cohort. Replication was pursued in the NIMH Genetic Association Information Network bipolar disorder project and a German clinical cohort. Depression subjects were drawn from the Sequential Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression cohort, with replication in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety/ Netherlands Twin Register depression cohort.
   Results: Strongest evidence of association for suicide attempt in bipolar disorder was observed in a region without identified genes (rs1466846); five loci also showed suggestive evidence of association. In major depression, strongest evidence of association was observed for a single nucleotide polymorphism in ABI3BP, with six loci also showing suggestive association. Replication cohorts did not provide further support for these loci. However, meta-analysis incorporating approximately 8,700 mood disorder subjects identified four additional regions that met the threshold for suggestive association, including the locus containing the gene coding for protein kinase C-epsilon, previously implicated in models of mood and anxiety. Conclusions: The results suggest that inherited risk for suicide among mood disorder patients is unlikely to be the result of individual common variants of large effect. They nonetheless provide suggestive evidence for multiple loci, which merit further investigation.

ID NETHERLANDS
AB This article explores the role of the physician in the Assisted Dying Bill, which is currently progressing through the House of Lords. The Supreme Court decision in Nicklinson and Others has alerted Parliament to the possibility that the current prohibition against assisted suicide may breach Article 8 of the European Convention in relation to the right to choose how to end one's life. In this article, the role of healthcare professionals in the proposed legalisation of physician-assisted suicide is examined, together with consideration of key ethical concerns over who might be permitted to access assisted dying. Whether the proposed law presents an ethically sound alternative to the current prohibition against assisting in suicide is not clear, but Parliament must now respond in order to address human rights issues and the call to legalise medically assisted suicide.

ID NETHERLANDS
AB Background. In the Netherlands, euthanasia or assisted suicide (EAS) is neither a right of the patient nor a duty of the physician. Beside the legal requirements, physicians can weigh their own considerations when they decide on a request for EAS.
   Objective. We aim at a better understanding of the considerations that play a role when physicians decide on a request for EAS.
   Methods. This was a qualitative study. We analysed 33 interviews held with general practitioners (GPs) from various regions in the Netherlands.
   Results. The considerations found can be divided in three main types. (i) Perceived legal criteria, (ii) individual interpretations of the legal criteria and (iii) considerations unrelated to the legal criteria. Considerations of this 3rd type have not been mentioned so far in the literature and the debate on EAS. Examples are: the family should agree to EAS, the patient's attitude must reflect resignation, or conflicts must be resolved.
   Conclusions. Our study feeds the ethical discussion on the tension that can arise between a physician's own views on death and dying, and the views and preferences of his patients. When considerations like 'no unresolved conflicts' or 'enough resignation' influence the decision to grant a request for EAS this poses questions from an ethical and professional point of view. We hypothesise that these considerations reflect GPs' views on what 'good dying' entails and we advocate further research on this topic.

AB The Food and Drug Administration has issued a number of advisories regarding a possible causal link between antidepressants and suicide behaviour among young persons. We investigated the age dependency of (fatal) suicide attempts associated with antidepressants (N=232,561). By linking insurance claims with the death register of Statistics Netherlands (2002-2011), rates of (fatal) suicide attempts were estimated during antidepressant use and intermittent episodes without use. The age dependency of the relative risk of attempts and of suicide during episodes with compared with episodes without antidepressants was investigated by testing the {age x episode} interaction. The attempt rate during antidepressant use decreased with increasing age, concurrently with a decrease of the relative risk from 3.62 to 1.86 (p for interaction <0.001). This age dependency was found both at the early (<0.5 year) and at later stages after the first prescription (>5 years). No suicides were found among those aged <18 years, and no age dependency for the relative risk of suicide at ages 18 was established (p>0.46). The association between antidepressants and suicide attempts at a young age does not necessarily point to a causal relationship, and, most importantly, did not translate to a similar age dependency for suicide.

TI Attempted suicide of ethnic minority girls with a Caribbean and Cape
   Verdean background: rates and risk factors
SO BMC PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID BEHAVIOR; IDEATION
AB Background: WHO data shows that female immigrants in Europe attempt suicide at higher rates than 'native' women and 'native' and immigrant men. Empirical studies addressing attempted suicide of female immigrants of Caribbean (Antillean-Dutch and Creole-Surinamese-Dutch) as well as Cape Verdean descent in Europe are however scarce. We aim to increase knowledge about rates and risk factors of girls of Caribbean and Cape Verdean descent living in the Netherlands.
   Methods: We conducted logistic regression on a dataset that consisted of self-reported health and well-being surveys filled out by 5611 female students, age 14-16, in Rotterdam, the Netherlands (Antillean Dutch N = 357, Creole-Surinamese-Dutch N = 130, and Cape Verdean-Dutch N = 402, and Dutch 'natives' N = 4691). We studied if girls of these minority groups had elevated risk for attempted suicide. Risk indicators that were suspected to play a role were investigated i.e. household composition, socio-economic class, externalizing problems, emotional problems and sexual abuse.
   Results: We found that rates of attempted suicide among Antillean (14%), Creole-Surinamese young women (15.4%) were higher than of 'native' Dutch girls (9.1%), while rates of Cape-Verdean girls (8.3%) were rather similar to those of 'native' girls. Not living with two biological parents was a risk factor for 'native' girls, but not for girls of Caribbean and Cape Verdean descent. Emotional problems and sexual abuse seems to be a risk indicator for suicidality across all ethnicities. Aggressive behaviour was a risk factor for Antillean Dutch and 'native' girls.
   Conclusions: Our findings underscore the need for developing suicide prevention programs for minority girls in multicultural cities in western Europe, in particular those of Caribbean descent. Results suggest the importance of addressing socio-economic class and educational background for suicide prevention, which bear particular relevance for Caribbean populations. Referral in the case of sexual trauma and low psychological wellbeing seems critical for reducing suicidal behaviour in girls, regardless of ethnicity.

AB The aim was to assess determinants of suicidality (suicidal ideation and suicide attempts) in a general population cohort with depressive spectrum disorders, and to compare determinants for suicidal ideation and determinants for suicide attempts in this cohort.
   The Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study is a epidemiologic survey in the adult population (N = 7,076), using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).
   In a cohort of 586 persons with a depressive spectrum disorder, 97 (16.6%) reported suicidal ideation and 19 (3.2%) suicide attempts in a period of 2 years. In a multivariate model, male gender (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30-0.99, p = 0.05), longer (> 13 months) duration of depression (OR 2.86, 95%CI 1.21-6.73, p = 0.02; OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.24-5.91, p = 0.01), anhedonia (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.01-5.91, p = 0.05), feeling worthless (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.05-3.74, p = 0.03), comorbid anxiety (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.38-4.40, p < 0.01), previous suicidal ideation (OR 3.50, 95% CI 1.96-6.24, p < 0.001) and use of professional care (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.01-3.79, p = 0.05) were significantly related to suicidality. Determinants of suicidal ideation differed from determinants of suicide attempts.
   Suicidality (and not actual suicides) was assessed with only two questions from the CIDI and some determinants for suicidality were assessed in the same time period as suicidality.
   Features of depression were the most important determinants of suicidality in a depressive spectrum cohort. Determinants for suicidal ideation differed from suicide attempts. These findings could be helpful in identifying those who need more intense treatment strategies in order to prevent suicidality and eventually suicide.

AB Euthanasia or assisted suicide and sometimes both have been legalized in a small number of countries and states. In all jurisdictions, laws and safeguards were put in place to prevent abuse and misuse of these practices. Prevention measures have included, among others, explicit consent by the person requesting euthanasia, mandatory reporting of all cases, administration only by physicians (with the exception of Switzerland), and consultation by a second physician.
   The present paper provides evidence that these laws and safeguards are regularly ignored and transgressed in all the jurisdictions and that transgressions are not prosecuted. For example, about 900 people annually are administered lethal substances without having given explicit consent, and in one jurisdiction, almost 50% of cases of euthanasia are not reported. Increased tolerance of transgressions in societies with such laws represents a social "slippery slope," as do changes to the laws and criteria that followed legalization. Although the initial intent was to limit euthanasia and assisted suicide to a last-resort option for a very small number of terminally ill people, some jurisdictions now extend the practice to newborns, children, and people with dementia. A terminal illness is no longer a prerequisite. In the Netherlands, euthanasia for anyone over the age of 70 who is "tired of living" is now being considered. Legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide therefore places many people at risk, affects the values of society over time, and does not provide controls and safeguards.

Most of the patients suffered from cancer (85%). The relatives were most Often a partner (63%) or a child (28%) of the patient. Before explicitly requesting EAS most patients (79%) had spoken about their wishes concerning medical end-of-life decisions to be made at a later date. Hopeless suffering, loss of dignity, and no prospect of recovery were the most prevalent reasons for explicitly requesting EAS. According to the relative, in 92% of patients EAS had contributed favourably to the quality of the end of life, mainly by preventing or ending suffering.

AB Recent literature has emphasized the important role psychologists can play in evaluating patients' competency and decision-making processes in cases of assisted suicide. It is often assumed that psychologists will be objective when conducting evaluations or that current training standards will neutralize potential sources of bias. Yet, providing service to patients who are seeking an assisted suicide may give rise to a number of relational and intrapsychic issues that could influence the evaluation process and its outcomes. In this commentary, we argue that psychologists should not be involved in cases of assisted suicide until they are adequately trained to be cognizant of the psychodynamic issues, particularly their own countertransference, that are likely to emerge within this unique clinical situation. We offer suggestions for augmenting previously recommended training procedures to account for these issues.

On the other hand, there has been a strong development of palliative care. The combination of these simultaneous processes seems to be rather unique. This contribution first focuses on these remarkable developments. Subsequently, the analysis concentrates on the question of how these new developments have influenced the ethical debate.

AB Previous studies on homicides followed by the suicide of the perpetrator have mostly regarded this phenomenon as a variation of homicidal or as a variation of suicidal behaviour resulting from external or internal blame attribution. The aim of this study is to qualitatively assess to what extent homicide-suicide can be understood as a dichotomous phenomenon, using homicides followed by a failed suicide by the perpetrator (homicide-parasuicides). Particular attention is paid to both internal and external blame attribution. Three different homicide-parasuicide groups emerged from the data: one being primarily homicidal, one being primarily suicidal and one constituting a separate phenomenon. Blame attribution as well as interpersonal dependency on the victim differentiated homicide-parasuicides from other homicides and other parasuicides. The findings of this study suggest that homicide-parasuicide cannot easily be dichotomized into either a homicide or a suicide category. More insight into the concept of interpersonal dependency may aid the prevention of this phenomenon.

AB During the summer of 1999, twenty-eight interviews with some of the leading authorities on euthanasia policy were conducted in the Netherlands. They were asked about cases of non-voluntary (when patients are incompetent) and involuntary euthanasia (when patients are competent and made no request to die). This study reports the main findings, showing that most respondents are quite complacent with regard to breaches of the guideline that require the patient's consent as a prerequisite to performance of euthanasia.

AB More suicidal ideation and higher rates of attempted suicide are found in Turkish people when compared with the general population in Europe. Acculturation processes and related distress may explain an elevated risk of suicide. The current study investigates the association between acculturation and suicidal ideation among Turkish migrants in the Netherlands. The mediating effect of hopelessness and moderating effect of secure attachment are also examined. A total of 185 Turkish migrants living in the Netherlands were recruited through social media and through liaison with community groups. They completed an online survey including validated measures of suicidal ideation, hopelessness, acculturation and attachment style. Mediation and moderation analyses were tested using bootstrapping. Higher participation was associated with less hopelessness and less suicidal ideation. Greater maintenance of ones ethnic culture was associated with higher hopelessness and higher suicidal ideation. Greater participation was associated with less suicidal ideation particularly amongst those with less secure attachment styles. Turkish migrants who participate in the host culture may have a lower risk of developing suicidal thinking. Participation may protect against suicidal thinking, particularly among those with less secure attachment styles.

AB This study reports data gathered via extensive interviews with some of the leading authorities on the euthanasia policy that were conducted in the Netherlands. They were asked: It has been argued that the policy and practice of euthanasia in the Netherlands is the result of undeveloped palliative care. What do you think? I also mentioned the fact that there are only a few hospices in the Netherlands.
   The responses were different and contradictory. Many interviewees agreed with the statement. Almost all of those agreeing with it said that only during the late 1990s were people beginning to admit that there was a need to improve palliative care. Some interviewees insisted that doctors first need to explore other options for helping the patient prior to choosing the course of euthanasia. Other interviewees thought that palliative care is well developed in the Netherlands and that euthanasia has actually paved the way for calling more attention to palliative care.

AB Homicide-suicide in the industrialized West has been studied for many years. Yet, only limited scholarly research currently exists on the subject in Africa and other non-Western societies. The aim of the present descriptive study was to investigate homicide-suicides in contemporary Ghana. A content analysis of homicide-suicide reports in a major Ghanaian daily newspaper during 1990 to 2009 was conducted. The results overwhelmingly support findings in the literature, suggesting that homicide-suicides are extremely rare events in Ghana. The overwhelming majority of reported homicide-suicides were committed by males, with females substantially more likely to be the homicide victims. The offenders and victims were generally of low socioeconomic status. Most homicide-suicides involved victims and offenders who were intimately acquainted as family members. The majority of cases involved men who killed their wives on suspicion of infidelity; the next largest category involved men who murdered wives who threatened divorce or separation. The principal homicide and suicide methods were shooting with firearms, hacking with machetes, and stabbing with knives. The findings of the study are discussed in relation to Ghana's patriarchal family system and ideology and present socioeconomic issues in the country. This study recommends further research on this subject in Ghana and other African countries. This is necessary to further an understanding of homicide-suicide as a phenomenon, as well as a necessary prelude to the development and implementation of effective preventive programs.

AB The passive form of euthanasia is legalized almost in every civilized country. Its active form is not a generally accepted legal institution. In Europe, active euthanasia is legalized only in The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland. In Australia, the Act on the Rights of the Terminally Ill of 1995 legalized the institution of assisted suicide, which is not identical to active euthanasia. The difference lies in the fact that legalized active euthanasia means that the author of a murder is not punishable (under certain circumstances), whilst assisted suicide is not about murder, rather about suicide. In the first case, the patient is killed on his or her request by someone else. In the second case, the patient himself or herself executes the act of self-killing (by the assistance of a healthcare worker). In Australia, the institution of assisted suicide was repealed in 1997. Assisted suicide is legal in four USA member states: in Vermont, Washington, Montana and Oregon. In Uruguay, the active form of euthanasia has been legal since 1932.

AB Tremendous debate surrounds the acceptability of physician-assisted suicide in the United States. Progress requires carefully mapping the relationship of this practice to termination of life-sustaining treatment, appropriate pain relief and palliative care, and euthanasia. Arguments that have been offered in favor of permitting physicians to aid suicide include the importance of patient autonomy, the claim that patients need this option to cope with symptoms at the end of life, and the assertion that practices already accepted involve intentionally ending life. Arguments that have been offered against include the potential for abuse, the claim that forbidding intentional killing is essential to the ethics of medicine, and the assertion that patients can be provided good and humane care at the end of life without assisting suicide. Addressing the demand for physician-assisted suicide requires improvement in end-of-life care and continued discussion attentive to emerging empirical data.

AB In this paper, I examine the arguments against physician assisted suicide (PAS). Many of these arguments are consequentialist. Consequentialist arguments rely on empirical claims about the future and thus their strength depends on how likely it is that the predictions will be realized. I discuss these predictions against the backdrop of Oregon's Death with Dignity Act and the practice of PAS in the Netherlands. I then turn to a specific consequentialist argument against PAS - Susan M. Wolf's feminist critique of the practice. Finally, I examine the two most prominent deontological arguments against PAS. Ultimately, I conclude that no anti-PAS argument has merit. Although I do not provide positive arguments for PAS, if none of the arguments against it are strong, we have no reason not to legalize it.

AB IMPORTANCE Right to Die NL, an organization in the Netherlands that advocates for the option of euthanasia, founded the End-of-Life Clinic in 2012 to provide euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide for patients who meet all legal requirements but whose regular physicians rejected their request. Many patients whose requests are rejected have less common situations, such as a psychiatric or psychological condition, dementia, or being tired of living.
   OBJECTIVE To study outcomes of requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide received by the clinic and factors associated with granting or rejecting requests.
   DESIGN Analysis of application forms and registration files from March 1, 2012, to March 1, 2013, the clinic's first year of operation, for 645 patients who applied to the clinic with a request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide and whose cases were concluded during the study period.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A request could be granted, rejected, or withdrawn or the patient could have died before a final decision was reached. We analyzed bivariate and multivariate associations with medical conditions, type of suffering, and sociodemographic variables.
   RESULTS Of the 645 requests made by patients, 162 requests (25.1%) were granted, 300 requests (46.5%) were refused, 124 patients (19.2%) died before the request could be assessed, and 59 patients (9.1%) withdrew their requests. Patients with a somatic condition (113 of 344 [32.8%]) or with cognitive decline (21 of 56 [37.5%]) had the highest percentage of granted requests. Patients with a psychological condition had the smallest percentage of granted requests. Six (5.0%) of 121 requests from patients with a psychological condition were granted, as were 11 (27.5%) of 40 requests from patients who were tired of living.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Physicians in the Netherlands have more reservations about less common reasons that patients request euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, such as psychological conditions and being tired of living, than the medical staff working for the End-of-Life Clinic. The physicians and nurses employed by the clinic, however, often confirmed the assessment of the physician who previously cared for the patient; they rejected nearly half of the requests for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, possibly because the legal due care criteria had not been met.

AB Background In 2002, the euthanasia act came into effect in the Netherlands, which was followed by a slight decrease in the euthanasia frequency. We assessed frequency and characteristics of euthanasia, physician-assisted suicide, and other end-of-life practices in 2010, and assessed trends since 1990.
   Methods In 1990, 1995, 2001, 2005, and 2010 we did nationwide studies of a stratified sample from the death registry of Statistics Netherlands, to which all deaths and causes were reported. We mailed questionnaires to physicians attending these deaths (2010: n=8496 deaths). All cases were weighted to adjust for the stratification procedure and for differences in response rates in relation to the age, sex, marital status, region of residence, and cause and place of death.
   Findings In 2010, of all deaths in the Netherlands, 2.8% (95% CI 2.5-3.2; 475 of 6861) were the result of euthanasia. This rate is higher than the 1.7% (1.5-1.8; 294 of 9965) in 2005, but comparable with those in 2001 and 1995. Distribution of sex, age, and diagnosis was stable between 1990 and 2010. In 2010, 77% (3136 of 4050) of all cases of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide were reported to a review committee (80% [1933 of 2425] in 2005). Ending of life without an explicit patient request in 2010 occurred less often (0.2%; 95% CI 0.1-0.3; 13 of 6861) than in 2005, 2001, 1995, and 1990 (0.8%; 0.6-1.1; 45 of 5197). Continuous deep sedation until death occurred more frequently in 2010 (12.3% [11.6-13.1; 789 of 6861]) than in 2005 (8.2% [7.8-8.6; 521 of 9965]). Of all deaths in 2010, 0.4% (0.3-0.6; 18 of 6861) were the result of the patient's decision to stop eating and drinking to end life; in half of these cases the patient had made a euthanasia request that was not granted.
   Interpretation Our study provides insight in consequences of regulating euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide within the broader context of end-of-life practices. In the Netherlands the euthanasia law resulted in a relatively transparent practice. Although translating these results to other countries is not straightforward, they can inform the debate on legalisation of assisted dying in other countries.

TI Comparison of suicide in people aged 65-74 and 75+ by gender in England

AB Background The factors most strongly associated with suicide are age and gender-more men than women, and, more people over 65 kill themselves. As a number of Governments have targets to reduce suicide levels we compare elderly suicide rates over a 20-year period in England and Wales. And the major Western countries focusing upon age and gender.
   Method WHO mortality data were used to calculate three-year average General Population Suicide Rates (GPSR) for 1979-1981 to 1997-1999 and rates of people aged 65-74 and 75+ suicide by gender to provide ratios of change and a statistical comparison of England and Wales and the Major Western countries over the period.
   Results Male GSPR: '65-74' suicide ratios fell significantly in six countries and in three for the '75+'. Female GSPR: '65-74' suicide ratios fell in every country except Spain. Proportionately, there were more suicides in the over 65s in countries with an 'extended family' tradition, Spain, Italy, Germany, France and Japan, than in the five 'secular' countries. England and Wales male '65-74' suicide fell significantly more than Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Netherlands and the USA, and did significantly better than the other countries for all female senior citizen suicides.
   Conclusion Suicide of the over-65s has improved in seven countries, especially in England and Wales, who had the greatest proportional reduction, which reflects well upon the psycho-geriatric and community services. However, in all countries, male 65-74 rates did not match the female out so extra efforts are needed to improve male rates. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

TI Requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide from older persons
   who do not have a severe disease: An interview study
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID LIFE
AB Objective. To determine how often requests are made for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (EAS) in the absence of severe disease and how such requests are dealt with in medical practice in The Netherlands.
   Method. Retrospective interview study. Participants: 125 general practitioners (GPs), 77 nursing home physicians (NHPs), and 208 clinical specialists.
   Results. In The Netherlands, each year approximately 400 people request EAS, because they are 'weary of life'. Thirty per cent of all physicians have at some time received an explicit request for EAS in the absence of severe disease; 3 % of all physicians had granted a request for EAS in such a case. Most requests for EAS to GPs in the absence of severe disease (17 = 29) were made by single people aged 80 years- and over. While their problems were most frequently of a social nature, 79 % had one or more non-severe illnesses. Most GPs refused the request; half of them proposed an alternative treatment, which the patient often refused. Nineteen people who did not receive any treatment persisted in their wish to die; the request for EAS from 5 out of 10 patients who received one or more types of treatment was withdrawn or became less explicit.
   Conclusions. Most physicians in The Netherlands refuse requests for EAS in the absence of severe disease. Most patients persist in their request. In an ageing population more research is needed to provide physicians with practical interventions to prevent suicide and to make life bearable and satisfactory for elderly people who wish to die.

AB Objectives This paper aims to describe the degree to which general practitioners (GPs) explore suicidal behaviour among depressed patients in the Netherlands.
   Design An observational study of consultations between GPs and depressed patients.
   Setting 39 sentinel GP practices within the Netherlands in 2017.
   Participants Patients with a registration of depression.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures Primary outcome measure is suicide exploration by the GP. Secondary outcome measures at patient level, assessed by surveying GPs, include prevalence and severity of suicidal thoughts. Secondary outcome measures at GP level include follow-up actions of GP and reasons not to explore suicidality.
   Results A total of 1034 questionnaires were included in the analyses. GPs assessed and explored suicidality in 44% of patients with depression (66% in patients with a new episode of depression). GPs explored suicidal feelings more often in patients with a new episode of depression (OR 4.027, p<0.001, 95% CI 2.924 to 5.588), male patients (OR 1.709, p<0.001, 95% CI 1.256 to 2.330) or younger patients (OR 1.017, p<0.001, 95% CI 1.009 to 1.026). Multilevel analysis showed that 22% of the variation in suicide exploration is due to differences in GP practice. Thirty-eight per cent of the patients who were asked by their GP, reported (severe) suicidal ideation. Most GPs (68%) did not explore suicidal feelings because they thought the patient would not be suicidal.
   Conclusion GPs explored suicidal thoughts in less than half of all depressed patients and in two-thirds of patients with a new episode of depression. Suicide prevention training is recommended to enhance suicide exploration.

AB In the first three years that physician-assisted suicide (PAS) has been legal in Oregon, about two persons per month have taken medication to end their life. Most physicians are unwilling to prescribe the lethal medication. Because many terminally ill people are confined to their bed or home, the difficulty of finding a willing physician may have resulted in many abandoning the idea of using PAS. People living a long way from a large urban centre may be severely disadvantaged in their ability to obtain medication to end their lives.

AB Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia (PAS/E) have been outside the bounds of acceptable behavior for physicians for hundreds of years and remain illegal in all jurisdictions except Oregon and The Netherlands. The morally, legally, and professionally acceptable alternative is excellent end-of-life care. In this article, the arguments in Favor of PAS/E are discussed briefly and rebutted. The arguments against this practice are outlined and supported. Because pain (and fear of pain) at the end of life is one of the driving forces behind the recurrent debate about legalization of PAS/E, the medical profession as a whole, and pain specialists in particular, have an obligation to use all available means to relieve pain.

AB Since the Carter judgment in 2015, voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal in Canada. The purpose of this article is to analyze the relevance of making people with mental disorders eligible for medical aid in dying (MAD). The text consists of three parts. The first part presents the history of the legalization of the MAD in Canada. In the second part, we discuss the extension of the MAD to individuals suffering from mental disorders. We then insist on five aspects: the MAD and suicide in Quebec, suicide's place in the values of Quebec society, a reflection on rational suicide and the impact of mental health on the ability to make decisions, the respect of the laws and their application as well as assisted suicide of people with mental disorders in Belgium and the Netherlands. In the third part, we suggest four recommendations: to extend the requests to cases with mental disorders whose suffering is refractory to all care, to increase the minimum delay for the treatment of these requests, to systematically include a mental health specialist and to involve the loved ones throughout the process.

AB Birth cohort effects in suicide rates are well established, but to date there is no methodological approach or framework to test the temporal stability of these effects. We use the APC-Detrended (APCD) model to robustly estimate intensity of cohort effects identifying non-linear trends (or 'detrended' fluctuations) in suicide rates. The new APC-Hysteresis (APCH) model tests temporal stability of cohort effects. Analysing suicide rates in 25 WHO countries (periods 1970-74 to 2005-09; ages 20-24 to 70-79) with the APCD method, we find that country-specific birth cohort membership plays an important role in suicide rates. Among 25 countries, we detect 12 nations that show deep contrasts among cohort-specific suicide rates including Italy, Australia and the United States. The APCH method shows that cohort fluctuations are not stable across the life course but decline in Spain, France and Australia, whereas they remain stable in Italy, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. We discuss the Spanish case with elevated suicide mortality of cohorts born 1965-1975 which declines with age, and the opposite case of the United States, where the identified cohort effects of those born around 1960 increase smoothly, but statistically significant across the life course.

   CLASSIFICATION; DEPRESSION; COUNTRIES; ALLIANCE; QUALITY
AB Background The suicide rate is a macro indicator of the population's psychosocial wellbeing and an evaluation criterion of the effectiveness of suicide prevention strategies. A high level of injury deaths of undetermined intent (UD) is usually discussed in connection with the validity of suicide statistics. An effort is made to develop a criterion to characterise the quality of suicide statistics.
   Methods Standardised rates of suicides (X60-X84) and UD (Y10-Y34) by the International Classification of Disease version 10 as an average for the past five available years were taken from the WHO European mortality database. Rate ratios were computed by dividing rates of UD by suicide rates.
   Results There is considerable variation in suicide and UD rates among countries. The highest overall rates of UD were registered in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and the lowest in Greece, Spain and Italy. The EU-15 average UD rate of 1.97 and the rate ratio of 0.194 UD to suicides were combined into a '2-20 benchmark', in which the primary indicator is 2.0 UD cases per 100 000 and the secondary indicator is the proportion of UD to suicides 0.20 (20%), which enables countries to be clustered according to the quality of suicide statistics. The following countries satisfied the benchmark: Greece, Norway, Spain, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Austria, Italy, Romania, Hungary, Ireland and Finland.
   Conclusion This study used the developed '2-20 benchmark' in Europe to assess suicide registration quality in a particular country, to compare the relative position of countries, and to set a target for those European countries that have not yet achieved the benchmark.

ID BIPOLAR DISORDER; LITHIUM TREATMENT
AB Objective: The authors' goal was to investigate whether there is a greater suicide risk in the placebo arms of placebo-controlled studies of active medication for the treatment of acute manic episode and the prevention of manic/depressive episode. If so, this would be a strong ethical argument against the conduct of such studies.
   Method: All placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trials of medication for the treatment of acute manic episode and the prevention of manic/depressive episode that were part of a registration dossier submitted to the regulatory authority of the Netherlands, the Medicines Evaluation Board, between 1997 and 2003, were reviewed for occurrence of suicide and attempted suicide.
   Results: In 11 placebo-controlled studies of the treatment of acute manic episode, including 1,506 patients ( 117 person-years) in the combined active compound group and 1,005 patients ( 71 person-years) in the combined placebo group, no suicides and no suicide attempts occurred. In four placebo-controlled studies of the prevention of manic/depressive episode, including 943 patients ( 406 person-years) in the combined active compound group and 418 patients ( 136 person-years) in the combined placebo group, two suicides (493/100,000 person-years of exposure) and eight suicide attempts ( 1,969/ 100,000 person-years of exposure) occurred in the combined active compound group, but no suicides and two suicide attempts ( 1,467/100,000 person-years of exposure) occurred in the combined placebo group.
   Conclusions: Concern about greater risk of suicide or attempted suicide in the placebo group should not be an argument against the conduct of placebo-controlled trials for these indications, provided that appropriate precautions are taken.

TI Behaviour patterns preceding a railway suicide: Explorative study of
   German Federal Police officers' experiences
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID TRAIN SUICIDES; PREVENTION; NETHERLANDS
AB Background: Constant high-level numbers of railway suicides indicate that prevention strategies against railway suicides are urgently needed. The main question of the present study was whether pre-crash railway suicide behaviour can be identified, using German Federal Police officers experience with suicidal events in railway related environments.
   Methods: To collect information on pre-crash railway suicide behaviour, a questionnaire was used and made available on the German Federal Police intranet. A total of 202 subjects (mean age: 41 years, sex: 84.9% male) were included in the analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to predict the prevention of suicide (first model) or demand for counselling (second model) as outcomes. Sex, age, years of service, number of experienced suicides, suicides personally observed, information on suicides obtained from witnesses and finally either counselling/debriefing (first model) or whether officers had prevented a suicide (second model) were used as predictors.
   Results: A considerable proportion of police officers reported behavioural patterns preceding a suicide. Half of them observed the dropping or leaving behind of personal belongings or the avoidance of eye contact, more than a third erratic gesture, mimic or movement. Erratic communication patterns and general confusion were each reported by about one quarter. One fifth indicated the influence of alcohol. Less frequently observed behaviour was aimlessly wandering (14.3%) and out of the ordinary clothing (4%). About one third of all railway suicide victims committed suicide in stations. Of those, 70% had chosen an eminent spot. The multivariate logistic regression model using prevented suicides as the outcome identified the number of suicides experienced, counselling/debriefing and having personally observed a suicide as variables with significant impact. The model using counselling/debriefing as the outcome identified age and having prevented a suicide as variables with a significant association.
   Conclusions: Our results provide evidence that railway suicides are preceded by identifiable behavioural patterns. This emphasizes the importance of educational efforts, taking into account the knowledge and skills of experienced police officers.

AB Recent data indicate increasing suicide rates for children and adolescents in the United States, Great Britain and the Netherlands. These facts call for a critical discussion of prescription rates of antidepressants for pediatric use. Obviously the U.S. and European regulators issued public warnings about a possible association between antidepressants and suicidal thinking and behaviour have discouraged physicians to use antidepressants in this age group. Untreated depression means impairment of psychosocial development of children and their families. Alarmingly there is no evidence of a significant increase in the use of treatment alternatives as for example psychotherapy. High relapse rate with early onset of depressions are common and therefore children with depression need all our attention and best treatment available.
   Current Austrian suicidal statistics do not yet demonstrate increasing suicidal rates in adolescents as seen in the U.S., the U.K. and the Netherlands. Thus all our alertness is needed to avoid any analogical progress in suicide rates and despite regulatory warnings and certainly after a careful risk-benefit analyses physicians have to consider pharmacological treatment options in depressive children and adolescents.

AB This paper presents a system for making decisions at the end of life. It emphasizes the role of patient autonomy and the importance of patient and family participation with the physician in decision-making. Definitions are presented for the terms: terminal illness, withholding and withdrawing life sustaining treatment, physician assisted suicide and euthanasia. Three cases are briefly described to illustrate the application of the decision-making system. A detailed discussion is then presented of the divergent views expressed by different authors about the moral differences or similarities between forgoing life sustaining treatment and physician assistance in dying. It is concluded that the view that these two actions are fundamentally different, as supported by the United States Supreme Court, in 1997, is the correct one. Physician assisted suicide (PAS) remains a controversial issue. Physicians and societies in individual countries must work out their own approaches to PAS. However, forgoing invasive or intensive life support in terminally ill patients consistent with their wishes is considered appropriate.

DT Article
ID ECONOMIC-CRISIS; FINANCIAL CRISIS; TIME TREND; RECESSION; HEALTH; RATES;
   INCREASE
AB Background A scientific debate is currently taking place on whether the 2008 economic crisis caused an increase in suicide rates. Our main objective was to assess the impact of unemployment rate on suicide rate in Western European countries between 2000 and 2010. We then tried to estimate the excess number of suicides attributable to the increase of unemployment during the 2008-2010 economic crisis.
   Methods The yearly suicide rates were modelled using a quasi-Poisson model, controlling for sex, age, country and a linear time trend. For each country, the unemployment-suicide association was assessed, and the excess number of suicides attributable to the increase of unemployment was estimated. Sensitivity analyses were performed, notably in order to evaluate whether the unemployment-suicide association found was biased by a confounding context effect ('crisis effect').
   Results A significant 0.3% overall increase in suicide rate for a 10% increase in unemployment rate (95% CI 0.1% to 0.5%) was highlighted. This association was significant in three countries: 0.7% (95% CI 0.0% to 1.4%) in the Netherlands, 1.0% (95% CI 0.2% to 1.8%) in the UK and 1.9% (95% CI 0.8% to 2.9%) in France, with a significant excess number of suicides attributable to unemployment variations between 2008 and 2010 (respectively 57, 456 and 564). The association was modified inconsistently when adding a 'crisis effect' into the model.
   Conclusions Unemployment and suicide rates are globally statistically associated in the investigated countries. However, this association is weak, and its amplitude and sensitivity to the 'crisis effect' vary across countries. This inconsistency provides arguments against its causal interpretation.

ID EUTHANASIA; NETHERLANDS; ACT
AB The Assisted Dying for the Terminally III Bill proposed to legalise both euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide for those with a terminal illness in the UK. A House of Lords Select Committee was convened to scrutinise this Bill and has recently published its report, which will be debated in Parliament on October 10th 2005.
   The written and oral evidence submitted to the Select Committee represented a wide range of views on 'assisted dying'. Much of the evidence from those countries which have legalised euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide (The Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, USA) dealt with the practicalities of ending life, and the legal procedures and safeguards instigated in these countries.
   All the written and oral evidence in the public domain was scrutinised by the authors whilst the Select Committee was sitting. We have extracted those themes relevant to specialist palliative care practice and present them in this paper. We hope that this will provide a useful resource to inform the forthcoming public debate on assisted dying. The evidence of harms inherent in making such a change in the law, as presented to the Select Committee, has moved all three authors to oppose a change in the law.

DT Article
ID QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; ASSISTED SUICIDE; PATIENT; DEATH; LIFE; END
AB Background: There is only limited knowledge about the emotional impact that performing euthanasia has on primary care physicians (PCPs) in the Netherlands. Objective: To obtain more insight into the emotional impact on PCPs of performing euthanasia or assisted suicide, and to tailor the educational needs of vocational PCP trainees accordingly. Methods: Qualitative research, consisting of four focus group studies. The setting was primary care in the Netherlands; 22 PCPs participated, in four groups (older males, older females, younger males and a group with interest with regard to euthanasia). Results: Various phases with different emotions were distinguished: before (tension), during (loss) and after (relief) the event. Although it is a very rare occurrence, euthanasia has a major impact on PCPs. Their relationship with the patient, their loneliness, the role of the family, and pressure from society are the main issues that emerged. Making sufficient emotional space and time available to take leave adequately from a patient is important for PCPs. Conclusions: Many PCPs stressed that young physicians should form their own opinions about euthanasia and other end-of-life decisions early on in their career. We recommend that these issues are officially included in the vocational training programme for general practice.

AB Background: The existing literature provides contradictory evidence on antidepressant use and risk of suicide. Some studies have shown that the use of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) is associated with an increased risk of suicide, especially during the first months of treatment, whereas other studies did not confirm this association. For this reason, our objective was to investigate the association between antidepressant use and risk of suicide in incident antidepressant users in relation to Lime since starling therapy.
   Methods: We concluded a population based cohort study within the Dutch Integrated Primary Care Information (IPCI) database, in incident users of antidepressant therapy between 1994 and 2012 (n=27,712). Cox proportional hazard models were used to study the association between current use of SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and other antidepressants and risk of suicide or attempted suicide.
   Results: During follow-up, a total of 280 incident antidepressant users attempted or committed suicide. Current use of SSRIs (hazard ratio (HR): 078,95% CI. 057-1.07), TCAs (HR: 0.82, 95% CI. 0.48-1.42) or other antidepressants (HR: 0.75, 95% CI : 0.47-1.18) was not statistically significantly associated with suicide compared to past use of any of the antidepressants.
   Limitations: Although a large healthcare database was used, the number of reported cases of suicide (attempt) was low.
   Conclusions: This study did not indicate an increase in risk of suicide after starting treatment with SSRIs, TCAs or other antidepressants compared with past antidepressant use. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID EUTHANASIA
AB The recent legalization of assisted dying in California, along with similar bills before other states, returned assisted suicide to the national spotlight. In Anglo-American dying bills, two criteria restrict eligibility for assisted suicide: (1) the uncoerced request to die (roughly, the "autonomy" criterion) and (2) severely deteriorated health of a certain kind (roughly, the "physical" criterion) from a six-month terminal illness (US jurisdictions) to severe and irreversible conditions (the Netherlands, Belgium). I argue that the physical criterion in any form violates the equality of respect and moral status of a large class of people, thereby degrading them, and I supplement this with theological considerations drawn from Thomas Aquinas. Even if the slope were not slippery and the autonomy firewall prevented Dutch-style mission creep, the physical criterion itself degrades tens of thousands of sick, disabled, and dying people by insinuating that their lives-but crucially, not other people's-are "objectively" the sort of thing they might reasonably want to dispose of.

TI The role of guidelines in the practice of physician-assisted suicide
SO ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
LA English

ID DEATH; NETHERLANDS; EUTHANASIA; MODEL; CARE
AB Oregon has legalized and implemented physician-assisted suicide, while observers argue about the moral import of attempting to formulate guidelines; the utility any set of guidelines can have for physician practice, health care providers, patients, or families; and whether guidelines can really protect against harm or abuse. What were once theoretical questions have taken on new urgency.
   The debate over the value and power of guidelines includes the following questions: What has been the experience of efforts to implement physician-assisted suicide using consensus guidelines? What goals are guidelines intended to serve? Who should formulate guidelines? What features should be reflected in any proposed guidelines to make them practical and to permit achievement of their goals? Are there any fundamental obstacles to the creation or implementation of guidelines', Is dying a process that is amenable to direction under guidelines, be they issued by physicians, departments of health, blue ribbon panels, or other regulatory bodies? This paper explores these questions as physician-assisted suicide becomes legal.

DT Article
ID SEXUAL ORIENTATION; RISK
AB We examined Netherlands Institute for Social Research data, collected between May and August 2009, on 274 Dutch lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths. The data showed that victimization at school was associated with suicidal ideation and actual suicide attempts. Homophobic rejection by parents was also associated with actual suicide attempts. Suicidality in this population could be reduced by supporting coping strategies of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths who are confronted with stigmatization by peers and parents, and by schools actively promoting acceptance of same-sex sexuality.

TI Suicide risk in placebo vs active treatment in placebo-controlled trials

SO ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID SYMPTOM REDUCTION; CLINICAL-TRIALS
AB Background: If there is an increased risk of suicide in the placebo arms of placebo-controlled studies in patients with schizophrenia, it would be a strong ethical argument against the conduct of placebo-controlled studies in this patient population. We tested whether the risk of suicide and attempted suicide in the placebo arms of placebo-controlled studies among patients with schizophrenia is higher than in the active treatment arms of such studies.
   Methods: All placebo-controlled double-blind studies that were part of a registration dossier for the indication schizophrenia, and that were submitted to the regulatory authority of the Netherlands from January 1, 1992, through December 31, 2002, were reviewed for suicide and attempted suicide.
   Results: In 31 studies, 7152 patients were included: 1888 in placebo groups (398.2 person-years) and 5264 in active compound groups (981.3 person-years). One suicide occurred in the placebo groups (0.05%, or an incidence rate of 251 per 100000 years of exposure) and I in the active compound groups (0.02%, or an incidence rate of 102 per 100000 years of exposure), This difference was not statistically significant. Two attempted suicides occurred in the placebo groups (0.11%, or an incidence rate of 502 per 100000 years of exposure) and 11 in the active compound groups (0.21%, or an incidence rate of 1121 per 100000 years of exposure). This difference was also not statistically significant.
   Conclusion: Concern about increased risk of suicide or attempted suicide in the placebo group should not be an argument against the conduct of placebo-controlled trials in schizophrenia, provided that appropriate precautions are taken.

AB The suicide of David welly in the UK following revelations by the BBC of questionable treatment by the government with regard to information on Iraq and the killing of Pim Fortuyn in the Netherlands, after intensive TV election coverage was criticized for 'demonizing' the populist politician, have resulted in comparable public outcries and political indignation. Both cases led to a crisis in trust and in similar demands for new arrangements visa vis the responsibility and accountability of public broadcasting. The actual outcomes, however, differ considerably: a strong (self) regulatory reaction in the UK and a limited government response in the Netherlands.

DE Aging; Death; Euthanasia; Suicide
AB The purpose of this article is to promote a debate about controversial issues there are pertinent to human ageing, but which are not often discussed by the society. Through bibliographic research, documentary and empirical studies, we presented questions related to ageing, death, euthanasia and suicide. It has been noted in this study that some topics are often considered a taboo, such as euthanasia, but there are countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Colombia where this procedure has already been adopted and, in some cases, even regulated. It has been found in this work that death is often not the greatest fear of the human being, but rather the fear of loss of freedom and control of one's life. Family support, clinical treatments and spirituality can be considered to be great allies in trying to prevent suicide by older people.

   EXPERIENCES; NETHERLANDS; DEPRESSION; ATTITUDES; CARE
AB Background: Studies show that patient requests for physician-assisted suicide (PAS) are a relatively common clinical occurrence. The purpose of this study was to describe how experienced physicians assess and respond to requests for assisted suicide.
   Methods: Focused ethnography in the offices of 11 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome physicians, 8 oncologists, and 1 hospice physician who had received requests for assisted suicide in their practice. Ten had facilitated PAS.
   Results: Informants had a similar approach to evaluating patients who requested assisted suicide, often asking, "Why do you want to die now?" Reasons for requests fell into 3 broad categories: physical symptoms, psychological issues, and existential suffering. Physicians thought they competently addressed patients' physical symptoms, and this obviated most requests. They treated depression empirically and believed they did not assist depressed patients with assisted suicide. Physicians had difficult); addressing patients' existential suffering, which led to most facilitated requests. Informants rarely talked to colleagues about requests for assisted suicide, suggesting a "professional code of silence."
   Conclusions: Regardless of divergent attitudes about PAS, physicians respond similarly to requests for assisted suicide from their patients, creating a common ground for professional dialogue. Our sample addressed physical suffering aggressively, treated depression empirically, but struggled with requests arising from existential suffering. A professional code of silence regarding PAS creates professional isolation. Clinicians do not share knowledge or receive social support from peers about their decisions regarding assisted suicide. Educational strategies drawing on approaches used by experienced clinicians may create an atmosphere that enables physicians with divergent beliefs to discuss this difficult subject.

AB Methods: We linked the suicides assisted by right-to-die associations during 2003-08 to a census-based longitudinal study of the Swiss population. We used Cox and logistic regression models to examine associations with gender, age, marital status, education, religion, type of household, urbanization, neighbourhood socio-economic position and other variables. Separate analyses were done for younger (25 to 64 years) and older (65 to 94 years) people.
   Results: Analyses were based on 5 004 403 Swiss residents and 1301 assisted suicides (439 in the younger and 862 in the older group). In 1093 (84.0%) assisted suicides, an underlying cause was recorded; cancer was the most common cause (508, 46.5%). In both age groups, assisted suicide was more likely in women than in men, those living alone compared with those living with others and in those with no religious affiliation compared with Protestants or Catholics. The rate was also higher in more educated people, in urban compared with rural areas and in neighbourhoods of higher socio-economic position. In older people, assisted suicide was more likely in the divorced compared with the married; in younger people, having children was associated with a lower rate.
   Conclusions: Assisted suicide in Switzerland was associated with female gender and situations that may indicate greater vulnerability such as living alone or being divorced, but also with higher education and higher socio-economic position.

AB The aim of this paper is to gain some understanding of euthanasia as a Dutch cultural practice, focusing on value orientations that lie beneath the surface of what is made visible in the many national surveys done in the Netherlands. In order to reach this aim, I take 2 steps. In the first place, I give a short sketch of euthanasia as it is understood and practiced in the Netherlands. This is followed by a cultural analysis by the American-Dutch historian James Kennedy who studied the euthanasia debate in the Netherlands from the 1960s until 1985. Having arrived at some cultural understanding of Dutch mentality, I dive deeper into the understanding of the Dutch value orientations by focusing on the dimension of spiritual care at the end of life. After having defined the concept of spirituality, I sketch the contemporary state of affairs in this area and report how spiritual care in the Netherlands is understood and practiced by discussing the consensus-based Dutch guideline on spiritual care in palliative care, recent research on hope among palliative care patients in the Netherlands, and an often used Dutch tool for spiritual care: the Ars moriendi model. I end this contribution by sketching how I think that spiritual care at the end of life should be developed further in the Netherlands from a palliative care perspective.

AB Euthanasia motivated by mental disorders is legal in only a few countries and has a short history. In a recent report of all psychiatric euthanasia cases in Belgium between 2002 and 2013, Dierickx and colleagues suggest that the number of these cases is increasing, and provide a profile of the applicants. To date, knowledge of the practice of psychiatric euthanasia is limited, but rising public awareness might increase the number of requests. The authors reveal several shortcomings in cases of psychiatric euthanasia and open avenues for future research.

AB How differences in drinking patterns may affect the impact of alcohol consumption on deliberate self-harm among adolescents is explored in this international comparative study. Schools in Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Norway (N=30,532) were surveyed. In all countries the risk of deliberate self-harm was significantly elevated among adolescents who reported some or numerous episodes of intoxication, controlling for confounding factors. The results support the assumption that intoxication is significantly related to the association between alcohol consumption and deliberate self-harm in adolescents.

TI Origins of the desire for euthanasia and assisted suicide in people with

SO LANCET

DT Article
ID ATTITUDES; CARE; NETHERLANDS; DEATH
AB Background Euthanasia and assisted suicide, and policies to address them are the subjects of contentious debate in many countries. However, the question of why people desire euthanasia or assisted suicide has not been coherently answered. We aimed to answer this question in a specific group of patients.
   Methods We did a qualitative study of 32 people with HIV-1 or AIDS, who were enrolled in the HIV-1 Ontario Observational Database at Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We elicited participants' experiences of deliberation about euthanasia or assisted suicide, and the meaning of these experiences with in-depth, face-to-face interviews. We analysed our data with grounded theory methods.
   Findings Participants' desire for euthanasia and assisted suicide were affected by two main factors: disintegration, which resulted from symptoms and loss of function; and loss of community, which we defined as progressive diminishment of opportunities to initiate and maintain close personal relationships. These factors resulted in perceived loss of self. Euthanasia and assisted suicide were seen by participants as means of limiting loss of self.
   Interpretation These determinants of desire for euthanasia or assisted suicide in people with HIV-1 or AIDS have implications for the debate on these practices, and development of policies to regulate them.

   ATTITUDES; END; EXPERIENCES; DOCTORS
AB Background: In recent decades significant developments in end-of-life care have taken place in The Netherlands. There has been more attention for palliative care and alongside the practice of euthanasia has been regulated.
   Objective: The aim of this paper is to describe the opinions of physicians with regard to the relationship between palliative care and euthanasia, and determinants of these opinions.
   Design: Cross-sectional.
   Setting/subjects: Representative samples of physicians (n = 410), relatives of patients who died after euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (EAS; n = 87), and members of the Euthanasia Review Committees (ERCs; n = 35).
   Measurements: Structured interviews with physicians and relatives of patients, and a written questionnaire for the members of the ERCs.
   Results: Approximately half of the physicians disagreed and one third agreed with statements describing the quality of palliative care in The Netherlands as suboptimal and describing the expertise of physicians with regard to palliative care as insufficient. Almost two thirds of the physicians disagreed with the suggestion that adequate treatment of pain and terminal care make euthanasia redundant. Having a religious belief, being a nursing home physician or a clinical specialist, never having performed euthanasia, and not wanting to perform euthanasia were related to the belief that adequate treatment of pain and terminal care could make euthanasia redundant.
   Conclusion: The study results indicate that most physicians in The Netherlands are not convinced that palliative care can always alleviate all suffering at the end of life and believe that euthanasia could be appropriate in some cases.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine if fear of an increased risk of attempted suicide in placebo groups participating in placebo-controlled studies is an argument against the performance of placebo-controlled trials in studies of major depression.
   Method: All short-term and long-term, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies that were part of a registration dossier for the indication of major depression that were submitted to the Medicines Evaluation Board, the regulatory authority of the Netherlands, from 1983 to 1997 were reviewed for attempted suicide. In addition, all long-term, placebo-controlled studies from a MEDLINE search that were conducted in the last decade in patients with major depression were assessed for attempted suicide.
   Results: In 77 short-term studies with 12,246 patients in dossiers from the Medicines Evaluation Board, the incidence of suicide was 0.1% in both placebo groups and active compound groups. The incidence of attempted suicide was 0.4% in both placebo groups and active compound groups. in eight long-term studies with 1,949 patients, the incidence of suicide in the placebo groups was 0.0% and 0.2% in the active compound groups. Attempted suicide occurred in 0.7% of both placebo groups and active compound groups. In seven long-term MEDLINE studies, the incidence of attempted suicide in the placebo groups was not higher than in the groups treated with active compound.
   Conclusions: Fear of increased risk of attempted suicide in the placebo groups should not be an argument against performing short-term and long-term, placebo-controlled trials in major depression.

AB Although personal assistance services would appear to have no direct connection to the national debate over legalization of physician-assisted suicide, arguments relating to personal assistance have been raised in the debate. Independent living opponents of a right to assisted suicide contend that people with disabilities who do not have access to the basic personal assistance services they need are inherently oppressed, and a society that provides a right to assisted suicide is essentially an accomplice in coercing such individuals to end their lives, Independent living proponents of the right argue that people with disabilities should have control over the assistance they need to achieve all their goals, and access to desired assistance in seeking death may allow some to decide to forgo or postpone what would otherwise be a desperate act. Both sides would agree that personal assistance services are extremely important to people with disabilities, and that universal access to such services will eliminate a major area of contention in the right-to-die debate in the United States.

AB Relief for surviving relatives following a suicide. - After the suicide of a 43-year-old woman with known depression, a 41-year-old paraplegic man who recently developed diarrhoea and a 41-year-old woman with probable depression with symptoms of psychosis, the general practitioners of the surviving relatives offered a sympathetic ear, answered questions and prescribed sedatives and/or follow-up counselling. Completed suicide occurs 1500 times each year in the Netherlands and is strongly associated with psychiatric morbidity as well as psychological features like hopelessness and inability to solve problems. Generally, this irreversible act of despair can lead to existential difficulties in surviving relatives. Following a loss, acceptance of reality is essential to initiating effective emotional processing. The general practitioner is often first and foremost involved in providing support and comfort to bereaved families, during which many questions about the cause of death are brought up. The general practitioner helps the family to reconstruct the rationale behind the suicide in order to initiate effective emotional processing. In addition, the general practitioner can assess the risk of psychiatric morbidity, including suicidal behaviour, in surviving relatives.

AB Background: The Turkish community living in Europe has an increased risk for suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. Online self-help may be an effective way of engagement with this community. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally adapted, guided, cognitive behavioural therapy-based online self-help intervention targeting suicidal ideation for Turkish adults living in the Netherlands and in the UK.
   Methods and design: This study will be performed in two phases. First, the Dutch online intervention will be adapted to Turkish culture. The second phase will be a randomized controlled trial with two conditions: experimental and waiting-list control. Ethical approval has been granted for the trials in London and Amsterdam. The experimental group will obtain direct access to the intervention, which will take 6 weeks to complete. Participants in the waiting-list condition will obtain access to the modules after 6 weeks. Participants in both conditions will be assessed at baseline, post-test and 3 months post-test follow-up. The primary outcome measure is reduction in frequency and intensity of suicidal thoughts. Secondary outcome measures are self-harm, attempted suicide, suicide ideation attributes, depression, hopelessness, anxiety, quality of life, worrying and satisfaction with the treatment.

ID NETHERLANDS
AB Objective: In the Netherlands the law states that physicians are allowed to grant a request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (EAS) if specific criteria for due care are met. This study investigated which sources physicians use to determine whether three of these criteria (unbearable and hopeless suffering, and no realistic alternatives for treatment) are met. Methods: The data were collected for the project Support and Consultation on Euthanasia in the Netherlands. General practitioners (GPs) received a written questionnaire concerning the most recent request for EAS that they had received. Of the 3614 (60%) GPs who returned the questionnaire, 1681 described the most recent request for EAS. Results: The study shows that physicians used different types of sources, and more than one source. to determine whether the criteria were met. More sources were used when the criteria were met or when a request resulted in EAS. The determination of every criterion required a different approach, but for all criteria discussions with colleagues were important. Conclusion: Using less sources when a criterion is not met could possibly lead to less extensive consideration of the criteria, and therefore to assessing too easily that the request does not meet the criteria for due care.

AB Extant theory hypothesizes that offenders have greater risk of premature and unnatural death than nonoffenders, but few studies have assessed this hypothesis; those doing so have relied on U. S. samples of male offenders typically followed until midlife. This article examines the relation between criminal conduct and mortality rates in the Netherlands using data from the Criminal Careers and Life Course Study, which traces the life course and criminal careers of 4,615 males and females convicted in 1977 up until 2002. The causes of deaths that occurred during this 25-year period are examined using data from the Netherlands Statistics. Results show that criminal conduct increases the chance of premature death due to natural and unnatural causes. Convicted persons run greater risks of dying of unnatural causes such as accidents, homicide, and suicide. Additionally, risk of premature, unnatural death varies, with high-rate, persistent offenders evincing higher risks than other types of offenders.

AB Using survey data from the Netherlands, we find that Muslims have relatively high levels of religious philanthropic behavior and relatively low levels of secular philanthropic behavior, whereas Hindus have relatively low levels of religious philanthropic behavior and higher levels of secular philanthropic behavior. Results indicate that the community explanation and the conviction explanation of the relationship between religion and philanthropic behavior are both valid to some extent when it comes to differences in philanthropic behavior between Christians, Muslims, and Hindus. In addition, we find a relationship between group orientation in worship rituals on the relation between religion and philanthropic behavior. The more group-oriented the worship rituals, the stronger the relation between religion and philanthropic behavior. The results suggest that Durkheim's theory (La Suicide: Etude de Sociologie. Presses Universitaires de France, Paris, 1897) may only be valid in a Christian context.

ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; DIGNITY; DEATH
AB The results of Oregon's first year with physician-assisted suicide raise two questions. First, how will it be possible to evaluate what is actually going on in Oregon if there is no public access to the records and if physicians are shielded by patient confidentiality rules? The second question is whether the public understood that many, if not most, Of those who want physician-assisted suicide want it not to relieve suffering as ordinarily understood but to maintain control over their dying, something that may not correlate at all with suffering from illness and disease. This commentary reviews the existing evidence from the Netherlands and suggests that abuse of the vulnerable will likely occur in Oregon over time. It also reviews the insufficiency of the data emerging from Oregon. Finally, it addresses the various issues raised by the other commentators to the main article.

AB Death, like many social problems, has become medicalized. In response to this medicalization, physician-assisted suicide (PAS) has emerged as one alternative among many at the end of life. And although the practice is currently legal in the states of Oregon and Washington, opponents still argue that PAS is unethical, is inconsistent with a physician's role, and cannot be effectively regulated. In comparison, Switzerland, like Oregon, permits PAS, but unlike Oregon, non-physicians and private organizations play a significant role in assisted death. Could the Swiss model be the answer ? The following essay explores the Swiss model of assisted suicide for its potential to enhance the regulation of PAS, reduce physician involvement, and perhaps demedicalize the way we die.

ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; NETHERLANDS; CARE
AB Over the past 30 years, euthanasia has been under continuous debate in the Netherlands, This contribution aims to provide a moral assessment of this debate. It is argued that euthanasia should be understood within a historical context, as a protest against medical power and as a way to bring about good death. Within the euthanasia debate, two paradoxes are identified which make the issue inherently complex and hard to regulate, The first paradox results from the dialectical relation between individual autonomy and relief of suffering as the major justifications of euthanasia. Although euthanasia represents an ultimate effort to give the individual patient control over his dying, the result of the debate is an increase of medical power, The second paradox is that although euthanasia emerged from a commitment to good death, it is resulting in a reduced range of options to bring about good death.

TI A role for doctors in assisted dying?: An analysis of legal regulations
   and medical professional positions in six European countries
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID PALLIATIVE CARE; SUICIDE; EUTHANASIA; NETHERLANDS; ATTITUDES
AB Objectives: To analyse legislation and medical professional positions concerning the doctor's role in assisted dying in western Europe, and to discuss their implications for doctors.
   Method: This paper is based on country-specific reports by experts from European countries where assisted dying is legalised (Belgium, The Netherlands), or openly practiced (Switzerland), or where it is illegal (Germany, Norway, UK).
   Results: Laws on assisted dying in The Netherlands and Belgium are restricted to doctors. In principle, assisted suicide (but not euthanasia) is not illegal in either Germany or Switzerland, but a doctor's participation in Germany would violate the code of professional medical conduct and might contravene of a doctor's legal duty to save life. The Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill proposed in the UK in 2005 focused on doctors, whereas the Proposal on Assisted Dying of the Norwegian Penal Code Commission minority in 2002 did not.
   Professional medical organisations in all these countries except The Netherlands maintain the position that medical assistance in dying conflicts with the basic role of doctors. However, in Belgium and Switzerland, and for a time in the UK, these organisations dropped their opposition to new legislation. Today, they regard the issue as primarily a matter for society and politics. This "neutral'' stance differs from the official position of the Royal Dutch Medical Association which has played a key role in developing the Dutch practice of euthanasia as a "medical end-of-life decision'' since the 1970s.
   Conclusion: A society moving towards an open approach to assisted dying should carefully identify tasks to assign exclusively to medical doctors, and distinguish those possibly better performed by other professions.

AB Background: The presence of a comorbid borderline personality disorder (BPD) may be associated with an increase of suicidal behaviors in patients with depressive and anxiety disorders. The aim of this study is to examine the role of borderline personality traits on recurrent suicide attempts.
   Methods: The Netherlands Study on Depression and Anxiety included 1838 respondents with lifetime depressive and/or anxiety disorders, of whom 309 reported at least one previous suicide attempt. A univariable negative binomial regression analysis was performed to examine the association between comorbid borderline personality traits and suicide attempts. Univariable and multivariable negative binomial regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for the number of recurrent suicide attempts in four clusters (type and severity of axis-I disorders. BPD traits, determinants of suicide attempts and socio-demographics).
   Results: In the total sample the suicide attempt rate ratio increased with 33% for every unit increase in BPD traits. A lifetime diagnosis of dysthymia and comorbid BPD traits, especially the symptoms anger and fights, were independently and significantly associated with recurrent suicide attempts in the final model (n=309).
   Limitations: The screening of personality disorders was added to the NESDA assessments at the 4-year follow-up for the first time. Therefore we were not able to examine the influence of comorbid BPD traits on suicide attempts over time.
   Conclusions: Persons with a lifetime diagnosis of dysthymia combined with borderline personality traits especially difficulties in coping with anger seemed to be at high risk for recurrent suicide attempts. For clinical practice, it is recommended to screen for comorbid borderline personality traits and to strengthen the patient's coping skills with regard to anger. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Extended suicide (also known as homicide-suicide) is an incident in which the perpetrator kills one or more people against their will and subsequently commits suicide. Victim and offender are often in a close relationship. In the case of a failed suicide, the offender has to anticipate extensive penal consequences (A A 211 ff. of the German criminal code).
   The aim of this study was to analyze homicide-suicide cases that occurred during a 21-year period (1994-2014) and to gain further information about the background of these incidents.
   In a retrospective study, 58 cases of homicide-suicide investigated at the Institute of Legal Medicine, Goethe University in Frankfurt/Main, Germany were analyzed. Information about the incidents was obtained from the autopsy reports and from prosecution investigation files, as far as these were provided in accordance with data protection regulations. A literature survey and a homicide-suicide classification system were conducted and descriptive and statistical data analyses were performed.
   In 58 cases a total of 74 victims were involved in which 93% of the offenders were male and 7% female. Of the victims 76% were female, 20% male and 4% remained unknown. Victims involved 17 children and 66% of the incidents included a spouse or intimate partner relationship. In 71% the crime scene took place in the domestic environment. The main triggering factors of the acts were marriage conflicts and financial problems. In 57% of the cases shooting was the method of choice.
   Due to the severity and consequences of the act, the term homicide-suicide rather than extended suicide should be employed in German linguistic usage because it is a homicide with subsequent suicide. The emphasis should be placed on the development of prevention.

AB Objectives To analyse trends in suicidal behaviour as reported by the Dutch sentinel general practices from 1983 to 2013. Second, to examine the relationship between suicidal behaviour and several patient characteristics. Finally, to compare the relationship between suicidal behaviour and patient characteristics before (1983-2007) and after (2008-2013) the start of the crisis.
   Setting 40 general practices in the Netherlands during the period 1983-2013.
   Participants Patients with an ICPC code of P77 (suicide attempt).
   Primary and secondary outcomes Primary outcomes were age-adjusted and gender-specific trends in reported suicides (342) and suicide attempts (1614). Secondary outcomes were the relationship between suicidal behaviour and age, household composition, history of depression, recognition of suicide ideation, treatment before the suicidal behaviour and contact within the past month before suicidal behaviour for the period 1983-2013. Additionally, separate frequencies for the periods 1983-2007 and 2008-2013 were presented.
   Results Join-point analyses revealed a significant rise in male suicides from 2008 (b=0.32, SE=0.1, p=0.008), and an increase in male suicide attempts since 2009 (b=0.19, SE=0.04, p<0.001). Female suicidal behaviour showed a steady decrease from 1989 to 2013(b=-0.03, SE=0.007, p<0.0001 for female suicide, b=-0.02, SE=0.002, p<0.001 for female attempts). Before 2007, a history of depression was reported in 65% (168/257) of the suicides. After the start of the recession, a depression was recognised in 44% (22/50) of the patients who died by suicide.
   Conclusions Since 2008, there was a rise in the male suicide rate while female suicide behaviour has continued to decline. General practitioners less often reported a history of depression within patients who died due to suicide after 2007 than before. Training in the early recognition of suicide ideation in depressive patients might improve suicide prevention in primary care.

AB On February 6, 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the prohibition of physician-assisted death (PAD) was unconstitutional for a competent adult person who "clearly consents to the termination of life" and has a "grievous and irremediable (including an illness, disease, or disability) condition that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition."(1) The radically subjective nature of this ruling raises important questions about who will be involved and how this practice might be regulated. This paper aims to stimulate discussion about psychiatry's role in this heretofore illegal practice and to explore how psychiatry might become involved in end-of-life care in a meaningful, patient-centred way. First, I will review existing international legislation and professional regulatory standards regarding psychiatry and PAD. Second, I will discuss important challenges psychiatry might face regarding capacity assessment, the notion of rational suicide, and the assessment of suffering.

DE Ethics; Dementia; End of life; Euthanasia; Assisted suicide
AB The number of dementia patients requesting euthanasia in the Netherlands has increased over the past five years. The issue is highly controversial. In this contribution we discuss some of the main arguments: the nature of suffering, the voluntariness of the request and the role of the physician. We argue that society has a duty to care for patients who suffer from dementia and to make their lives as good and comfortable as possible. We also argue that it can be morally acceptable for those who do not want to continue their life with dementia to choose to die. The choice can be based on good reasons.

AB In Switzerland, where assisted suicide but not euthanasia is permitted, the authors sought to understand how physicians integrate palliative sedation in their practice and how they reflect on existential suffering and death hastening. They interviewed 31 physicians from different care settings. Five major attitudes emerged. Among specialized palliative care physicians, convinced, cautious and doubtful attitudes were evident. Within unspecialized settings, palliative sedation was more likely to be considered as death hastening: clinicians either avoid it with an inexperienced attitude or practice it with an ambiguous attitude, raising the issue of unskilled and abusive uses of sedatives at the end of life.

AB BackgroundAlthough the cross-sectional association between mental disorders and suicide ideation is well studied, less is known about the prospective association. In this paper, we estimated among those without 12-month suicide ideation at baseline, the association between a wide variety of common mental disorders at baseline and suicide ideation within the 6-year follow-up period, after controlling for history of other mental disorders and demographic variables.MethodsData were used from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 (NEMESIS-2), a prospective representative adult cohort study with baseline (n=6646) with a 6-year follow-up period. Lifetime mental disorders were assessed at baseline with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0. Within the longitudinal design, participants with first time or recurrent suicide ideation were defined follows: having no suicide ideation in the 12months before the baseline assessment, and reporting to have had seriously thought about suicide between baseline and the 6-year follow-up period. Multiple logistical regression was used to estimate the longitudinal association between suicide ideation and a specific mental disorder while controlling for comorbidity and baseline variables. To account for the prevalence of a disorder in the population, for each disorder, the population attributable risk proportion (PARP) was calculated.Results2.9% (n=132) of the participants that did not report suicide ideation in the past 12months at baseline reported suicide ideation at follow-up. Of these 132 cases, 81 (61%) experienced suicide ideation for the first time in their lives and could be viewed as first onset cases. 51 (39%) reported recurrent suicide ideation. After controlling for comorbidity, the only two disorders that were significantly related to suicide ideation at follow-up were lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). PARP for MDD was 47.8 and 16.6% for GAD.ConclusionsAfter controlling for all other mental disorders, a lifetime history of MDD and GAD were related to suicide ideation at follow-up. For clinical practice, this indicates that patients with a history of MDD or GAD stay vulnerable for suicide ideation, even though they did not report suicide ideation in the past year.

AB What is the best way to care for a child with severe neurologic impairment who seems to be dying and is in intractable pain? Can we give sedation as we remove life support? Is it ethically permissible to hasten death? In the United States, 5 states have legalized assisted suicide (although only for competent adults). In Belgium and the Netherlands, euthanasia is legal for children under some circumstances. We present a case in which parents and doctors face difficult decisions about palliative care. Experts from Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United States then discuss how they would respond to such a case.

AB Thoughts of self-harm and suicidal behavior are thought to be influenced by both genetics and environment. Molecular genetic studies are beginning to address the question of which genes may be involved and whether different genes may be expressed in men and women. We examined thoughts of self-harm and suicidal behavior in a large general population twin sample including male and female same- and opposite-sex twins. In this study, data on self-reported thoughts of self-harm and suicide were obtained from self-report questionnaires (Beck Depression Inventory and Youth or Adult Self Report forms) in 6,265 twin pairs (11,008 individuals) aged 1190 (62% female) from the Netherlands Twin Registry. Liability threshold models were compared including sex and age (linear and quadratic) effects. Models were compared using measures of parsimony to calculate the simplest model to the data. A model with additive genetic and unique environmental contributions fitted the data for both males and females. There were no qualitative sex differences, but the relative contributions differed between men and women. Heritability was higher in women (0.74, 95% CI 0.65-0.81) than men (0.45, 95% CI 0.28-0.61). The remaining variance was accounted for by environmental influence unique to an individual. These results suggest contributions from additive genetic factors to self-reported thoughts of self-harm and suicide and support the continued study of both molecular genetic and individual-specific environmental risk factors.

AB This article examines the evidence for the empirical argument that there is a slippery slope between the legalization of voluntary and non-voluntary euthanasia. The main source of evidence in relation to this argument comes from the Netherlands. The argument is only effective against legalization if it is legalization which causes the slippery slope. Moreover, it is only effective if it is used comparatively-to show that the slope is more slippery in jurisdictions which have legalized voluntary euthanasia than it is in jurisdictions which have not done so. Both of these elements are examined comparatively.

AB Two decades of research on euthanasia in the Netherlands have resulted into clear insights in the frequency and characteristics of euthanasia and other medical end-of-life decisions in the Netherlands. These empirical studies have contributed to the quality of the public debate, and to the regulating and public control of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. No slippery slope seems to have occurred. Physicians seem to adhere to the criteria for due care in the large majority of cases. Further, it has been shown that the majority of physicians think that the euthanasia Act has improved their legal certainty and contributes to the carefulness of life-terminating acts. In 2005, eighty percent of the euthanasia cases were reported to the review committees. Thus, the transparency envisaged by the Act still does not extend to all cases. Unreported cases almost all involve the use of opioids, and are not considered to be euthanasia by physicians. More education and debate is needed to disentangle in these situations which acts should be regarded as euthanasia and which should not. Medical end-of-life decision-making is a crucial part of end-of-life care. It should therefore be given continuous attention in health care policy and medical training. Systematic periodic research is crucial for enhancing our understanding of end-of-life care in modern medicine, in which the pursuit of a good quality of dying is nowadays widely recognized as an important goal, in addition to the traditional goals such as curing diseases and prolonging life.

AB The Netherlands was one of the first countries in the world to establish a legal framework for physician-assisted dying (PAD). In this article, we provide an overview of the public, political, legal, and medical debates on physician-assisted dying in the Netherlands, focusing on the role of psychiatry and mental illness. The number of individuals with chronic mental illness requesting PAD has been relatively small (although the number can be expected to increase because of the activities of various civic organizations advocating the right to die) and Dutch psychiatrists have been extremely reluctant to respond to such requests. Nevertheless, mental conditions have been central to the public debate on PAD by helping to define the nature and limits of current legislation and professional practice. Although a few Dutch psychiatrists have campaigned to increase the involvement of psychiatrists and many support PAD in principle, the majority has been hesitant to engage in PAD despite increasing public pressure.

AB Objective To determine whether the strong increase in assisted suicides in Switzerland since 2008 is linked to a shift in the socioeconomic factors associated with assisted suicide and its related diagnoses.
   Methods In a population-based longitudinal study, we investigated assisted suicides in Switzerland over the period 2003-2014. Two groups of younger (25-64 years) and older (65-94 years) persons were analysed separately and compared. We calculated crude rates and used Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression models to examine associations of assisted dying with gender, marital status, education, religion, neighbourhood socioeconomic status and other variables, and investigated trends over time.
   Results We identified 3941 assisted suicides among 6 237 997 Swiss residents, 80% of which occurred in the older age group. Crude rates of assisted suicide more than tripled during the study period from 3.60 to 11.21 per 100 000 person-years; the increase was more pronounced in the older age group. Cancer was the most common underlying diagnosis (41.8%), but the percentage dying assisted was highest among patients with diseases of the nervous system (5.25% in the younger and 1.23% in the older age group). The factors associated with assisted suicide did not change during the study period. Female gender, higher education, having no religious affiliation, no children and a Swiss passport, living in a neighbourhood with a higher socioeconomic index and living in the French-speaking part of Switzerland were associated with a higher rate.
   Conclusions The study results do not indicate any shift in socioeconomic factors associated with assisted suicide, but a more pronounced increase in incidence among the elderly.

AB Context. Thousands of family members worldwide are annually involved in assisted dying. Family participation in assisted dying has rarely been investigated and families' needs typically are not considered in assisted dying legislation and clinical guidelines.
   Objectives. To explore family caregivers' reflections on experiences of assisted suicide in Switzerland.
   Methods. A cross-sectional qualitative interview study conducted in the Italian-and French-speaking regions of Switzerland. Interpretation and analysis were performed using qualitative content analysis.
   Results. Twenty-eight close relatives and family carers of 18 patients who died by assisted suicide in Switzerland were interviewed. Family members perceived their involvement in assisted suicide as characterized by five phases; 1) contemplation, 2) gaining acceptance, 3) gaining permission, 4) organization, and 5) aftermath. Families can participate in these phases at diverse levels and with varying degrees of involvement. Important triggers for families and patients for transition between phases include patients' experiences of their life-threatening illnesses and related treatments, their increasing awareness of approaching death, and family member recognition of their loved one's unbearable suffering. Participating in assisted suicide created further demanding tasks for families in addition to their role of caregivers.
   Conclusion. Families appeared to be involved in the preparation of assisted suicide along with patients, irrespective of their personal values regarding assisted dying. Support for family members is essential if they are involved in tasks preparatory to assisted suicide. Clinical guidelines and policies concerning assisted dying should acknowledge and address family needs. (C) 2017 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

ID EUTHANASIA; NETHERLANDS; SWITZERLAND; ATTITUDES; OREGON; LIFE; END
AB Background and methods: In Switzerland, non-medical right-to-die organisations offer instruction and personal guidance in committing suicide to members suffering from incurable diseases. Suicide is usually committed with a lethal dose of barbiturates prescribed by a physician.
   This study is a retrospective analysis of all case files of assisted suicide kept during the period 1990-2000 by "Exit Deutsche Schweiz", the largest Swiss right-to-die organisation.
   Results: Between 1990 and 2000 Exit assisted in 748 suicides among Swiss residents (0.1% of total deaths, 4.8% of total suicides). 54.4% of the deceased were women. Mean age at death was 73 years in males and 72 years in females (range 18-101 years). Assisted suicide was over-proportionately represented in the German-speaking (p <0.0001), more urbanised (p <0.0001), predominantly Protestant (p <0.0001) cantons. Over the study period the annual number of Exit deaths more than tripled (p <0.0001).
   Of the 331 who died in Canton Zurich, 47.4% had cancer, 11.8% cardiovascular/respiratory disease, 12.4% neurological disease and 7.3% HIV/AIDS. The remaining 21.1% suffered from other, usually non-fatal conditions; 76% of these were women.
   There were no significant changes in sex, age and distribution of diagnoses during the study period. At first all the lethal substances were taken orally, but by the end of the study period 14% were administered via infusion or PEG catheter.
   All assisted suicides in the City of Zurich were duly notified to the authorities.
   Conclusions:The number of suicides assisted by "Exit Deutsche Schweiz" and the practices followed markedly expanded over this time. There was no apparent relaxation of the indications for assisted suicide. Notification of the authorities appeared to be total.

AB Objective: Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are important indicators of extreme emotional distress. However, little is known about predictors of onset and course of suicidality in the general population. Our study tried to fill this gap by analyzing data from a prospectively followed community sample.
   Method: Data were derived from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS), a 3-wave cohort study in a representative sample (n = 4848) of the Dutch adult general population.
   Results: The 3-year incidence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts was 2.7% and 0.9%, respectively. Predictors of first-onset suicidal ideation and suicide attempts were sociodemographic variables (especially the negative change in situation variables), life events, personal vulnerability indicators, and emotional (mood and anxiety) disorders. Comparison of the corresponding odds ratios and confidence intervals revealed that predictors for first-onset suicidal ideation and suicide attempts did not differ significantly. One of the strongest predictors of incident suicide attempts was previous suicidal ideation. Regarding the course of suicidal ideation, it was found that 31.3% still endorsed these thoughts and 7.4% reported having made a suicide attempt 2 years later.
   Conclusions: Similar predictors were found for first-onset suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. This suggests that suicidal behaviours may be ordered on a continuum and have shared risk factors. While suicidal thoughts may be necessary for, they are not sufficient predictors of, suicidal acts. The course of suicidality in the general population can be characterized by a minority of people having suicidal experiences that develop over time with progressively increasing severity.

AB Background: Care-dependency constitutes an important issue with regard to the approval of end-of-life decisions, yet attitudes towards assisted suicide and euthanasia are understudied among care-dependent older adults. We assessed attitudes towards assisted suicide and euthanasia and tested empirical correlates, including socio-demographics, religiosity, physical illness, psychological distress and social isolation.
   Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional survey among older care allowance recipients (50+) in private households in Austria was conducted in 2016. In computer-assisted personal interviews, 493 respondents were asked whether or not they approved of the availability of assisted suicide and euthanasia in case of long-term care dependency and whether or not they would consider using assisted suicide or euthanasia for themselves. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess the impact of potential determinants of attitudes towards assisted suicide and euthanasia.
   Results: About a quarter (24.8-26.0%) of the sampled care-dependent older adults approved of the availability of assisted suicide and euthanasia respectively indicated the will to (hypothetically) make use of assisted suicide or euthanasia. Attitudes towards assisted suicide were most favourable among care-dependent older adults living in urban areas, those who did not trust physicians, those who reported active suicide ideation, and individuals with a strong fear of dying. With regard to euthanasia, living alone, religiosity and fear of dying were the central determinants of acceptance.
   Conclusions: Positive attitudes towards and will to (hypothetically) use assisted suicide and euthanasia were expressed by a substantial minority of care-dependent older adults in Austria and are driven by current psychological suffering and fear of the process of dying in the (near) future. Community-based psychosocial care should be expanded to address psychological distress and fears about end-of-life issues among care-dependent older adults.

AB Depressive disorders have been strongly linked to suicidality, but the association with anxiety disorders is less well established. This exploratory study aims to examine whether anxiety and depressive disorders are both independent risk factors for suicidal ideation and attempted suicide, and additionally examined the role of specific clinical characteristics (disorder type, severity, duration, onset age) in suicidality. Data are from 1693 persons with a current (6-month) CIDI based depressive or anxiety disorder and 644 healthy controls participating in the baseline measurement of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, which is an existing dataset. Suicidal ideation in the week prior to baseline and attempted suicide ever in life were assessed. Results showed that compared to persons with only an anxiety disorder, persons with a depressive disorder were at significantly higher risk to have current suicidal ideation or a history of attempted suicide. When examining the association between type of disorder and suicidality the odds ratio for MDD was significantly higher than those for the separate anxiety disorders. Although depression and anxiety severity were univariate risk indicators for suicidal ideation and attempted suicide, only depression severity remained a risk indicator for suicidal ideation and attempted suicide in multivariate analyses. Additional risk indicators were an early age at disorder onset for both suicidal ideation and attempted suicide, male gender for suicidal ideation and lower education for attempted suicide. These findings suggest that although anxiety and depression tend to converge in many important areas, they appear to diverge with respect to suicidality. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We assess (i) whether being married is a protective factor against socio-economic inequalities in suicide, and (ii) whether any such buffering effect varies between countries. We used the data from a European cross-national comparison project, a prospective follow-up of several European population censuses matched with vital statistics. The data encompass 99.5 million person-years aged 30 and above and, 25,476 suicides in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Turin, Madrid, Norway and Switzerland. Standardised rates were computed and logistic regressions were used to assess educational inequalities. Among the non-married, the lower educational group had an increased risk of dying of suicide compared to the higher group (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.45). Inequalities among the married were lower (OR = 1.29). In all countries or regions except Austria, the lower educational group had a higher risk of suicide mortality among the non-married than among the married. The buffering effect of being married was not observed for elderly individuals (65 and over). Among younger individuals, the buffering effect of being married on relative inequalities in suicide was stronger in Madrid, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland (but significant only for Denmark and Norway). There was no indication that countries with stronger welfare policies or lower divorce rate had a lower buffering effect. We conclude that being married protects against inequalities in suicide and that this protective effect is not affected by the level of social capital at the country level. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Both increased as well as decreased cancer mortality among psychiatric patients has been reported, but competing death causes were not included in the analyses. This study aims to investigate whether observed cancer mortality in patients with psychiatric disorders might be biased by competing death causes.
   In this retrospective cohort study on data from the Psychiatric Case Register Middle Netherlands linked to the death register of Statistics Netherlands, the risk of cancer death among patients with schizophrenia (N = 4,590), bipolar disorder (N = 2,077), depression (N = 15,130) and their matched controls (N = 87,405) was analyzed using a competing risk model.
   Compared to controls, higher hazards of cancer death were found in patients with schizophrenia (HR = 1.61, 95 % CI 1.26-2.06), bipolar disorder (HR = 1.20, 95 % CI 0.81-1.79) and depression (HR = 1.26, 95 % CI 1.10-1.44). However, the HRs of death due to suicide and other death causes were more elevated. Consequently, among those who died, the 12-year cumulative risk of cancer death was significantly lower.
   Our analysis shows that, compared to the general population, psychiatric patients are at higher risk of dying from cancer, provided that they survive the much more elevated risks of suicide and other death causes.

TI Cognitive behaviour therapy to prevent complicated grief among relatives

SO BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID TRAUMATIC GRIEF; STATISTICS; RISK
AB Objective To examine the effectiveness of a family based grief counselling programme to prevent complicated grief among first degree relatives and spouses of someone who had committed suicide.
   Design Cluster randomised controlled trial with follow-up at 13 months after the suicide.
   Setting General practices in the Netherlands.
   Participants 122 first degree relatives and spouses of 70 people who committed suicide; 39 families (68 participants) were allocated to intervention, 31 families (54 participants) to control.
   Intervention A family based, cognitive behaviour counselling programme of four sessions with a trained psychiatric nurse counsellor between three to six months after the suicide. Control participants received usual care.
   Main outcome measures Self report complicated grief. Secondary outcomes were the presence of maladaptive grief reactions, depression, suicidal ideation, and perceptions of being to blame for the suicide.
   Results The intervention was not associated with a reduction in complicated grief (mean difference -0.61, 95% confidence interval -6.05 to 4.83; P = 0.82). Secondary outcomes were not affected either. When adjusted for baseline inequalities, the intervention reduced the risk of perceptions of being to blame (odds ratio 0.18, 0.05 to 0.67; P = 0.01) and maladaptive grief reactions (0.39, 0.15 to 1.01; P = 0.06).
   Conclusions A cognitive behaviour grief counselling programme for families bereaved by suicide did not reduce the risk of complicated grief or suicidal ideation or the level of depression. The programme may help to prevent maladaptive grief reactions and perceptions of blame among first degree relatives and spouses.

TI Euthanasia and assisted suicide: Comparison of legal aspects in
   Switzerland and other countries
SO MEDICINE SCIENCE AND THE LAW
LA English
DT Article
AB The purpose of this paper is to present the legal aspects associated with assisted suicide in Switzerland and compare them with those in other countries. Like euthanasia, assisted suicide is a subject that induces much discussion in many countries. While the law is very liberal in some countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands (where both euthanasia and assisted suicide take place), these practices are very controversial in other countries, such as France, where they remain taboo subjects.
   In the United States of America, the laws concerning assisted suicide can differ greatly from one state to another. For example, in Oregon, assisted suicide is allowed if applied by a medical doctor; in others, this act is illegal. In Canada, it is punishable according to the Criminal Code.
   In Switzerland euthanasia is punishable by law. However, the penal code does not condemn assisted suicide, whether carried out by a medical doctor or another person, provided it is not carried out through selfish motives. The application of these practices has become simplified in recent years and societies for the right to die with dignity based on this principle have come into being (Exit and Dignitas).
   In the French- and German-speaking parts of Switzerland the association Exit assists individuals living in Switzerland with serious progressive and incurable disease in their engagement to end their life. The association Dignitas, in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, also undertakes - in the same circumstances - to assist individuals coming from foreign countries. Dignitas welcomes several such individuals every year, especially from Germany, where a similar approach does not currently exist.

ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; UNITED-STATES; NETHERLANDS
AB In the project 'Support and consultation in Euthanasia in Amsterdam' (SCEA) general practitioners can turn to 20 especially trained physicians for advice or consultation concerning euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. In this study the implementation was evaluated and it was investigated whether the goals of SCEA. supporting physicians and improving the quality of consultation, the quality of decision-making and the willingness to report. were met. Methods used were a questionnaire send to all general practitioners ls registered in Amsterdam (n = 398). registration forms SCEA physicians filled in for every time SCEA was contacted and records of the public prosecutor. After the study period of 14 months. of the general practitioners who had performed euthanasia during this period. 53% had contacted SCEA at least once. The vast majority of general practitioners felt supported bq SCEA. The quality of consultation was: (even) higher in cases of euthanasia in which a SCEA physician acted as consultant than in cases with another consultant. We found no relation between use of SCEA and the last two goals of SCEA. Conclusions: Whether the lack of relation found between SCEA and it's last two goals is real or due to the studies limitations remains unclear. The results of this study do suggest that SCEA. by further improving the quality of consultation, has contributed to the safeguarding of euthanasia and assisted suicide. Therefore, similar networks are being developed throughout the Netherlands. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite the Netherlands' reputation as a world leader with respect to gay rights, homosexual Dutch men have much higher rates of mood disorders, anxiety disorders and suicide attempts than heterosexual Dutch men. Epidemiologists report similar disparities elsewhere in Western Europe and North America. These findings have been the focus of a blossoming psychological literature, inspired by minority stress theory and deploying quantitative methods. Our investigation aims to complement this body of work by adopting an ethnographic approach. Drawing from fieldwork conducted in the Netherlands from 2009 to 2010, we explore sociocultural and contextual factors that have received relatively little attention with respect to gay mental health. In the Netherlands - considered a model for gay equality - how can one understand high rates of psychiatric disorders among gay men? This study points to heteronormativity, complex dynamics involving long-term relationships and processes within gay subcultures as key issues. Notwithstanding their putative socioeconomic, legal and political equality, gay men struggled - at various stages of the life cycle - with internalised norms that they found difficult to fulfil. The desire to embody these ideals, and structural constraints in meeting them, could be potent sources of disappointment and distress.

AB This study investigated the impact of a visit from a consulting physician on the patient and the relatives during the euthanasia procedure in The Netherlands. Data on experiences with the consultant's visit were collected from 86 relatives and 3,614 general practitioners, who described their most recent request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. More than three-quarters of the patients experienced the visit as they had expected, or became more positive. Although about 1 out of 5 patients had negative experiences, this study indicates that, in general, a visit from a consulting physician is not perceived to be burdensome for patients.

AB Previous research has treated multiple family homicide, or familicide, as a uniform event. We sought to explore whether subtypes of familicide could be discerned, making use of a decade of Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) coupled with newspaper articles. The resulting 238 cases were analyzed through a two-step cluster analysis, showing that the familicides can be subgrouped into four categories based on the perpetrator's age, relationship between perpetrator and victims, and perpetrator's suicide. The empirically grouped categories were labeled Despondent Husbands, Spousal Revenge, Extended Parricide, and Diffuse Conflict. Familicide is thus a heterogeneous phenomenon and must be viewed in unique terms to appropriately determine prevention strategies.

ID TRAIN SUICIDES; SYSTEM; NETHERLANDS; PATTERNS; BEHAVIOR
AB This study presents and compares the prevalence and characteristics of rail-related suicide and other railway fatalities in Canada over 10 years, from 1999 to 2008. The methodology involved in-depth data analysis of records from provincial coroner and medical examiner's investigations, railway company reports and Transportation Safety Board data. We identify physical risk factors and psychosocial descriptions of people who commit suicide and compared them to accidental (non-suicide). railway fatalities in order to identify at-risk populations and better target and elaborate railway suicide prevention strategies. We identified 460 accidental deaths and 428 suicides. Most people (94.7%) died on the site of the incident, although not always immediately. Canada does not have any specific locations with high incidence suicide or accidents clusters. We conclude that impairment of some type, by illness, substance abuse or intoxication, advanced age or immature youth, play an important role in a significant number of accidents, suggesting that more intense warnings of approaching trains may help prevent accidental deaths. Mental illness, although often being treated, is associated with the majority of suicide fatalities, and more than one-third of suicides occur on rails near psychiatric facilities, suggesting targeted prevention strategies in facilities near rails and at track locations in proximity to mental health facilities. What is already known on this subject:
   - In other countries we have basic data on location, time and date, gender, age and some basic epidemiological characteristics of railway fatalities, usually combining suicides and accidental fatalities in studies of collisions or Person Under Train (PUT) incidents.
   - Hotspots for suicides have been identified in Europe, often near psychiatric facilities.
   What this study adds:
   - We provide more in-depth information on fatality victims from analyses of detailed coroners' investigations and industry reports on all railway fatalities in Canada over an extended period of ten years.
   - We compare characteristics of deaths by suicide with accident fatalities in order to develop specific recommendations for prevention programmes that consider the specific characteristics of each type of fatality.
   - Our approach provides a model for developing prevention strategies based upon in-depth comparative analyses of suicides and accident fatalities to adapt prevention approaches to characteristics unique to a country or location, and the different characteristics of people who die on railways by suicide and in accidental fatalities.

AB IMPORTANCE Euthanasia or assisted suicide (EAS) of psychiatric patients is increasing in some jurisdictions such as Belgium and the Netherlands. However, little is known about the practice, and it remains controversial.
   OBJECTIVES To describe the characteristics of patients receiving EAS for psychiatric conditions and how the practice is regulated in the Netherlands.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This investigation reviewed psychiatric EAS case summaries made available online by the Dutch regional euthanasia review committees as of June 1, 2015. Two senior psychiatrists used directed content analysis to review and code the reports. In total, 66 cases from 2011 to 2014 were reviewed.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Clinical and social characteristics of patients, physician review process of the patients' requests, and the euthanasia review committees' assessments of the physicians' actions.
   RESULTS Of the 66 cases reviewed, 70%(n = 46) were women. In total, 32%(n = 21) were 70 years or older, 44% (n = 29) were 50 to 70 years old, and 24% (n = 16) were 30 to 50 years old. Most had chronic, severe conditions, with histories of attempted suicides and psychiatric hospitalizations. Most had personality disorders and were described as socially isolated or lonely. Depressive disorders were the primary psychiatric issue in 55% (n = 36) of cases. Other conditions represented were psychotic, posttraumatic stress or anxiety, somatoform, neurocognitive, and eating disorders, as well as prolonged grief and autism. Comorbidities with functional impairments were common. Forty-one percent (n = 27) of physicians performing EAS were psychiatrists. Twenty-seven percent (n = 18) of patients received the procedure from physicians new to them, 14 of whom were physicians from the End-of-Life Clinic, a mobile euthanasia clinic. Consultation with other physicians was extensive, but 11% (n = 7) of cases had no independent psychiatric input, and 24%(n = 16) of cases involved disagreement among consultants. The euthanasia review committees found that one case failed to meet legal due care criteria.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Persons receiving EAS for psychiatric disorders in the Netherlands are mostly women and of diverse ages, with complex and chronic psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial histories. The granting of their EAS requests appears to involve considerable physician judgment, usually involving multiple physicians who do not always agree (sometimes without independent psychiatric input), but the euthanasia review committees generally defer to the judgments of the physicians performing the EAS.

AB ObjectiveThoughts of death are not regularly included in diagnostic instruments and rarely examined separately from thoughts of suicide. This exploratory study examined whether thoughts of death and thoughts of suicide affect the course of late-life depressive disorders.
   MethodsIn 378 depressed older persons, thoughts of death and thoughts of suicide were assessed using questions from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. After 2years, the presence of a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of minor or major depression or dysthymia was assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology was administered every 6months up till 3-year follow-up.
   ResultsMultinomial logistic regression showed that thoughts of death as well as thoughts of suicide predicted double depression at follow-up (OR=2.14 [95% CI: 1.04-4.40] and OR=6.47 [95% CI: 2.22-3.02], respectively), compared with patients without these thoughts. Results became non-significant when adjusted for baseline depression severity (OR=1.17 [95% CI: 0.52-2.63] and OR=2.57 [95% CI: 0.79-8.84], respectively). Mixed linear models showed that severity of depression was lowest in the reference group, while symptoms decreased more over time in those with either thoughts of death or suicide.
   ConclusionsPatients with thoughts of death or with thoughts of suicide were more severely depressed at baseline and follow-up, with the highest risk of being depressed at follow-up for patients with thoughts of suicide. These associations could be explained by baseline depression severity. The results suggest that thoughts of death and thoughts of suicide are important risk markers in predicting the course of depression. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Some jurisdictions that have decriminalized assisted dying (like Canada) exclude psychiatric patients on the grounds that their condition cannot be determined to be irremediable, that they are vulnerable and in need of protection, or that they cannot be determined to be competent. We review each of these claims and find that none have been sufficiently well-supported to justify the differential treatment psychiatric patients experience with respect to assisted dying. We find bans on psychiatric patients' access to this service amount to arbitrary discrimination. Proponents of banning the practice ignore or overlook alternatives to their proposal, like an assisted dying regime with additional safeguards. Some authors have further criticized assisted dying for psychiatric patients by highlighting allegedly problematic practices in those countries which allow it. We address recent evidence from the Netherlands, showing that these problems are either misrepresented or have straightforward solutions. Even if one finds such evidence troubling despite our analysis, other jurisdictions need not adopt every feature of the Dutch system.

AB Background: In the Netherlands, people with a wish to die can request physician assistance in dying. However, almost two thirds of the explicit requests do not result in physician assistance in dying. Some people with a wish to end life seek counselling outside the medical context to end their own life. The aim of this cross-sectional research was to obtain information about clients receiving counselling for non-physician assisted suicide, and the characteristics and outcome of the counselling itself.
   Methods: All counsellors working with foundation De Einder (an organisation that offers professional counselling for people with a wish to end life) (N=12) filled in registration forms about all clients they counselled in 2011 and/or 2012. Only client registration data forms with at least one face-to-face contact with the counsellor were selected for analysis (n=595).
   Results: More than half of the clients were over 65 years old. More than one third of the clients had no wish to end life and 16% had an urgent wish to end life. Almost two thirds of the clients had not requested physician assistance in dying. Half of the clients had others involved in the counselling. More than half of the clients received explicit practical information concerning non-physician assisted suicide, while 13% of all clients actually ended their own life through non-physician assisted suicide. Clients without a (severe) disease were older than clients with a severe disease. They also had more problems of old age and existential suffering and more often wanted to be prepared for self-determination. The clients without a (severe) disease more often had no wish to end life and requested physician assistance in dying less often than clients with a severe disease.
   Conclusion: While some of the clients receiving counselling for non-physician assisted suicide seem to be looking for a peaceful death to escape from current suffering, others have no wish to end life and seem to be looking for reassurance in anticipation of prospective suffering. If non-physician assisted suicide is be distinguished from 'mutilating' suicide, this asks for a different approach than suicide crisis intervention, for example suicide-attempt prevention.

AB Background: There is a lack of information on the cost-effectiveness of suicide prevention interventions. The current study examines the cost-effectiveness of a multifaceted structured intervention aiming to improve adherence to the national suicide practice guideline in comparison with usual implementation.
   Methods: In the intervention condition, professionals of psychiatric departments were trained using an e-learning supported Train-the-Trainer program. Newly admitted suicidal patients were assessed as soon as their department was trained and at 3 months follow-up. The primary outcome was improvement in suicide ideation. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation. Cost-effectiveness planes were plotted, and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were estimated.
   Results: For the total group of suicidal patients (n=566), no effect of the intervention on suicide ideation or costs was found. For a subgroup of depressed suicidal patients (n=154, intervention=75, control-79), mean level of suicide ideation decreased with 2.7 extra points in the intervention condition, but this was not statistically significant. For this subgroup, the intervention may be considered cost-effective in comparison with usual implementation if society is willing to pay 6100 per unit of effect on the suicide ideation scale extra.
   Limitations: Considering the cost outcomes, we had almost no cases that were complete, and heavily relied on statistical techniques to impute the missing data Also, diagnoses were not derived from structured clinical interviews.
   Conclusions: We presented the first randomized trial (trial registration: The Netherlands Trial Register (NTR3092 www.trialregister.nl)) on cost-effectiveness of a suicide practice guideline implementation in mental health care. The intervention might be considered cost-effective for depressed suicidal patients if society is willing to make substantial investments. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Physician-assisted suicide (PAS) laws have been enacted in five US States and, along with physician-administered euthanasia, in Canada and the Netherlands.
   Sources of data: Annual reports of the Oregon Health Authority and published research papers.
   Areas of agreement: Not all recipients of lethal drugs use them to end their lives. Improvements in palliative care provision.
   Areas of controversy: Rising numbers of deaths from PAS. Emergence of 'doctor shopping' and multiple-prescribing. Absence of qualitative scrutiny of assessment process. No re-assessment or oversight when prescribed drugs are ingested. Recent pressures to extend Oregon's PAS law.
   Growing points: Reasons given for seeking PAS indicate this is a societal rather than a clinical issue and raise the question whether adjudicating on requests for legalized PAS is an appropriate role for doctors.
   Areas for timely research: Research into quality of decision-making in requests for PAS and into potential role of doctors as expert witnesses rather than judges in requests for PAS.

AB Belgium legalised voluntary euthanasia in 2002, thus ending the long isolation of the Netherlands as the only country in which doctors could openly give lethal injections to patients who have requested help in dying. Meanwhile in Oregon, in the United States, doctors may prescribe drugs for terminally ill patients, who can use them to end their life - if they are able to swallow and digest them. But despite President Bush's oft-repeated statements that his philosophy is to 'trust individuals to make the right decisions' and his opposition to 'distant bureaucracies' his administration is doing its best to prevent Oregonians acting in accordance with a law that its voters have twice ratified. The situation regarding voluntary euthanasia around the world is therefore very much influx..
   This essay reviews ethical arguments regarding voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide from, a utilitarian perspective. I shall begin by asking why it is normally wrong to kill an innocent person, and whether these reasons apply to aiding a person who, when rational and competent, asks to be killed or given the means to commit suicide. Then I shall consider more specific utilitarian arguments for and against permitting voluntary euthanasia.

AB Physician-assisted suicide (PAS), which is currently the subject of intense and controversial discussion in medical ethics, is barely discussed in psychiatry, albeit there are already dementia patients in Germany and other European countries who end their own lives with the assistance of physicians.
   Based on the finding that patients who ask for medical assistance in suicide often have in mind the loss of their mental capacity, we submit PAS to an ethical analysis and put it into a broader context of patient autonomy at the end of life.
   In doing so, we point to advance care planning, through which the patient autonomy of the person concerned can be supported as well as respected in later stages of the disease.
   If patients adhere to their autonomous wish for PAS, physicians find themselves in an ethical dilemma. A further tabooing of the topic, however, does not provide a solution; rather, an open societal and professional ethical discussion and regulation are essential.

AB A substantial majority of Canadians favours a change to the Criminal Code which would make it legally permissible, subject to careful regulation, for patients suffering from incurable physical illness to opt for either physician assisted suicide (PAS) or voluntary active euthanasia (VAE). This discussion will focus primarily on the arguments for and against decriminalizing physician assisted suicide, with special reference to the British Columbia case of Lee Carter vs. Attorney General of Canada. The aim is to critique the arguments and at the same time to describe the contours of the current Canadian debate. Both ethical and legal issues raised by PAS are clarified. Empirical evidence available from jurisdictions which have followed the regulatory route is presented and its relevance to the slippery slope argument is considered. The arguments presented by both sides are critically assessed. The conclusion suggested is that evidence of harms to vulnerable individuals or to society, consequent upon legalization, is insufficient to support continued denial of freedom to those competent adults who seek physician assistance in hastening their death.

AB The majority of Dutch physicians feel pressure when dealing with a request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (EAS). This study aimed to explore the content of this pressure as experienced by general practitioners (GP). We conducted semistructured in-depth interviews with 15 Dutch GPs, focusing on actual cases. The interviews were transcribed and analysed with use of the framework method. Six categories of pressure GPs experienced in dealing with EAS requests were revealed: (1) emotional blackmail, (2) control and direction by others, (3) doubts about fulfilling the criteria, (4) counterpressure by patient's relatives, (5) time pressure around referred patients and (6) organisational pressure. We conclude that the pressure can be attributable to the patient-physician relationship and/or the relationship between the physician and the patient's relative(s), the inherent complexity of the decision itself and the circumstances under which the decision has to be made. To prevent physicians to cross their personal boundaries in dealing with EAS request all these different sources of pressure will have to be taken into account.

AB Euthanasia in the Netherlands, which has been legal since 1984, is often talked about; yet, only rarely does it culminate in a euthanasia death. In 2001, for example, only 1 in 10 of those who initiated a request for euthanasia with their physician died a euthanasia death. Using data gathered during a 15-month ethnographic study with general practitioners, families, and patients, this article explores the practice of euthanasia, a practice based mainly in talk. Applying a Foucauldian concept of discourse, I will examine euthanasia as a script for how people think, feel, and act at the end of Dutch life, attempting to answer the question: What are Dutch people talking about when they talk about euthanasia? This article is intended to provide ethnographic data not currently available on the modern-day practice of euthanasia and to add to a growing body of literature on death, dying, and the role of the state.

AB "There's nothing more to do, so let's come to an end, Doc!" A request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide is a dramatic expression of patients' suffering and causes difficulties for staff members to react to these questions. Great efforts have been made in the last two centuries to gain a deeper understanding of the wish for hastened death of terminally ill patients and to develop conclusions for the management of these situations. This article presents differences in international legislation on euthanasia and summarises the ethical background. The current results from the literature according to motivations for the wish for hastened death, communicative functions of the request, attitudes and practices of physicians and their willingness to accompany the patient in euthanasia as well as practical implications for clinical practice are discussed.

DE conscientious objection; fiduciary; legal rights; physician assisted
   suicide
AB "What Does a Right to Physician-Assisted Suicide (PAS) Legally entail?" Much of the bioethics literature focuses on the morality of PAS but ignores the legal implications of the conclusions thereby wrought. Specifically, what does a legal right to PAS entail both on the part of the physician and the patient? I argue that we must begin by distinguishing a right to PAS qua "external" to a particular physician-patient relationship from a right to PAS qua "internal" to a particular physician-patient relationship. The former constitutes a negative claim right in rem that prohibits outside interference with the exercise of a right to PAS while the latter can provide the patient with a positive claim right in personam to obligatory assistance from his physician. Importantly, I argue that the creation of such a patient right, however, originates with the physician who may exercise an unqualified right of first refusal prior to promising to help her patient commit suicide. In doing so, I hope to establish that explicit physician promises of assistance in dying should become legally binding. As such, current PAS law in both the Netherlands and Oregon is in need of substantive modification.

ID EUTHANASIA; REQUESTS; PAIN; MANAGEMENT; NETHERLANDS; DESIRE; LIFE; END
AB Background. Assisted suicide is permitted in Switzerland provided that assistance is not motivated by selfish reasons. Suicides arc commonly performed with the assistance of right-to-die organisations and the use of a lethal dose of barbiturates prescribed by a participating physician. We examined the reasons physicians provided for writing the prescription and the reasons patients gave for requesting assistance in dying.
   Methods: We analysed all reported cases of assisted suicide that were facilitated by right-to-die organisations between 2001 and 2004 in the city of Zurich, and for which both the medical report and the optional letter written by the decedent providing information on their reasons for seeking assistance in suicide (N = 165).
   Results: The reasons most often reported by physicians (ph), as well as persons who sought help (p), were: pain (ph: 56% of all assisted suicides, p: 58%), need for long-term care (ph: 37%, p: 39%),neurological symptoms (ph: 35%, p: 32%), immobility (ph: 23%, p: 30%) and dyspnoea (ph: 23%, p: 23%). Control of circumstances over death (ph: 12%, p: 39%); loss of dignity (ph: 6%, p: 38%); weakness (ph: 13%, p: 26%); less able to engage in activities that make life enjoyable (ph: 6%, p: 18%); and insomnia and loss of concentration (ph: 4%, p: 13%) were significantly more often mentioned by decedents than by physicians.
   Conclusions: Both prescribing physicians and patients provided with assistance to die quite often mentioned pain and other concerns, many of which were objectively assessable and related to unbearable suffering or unreasonable disability. Concerns referable to autonomy and individual judgement were more often noted by people seeking help than by the prescribing physicians.

AB The birth of the Dutch law Euthanasia has been recently legalized in the Netherlands (since April 1, 2002). In this article, we present the various cultural and historical factors that contributed to the law, the guidelines for the procedure and the resulting controversy.
   The intervening factors Internationally, the attitude concerning end of life care are heterogenic and also directly depend on religious and cultural factors. in the Netherlands, the health system promotes the maintenance at home of the terminally ill. However, the financial aspects (private health insurance) interact with the management of these patients. The rules for euthanasia are very strict and a declaration must be registered. Dedicated commissions are organised to control that the rules are applied.
   The current debate concerns the pertinence of the regulations, the attitude towards handicapped people and children, and the need to develop palliative care. The latter have only recently been developed in the country. The priority is focusing on old peoples' homes. The Netherlands is slow in this regard, but a new draft law is soon to be presented to the authorities, and will most probably enable the gaps to be bridged. (C) 2004, Masson, Paris.

AB Background: Studies report high rates of suicide attempts for female immigrants. This study assesses variations in the distribution of suicide attempts across gender in immigrant and non-immigrant groups in Europe. Method: Data on 64 native and immigrant groups, including 17 662 local and 3755 immigrant person-cases collected, between 1989 and 2003, in 24 million person-years were derived from the WHO/EURO Multicentre Study on Suicidal Behaviour. Female-to-male ratios of suicide attempt rates (SARs) were calculated for all groups. Results: The cases were combined into four major categories: hosts; European and other Western immigrants; non-European immigrants; and Russian immigrants. The non-European immigrants included higher female SARs than the Europeans, both hosts and immigrants. Unlike the other groups, the majority of suicide attempters among the Russian immigrants in Estonia and Estonian hosts were male. This was also true for immigrants from Curacao, Iran, Libya and Sri Lanka. When the single groups with a male majority were excluded, the correlation between female and male SARs was relatively high among the European immigrants (r = 0.74, P < 0.0005) and lower among the non-European immigrants (r = 0.55, P < 0.03). Generalized estimating equation analysis yielded a highly significant difference (P < 0.0005) in gender ratios of suicide attempts between hosts (ratio 1.52) and both non-European immigrants (ratio 2.32) and Russian immigrants (0.68), but not the European immigrants. Conclusions: The higher suicide attempt rates in non-European immigrant females compared with males may be indicative of difficulties in the acculturation processes in Europe. Further understanding of factors underlying suicidal behaviour in immigrant and minority groups is necessary for planning effective prevention strategies.

AB End-of-life decision making is fraught with ethical challenges. Withholding or withdrawing life support therapy is widely considered ethical in patients with high treatment burden, poor premorbid status, or significant projected disability even when such treatment is not "futile." Whether such withdrawal of therapy in the aftermath of attempted suicide is ethical is not well established in the literature. We provide a clinical vignette and propose criteria under which such withdrawal would be ethical. We suggest that it is appropriate to withdraw life support, regardless of the cause of the critical illness or disability, when the following criteria are met: (1) Surrogates request withdrawal of care and the adequacy of surrogates is confirmed, (2) an external reasonability standard is met, (3) passage of time, perhaps 72 hours, to allow certainty regarding the patient's wishes, and (4) psychiatric morbidity should be considered as grounds for withdrawal only in truly treatment-refractory cases. Fundamentally, we believe the question to ask is, "If this were not an attempted suicide, would a request to withdraw care be reasonable?" We believe that under these circumstances, such withdrawal of life support, even in an individual who has attempted suicide, does not constitute physician assistance with suicide and is distinct from physician aid-in-dying in several important respects.

AB Study design: Explorative retrospective files study.
   Objectives: To document end-of-life decisions (ELDs) in in-hospital deaths after new traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI).
   Setting: The Netherlands.
   Methods: Discharge letters concerning patients with TSCI discharged from Dutch acute hospitals in 2010 were analysed. Data were extracted on survival, personal and lesion characteristics, comorbidities, other injuries, preexisting spinal stenosis, stabilising surgery, length of hospital stay and the presence and types of ELDs. Characteristics of deceased patients and survivors were compared using chi(2) and T-tests. Characteristics of the deceased patients and ELDs were further explored.
   Results: A total of 185 patients with new TSCI were identified. Twenty-six patients were excluded as their survival status at discharge was unknown-for example, because of discharge to another hospital without information about their final discharge. Thirty of the remaining 159 patients died during their initial hospital stay (18.9%). Deceased patients were older and had more often high cervical and motor complete injuries than survivors. The circumstances of death were sparsely documented, and in nine cases, it was not possible to determine the absence or the presence of an ELD. ELDs were reported in 19 deaths (63.3%). All were non-treatment decisions, and almost all (89.5%) were decisions of withdrawal of treatment. There were no cases of documented euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide.
   Conclusion: ELDs were reported in the majority of in-hospital deaths after new TSCI in the Netherlands (63.3%), and all were non-treatment decisions.

TI Developments in the practice of physician-assisted dying: perceptions of
   physicians who had experience with complex cases
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Euthanasia; Suicide; Assisted Suicide; End of Life Care
AB Background Since the enactment of the euthanasia law in the Netherlands, there has been a lively public debate on assisted dying that may influence the way patients talk about euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (EAS) with their physicians and the way physicians experience the practice of EAS.
   Aim To show what developments physicians see in practice and how they perceive the influence of the public debate on the practice of EAS.
   Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of in-depth interviews with 28 Dutch physicians who had experience with a complex case of EAS. Respondents were recruited both by the network of physicians working for SCEN (Support and Consultation for Euthanasia in the Netherlands) as well as via a national questionnaire, wherein participating physicians could indicate their willingness to be interviewed.
   Results Three themes came up in analysing the interviews. First, the interviewed physicians experienced a change in what (family of) patients would expect from them: from a role as an involved caregiver to being the mere performer of EAS. Second, interviewees said that requests for EAS based on non-medical reasons came up more frequently and wondered if EAS was the right solution for these requests. Last, respondents had the impression that the standards of EAS are shifting and that the boundaries of the EAS regulation were stretched.
   Conclusions The perceived developments could make physicians less willing to consider a request for EAS. Our results also raise questions about the role of physicians and of EAS in society.

AB Ethnic minority status and female gender convey a risk for suicidal behavior, yet research of suicidality of ethnic minority female immigrants is scarce. The authors of this article conducted qualitative interviews with 15 young women (of four ethnicities) in the Netherlands, who either had attempted suicide or contemplated suicide, and analyzed these in a narrative psychology tradition. Suicidality was associated with despair and frustration over the violation of the women's personal autonomy and self-integrity regarding strategic life choices. Autonomy restrictions and violations followed two patterns, which are interconnected with four criteria regarding the capacity for autonomy. Findings are discussed with referral to Durkheim and feminist theories of autonomy.

AB Objective. Although Western Europe is becoming increasingly multicultural, ethnic minorities are scarcely included in studies of suicidology. We investigated the prevalence of non-fatal suicidal behavior and examined risk factors in non-western female immigrant adolescents compared to majority female adolescents in the city of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Design. We conducted logistic regression on a dataset that consisted of self-reported health and well-being questionnaires filled out by 4527 adolescents of Dutch, South Asian-Surinamese, Moroccan, and Turkish origin. We examined whether young females of specific ethnic groups had elevated risk for attempted suicide. Well-known risk factors in suicidology of social economic class, level of education, life events, abuse, and family context were investigated to verify whether these factors are beneficial to explaining ethnic differences in suicidal behavior. Results. We found that rates of attempted suicide among Turkish and South Asian-Surinamese young women were higher than of Dutch females, while Moroccan females had lower rates than Dutch female adolescents. Physical and sexual abuse, and an impaired family environment, as well as parental psychopathology or parental substance abuse contributed to non-fatal suicidal behavior of females across ethnicities. However, these risk factors, as well as low social economic class and of level of education, did not fully explain the vulnerability of Turkish and South Asian-Surinamese females. Conclusion. Our findings underscored the need for developing suicide prevention for specific minority females in multicultural cities in Western Europe. Screening programs, which aim at preventing suicide attempts by young immigrant women should include risk factors in the family environment and relationship with the parents as well as physical and sexual abuse. However, the study also showed that the disproportionate risk of Turkish and South Asian-Surinamese females could not be understood by risk factors alone and transpired that the origins of ethnic disparities in suicidal behavior deserve further examination.

AB Objective To identify factors predicting the long term course of complicated grief, depression, and suicide ideation in a community based sample of relatives bereaved through suicide.
   Design Longitudinal cohort study. Included in the multilevel regression models were sociodemographic and personality features, mental health history, records of received help, long term complicated grief, depression, and suicide ideation.
   Setting Community based sample located in the northern part of the Netherlands.
   Participants 153 first degree relatives and spouses of 74 people who had committed suicide.
   Main outcome measures Complicated grief, depression, and suicide ideation assessed at 2.5 months, 13 months and 96-120 months (8-10 years) by means of self report questionnaires.
   Results Complicated grief, depression, and suicide ideation were mutually associated in relatives and spouses of people who had committed suicide. A history of attempted suicide was associated with long term suicide ideation (odds ratio 5.5, 95% confidence interval 1.8 to 16.7; P=0.003). Depression was more likely to be predicted by female sex and low mastery, whereas complicated grief was more likely to be predicted by the trauma of losing a child. The risk of both complicated grief and depression decreased over time; for complicated grief the change corresponded with a Cohen's d effect size of 0.36 at 13 months and 0.89 at 96-120 months; for depression these figures were 0.28 at 13 months and 0.94 at 96-120 months. The long term course of bereavement was not affected by family based cognitive behavioural therapy, support from a general practitioner, and/or mental healthcare. Mutual support was associated with an increased risk of complicated grief: B regression coefficient=6.4 (95% confidence interval 1.8 to 11.0; P=0.006). Throughout this long term study, selection bias might have affected some outcomes.
   Conclusion In relatives bereaved by suicide, suicide ideation is associated with an increased risk of long term complicated grief and depression. The risk of complicated grief and depression decreases over time. Although mutual support is associated with an increased risk of complicated grief, we could not draw conclusions about a causal relation.

TI Euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide? A survey from the Netherlands
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
DE Euthanasia; suicide; assisted; physicians; attitude; decision making
AB Background: Legalizing euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (PAS) is a current topic of debate in many countries. The Netherlands is the only country where legislation covers both.
   Objectives: To study physicians' experiences and attitudes concerning the choice between euthanasia and PAS.
   Methods: A questionnaire including vignettes was sent to a random sample of 1955 Dutch general practitioners, elderly care physicians and medical specialists.
   Results: In total, 793 physicians (41%) participated. There was no clear preference for euthanasia (36%) or PAS (34%). Two thirds of physicians thought that PAS underlines the autonomy and responsibility of the patient and considered this a reason to choose PAS. Reasons for not choosing PAS were expected practical problems. A minority (22%) discussed the possibility of PAS with their patient in case of a request for assistance in dying. Patients receiving PAS more often experienced psychosocial suffering in comparison with patients receiving euthanasia. In vignettes of patients with a request for assistance in dying due to psychosocial suffering, physicians agreed more often with the performance of PAS than with euthanasia.
   Conclusion: Dutch physicians perceive a difference between euthanasia and PAS. Although they believe PAS underlines patient autonomy and responsibility, the option of PAS is rarely discussed with the patient. The more psychosocial in nature the patient's suffering, the more physicians choose PAS. In these cases, PAS seems to fulfil physicians 'preferences to emphasize patient autonomy and responsibility. Expected technical problems and unfamiliarity with PAS also play a role. Paradoxically, the choice for PAS is predominantly a physician's one.

DT Article
ID ASSISTED SUICIDE; EUTHANASIA; REQUESTS; DOCTORS; DEATH
AB Background: This study compares attitudes and practices concerning the end-of-life decisions between physicians in the United States and in the Netherlands, using the same set of questions.
   Methods: A total of 152 physicians from Oregon and 67 from the Netherlands were interviewed using the same questions about (1) their attitudes toward increasing morphine with premature death as a likely consequence, physician-assisted suicide (PAS), and euthanasia; and (2) their involvement in cases of euthanasia, PAS, or the ending of life without an explicit request from the patient. Odds ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, were calculated to investigate relation between attitudes and various characteristics of the respondents.
   Results: American physicians found euthanasia less often acceptable than the Dutch, but there was similarity in attitudes concerning increasing morphine and PAS. American physicians found increasing morphine and PAS more often acceptable in cases where patients were concerned about becoming a burden to their family. There was a discrepancy between the attitudes and practices of Dutch physicians concerning PAS. The proportions of physicians having practiced euthanasia, PAS, or ending of life without an explicit request from the patient differ more between the countries than do their attitudes, with American physicians having been involved in these practices less often than the Dutch.
   Conclusions: In this study of American and Dutch physicians, 2 important differences emerge: different attitudes toward the patient who is concerned over being a burden, and different frequency of euthanasia and PAS in the two countries.

TI Suicide Behavior Before and After the Start with Antidepressants: A High
   Persistent Risk in the First Month of Treatment Among the Young

AB Background: A causal relationship between antidepressants (ADs) and a high risk of suicidal behavior at a young age has been suggested. We analyzed the rates of suicide attempts during treatment with AD in comparison with the rates before treatment initiation for different ages.
   Methods: Claims of insurance company Achmea were linked to the population registry of Statistics Netherlands. Episodes of AD use were defined for those with their first registered prescription in 2006-2011 (n = 66,196). Rates were analyzed in a Poisson model. Correlates of attempts in the first month of AD use were assessed in a logistic model.
   Results: Among those aged <25 years, a high rate of suicide attempts during the month before the start of ADs was found (376.3/10 000 person yrs). A non-significant increase in the first month (p = 0.212) was found and a non-significant trend to lower values was determined thereafter (p = 0.3050). Among those >= 25 years, a clear decrease to lower rates immediately after the start was observed (p < 0.025). The highest rates of suicide were found among those >40 years during the first month. Female gender was, but treatment characteristics were not, associated with early attempts at a young age.
   Conclusions: Among young AD users, a high pre-treatment risk of suicide attempts was present and persisted during the early phases after the start. This contrasted with the clear decrease in risk among those aged >= 25 years, suggesting lower effectiveness of ADs to prevent suicidal behavior at young ages. Caution should be exercised to infer a causal relationship or to use data on attempts to predict risk of suicide during AD use.

AB Purpose of reviewPhysician-assisted suicide (PAS) and euthanasia have been increasingly discussed in end-of-life care, as PAS and euthanasia have now been legalized in three European countries and PAS has been legalized in Washington, Oregon, and Montana in the USA. This review focuses on some aspects of PAS and euthanasia and discusses deep terminal sedation (DTS), which is increasingly used to treat intractable symptoms at the end of life.Recent findingsPAS and euthanasia present potential risks for vulnerable populations, such as the depressed and disabled. The Oregon experience does not allow specific analysis regarding disabled patients, but fewer psychiatric consultations are being done to evaluate patients for depression. In the Netherlands, a small number of patients undergo euthanasia without an explicit request. Twenty percent of cases go unreported, raising questions of whether they met legal standards. The use of DTS in all countries has increased, but in a significant number of cases, DTS is used with an explicit intent to hasten death. Double-effect arguments to justify DTS may not actually apply.SummaryCaution is warranted regarding PAS and euthanasia, as vulnerable patients may still be at risk. More research is needed to characterize the use (and misuse) of DTS.

AB Background: Research, aimed at improving the continuity of care after hospital discharge following attempted suicide focuses on the effectiveness of the interventions. Little attention has been paid to patients who immediately decline guidance to advised post-discharge care. We aimed to identify differences between accepters and decliners of guidance to care (GtC) in relation to the characteristics of patients who presented at the emergency department (ED) of an urban hospital in the Netherlands after attempted suicide.
   Method: This cross-sectional study included all patients who presented at the ED of OLVG-West Amsterdam with a suicide attempt or intentional self-harm and were referred for psychiatric evaluation. Data were collected over a period of twenty months using a semi-structured questionnaire. Subgroups were described in relation the acceptance of GtC using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.
   Results: In total, 257 patients were included. GtC was accepted by 77%. Suicide attempters who reported loneliness as reason for the attempt showed a positive relation to acceptance. No indication was found that patients at higher risk for suicide are more reluctant to accept GtC. Suicide attempters with a non-Western ethnicity, especially patients with a Turkish/Moroccan ethnicity, declined contact by the GtC nurse significantly more often. In addition, patients who currently did not receive care were significantly more often of non-Western ethnicity and younger than 25.
   Conclusion: Acceptance of GtC is high among patients who presented at the ED after attempted suicide. The patients who were the most reluctant to accept GtC were young suicide attempters of non-Western ethnicity who were not in current care. As this study is the first to address the acceptance of GtC, we point out two lines of inquiry for further research. First, reasons to accept or decline need to be investigated further since only interventions that are accepted by patients have a chance to improve clinically relevant outcome. Second, follow-up research is warranted comparing the adherence to advised post-discharge care and attempted or completed suicide among accepters versus decliners of GtC in various ethnic and sociodemographic subgroups.

DT Article
ID TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS; DEATH PRACTICES; EUTHANASIA; DESIRE;
   DEPRESSION; CONSULTATION; VIEWS
AB Background: Physician-assisted suicide (PAS) is an important subject of the public debate. So far, legal regulations exist in the Netherlands, Belgium and in Oregon (USA). This review reports results of nine empirical studies from Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the U.S. which examine attitudes of psychiatrists toward PAS. Results: The approval of PAS by psychiatrists varies between the four countries (40-69%). Comparisons with the attitudes of other physicians show a greater agreement among the psychiatrists. A psychiatric examination in order to evaluate competence even in patients with severe somatic illness was advocated by the majority of psychiatrists. Conclusion: Psychiatrists' attitudes toward PAS vary and are compared with other medical specialities, as well as in different legal and cultural contexts. Therefore, and because of missing empirical studies, results can not be transferred into the context of German speaking countries easily. So far, no acknowledged criteria for the assessment of competence exist. Further empirical research is needed on German psychiatrists' attitudes towards PAS and on competence assessment at the end of life. It remains an open question how legal changes and future developments of palliative care will influence attitudes toward PAS.

AB ObjectivesTo report worldwide trends in suicidemortality during a period that covers 7years after the 2008 global crisis.MethodsWe performed a time trend analysis with joinpoint regression.ResultsOver the 2000s, suicide mortality decreased with the largest declines observed in some Eastern European countries. The downward trends were followed by an increase in concomitance with the 2008 global crisis in some countries, including Greece (annual percentage change=+6 in men and +11.8 in women), the Netherlands (+4.2 in men and +4.0 in women), and the UK (+1.6 in men), while the pre-crisis downward trends stopped in Germany, Italy, and Spain. The joinpoint analysis also revealed long-term rises in Brazil (+0.8 since 1990 in men and +1.8 since 1999 in women), Mexico (+1.3 since 1995 in men and +3.6 since 1990 in women), the USA (+1.7 since 2005 in men and +4.2 since 2010 in women), and Australia (+1.8 in men and +3.7 in women, since 2006 in both sexes).ConclusionsDespite downward trendsin several areas of the world, in some countries suicide rates increased since the 2008 global crisis.

AB Objective: In the project 'Support and Consultation on Euthanasia in The Netherlands' (SCEN), general practitioners (GPs) receive training in formal consultation and in giving expert advice to colleagues who have questions about euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (EAS). This study describes the way in which this project was implemented in The Netherlands and how it was received by GPs.
   Method: In the period from April 2000 to December 2002, all GPs in the districts in which SCEN had been implemented received a written post-test questionnaire a year and a half after the start of the project. Registration forms were also filled in by the SCEN physicians and the GPs who contacted SCEN. The post-test questionnaire was returned by 60% of the GPs (n = 3614), and registration forms were returned by 86% (n = 3337) of the GPs who contacted SCEN.
   Results: The gradual nation-wide implementation of SCEN was completed within the 4-year study period. Almost all GPs were familiar with the project (99%) and most GPs knew what they could contact SCEN for. Most GPs felt supported by the presence of SCEN, and most GPs also had a positive attitude towards consultation and SCEN. GPs who had received an explicit request for EAS, or had performed EAS, often consulted SCEN physicians (71 and 85%, rispectively). Reasons for contacting SCEN were: independence (60%), expertise (58%), and accessibility/availability of a consultant (45%). Reasons for not contacting SCEN were: enough other possibilities for counselling and consultation (48%) only at the beginning of the decision-making process (36%), and sufficient knowledge about EAS (22%). Most GPs intended to use SCEN in the future (96%).
   Conclusion The implementation of SCEN has been successful, according to the four steps for successful implementation: awareness. attitude. use and future use. In this respect, linking up with existing networks and gocd organisation may play an important role. Furthermore, GPs consider it important to have a facility like SCEN which they can contact concerning EAS. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Train-person collisions have a significant impact in our society, due to their negative economic and psychological effects. This work aims to study fatalities resulting from train-person collisions in Portugal.
   Methods: A retrospective study was conducted based on the analysis of autopsy reports related to train-person fatalities performed in the North Branch of the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences.
   Results: Suicide was responsible for most of the cases, and males were more often involved in train-person collisions than females. Victims, between 40 and 59years old, were found to be involved in a high percentage (39%) of the cases, and people older than 65 accounted for a significant percentage (40%) of the accidents. No seasonality was observed in suicide cases, but a decrease in accident numbers was registered in summer. Regarding weekday and time of day, afternoon and non-rush hour were the times when most suicides were observed, whereas accidents did not showed a specific weekday or time of day, except for rush hour, during which they were more frequent. Alcohol-positive blood analysis accounting for 25% of the cases.
   Conclusions: Differences from other European studies were found, which may be related to the different cultures of the countries/regions, as well as to the differences in the railway systems. More extensive studies must be performed in order to develop strategies to prevent train-person collisions.

AB Patterns of suicidal behavior vary among cultures and along gender. Young Hindustani immigrant women attempt suicide four times more often than young Dutch women. This article explores multi-disciplinary explanations for suicidal behavior in this group. The interconnection of Durkheimian concepts of social integration and regulation with ecological insights into family relations and psychological and psychiatric theories on individual distress are relevant. It is suggested that young Hindustani women who display suicidal behavior possess certain personality and cognitive constellations that are interlocked with specific parenting styles in stressful family environments. These families are embedded in a context of moral transformations resulting from migration to a Western culture and may be facing difficulties accompanying the transitional processes encountered in the West, particularly those regarding gender roles. Durkheimian fatalistic and anomic suicides elucidate this. The Hindustani women who appear most at risk are those facing contradictory norms and overregulation, which prevent them from developing autonomy.

AB Bill C-14 introduces a new era in end-of-life care by permitting death to be hastened through medical assistance in dying (MAiD). This article reviews those aspects of MAiD that are of particular relevance to psychologists, as seen through the perspective of the author's research. It includes a brief overview of the major legal cases that led the Supreme Court of Canada to overturn the laws against assisted suicide. It addresses such issues as the prevalence of the desire for death in the terminally ill, reasons for requesting MAiD, the concept of "intolerable suffering," and the association between MAiD, depression, and suicide. Findings from the Canadian National Palliative Care Survey are highlighted, which document the attitudes of patients receiving palliative care for cancer. Data from the Netherlands, Belgium, and Oregon are also reviewed briefly and contrasted; differences in the incidence of MAiD in these jurisdictions point to the importance of permitting MAiD to be provided by clinicians (euthanasia) rather than requiring patients to self-administer lethal medication (assisted suicide). It is concluded that Bill C-14 aligns with the opinions expressed by the majority of terminally ill participants in the National Palliative Care Survey. It remains to be seen whether new legal challenges will lead to the extension of MAiD to other patient groups.

AB "I will not relinquish old age, if it leaves my better part intact. But, if it begins to shake my mind, if it destroys its faculties one by one, if it leaves me not life but breath, I will depart from the putrid or tottering edifice. If I must suffer without hope or relief, I will depart, not through fear of the pain itself, but because it prevents all for which I would live." Seneca, the great Roman statesman of 1st century AD, spoke these words 2 millennia before the Netherlands became, on November 28, 2000, the first country in the world to legalize euthanasia.
   The decisions pertaining to end of life, whether legalized or otherwise, are practiced in many parts of the world but not reported on account of legal implications. Lack of awareness regarding the distinction between different procedures on account of legal status granted to them in some countries is the other area of concern. Debate among the medical practitioners, lawmakers, and the public taking into consideration the cultural, social, and religious ethos will lead to increased awareness, more safeguards, and improvement of medical decisions concerning the end of life.

DE attitudes; euthanasia; psychiatrists; physician assisted suicide
ID NETHERLANDS
AB Euthanasia and physician assisted-suicide are terms used to describe the process in which a doctor of a sick or disabled individual engages in an activity which directly or indirectly leads to their death. This behavior is engaged by the healthcare provider based on their humanistic desire to end suffering and pain. The psychiatrist's involvement may be requested in several distinct situations including evaluation of patient capacity when an appeal for euthanasia is requested on grounds of terminal somatic illness or when the patient is requesting euthanasia due to mental suffering. We compare attitudes of 49 psychiatrists towards euthanasia and assisted suicide with a group of 54 other physicians by means of a questionnaire describing different patients, who either requested physician-assisted suicide or in whom euthanasia as a treatment option was considered, followed by a set of questions relating to euthanasia implementation. When controlled for religious practice, psychiatrists expressed more conservative views regarding euthanasia than did physicians from other medical specialties. Similarly female physicians and orthodox physicians indicated more conservative views. Differences may be due to factors inherent in subspecialty education. We suggest that in light of the unique complexity and context of patient euthanasia requests, based on their training and professional expertise psychiatrists are well suited to take a prominent role in evaluating such requests to die and making a decision as to the relative importance of competing variables.

AB This article is a response to Raphael Cohen-Almagor's paper entitled 'First do no harm: intentionally shortening lives of patients without their explicit request in Belgium'. His paper deals with very important matters of life and death, however its concept usage is in part misleading. For instance, the fact that medical murder takes place both in Belgium and the Netherlands is missed. Cohen-Almagor calls such acts 'worrying' and considers them to be 'abuse'. However, it remains an open question whether or not there can be such a thing as legitimate murder in a medical context. From the combined perspectives of justice and the duty to end unbearable suffering, there might be. Thus, key arguments for euthanasia are also prominent in an argument for medical murder.

TI End-of-life decisions in medical practice in Flanders, Belgium: a

ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; MAIL SURVEYS; EUTHANASIA; NETHERLANDS
AB Background Our study is a repeat of the Dutch death-certificate study on end-of-life decisions (ELDs). The main objective was to estimate the frequency of euthanasia (the administration of lethal drugs with the explicit intention of shortening the patient's life at the patient's explicit request), physician-assisted suicide (PAS), and other ELDs in medical practice in Flanders, Belgium.
   Methods A 20% random sample of 3999 deaths was selected from all deaths recorded between Jan 1 and April 30, 1998. The physicians who signed the corresponding death certificates received one questionnaire by post per death.
   Findings The physicians' response rate was 1355 (52%). 1925 deaths were described. The results were corrected for non-response bias, and extrapolated to estimated annual rates after seasonal adjustment for death causes, and we estimate that 705 (1.3%, 95% CI 1.0-1.6) deaths resulted from euthanasia or PAS. In 1796 (3.2%, 2.7-3.8) cases, lethal drugs were given without the explicit request of the patient. Alleviation of pain and symptoms with opioids in doses with a potential life-shortening effect preceded death in 10 416 (18.5%, 17.3-19.7) cases and non-treatment decisions in 9218 (16.4%, 15.3-17.5) cases, of which 3261 (5.8%, 5.1-6.5) with the explicit intention of ending the patient's life.
   Interpretation ELDs are prominent in medical practice in Flanders. The frequency of deaths preceded by an ELD is similar to that in the Netherlands, but lower than that in Australia. However, in Flanders the rate of administration of lethal drugs to patients without their explicit request is similar to Australia, and significantly higher than that in the Netherlands.

AB Aim. This paper is a report of the findings of a study into the role of district nurses in euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in homecare organizations, conducted as part of a study into the role of nurses in medical end-of-life decisions.
   Background. Issues concerning legislation and regulation with respect to the role of nurses in euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide gave the Minister for Health reason to commission a study into the role of nurses in medical end-of-life decisions in hospitals, nursing homes and homecare organizations. This is the first quantitative study from the perspective of nurses. Previous quantitative studies were conducted under physicians and information on the role of nurses was obtained indirectly.
   Method. A questionnaire was sent in 2003 to 500 district nurses employed in 55 homecare organizations. The absolute response rate was 86.0% and 81.6%( 408) could be used for analysis.
   Results. In 22.3% of 278 cases, the district nurse was the first with whom patients discussed their request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. In about half (49.8%) of 267 cases nurses were not involved in the general practitioner's decision-making process, and in only 13.3% of 264 cases, did they attend the administration of the lethal drugs. District nurses had provided some degree of aftercare to the surviving relatives in 80.3% of 264 cases.
   Conclusion. Collaboration between general practitioners and district nurses needs improvement, particularly in relation to decision-making. Our Dutch data could help nurses in other countries to define their ( future) role in euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide.

AB Background There is an established link between depression and interest in hastened death in patients who are seriously ill. Concern exists over the extent of depression in patients who actively request euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide (PAS) and those who have their requests granted. Objectives To estimate the prevalence of depression in refused and granted requests for euthanasia/PAS and discuss these findings.
   Methods A systematic review was performed in MEDLINE and PsycINFO in July 2010, identifying studies reporting rates of depression in requests for and cases of euthanasia/PAS. One author critically appraised the strength of the data using published criteria.
   Results 21 studies were included covering four countries. There was considerable heterogeneity in methods of assessing depression and selecting patients. In the highest quality studies, in the Netherlands and Oregon, 8-47% of patients requesting euthanasia/PAS had depressive symptoms and 2-17% of completed euthanasia/PAS cases had depressive symptoms. In the Netherlands, depression was significantly higher in refused than granted requests, and there was no significant difference in the rate of depression between euthanasia cases and similar patients who had not made a request for euthanasia.
   Conclusion It is unclear whether depression increases the probability of making a request for euthanasia/PAS, but in the Netherlands most requests in depressed patients are rejected, leaving a depression rate in cases that is similar to the surrounding population. Less evidence is available elsewhere, but some level of depression has been identified in patients undergoing euthanasia/PAS in all the countries studied. Whether the presence of depression is ever compatible with an ethical decision on euthanasia/PAS is discussed.

AB Background: Caring for terminally ill patients is a meaningful task, however the patient's suffering can be a considerable burden and cause of frustration.
   Objectives: The aim of this study is to describe the experiences of general practitioners (GPs) in The Netherlands in dealing with a request for euthanasia from a terminally ill patient.
   Methods: The data, collected through in-depth interviews, were analysed according to the constant comparative method.
   Results: Having to face a request for euthanasia when attempting to relieve a patient's suffering was described as a very demanding experience that GPs generally would like to avoid. Nearly half of the GPs (14/30) strive to avoid euthanasia or physician assisted suicide because it was against their own personal values or because it was emotional burdening to be confronted with this issue. They explained that by being directed on promoting a peaceful dying process, or the quality of end-of-life of a patient by caring and supporting the patient and the relatives it was mainly possible to shorten patient's suffering without ``intentionally hastening a patient's death on his request''. The other GPs (16/30) explained that as sometimes the suffering of a patient could not be lessened they were open to consider a patient's request for euthanasia or physician assisted suicide. They underlined the importance of a careful decision-making process, based on finding a balance between the necessity to shorten the patient's suffering through euthanasia and their personal values.
   Conclusion: Dealing with requests for euthanasia is very challenging for GPs, although they feel committed to alleviate a patient's suffering and to promote a peaceful death.

AB Background: Euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (EAS) of psychiatric patients is legal in some countries but remains controversial. Objective: This study examined a frequently raised concern about the practice: how physicians address the issue of decision making capacity of persons requesting psychiatric EAS. Methods: A review of psychiatric EAS case summaries published by the Dutch Regional Euthanasia Review Committees. Directed content analysis using a capacity-specific 4 abilities model (understanding of facts, applying those facts to self, weighing/reasoning, and evidencing choice) was used to code texts discussing capacity. A total of 66 cases from 2011-2014 were reviewed. Results: In 55% (36 of 66) of cases, the capacity-speck discussion consisted of only global judgments of patients' capacity, even in patients with psychotic disorders. Further, 32% (21 of 66) of cases included evidentiary statements regarding capacity specific abilities; only 5 cases (8%) mentioned all 4 abilities. Physicians frequently stated that psychosis or depression did or did not affect capacity but provided little explanation regarding their judgments. Physicians in 8 cases (12%) disagreed about capacity; even when no explanation was given for the disagreement, the review committees generally accepted the judgment of the physician performing EAS. In one case, the physicians noted that not all capacity-specific abilities were intact but deemed the patient capable. Conclusion: Case summaries of psychiatric EAS in the Netherlands do not show that a high threshold of capacity is required for granting EAS. Although this may reflect limitations in documentation, it likely represents a practice that reflects the normative position of the review committees.

AB The ethical underpinnings of palliative care and those of voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide ( VE/AS) are often viewed as opposites. In this article, we review the values held in common by the euthanasia legalization movement and palliative care providers. Outlining this common ground serves to define, with greater clarity, the issues on which differences do exist, and ways in which some open questions, which are as yet unresolved, could be approached. Open discussion between VE/AS legalization advocates and palliative care providers is important to address these open questions seriously, and to enrich the care of terminally ill patients by giving members of both groups access to each other's experience.

AB In The Netherlands, relatively more patients (20%) with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) die due to euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (EAS) compared with patients with cancer (5%) or heart failure (0.5%). We wanted to gain insight into the reasons for ALS patients requesting EAS and compare these with the reasons of cancer and heart failure patients. Knowing disease-specific reasons for requesting EAS may improve palliative care in these vulnerable patients. The data used in the present study were derived from the Support and Consultation in Euthanasia in The Netherlands (SCEN) evaluation study. This study provided consultation reports and questionnaires filled out by the attending physicians from 3,337 consultations conducted by SCEN physicians in situations where a patient requested EAS. For this study we selected data on all ALS patients (n = 51), all heart failure patients (n = 61), and a random sample of 73 cancer patients. The most frequently reported reasons for unbearable suffering were: fear of suffocation (45%) and dependency (29%) in ALS patients, pain (46%) and fatigue (28%) in cancer patients, and dyspnea (52%) and dependency (37%) in heart failure patients. Somatic complaints were reported more frequently as a reason for EAS by cancer patients [odds ratio (OR) 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09-0.46] and heart failure patients [OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.05-0.46] than by ALS patients. ALS patients should be helped in a timely fashion to cope with psychosocial symptoms, e.g., by informing them about the low risk of suffocation in the terminal phase and the possible means of preventing this.

AB Background: When suffering becomes unbearable for patients they might request for euthanasia.
   Objective: To study which patients request for euthanasia and which requests actually resulted in euthanasia in relation with diagnosis, care setting at the end of life, and patient demographics.
   Design: A cross-sectional study covering all Dutch health care settings.
   Participants: In 2005, of death certificates of deceased persons, a stratified sample was derived from the Netherlands central death registry. The attending physician received a written questionnaire (n = 6860; response 78%).
   Measurements: If deaths were reported to have been nonsudden, the attending physician filled in a 4-page questionnaire on end-of-life decision-making. Data regarding the deceased person's age, sex, marital status, and cause of death were derived from the death certificate.
   Results: Of patients whose death was nonsudden, 7% explicitly requested for euthanasia. In about two thirds, the request did not lead to euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide being performed, in 39% because the patient died before the request could be granted and in 38% because the physician thought the criteria for due care were not met. Factors positively associated with a patient requesting for euthanasia are (young) age, diagnosis (cancer, nervous system), place of death (home), and involvement of palliative teams and psychiatrist in care. Diagnosis and place of death are also associated with requests resulting in euthanasia.
   Conclusions: Only a minority of patients request euthanasia at the end of life and of these requests a majority is not granted. Careful decision-making is necessary in all requests for euthanasia.

AB There are over 250 suicides on the railway network in Great Britain each year. Descriptive statistics are compiled, producing national and international data. The industry knows how many and, to a limited extent, where these fatalities occur. There is little in-depth analysis of events. Therefore, there are gaps in knowledge of these fatalities and this can be a weakness when considering the best approaches to prevention. This paper reports on the analysis of data on 257 suicide events at or near to 51 stations on three rail routes in Great Britain over a 20-year period. The analysis uses data from the industry safety management information system database and produces simple descriptive statistics on a range of variables, including comparisons across the three rail routes. Additional data from staff and route-based documentation have been used to verify, supplement and interpret information in the database. Examples of patterns of immediate and precursor behaviours during incidents have been presented, illustrating the potential to explore both common and anomalous behaviours during events. The findings demonstrate the type of content that can be explored within the industry data and through use of other data that are available within the industry. Commentaries have been provided on the strengths and weaknesses of the data and how findings from the analysis can be used to improve future data collection and prevention of incidents.

AB Authorising euthanasia and assisted suicide with advance euthanasia directives (AEDs) is permitted, yet debated, in the Netherlands. We focus on a recent controversial case in which a Dutch woman with Alzheimer's disease was euthanised based on her AED. A Dutch euthanasia review committee found that the physician performing the euthanasia failed to follow due care requirements for euthanasia and assisted suicide. This case is notable because it is the first case to trigger a criminal investigation since the 2002 Dutch euthanasia law was enacted. Thus far, only brief descriptions of the case have been reported in English language journals and media. We provide a detailed description of the case, review the main challenges of preparing and applying AEDs for persons with dementia and briefly assess the adequacy of the current oversight system governing AEDs.

ID NETHERLANDS; EUTHANASIA; SWITZERLAND; GENDER
AB Background: In Switzerland, non-medical right-to-die organisations such as Exit Deutsche Schweiz and Dignitas offer suicide assistance to members suffering from incurable diseases.
   Objectives: First, to determine whether differences exist between the members who received assistance in suicide from Exit Deutsche Schweiz and Dignitas. Second, to investigate whether the practices of Exit Deutsche Schweiz have changed since the 1990s.
   Methods: This study analysed all cases of assisted suicide facilitated by Exit Deutsche Schweiz (E) and Dignitas (D) between 2001 and 2004 and investigated by the University of Zurich's Institute of Legal Medicine (E: n = 147; D: n = 274, total: 421). Furthermore, data from the Exit Deutsche Schweiz study which investigated all cases of assisted suicide during the period 1990-2000 (n = 149) were compared with the data of the present study.
   Results: More women than men were assisted in both organisations (D: 64%; E: 65%). Dignitas provided more assistance to non-residents (D: 91%; E: 3%; p = 0.000), younger persons (mean age in years (SD): D: 64.5 (14.1); E: 76.6 (13.3); p = 0.001), and people suffering from fatal diseases such as multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (D: 79%; E: 67%; p = 0.013). Lethal medications were more often taken orally in cases assisted by Dignitas (D: 91%; E: 76%; p = 0.000). The number of women and the proportion of older people suffering from non-fatal diseases among suicides assisted by Exit Deutsche Schweiz has increased since the 1990s (women: 52% to 65%, p = 0.031; mean age in years (SD): 69.3 (17.0) to 76.9 (13.3), p = 0.000), non-fatal diseases: 22% to 34%, p = 0.026).
   Conclusions: Weariness of life rather than a fatal or hopeless medical condition may be a more common reason for older members of Exit Deutsche Schweiz to commit suicide. The strong over-representation of women in both Exit Deutsche Schweiz and Dignitas suicides is an important phenomenon so far largely overlooked and in need of further study.

TI The case for physician assisted suicide: not (yet) proven
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE
AB The legalisation of physician assisted suicide ( PAS) in Oregon and physician assisted death ( PAD) in the Netherlands has revitalised the debate over whether and under what conditions individuals should be able to determine the time and manner of their deaths, and whether they should be able to enlist the help of physicians in doing so. Although the change in the law is both dramatic and recent, the basic arguments for and against have not really changed since the issue was debated by Glanville Williams and Yale Kamisar nearly 50 years ago. In this paper, the author argues in favour of Kamisar's consequentialist framework. Any change in law and social policy should not be based solely on individual cases, heart wrenching though these may be. Instead, we need to assess the need for PAS, and weigh this against the risks of mistake and abuse.

ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; EUTHANASIA; NETHERLANDS; DEATH; LIFE; END
AB Euthanasia has been legally sanctioned in the Netherlands by a series of court decisions going back to the 1970s. The author discusses the cultural and historical factors that may have contributed to this development. In the past decade, studies sactioned by the Dutch government reveal that guidelines established for the regulation of euthanasia-a voluntary, well-considered, persistent request, intolerable suffering that cannot be relieved, consultation with a colleague, and reporting of cases-are consistently violated. Of greatest concern is the number of patients who are put to death without their consent-there are more involuntary than voluntary cases. Euthanasia intended originally for the exceptional case has become an accepted way of dealing with the physical and mental distress of serious or terminal illness. In the process palliative care has become one of the casualties while hospice care lags behind that of other countries. Case examples are given.

AB Two right-to-die organisations offer assisted suicide in Switzerland. The specific legal situation allows assistance to Swiss and foreign citizens. Both organisations require a report of the person's health status before considering assistance. This qualitative study explored these reports filed to legal authorities after the deaths of individuals in the area of Zurich. Health status reports in the legal medical dossiers of the deceased were analysed using content analysis and Grounded Theory. From 421 cases of assisted suicide (2001-2004), 350 reports on health status were filed. Many cases contained diagnosis lists only. Other reports had more elaborate reports revealing that some physicians were aware about the patient's death wish and the intention to solicit assisted suicide. Physicians' attitudes ranged from neutral to rather depreciative. Few physicians openly referred the patient to the organisations and supported the patient's request by highlighting a history of suffering as well as reporting understanding and agreement with the patient's wish to hasten death. In the health status reports five categories could be identified. Some files revealed that physicians were aware of the death wish. The knowledge and recognition of the patient's death wish varied from no apparent awareness to strongly supportive. This variety might be due to difficulties to discuss the death wish with patients, but might also reflect the challenge to avoid legal prosecution in the country of origin. To require comparable health status reports as requirements for the right-to-die organisations might be difficult to pursue.

DT Review
DE Euthanasia; Assisted suicide; Legal liability; Europe
ID OF-LIFE PRACTICES; CHILDREN; TRENDS
AB INTRODUCTION: End-of-life legislation, because of its bioethical, medico-legal, and judicial implications, is heatedly disputed in Europe and throughout the world, engendering a variety of legal end-of-life care options in different countries. We thought it could be interesting to compare the Italian law with current European legislation regulating end-of-life matters.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic search of the Medline, Cochrane Central, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases was conducted using the search words: "euthanasia", "law", "Europe", and "assisted suicide". The search word "euthanasia" was entered singly or in combination with each of the other search terms.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: To date, only three countries in Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) have legalized euthanasia, and four countries (Switzerland, France, Austria, Germany) permit only assisted suicide. Acceptance by the general public of euthanasia and assisted suicide increased in 11 of 13 European countries between 1981 and 2008, in parallel with a decrease in religiosity (except for Italy and Holland) and an increase in secularization. There was also a trend toward a correlation between an increase of the value of self-determination in important life issues and an increase in acceptance of euthanasia.
   CONCLUSIONS: This review shows that end-of-life decisions constitute a challenge for political governance and bioethical deliberation in modern liberal democracies. It appears that in certain situations, euthanasia is perceived more as a means to reduce health care costs rather than an ethical question regarding self-determination.

AB Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may be associated with the wish to hasten death (WTHD). We aimed to determine the prevalence and stability of WTHD and end-of-life attitudes in ALS patients, identify predictive factors, and explore communication about WTHD. We conducted a prospective questionnaire study among patients and their primary caregivers attending ALS clinics in Germany and Switzerland. We enrolled 66 patients and 62 caregivers. Half of the patients could imagine asking for assisted suicide or euthanasia; 14% expressed a current WTHD at the baseline survey. While 75% were in favour of non-invasive ventilation, only 55% and 27% were in favour of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and invasive ventilation, respectively. These attitudes were stable over 13 months. The WTHD was predicted by depression, anxiety, loneliness, perceiving to be a burden to others, and a low quality of life (all p < 0.05). Lower religiosity predicted whether patients could imagine assisted suicide or euthanasia. Two-thirds of patients had communicated their WTHD to relatives; no-one talked to the physician about it, yet half of them would like to do so. In conclusion, physicians should consider proactively asking for WTHD, and be sensitive towards neglected psychosocial problems and psychiatric comorbidity.

AB The key to the euthanasia debate lies in how best to regulate what doctors do. Opponents of euthanasia frequently warn of the possible negative consequences of legalising physician assisted suicide and active euthanasia (PAS/AE) while ignoring the covert practice of PAS/AE by doctors and other health professionals. Against the background of survey studies suggesting that anything from 4% to 10% of doctors have intentionally assisted a patient to die, and interview evidence of the unregulated, idiosyncratic nature of underground PAS/AE, this paper assesses three alternatives to the current policy of prohibition. It argues that although legalisation may never succeed in making euthanasia perfectly safe, legalising PAS/AE may nevertheless be safer, and therefore a preferable policy alternative, to prohibition. At a minimum, debate about harm minimisation and the regulation of euthanasia needs to take account of PAS/AE wherever it is practised, both above and below ground.

AB This study provides an overview of homicide clearance in four West European countries: Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Using data from the European Homicide Monitor, employing similar definitions and uniform coding schemes, this study allowed for unique cross-country comparisons in factors influencing differences in homicide clearance rates. Findings based on homicides occurring in the period 2009-14 revealed overall low homicide rates in all countries, with a wide variety in homicide clearance rates, ranging from 77 percent in the Netherlands to 98 percent in Finland. Results further showed that both event-based as well as victim-based characteristics significantly influenced the likelihood of homicide clearance, suggesting that homicide clearance rates can, for a large part, be attributed to the prevalent types of homicide in each of these European countries.

AB Background: Randomized studies examining the effect of training of mental health professionals in suicide prevention guidelines are scarce. We assessed whether professionals benefited from an e-learning supported Train-the-Trainer programme aimed at the application of the Dutch multidisciplinary suicide prevention guideline.
   Methods: 45 psychiatric departments from all over the Netherlands were clustered in pairs and randomized. In the experimental condition, all of the staff of psychiatric departments was trained by peers with an e-learning supported Train-the-Trainer programme. Guideline adherence of individual professionals was measured by means of the response to on-line video fragments. Multilevel analyses were used to establish whether variation between conditions was due to differences between individual professionals or departments.
   Results: Multilevel analysis showed that the intervention resulted in an improvement of individual professionals. At the 3 month follow-up, professionals who received the intervention showed greater guideline adherence, improved self-perceived knowledge and improved confidence as providers of care than professionals who were only exposed to traditional guideline dissemination. Subgroup analyses showed that improved guideline adherence was found among nurses but not among psychiatrists and psychologists. No significant effect of the intervention on team performance was found. Limitations: The ICT environment in departments was often technically inadequate when displaying the video clips clip of the survey. This may have caused considerable drop-out and possibly introduced selection bias, as professionals who were strongly affiliated to the theme of the study might have been more likely to finish the study.
   Conclusions: Our results support the idea that an e-learning supported Train-the-Trainer programme is an effective strategy for implementing clinical guidelines and improving care for suicidal patients.

DT Editorial Material
DE assisted suicide; euthanasia; pharmaceutical care; pharmacists
AB Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide continue to remain a controversial point of discussion in today's society. Patients will seek to increase their role in the decisions concerning their own health and death care. Pharmacists are also confronted with euthanasia: they not only have to provide the necessary drugs, but are also affected in every area of their life. Euthanasia can be seen as a contradiction to the mission of pharmacy practice. If, however, the activities of pharmacists include pharmaceutical care, the contradiction may not necessarily be present. Pharmaceutical care begins with the recognition that responsibilities of patient care cannot be relegated solely to other health professionals. Pharmaceutical care recognizes some of the most important needs of the terminally ill. If based on a patient-centered approach, euthanasia might be a logical last step in the efforts to alleviate the patient's sufferings.

AB Involving patients and families in mental healthcare is becoming more commonplace, but little is known about how they are involved in the aftermath of serious adverse events related to quality of care (sentinel events, including suicides). This study explores the role patients and families have in formal processes after sentinel events in Dutch mental healthcare. We analyzed the existing policies of 15 healthcare organizations and spoke with 35 stakeholders including patients, families, their counselors, the national regulator, and professionals. Respondents argue that involving patients and families is valuable to help deal with the event emotionally, provide additional information, and prevent escalation. Results indicate that involving patients and families is only described in sentinel event policies to a limited extent. In practice, involvement consists mostly of providing aftercare and sharing information about the event by providers. Complexities such as privacy concerns and involuntary admissions are said to hinder involvement. Respondents also emphasize that involvement should not be obligatory and stress the need for patients and families to be involved throughout the process of treatment. There is no one-size-fits-all strategy for involving patients and families after sentinel events. The first step seems to be early involvement during treatment process itself.

AB Purpose of reviewMedical Assistance in Dying (MAID) is now legal in many jurisdictions for competent adults who have intolerable suffering and/or have a terminal illness with a short prognosis. Mental illness can be a source of suffering for these individuals, but it can also affect their capacity to make medical decisions. Clinicians, and psychiatrists in particular, need to understand how to assess patients with mental illness who are requesting MAID, to determine the impact of their mental illness on the MAID request.Recent findingsPsychiatric disorders can be a primary indication for MAID in parts of Europe, and recent published case series from Belgium and the Netherlands have generated strong responses from the psychiatric community. Patients dying of terminal illnesses who request MAID often have symptoms of depression or anxiety, but psychiatrists are rarely involved in their care. Psychiatrists may be helpful in assessing decision capacity, but documentation of capacity assessment could be improved. There is a broad need to develop educational resources to train current and future physicians about MAID.SummaryMAID represents an ethical and clinical challenge for psychiatrists in a variety of ways. As more jurisdictions legalize MAID, the psychiatric community will need to be prepared to meet these challenges with robust clinical standards and educational programs to ensure the highest standards of care for patients.

AB BackgroundThe medical-ethical dilemmas related to euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (EAS) in psychiatric patients are highly relevant in an international context. EAS in psychiatric patients appears to become more frequent in the Netherlands. However, little is known about the experiences of psychiatrists with this practice. This study aims to estimate the incidence of EAS (requests) in psychiatric practice in The Netherlands and to describe the characteristics of psychiatric patients requesting EAS, the decision-making process and outcomes of these requests.MethodsIn the context of the third evaluation of the Dutch Euthanasia Act, a cross-sectional study was performed between May and September 2016. A questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 500 Dutch psychiatrists. Of the 425 eligible psychiatrists 49% responded. Frequencies of EAS and EAS requests were estimated. Detailed information was asked about the most recent case in which psychiatrists granted and/or refused an EAS request, if any.ResultsThe total number of psychiatric patients explicitly requesting for EAS was estimated to be between 1100 and 1150 for all psychiatrists in a one year period from 2015 to 2016. An estimated 60 to 70 patients received EAS in this period. Nine psychiatrists described a case in which they granted an EAS request from a psychiatric patient. Five of these nine patients had a mood disorder. Three patients had somatic comorbidity. Main reasons to request EAS were depressive feelings' and suffering without prospect of improvement'. Sixty-six psychiatrists described a case in which they refused an EAS request. 59% of these patients had a personality disorder and 19% had somatic comorbidity. Main reasons to request EAS were depressive feelings' and desperate situations in several areas of life'. Most requests were refused because the due care criteria were not met.ConclusionsAlthough the incidence of EAS in psychiatric patients increased over the past two decades, this practice remains relatively rare. This is probably due to the complexity of assessing the due care criteria in case of psychiatric suffering. Training and support may enable psychiatrists to address this sensitive issue in their work better.

AB A small proportion of deaths result from,the use of drugs with the intention to hasten death without an explicit request of the patient. Additional insight into its characteristics is needed for evaluating this practice. In the Netherlands in 2001, questionnaires were mailed to physicians that addressed the decision making that preceded their patient's death. Cases of ending life without an explicit request of the patient were compared with similar cases from 1995 and with cases from Belgium, Denmark, and Switzerland. In the Netherlands in 2001, patients receiving life-ending drugs without their explicit request were most Often 80+ years old and had cancer. Most of them were incompetent patients nearing death. Characteristics of this practice in 7995 were quite comparable, as were characteristics of this practice in Belgium, Denmark, and Switzerland. The use of drugs with the intention to hasten death without an explicit request of the patient is part of medical end-of-life practice in the studied countries, regardless of their legal framework, and it occurs in similar fashion.

AB Background: Euthanasia and assisted suicide (EAS) have been legally possible in the Netherlands since 2001, provided that statutory due care criteria are met, including: (a) voluntary and well-considered request; (b) unbearable suffering without prospect of improvement; (c) informing the patient; (d) lack of a reasonable alternative; (e) independent second physician's opinion. 'Unbearable suffering' must have a medical basis, either somatic or psychiatric, but there is no requirement of limited life expectancy. All EAS cases must be reported and are scrutinised by regional review committees (RTE). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether any particular difficulties arise when the EAS due care criteria are applied to patients with an intellectual disability and/or autism spectrum disorder.
   Methods: The 416 case summaries available on the RTE website (2012-2016) were searched for intellectual disability (6) and autism spectrum disorder (3). Direct content analysis was used on these nine cases.
   Results: Assessment of decisional capacity was mentioned in eight cases, but few details given; in two cases, there had been uncertainty or disagreement about capacity. Two patients had progressive somatic conditions. For most, suffering was due to an inability to cope with changing circumstances or increasing dependency; in several cases, suffering was described in terms of characteristics of living with an autism spectrum disorder, rather than an acquired medical condition. Some physicians struggled to understand the patient's perspective. Treatment refusal was a common theme, leading physicians to conclude that EAS was the only remaining option. There was a lack of detail on social circumstances and how patients were informed about their prognosis.
   Conclusions: Autonomy and decisional capacity are highly complex for patients with intellectual disabilities and difficult to assess; capacity tests in these cases did not appear sufficiently stringent. Assessment of suffering is particularly difficult for patients who have experienced life-long disability. The sometimes brief time frames and limited number of physician-patient meetings may not be sufficient to make a decision as serious as EAS. The Dutch EAS due care criteria are not easily applied to people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism spectrum disorder, and do not appear to act as adequate safeguards.

ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; DISORDERS; ATTITUDES
AB IMPORTANCE Euthanasia or assisted suicide (EAS) of psychiatric patients is increasing in some jurisdictions such as Belgium and the Netherlands. However, little is known about the practice, and it remains controversial.
   OBJECTIVES To describe the characteristics of patients receiving EAS for psychiatric conditions and how the practice is regulated in the Netherlands.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This investigation reviewed psychiatric EAS case summaries made available online by the Dutch regional euthanasia review committees as of June 1, 2015. Two senior psychiatrists used directed content analysis to review and code the reports. In total, 66 cases from 2011 to 2014 were reviewed.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Clinical and social characteristics of patients, physician review process of the patients' requests, and the euthanasia review committees' assessments of the physicians' actions.
   RESULTS Of the 66 cases reviewed, 70%(n = 46) werewomen. In total, 32%(n = 21) were 70 years or older, 44%(n = 29) were 50 to 70 years old, and 24%(n = 16) were 30 to 50 years old. Most had chronic, severe conditions, with histories of attempted suicides and psychiatric hospitalizations. Most had personality disorders andwere described as socially isolated or lonely. Depressive disorderswere the primary psychiatric issue in 55% (n = 36) of cases. Other conditions representedwere psychotic, posttraumatic stress or anxiety, somatoform, neurocognitive, and eating disorders, aswell as prolonged grief and autism. Comorbidities with functional impairmentswere common. Forty-one percent (n = 27) of physicians performing EASwere psychiatrists. Twenty-seven percent (n = 18) of patients received the procedure from physicians new to them, 14 of whomwere physicians from the End-of-Life Clinic, a mobile euthanasia clinic. Consultation with other physicianswas extensive, but 11% (n = 7) of cases had no independent psychiatric input, and 24% (n = 16) of cases involved disagreement among consultants. The euthanasia review committees found that one case failed to meet legal due care criteria.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Persons receiving EAS for psychiatric disorders in the Netherlands are mostly women and of diverse ages, with complex and chronic psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial histories. The granting of their EAS requests appears to involve considerable physician judgment, usually involving multiple physicians who do not always agree (sometimes without independent psychiatric input), but the euthanasia review committees generally defer to the judgments of the physicians performing the EAS.

AB Physician-administered euthanasia (PAE) was legalized, along with physician-assisted suicide (PAS), in The Netherlands in 2001.
   Annual reports of the Dutch Regional Euthanasia Review Committees, the committees' 2015 published Code of Practice and research studies
   There is a general openness about the practice of PAE/PAS in The Netherlands and an avoidance of misleading euphemisms. The 2001 law also includes arrangements for post-event review of PAE/PAS decisions.
   Rising numbers of annually reported deaths from PAE and uncertainty over actual numbers. Movement away from the principle that euthanasia must take place within an established doctor-patient relationship. Increasing extension of the 2001 law to people with mental health conditions, dementia and multiple co-morbidities. Nature of the post-event scrutiny applied to reported cases.
   The predominance of PAE over PAS where both are legalized raises questions over how these two acts are perceived and whether there are implications for such laws.
   Are the criteria for PAE/PAS in the 2001 law appropriate for a law of this nature? What should be the respective roles of the second-opinion doctors and the review committees?.

AB In 2015, euthanasia accounted for 4.5% of deaths in the Netherlands, of which 93% were performed by a GP. Historically, a conflict of physician's duties-to alleviate unbearable suffering and at the same time preserve the patient's life-is central to the justification of euthanasia practice in the Netherlands. However, there seems to be a shift towards a greater emphasis on the patient's autonomous wish as the primary basis for euthanasia. This shift has consequences for the role and interpretation of the physician's duties in end-of-life care. This paper aims to describe these developments in euthanasia practice and end-of-life decision-making. We describe important relevant developments and look into the role and the meaning of two dimensions of the concept of 'patient autonomy' regarding end-of-life decisions, in particular, the euthanasia request. We claim that the concept of autonomy 'as a right,' which can be distinguished from autonomy 'as an ideal,' narrows the physician's window of opportunity to offer end-of-life care other than euthanasia.

AB Background: Difficulties in predicting suicidal behavior hamper effective suicide prevention. Therefore, there is a great need for reliable biomarkers, and neuroimaging may help to identify such markers.
   Methods: Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to investigate resting state spatial-frequency power characteristics of female patients with major depressive disorder (MDD); 19 were recent suicide attempters (within the previous 30 days), 36 were suicide ideators, and 23 were nonsuicidal. Patients were enrolled at neuroCare Clinic Nijmegen (Nijmegen, the Netherlands) between May 2007 and November 2016, and the primary diagnosis of nonpsychotic MDD was confirmed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, DSM-IV criteria, and a score of >= 14 on the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory. Nonparametric, cluster-based permutation tests were applied to detect robust power differences between the study groups on the EEG broadband signal (2-100 Hz). Furthermore, a nonadaptive distributed source imaging method (eLORETA) was utilized to examine if these suicide-based frequency characteristics are localized in brain areas previously reported in the neuroimaging literature.
   Results: When compared to nonsuicidal depressed patients, attempters and ideators displayed both decreased beta and low gamma activity in the frontal regions. Moreover, ideators had increased alpha activity over the posterior regions and increased high beta, low gamma activity over the left occipital region when compared to psychiatric controls. Attempters had reduced beta and low gamma activity over the right temporal region when compared to ideators. In addition, eLORETA localized attempter and ideator reduced frontal activity within the orbito-, medial-, middle-, superior-, and inferior-frontal areas and the anterior cingulate cortex. In attempters, reduced right temporal activity was localized within the right inferior-, middle-, and superior-temporal cortices and the fusiform gyrus.
   Conclusions: Frequency power characteristics of attempters and ideators are consistent with findings from the neuroimaging literature concerning suicide, implying EEG resting state assessment could become a potential biomarker to predict suicide risk.

AB Background. Developmental adversities may be risk factors for adult suicidal behavior, but this relationship has rarely been Studied prospectively. The present Study examined the association between childhood adversities and new onset Suicidal ideation and attempts in an adult population-based sample.
   Method. The Study used a large community mental health survey (the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study; n=7076, age range 18-64 years). Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between childhood adversities and new onset of suicidal ideation L and attempts over 3 years Of longitudinal follow-Lip.
   Results. During the Study period 85 new cases of suicidal ideation and 39 new onset suicide attempts were observed. The incidence rate for new Suicide ideation was 0(.)67 % per year and the incidence rate for new Suicide attempts was 0(.)28 % per year. Childhood neglect, psychological abuse and physical abuse were strongly associated with new onset suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 2(.)80 to 4(.)66 for new onset suicidal ideation and from 3(.)60 to 5(.)43 for new onset Suicide attempts. The total number of adversities reported had a strong graded relationship to new onset suicidal ideation and attempts. These associations remained significant after controlling for the effects of mental disorders.
   Conclusions. Childhood abuse and multiple adversities are strongly associated with future suicidal behavior and the mental disorders assessed in the present study do not fully account for this effect. A comprehensive understanding of suicidal behavior must take childhood adversities into account.

AB Background: The Internet is used increasingly for both suicide research and prevention. To optimize online assessment of suicidal patients, there is a need for short, good-quality tools to assess elevated risk of future suicidal behavior. Computer adaptive testing (CAT) can be used to reduce response burden and improve accuracy, and make the available pencil-and-paper tools more appropriate for online administration.
   Objective: The aim was to test whether an item response-based computer adaptive simulation can be used to reduce the length of the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS).
   Methods: The data used for our simulation was obtained from a large multicenter trial from The Netherlands: the Professionals in Training to STOP suicide (PITSTOP suicide) study. We applied a principal components analysis (PCA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), a graded response model (GRM), and simulated a CAT.
   Results: The scores of 505 patients were analyzed. Psychometric analyses showed the questionnaire to be unidimensional with good internal consistency. The computer adaptive simulation showed that for the estimation of elevation of risk of future suicidal behavior 4 items (instead of the full 19) were sufficient, on average.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated that CAT can be applied successfully to reduce the length of the Dutch version of the BSS. We argue that the use of CAT can improve the accuracy and the response burden when assessing the risk of future suicidal behavior online. Because CAT can be daunting for clinicians and applied scientists, we offer a concrete example of our computer adaptive simulation of the Dutch version of the BSS at the end of the paper.

AB Background: Since 2010, suicide has been the most important cause of mortality in youth aged 15 to 29 years in the Netherlands. Depression is an important risk factor for suicidal behaviors (i.e., suicide ideation, deliberate self-harm, planning, and suicide attempts) in adolescents. Adolescents who develop depressive symptoms, are also at risk for adult depression. This developmental continuity is especially noticeable in adolescents compared to other age groups; therefore, it is necessary to develop preventive strategies for teens. This study will test a multimodal school-based approach to suicide and depression prevention, which integrates universal and targeted approaches and includes various stakeholders (schools, adolescents, parents, and mental health professionals) simultaneously.
   Methods: We will perform a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with an intervention and control condition to test the effectiveness of a school-based multimodal stepped-prevention program for depression and suicidal behaviors in adolescents. Adolescents in their second year of secondary education will participate in the study. The participants in the intervention condition will receive the entire multimodal stepped-preventive program comprising early screening and detection of suicidal behaviors and depressive symptoms, a safety net consisting of gatekeepers at school, followed by universal and indicated prevention. The participants in the control condition will undergo only the screening and the safety net of gatekeepers at schools. They will complete assessments at baseline, post-intervention, and 6, 12, and 24-month follow-up. Primary outcome will be suicidal behaviors measured at 12-months follow-up. Additionally, the present study will identify mechanisms that mediate and moderate the program effects and test the effect of the program on various secondary outcomes.
   Discussion: If the school-based multimodal stepped-prevention program proves to be effective, it could be implemented in schools on a large scale.

AB Background: In recognition of the ongoing discussion on euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, the Board of Directors of the European Association for Palliative Care commissioned this white paper from the palliative care perspective.
   Aim: This white paper aims to provide an ethical framework for palliative care professionals on euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. It also aims to provide an overview on the available evidence as well as a discourse of ethical principles related to these issues.
   Design: Starting from a 2003 European Association for Palliative Care position paper, 21 statements were drafted and submitted to a five-round Delphi process
   Participants: A panel with 17 experts commented on the paper in round 1. Board members of national palliative care or hospice associations that are collective members of European Association for Palliative Care were invited to an online survey in rounds 2 and 3. The expert panel and the European Association for Palliative Care board members participated in rounds 4 and 5. This final version was adopted as an official position paper of the European Association for Palliative Care in April 2015.
   Results: Main topics of the white paper are concepts and definitions of palliative care, its values and philosophy, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, key issues on the patient and the organizational level. The consensus process confirmed the 2003 European Association for Palliative Care white paper and its position on the relationship between palliative care and euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide.
   Conclusion: The European Association for Palliative Care feels that it is important to contribute to informed public debates on these issues. Complete consensus seems to be unachievable due to incompatible normative frameworks that clash.

AB Background: Little is known about the prevalence of bipolar disorder in the general population, what proportion is receiving care and what factors motivate people to seek help. Method: Data were derived from The Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS), a psychiatric epidemiological study in the general population in The Netherlands. DSM-III-R diagnoses were based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Results: Lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorder was 1.9%. Compared to other mental disorders, people with bipolar disorder were more often incapacitated were more likely to have attempted suicide and reported a poorer quality of life 82.8% had experienced an additional mental disorder in their lifetime; 25.5% had never sought help for their emotional problems, not even primary, informal or alternative care. Limitations: Three limitations of the study are: (1) the CIDI prevalence estimates for bipolar disorder may be inflated; (2) personality disorders were not recorded in the NEMESIS dataset; (3) in NEMESIS certain groups have not been reached, Conclusion: Three-quarters of the bipolar respondents do not benefit sufficiently from the treatment methods now available. In view of the serious consequences of this condition, greater efforts are needed to reach people with bipolar disorder, to get them into treatment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Background: In the Netherlands, the proportion of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who choose the option of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (PAS) is relatively high (20%). The objective of this study was to determine which factors influence end-of-life practices in ALS and whether rates are changing over time.
   Methods: In a cohort survey, 204 physicians and 198 informal caregivers (response rates 75% and 80%) of patients with ALS who died between 2000 and 2005 filled out questionnaires of the end-of-life circumstances of the patient.
   Results were compared with those of a similar study performed during the period 1994-1998. Results: In 2000-2005, 16.8% of the patients decided on euthanasia or PAS compared to 20.2% in 1994-1998. Thirty-one (14.8%) patients died during continuous deep sedation (CDS) in 2000-2005. Euthanasia or PAS, but not CDS, were significantly associated with religion not being important to the patient, being more educated, and dying at home. Euthanasia or PAS were not associated with quality of care items or symptoms of depression. Loss of function was similar in both groups. Informal caregivers of patients who died after euthanasia or PAS more frequently reported fear of choking (p = 0.003), no chance of improvement (p = 0.001), loss of dignity (p = 0.02), being dependent on others (p = 0.002), and fatigue (p = 0.018) as reasons for shortening life. Hopelessness was associated with euthanasia or PAS, as with CDS.
   Conclusion: The frequency of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (PAS) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) appeared stable over time and 1 in 7 patients died during CDS. CDS is relatively common in ALS, but appears to have other determinants than euthanasia or PAS. Subjective factors may be important in explaining euthanasia or PAS in ALS.

AB Purpose. in recent years the attitudes and practices of euthanasia (E) and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) among health care workers have been evaluated in different countries. There is, however, still an information gap on the role of pharmacists in these matters. The aim of our study was to study the attitudes and practices of E and PAS among pharmacists.
   Methodology. We conducted a nation-wide survey into the practice, including adherence to guidelines, of E and PAS in Community and hospital pharmacies (CP and HP) in the Netherlands. Furthermore, the attitude of community pharmacists concerning this subject was evaluated. Anonymous questionnaires were sent to a random sample of 50% (n = 755) of all CP and to ail (n = 101) HP.
   Results. The response rates were 52% and 51% for CP and HP, respectively. Most of the CP-respondents (95%) agreed with the concept of E and PAS and would dispense drugs for these purposes. When the data were extrapolated to ail pharmacies, there were 1351 and 340 dispensings of drugs for E and PAS per year in CP and HP (94% of ail requests), respectively. In most cases the pharmacist had been notified of the condition of the patient (CP: 93%, HP 87%) and a written request was obtained (CP: 74%, HP: 79%). The drugs were often handed personally to the physician (CP: 98%, HP: 86%). Involvement of pharmacy technicians was more common in HP than in CP (31% versus 6%). The mast frequently dispensed drugs were muscle relaxants with barbiturates (CP: 47%, HP 71%), barbiturates only (CP: 19%, HP: 6.1%), and muscle relaxants with benzodiazepines (CP: 14%, HP: 7.6%).
   Conclusion. Most pharmacists are supportive of E and PAS and are prepared to fill prescriptions written for these purposes.

AB Physician-assisted suicide (PAS) is one of the most provocative topics facing society today. Given the great responsibility conferred on physicians by recent laws allowing PAS, a careful examination of this subject is warranted by psychiatrists and other specialists who may be consulted during a patient's request for PAS. In this article, recent evidence regarding the implementation of PAS in the United States and The Netherlands is reviewed. Support is found for some concerns about PAS, such as the possibility that mental illness occurs at higher rates in patients requesting PAS, but not for other concerns, such as the fear that PAS will be practiced more frequently on vulnerable populations (the slippery-slope argument). These data and common arguments for and against PAS are discussed with an emphasis on the tension between values, such as maximizing patient autonomy and adhering to professional obligations, as well as the need for additional research that focuses more directly on the patient-centered perspective. Implications of the available evidence are discussed and lead to a consideration of mental anguish in terminally ill patients including aspects of existential distress and an acknowledgment of the importance of tailoring end-of-life care to the distinct set of values and experiences that shape each patient's perspective. The article concludes with a discussion of an expanding role for psychiatrists in evaluating patients who request PAS.

AB Palliative sedation therapy (PST) has become a frequent practice in end-of-life care and advocated in the literature as a less problematic alternative to practices of physician-assisted dying, such as ending patients' lives on request or assisted suicide . However, in clinical practice, patients, healthcare professionals and other parties involved in decisions about PST are facing numerous clinical and ethical challenges. This perspective aims to analyse important challenges associated with professional decision-making about PST and to explore the recommendations of guidelines, which have been published in recent years.

AB Belgium has become one of the few countries in the world where euthanasia is legally allowed within a specific juridical framework. Even more unique is the inclusion of grounds for requesting euthanasia on the basis of mental suffering. Further refinement of the legal, medical and psychiatric approach to the issue is required in order to clear up essential practical and ethical matters. Psychiatrists and their professional organisations need to play a greater role in this ongoing debate and contribute from a clinical, scientific and ethical point of view.

TI Premises and evidence in the rhetoric of assisted suicide and euthanasia

LA English
DT Article
DE Euthanasia; Assisted suicide; Suicide; Rational suicide; Slippery slope
ID CANCER-PATIENTS; TERMINALLY-ILL; LIFE; DIE; DESIRE; DEATH; RISK
AB In debates about euthanasia and assisted suicide, it is rare to find an article that begins with an expression of neutral interest and then proceeds to examine the various arguments and data before drawing conclusions based upon the results of a scholarly investigation. Although authors frequently give the impression of being impartial in their introduction, they invariably reach their prior conclusions. Positions tend to be clearly dichotomized: either one believes that the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide is totally acceptable or completely unacceptable in a just and moral society. Where there is some admission of a gray zone of incertitude, authors attempt to persuade us that their beliefs (preferences) are the only sensible way to resolve outstanding dilemmas. The practice of vehemently promoting a "pro" or "con" position may be useful when societies must decide to either legalize certain practices or not. Although only a handful of countries have thus far accepted the legal practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide (Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, the U.S. states of Montana, Oregon, Vermont and Washington, and Switzerland), scholarly articles in recent trends mainly promote legalization, to the point of recommending expansion of the current practices. Is this a case of the philosophers being ahead of their time in promoting and rationalizing the wave of the future? Alternatively, does the small number of countries that have legalized these practices indicate a substantial gap between the beliefs and desires of common citizens and the universe of the 'abstracted realm'? For the time being, what we do know is that more countries and states are debating legalization of euthanasia or assisted suicide, the nature of laws and legal practices vary greatly and both ethical and empirical assessments of current practices are the subject of much controversy. This article presents an examination of the premises and evidence in the rhetoric of assisted suicide and euthanasia. Inasmuch as any analysis cannot be totally impartial, we do not contend that our analysis is without influence from our experiences and philosophical affinities. Notwithstanding this caveat, we venture to propose that our scrutiny of the arguments and empirical data may offer some guidance to individuals who are attempting to reach practical conclusions based upon the available evidence, whether empirical or rationalized.

   concerning the impact on patients in vulnerable groups-another
   perspective on Oregon's data
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID PALLIATIVE CARE; MORTALITY
AB Battin et al examined data on deaths from physician-assisted suicide (PAS) in Oregon and on PAS and voluntary euthanasia (VE) in The Netherlands. This paper reviews the methodology used in their examination and questions the conclusions drawn from it-namely, that there is for the most part 'no evidence of heightened risk' to vulnerable people from the legalisation of PAS or VE. This critique focuses on the evidence about PAS in Oregon. It suggests that vulnerability to PAS cannot be categorised simply by reference to race, gender or other socioeconomic status and that the impetus to seek PAS derives from factors, including emotional state, reactions to loss, personality type and situation and possibly to PAS contagion, all factors that apply across the social spectrum. It also argues, on the basis of official reports from the Oregon Health Department on the working of the Oregon Death with Dignity Act since 2008, that, contrary to the conclusions drawn by Battin et al, the highest resort to PAS in Oregon is among the elderly and, on the basis of research published since Battin et al reported, that there is reason to believe that some terminally ill patients in Oregon are taking their own lives with lethal drugs supplied by doctors despite having had depression at the time when they were assessed and cleared for PAS.

AB Background Research on attitudes towards end-of-life decisions (ELDs) contextually most often refers to the very end of life, that is, to situations of terminally ill patients or severe pain, but it is rarely applied to the broader context of long-term care dependency in old age.
   Methods In a representative survey among older Austrians (50+, n=968), respondents were asked about their approval of assisted suicide and euthanasia (EUT) when requested by an older, severely care-dependent person. The influence of sociodemographics, care-related experiences and expectations, religiosity, trust, locus of control and concerns regarding constrictions of old age on the approval of both these ELDs was assessed through logistic regression analyses.
   Results 42% and 34% of the respondents approved assisted suicide and EUT, respectively, in case of care dependency. Non-religious individuals, less trusting respondents and those concerned about constrictions associated with old age were more likely to approve both these ELDs.
   Conclusions Widespread concerns regarding long-term care dependency in old age should be addressed in information campaigns, and public discourse about ELDs should pay more attention to situations of long-term care dependency.

AB In Belgium and the Netherlands, consultation of a second independent physician by the attending physician is mandatory in euthanasia cases. In both countries, specialized consultation services have been established to provide physicians trained for that purpose. This retrospective study describes and compares the quality of consultation of both services based on surveys of attending physicians and those providing the consultation (consultants). While Dutch consultants discussed certain subjects, for example, alternative curative or palliative treatment more often with the attending physician than Belgian consultants, both usually discussed those subjects considered necessary for a quality consultation and were independent from patient and attending physician. Over 90% of attending physicians in both countries evaluated the consultant's knowledge of palliative care, patient's disease, and judicial procedure, and their communication skills, as sufficient. Consultation with specialized consultation services seems to promote quality of euthanasia consultations.

AB Purpose To explore how physicians analyse their non-treatment decisions in light of the concepts of hastening, causing and intending the patient's death.
   Methods Sixteen Norwegian physicians from relevant specialties were interviewed and the results analysed by systematic text condensation, a qualitative analysis framework.
   Results The physicians' chief dilemma in non-treatment decisions was the attempt to achieve the proper balance for the level of treatment at life's end. Respondents framed their challenges in medical and not ethical terms. They treated the concepts of intending, hastening and causing the patient's death as alien to their practical deliberations and, for many, irrelevant to the moral appraisal of their end-of-life practices.
   Conclusions The core concepts of traditional medico-ethical analyses of end-of-life decision-making do not map the practical terrain well. Research on physician intentions must be designed and interpreted in light of this.

AB In this article I intend to describe an issue of the Dutch euthanasia practice that is not common knowledge. After some general introductory descriptions, by way of formulating a frame of reference, I shall describe the effects of this practice on patients, physicians and families, followed by a more philosophical reflection on the significance of these effects for the assessment of the authenticity of a request and the nature of unbearable suffering, two key concepts in the procedure towards euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. This article does not focus on the arguments for or against euthanasia and the ethical justification of physician-assisted dying. These arguments have been described extensively in Kimsma and Van Leeuwen (Asking to die. Inside the Dutch debate about euthanasia, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, 1998).

AB Some form of assisted dying (voluntary euthanasia and/or assisted suicide) is lawful in the Netherlands, Belgium, Oregon, and Switzerland. In order to be lawful in these jurisdictions, a valid request must precede the provision of assistance to die. Non-adherence to the criteria for valid requests for assisted dying may be a trigger for civil and/or criminal liability, as well as disciplinary sanctions where the assistor is a medical professional. In this article, we review the criteria and evidence in respect of requests for assisted dying in the Netherlands, Belgium, Oregon, and Switzerland, with the aim of establishing whether individuals who receive assisted dying do so on the basis of valid requests. We conclude that the evidence suggests that individuals who receive assisted dying in the four jurisdictions examined do so on the basis of valid requests and third parties who assist death do not act unlawfully. However, further research on the elements that may undermine the validity of requests for assisted dying is warranted. More research on the reasons why requests for assisted dying are refused is also desirable.

AB Legalisation of assisted suicide presents a dilemma for society. This arises because of a lack of consensus regarding the precedence to be accorded freedom of choice versus the inviolability of human life. Several factors including improvements in medical technology, population ageing and changing perceptions about quality of life serve to make a re-examination of attitudes to this issue appropriate at this time. Within this context, data from the 1983, 1984, 1989 and 1994 British Social Attitudes Surveys (BSAS) were examined. These demonstrate a slight increase in support for physician-assisted suicide (PAS) from around 75% to around 84% over the 11-year period in Britain. A much lower level of support (54%) was recorded in relation to family-assisted suicide (FAS). A logistic regression analysis of data from the 1994 survey was undertaken to establish the relationship between attitudes toward legalisation of PAS and FAS and the characteristics of the respondent. Strength of religious affiliation was found to be a significant determinant of opposition to legalisation of both. Religious denomination was found to be marginally significant in relation to PAS but not FAS. Members of the Church of England, non-Christian faiths and those of no faith were found to be marginally more likely to support legalisation of PAS, than Roman Catholics or those of other Christian faiths. Education, income, sex, marital status, long-standing illness and age were not found to be significant predictors of attitude. In relation to FAS age was also found to be significant predictor of opposition. Findings here suggest that if Britain continues to become a more secularised society, support for legalisation of PAS (and FAS) is likely to increase. As health care costs continue to grow and the ability to extend life (even where the quality of that life may be poor) increases, pressure for legalisation of PAS may increase.

ID PREVENTION PROGRAM; IMPLEMENTATION; STRATEGY
AB Background: To strengthen suicide prevention skills in mental health care in The Netherlands, multidisciplinary teams throughout the country are trained in the application of the new Dutch guideline on the assessment and treatment of suicidal behavior. Previous studies have shown beneficial effects of additional efforts for guideline implementation on professionals' attitude, knowledge, and skills. However, the effects on patients are equally important, but are rarely measured. The main objective of this study is to examine whether patients of multidisciplinary teams who are trained in guideline application show greater recovery from suicide ideation than patients of untrained teams.
   Methods/Design: This is a multicentre cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT), in which multidisciplinary teams from mental health care institutions are matched in pairs, and randomly allocated to either the experimental or control condition. In the experimental condition, next to the usual dissemination of the guideline (internet, newsletter, books, publications, and congresses), teams will be trained in the application of the guideline via a 1-day small interactive group training program supported by e-learning modules. In the control condition, no additional actions next to usual dissemination of the guideline will be undertaken. Assessments at patient level will start when the experimental teams are trained. Assessments will take place upon admission and after 3 months, or earlier if the patient is discharged. The primary outcome is suicide ideation. Secondary outcomes are non-fatal suicide attempts, level of treatment satisfaction, and societal costs. Both a cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis will be performed. The effects of the intervention will be examined in multilevel models.
   Discussion: The strengths of this study are the size of the study, RCT design, training of complete multidisciplinary teams, and the willingness of both management and staff to participate.

AB During the summer of 1999 and in April 2002 I went to the Netherlands in order to meet some of the leading authorities on the euthanasia policy. They were asked multiple questions. This study reports the main findings to the question: should doctors suggest euthanasia to their patients? Some interviewees did not observe any significant ethical concerns involved in suggesting euthanasia. For various reasons they thought physicians should offer euthanasia as an option. Two interviewees asserted that doctors don't propose euthanasia to their patients. Five interviewees objected to physician's initiative.

AB Context: Controversy exists whether anxiety disorders are independently associated (ie, after adjusting for comorbid mental disorders) with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.
   Objective: To examine whether anxiety disorders are risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in a large population-based longitudinal study.
   Methods: Data come from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study, a prospective population-based survey with a baseline and 2 follow-up assessments over a 3-year period. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to assess DSM-III-R mental disorders. Lifetime diagnoses of anxiety disorders (social phobia, simple phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder) were assessed at baseline. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine whether anxiety disorders were associated with suicidal ideation and attempts at baseline (n=7076) and whether anxiety disorders were risk factors for subsequent onset of suicidal ideation and attempts (n=4796).
   Results: After adjusting for sociodemographic factors and all other mental disorders assessed in the survey, base-line presence of any anxiety disorder was significantly associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in both the cross-sectional analysis (adjusted odds ratio for suicidal ideation, 2.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.85-2.82; adjusted odds ratio for suicidal attempts, 2.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.70-3.62) and longitudinal analysis (adjusted odds ratio for suicidal ideation, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-4.11; adjusted odds ratio for suicide attempts, 3.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.70-7.83). Further analyses demonstrated that the presence of any anxiety disorder in combination with a mood disorder was associated with a higher likelihood of suicide attempts in comparison with a mood disorder alone.
   Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate that a preexisting anxiety disorder is an independent risk factor for subsequent onset of suicidal ideation and attempts. Moreover, the data clearly demonstrate that comorbid anxiety disorders amplify the risk of suicide attempts in persons with mood disorders. Clinicians and policymakers need to be aware of these findings, and further research is required to delineate whether treatment of anxiety disorders reduces the risk of subsequent suicidal behavior.

AB ObjectiveFamily caregivers of people with dementia often report high levels of stress and depression, but little is known about those who contemplate suicide or self-harm. This study explores thoughts of suicide, self-harm and death in dementia caregivers and investigates the characteristics that distinguish them from those without such thoughts.
   MethodsData were collected every 3months, for 24months, from 192 family caregivers of people with dementia living in the Netherlands. Caregivers did not have a clinical depression or anxiety disorder at baseline. Suicide-related thoughts were measured with an item from the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, a diagnostic instrument for DSM-IV mental disorders. Fisher exact, analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis tests compared the characteristics of caregivers who had contemplated suicide with two comparison groups.
   ResultsWithin 24months, 76 caregivers reported symptoms of a potential depression and were further assessed for suicidal thoughts. Nine carers (11.8%, 4.7% of the total sample) reported suicidal thoughts with three of those at multiple points. Caregivers with suicidal thoughts had more severe depressive and anxious symptoms, had a lower sense of competence and mastery, felt less happy and experienced more health problems, less family support and more feelings of loneliness than caregivers who had not.
   ConclusionSuicidal thoughts are present in dementia caregivers and can persist across the care trajectory. Various psychological and social characteristics significantly distinguish caregivers with suicidal thoughts from those without. More research is needed to enable the identification of high-risk caregivers and provide an evidence base for the development of preventive strategies and interventions. (c) 2017 The Authors.

AB BackgroundLegalisation of physician-assisted dying (PAD) remains a highly contested issue. In the Australasian context, the opinion and perspective of palliative care specialists have not been captured empirically, and are required to inform better the debate around this issue, moving forward.
   AimTo identify current attitudes and experiences of palliative care specialists in Australasia regarding requests for physician-assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia, and to capture the opinion of palliative care specialists on the legalisation of these practices in the Australasian context.
   MethodAn anonymous, cross-sectional, online survey of Australasian specialists in palliative care, addressing the following six areas: (i) demographics; (ii) frequency of requests, and response given; (iii) understanding of the term voluntary euthanasia'; (iv) opinion regarding legalisation of physician-assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia in Australasia, and willingness to participate if legal; (v) identification of the most important values guiding this opinion; and (vi) anticipated impact that legalisation of assisted death would have on palliative care practice.
   ResultsImportant findings include: (i) palliative care specialists are largely opposed to the legalisation of PAD; (ii) the proportional titration of opioids is not understood by any palliative care specialist studied to be voluntary euthanasia'; and (iii) there is a wide variation in frequency of requests, and one-third of palliative care specialists express discomfort in dealing with requests for assisted suicide or euthanasia.
   ConclusionKey areas for future research at the interface between PAD and best practice end-of-life care are identified, including exploration into why palliative care specialists are largely opposed to PAD, and consideration of the impact the opioid misconception' may have on the literature informing this debate.

AB This paper addresses current developments in the right-to-die arena. While discussion of this area has traditionally been the province of disciplines other than sociology, including philosophy and bioethics, this paper offers an alternative framework from which to consider the progressive interest in control and choice at life's end which has developed this century, principally in the Western world. Taking a largely socio-historical approach, this paper argues that issues such as euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide can be seen as forming part of an international social movement, which is dubbed 'the requested death movement'.
   The paper traces the chronology of the movement, placing its framing activities, the emergence of individual activists and events and its progressive mobilization, within a consideration of so-called 'new' social movements, which have emerged since the 1960s. These are principally concerned with resisting state control of cultural matters, while reclaiming matters of identity, privacy and individual corporeality, which it is argued are at the core of the requested death movement. It is posited that this consideration can contribute to understandings of both the contemporary social organization of death and dying, and social movement theory more generally.

AB A lifetime history (LTH) of suicide attempts (SAs) is frequently assessed in mental health surveys. However, little is known about the reliability of assessing a LTH of SA. This study examined the consistency and its determinants of reporting a LTH of SA in a large cohort of persons with a history of depression and/or anxiety. Data are from the baseline and two-year assessments of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Persons with a Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)-based lifetime depressive and/or anxiety disorder (N=1973) constitute the study sample. A LTH of SAs was assessed at baseline and at two-year follow-up. Of the persons who reported at either interview a LTH of SAs, more than one-third did not report this consistent at both interviews. Moreover, indications were found for more consistent reporting among persons with a higher number of SAs and among persons with current (severe) psychopathology as compared to those with remitted or less severe current psychopathology. Our results showed that even a salient topic as a history of SAs is prone for reporting errors, and that current psychological state influences reporting of a LTH of SAs.

AB Objective: To investigate risk factors for non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), and present the relationship between NSSI and depression in children and adolescents who appeared for forensic examination.
   Methods: This study consisted of 295 children and adolescents who were brought for judicial examination in the TR Ministry of Justice Forensic Science Department, Council of Forensic Medicine, Ankara, Turkey between May and October 2013. Sociodemographic factors, alcohol and substance abuse, and history of sexual abuse and suicide attempts were assessed using a semi-structured questionnaire. During forensic medical examinations, NSSI was evaluated. Depression was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory.
   Results: The frequency of NSSI was 20.2% among boys, and 30.6% among girls. Statistical differences were found between subjects with and without NSSI in terms of number of children in their families, whether or not their parents were divorced, whether they held part-time jobs, or had a history of sexual abuse, substance abuse, or suicide attempts, and the number of criminal involvements. Those with NSSI had higher depressive scores than others (p<0.001).
   Conclusion: Children and adolescents with NSSI have wide-ranging problems in their lives. In a forensic adolescent population, depressive symptoms are more common in individuals with NSSI behaviors, and the specific characteristics of these behaviors need further investigation.

AB Background: Issues concerning legislation and regulation with respect to the role of nurses in euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide gave the Minister for Health reason to commission a study of the role of nurses in medical end-of-life decisions in hospitals, home care and nursing homes.
   Aim: This paper reports the findings of a study of the role of nurses in euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, conducted as part of a study of the role of nurses in medical end-of-life decisions. The findings for hospitals, home care and nursing homes are described and compared.
   Method: A questionnaire was sent to 1509 nurses, employed in 73 hospitals, 55 home care organisations and 63 nursing homes. 1179 responses (78.1%) were suitable for analysis. The questionnaire was pilot-tested among 106 nurses, with a response rate of 85%.
   Results: In 37.0% of cases, the nurse was the first person with whom patients discussed their request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. Consultation between physicians and nurses during the decision-making process took place quite often in hospitals (78.8%) and nursing homes (81.3%) and less frequently in home care situations (41.2%). In some cases (12.2%), nurses administered the euthanatics.
   Conclusions: The results show substantial differences between the intramural sector (hospitals and nursing homes) and the extramural sector (home care), which are probably linked to the organisational structure of the institutions. Consultation between physicians and nurses during the decision-making process needs improvement, particularly in home care. Some nurses had administered euthanatics, although this task is by law exclusively reserved to physicians.

AB Objective: Intimate partner homicides (IPHs) continue to be widespread and constant over time when compared with other types of homicide. Yet research addressing IPH particularly within the European context, is limited. The question of whether perpetrators of partner-related violence differ from offenders of general violence has been raised in research. In light of inconsistent findings and ongoing debate, the aim was to identify sociodemographic and criminological characteristics in perpetrators and victims of IPH, and to determine whether they differ from other types of homicides in Sweden. Method: This retrospective study was based on national data of all male-perpetrated homicides (N = 211) in Sweden committed between 2007 and 2009. Characteristics of IPH (n = 46) and non-IPH (n = 165) were compared and analyzed by conducting bivariate and multiple logistic regressions. Results: Perpetrators of IPH were older, more likely to be employed, less likely to have been convicted, and had less persistent criminal histories. Perpetrators of IPH were also less likely to be intoxicated at the time of the offense; nonetheless, intoxication was a common feature among victims and perpetrators in both groups. Further, perpetrators of partner-related homicides are substantially more likely to commit suicide. Conclusion: The present study illustrates critical differences between IPH and non-IPH perpetrators. As hypothesized, IPH perpetrators were less socially disadvantaged, less likely to have past criminal offenses, and more likely to commit suicide following the homicidal act. This study demonstrates that perpetrators of IPH constitute a separate subtype and, conceptually, ought to be treated separately.

LA English

DE epidemiology; injury; mortality; trends
AB Background: Approximately 190,000 European Union (EU) citizens die annually as a result of an injury. In response, the European Commission identified accidents and injuries as a priority area for action in the field of public health in 1993. In 1984, the World Health Organization (WHO) Health for All targets were set in Europe to reduce unintentional injuries by 25% and reverse the rising trends in suicide by the year 2000. The aim of this study was to examine the trends in mortality due to externally caused physical injuries between 1984 and 1993 in the 15 countries which are currently members of the EU. Methods: Injury mortality data for all countries were obtained from the WHO and national government agencies. Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated for both unintentional and intentional injuries and examined over time. Results: Downward trends in age-standardized injury mortality due to unintentional injuries were identified in most countries. Marked variations were observed between countries, with low rates in the UK, The Netherlands and Sweden and high rates in Finland, Portugal and France. Age-standardized suicide rates decreased in most countries over the study period, with marked variations between countries. In general, countries in northern Europe experienced higher suicide rates than countries in southern Europe. Mortality rates due to homicide and other violent causes were low and relatively stable over the study period. Conclusions: Most countries appear to be on track to meet the WHO targets for unintentional injury mortality and suicide mortality. However, disparities between countries remain, for reasons that are unclear. While mortality data were valuable in describing the epidemiology of fatal injury in Europe, agreement on standardized practices of data collection, coding and analysis would improve the comparability of data between countries.

AB In the USA, the use of advance directives (ADs) has been studied extensively, in order to identify opportunities to increase their use. We investigated the prevalence of ADs and the factors associated with formulation of an AD in The Netherlands, using samples of three groups: the general population up to 60 years of age, the general population over 60 years of age, and the relatives of patients who died after euthanasia or assisted suicide. The associated factors were grouped into three components: predisposing factors (e.g. age, gender), enabling factors (e.g. education) and need factors (e.g. health-related factors). We found that living wills had been formulated by 3% of younger people, 10% of older people, and 23% of the relatives of a person who died after euthanasia or assisted suicide. Most living wills concerned a request for euthanasia. In all groups, 26-29% had authorized someone to make decisions if they were no longer able to do so themselves. Talking to a physician about medical end-of-life treatment occurred less frequently, only 2% of the younger people and 7% of the older people had done so. Most people were quite confident that the physician would respect their end-of-life wishes, but older people more so than younger people. In a multivariate analysis, many predisposing factors were associated with the formulation of an AD: women, older people, non-religious people, especially those who lived in an urbanized area, and people with less confidence that the physician would respect their end-of-life wishes were more likely to have formulated an AD. Furthermore, the enabling factor of a higher level of education, the need factor of contact with a medical specialist in the past 6 months, and the death of a marital partner were associated with the formulation of an AD.

   MEDICAL ASSISTANCE; MENTAL-DISORDERS; CANCER-PATIENTS
AB Medical professional societies have traditionally opposed physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia (PAS-E), but this opposition may be shifting. We present 5 reasons why physicians shouldn't be involved in PAS-E.
   1. Slippery slopes: There is evidence that safeguards in the Netherlands and Belgium are ineffective and violated, including administering lethal drugs without patient consent, absence of terminal illness, untreated psychiatric diagnoses, and nonreporting;
   2. Lack of self-determination: Psychological and social motives characterize requests for PAS-E more than physical symptoms or rational choices; many requests disappear with improved symptom control and psychological support;
   3. Inadequate palliative care: Better palliative care makes most patients physically comfortable. Many individuals requesting PAS-E don't want to die but to escape their suffering. Adequate treatment for depression and pain decreases the desire for death;
   4. Medical professionalism: PAS-E transgresses the inviolable rule that physicians heal and palliate suffering but never intentionally inflict death;
   5. Differences between means and ends: Proeuthanasia advocates look to the ends (the patient's death) and say the ends justify the means; opponents disagree and believe that killing patients to relieve suffering is different from allowing natural death and is not acceptable.
   Conclusions: Physicians have a duty to eliminate pain and suffering, not the person with the pain and suffering. Solutions for suffering lie in improving palliative care and social conditions and addressing the reasons for PAS-E requests. They should not include changing medical practice to allow PAS-E.

AB Background: Families' experiences of assisted dying are under-investigated and families are rarely considered in clinical guidelines concerning assisted dying. Aim: To systematically review family experiences of assisted dying. Design: A systematic literature review using thematic synthesis. Data sources: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine) and PsycINFO databases (January 1992 to February 2019). Studies investigating families' experiences on the practice of legalised assisted dying were included. We excluded studies prior to legalisation within the jurisdiction, secondary data analysis and opinion papers. Results: Nineteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Publications were derived from four countries: The Netherlands, United States (Oregon, Washington and Vermont), Canada and Switzerland. Dutch studies predominately investigated family involvement in euthanasia, while Swiss and American studies only reported on assisted suicide. Eleven studies had a qualitative design, using predominately in-depth interviews; seven were retrospective surveys. Five analytical themes represented families' experiences in assisted dying: (1) context of the decision, (2) grounding the decision, (3) cognitive and emotional work, (4) experiencing the final farewell and (5) grief and bereavement. The results showed that families can be very involved in supporting patients seeking assisted dying, where open communication is maintained. Family involvement appeared to be influenced by the type of legislation in their country and the families' perception of the social acceptability of assisted dying. Conclusion: Our data confirm that families across all jurisdictions are involved in assisted suicide decision and enactment. Family needs are under-researched, and clinical guidelines should incorporate recommendations about how to consider family needs and how to provide them with evidence-based tailored interventions.

AB Background. Major depressive disorder (MDD), represent a major source of risk for suicidality. However, knowledge about risk factors for future suicide attempts (SAs) within MDD is limited. The present longitudinal study examined a wide range of putative non-clinical risk factors (demographic, social, lifestyle, personality) and clinical risk factors (depressive and suicidal indicators) for future SAs among persons with MDD. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between a number of significant predictors and the incidence of a future SA.
   Methods. Data are from 1713 persons (18-65 years) with a lifetime MDD at the baseline measurement of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety who were subsequently followed up 2, 4 and 6 years. SAs were assessed in the face-to-face measurements. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to examine a wide range of possible non-clinical and clinical predictors for subsequent SAs during 6-year follow-up.
   Results. Over a period of 6 years, 3.4% of the respondents attempted suicide. Younger age, lower education, unemployment, insomnia, antidepressant use, a previous SA and current suicidal thoughts independently predicted a future SA. The number of significant risk factors (ranging from 0 to 7) linearly predicted the incidence of future SAs: in those with 0 predictors the SA incidence was 0%, which increased to 32% incidence in those with 6+ predictors.
   Conclusion. Of the non-clinical factors, particularly socio-economic factors predicted a SA independently. Furthermore, preexisting suicidal ideation and insomnia appear to be important clinical risk factors for subsequent SA that are open to preventative intervention.

AB Background: The impact of depression and anxiety on heart rate variability (HRV) is not clear in adolescents. We hypothesised that HRV investigation in adolescents may early prevent the mental diseases occurrence.
   Methods: Three hundred and thirty-three seventh grade students participated in this study programme. HRV instrumental analysis and spectral with scale of depression were measured respectively.
   Results: It showed that among the participants, the depression score of female was higher than male. The population with lower depression score present with lower high frequency and higher low frequency/high frequency ratio but not statistically significant. Oppositely, participants with higher depression score were increased with heart rate and present with lower standard deviation of heart rate. However, it is also not statistically significant.
   Conclusion: This study supported the positive relation between HRV and depression, especially in the female gender. Therefore, HRV in depression may be beneficial in the detection and prevention of mental disorder development, even suicide behaviour in teenagers.

AB This paper unpacks the slippery slope argument as it pertains to assisted death.
   The assisted-death regimes of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and the states of Washington and Oregon are discussed and examined with respect to the slippery slope analytical rubric. In addition to providing a preliminary explanation of how the slippery slope argument has been academically defined and constructed, the paper examines assisted-death models from the perspective of considering what might exist at the top and at the bottom of the slippery slope. It also explores the nature and scope of safeguards implemented to avoid slippage, and shows that what lies at the top and bottom of the slippery slope may be different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. After identifying some of the recent concerns that have arisen within each of the jurisdictions (concerns that might be viewed by some as evidence of slide), the paper concludes by making note of certain critical issues in the current assisted-death debate that merit deeper examination.

AB Viral-mediated transfer of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene has been demonstrated by several investigators to confer sensitivity to nucleoside analogs such as ganciclovir (GCV) in a variety of tumor cells including brain, prostate, bladder, kidney, ovary, head and neck, lung, pancreas, and liver cancers. Fourteen suicide gene clinical protocols using adenovirus vectors have been conducted, including four in prostate cancer. Two additional protocols for prostate cancer are in preparation in Japan and the Netherlands. A study conducted at Baylor College of Medicine was the first to demonstrate the safety of HSV-tk plus GCV therapy for human prostate cancer and the anticancer activity of gene therapy in this disease. However, it is still in the early stage of its development, with a number of problems to be overcome. Systemic delivery, specific introduction, and specific expression of the target gene are the major issues to be managed in order to establish a clinically relevant treatment strategy.

AB Background: This study estimates the frequency of different end-of-life decisions (ELDs) in medical practice in the UK, compares these with other countries and assesses doctors' views on the adequacy of current UK law. Method: Postal survey of 857 UK medical practitioners using a questionnaire used in other countries. Findings: The proportion of UK deaths involving an ELD were: 1) voluntary euthanasia 0.16% (0-0.36), 2) physician-assisted suicide 0.00%, 3) ending of life without an explicit request from patient 0.33% (0-0.76), 4) alleviation of symptoms with possibly life shortening effect 32.8% (28.1-37.6), 5) non-treatment decisions 30.3% (26.0-34.6). ELDs 1 and 2 were significantly less frequent than in the Netherlands and Australia; ELD 2 was also less frequent than Switzerland. ELD 3 was less frequent than in Belgium and Australia. Comparison of UK and New Zealand general practitioners showed lower rates of ELDs 4 and 5 in the UK. ELD 5 was more common than in most other European countries. A few doctors attending deaths felt UK law had inhibited or interfered with their preferred management of patients (4.6% (3.1-6.1%) of doctors) or that a new law would have facilitated better management (2.6% (1.4-3.8%) of doctors). Interpretation: The lower relative rate of ELDs involving doctor-assisted dying in the UK, and the relatively high rate of non-treatment decisions, suggests a culture of medical, decision making informed by a palliative care philosophy.

AB Like many other disciplines, psychology has made a number of contributions to the continuing debate on voluntary euthanasia. The present paper describes a number of aspects of palliative care practice and argues that (a) good palliative care should consider the issue of euthanasia (b) psychologists have much to contribute to the consideration of euthanasia, for example in clarifying issues of autonomy; and (c) there is potential for a "palliative psychology" that could be of value in end-of-life care. Finally, consideration is given to the relationship between euthanasia and the society of which it is a part.

AB Background: Urban residents have higher mortality risks than rural residents. These urban- rural differences might be more pronounced within certain demographic sub-populations.
   Aim: To determine urban- rural differences in all- cause and cause- specific mortality within specific demographic subpopulations of the Dutch population.
   Method: Mortality records with information on gender, age, marital status, region of origin and place of residence were available for 1995 through 2000. Neighbourhood data on address density and socioeconomic level were linked through postcode information. Variations in all-cause and cause- specific mortality between urban and rural neighbourhoods were estimated through Poisson regression. Additionally, analyses were stratified according to demographic subpopulation.
   Result: After adjustments for population composition, urban neighbourhoods have higher all- cause mortality risks than rural neighbourhoods ( RR= 1.05; Cl 1.04 to 1.05), but this pattern reverses after adjustment for neighbourhood socioeconomic level ( RR= 0.98; Cl 0.97 to 0.99). The beneficial effect of living in an urban environment applies particularly to individuals aged 10 - 40 years and 80 years and above, people who never married and residents from non- Western ethnic origins. The beneficial effect of urban residence for non- married people is related to their lower cancer and heart disease mortality. The beneficial effect of urban residence for people of non- Western ethnic origin is related to their lower cancer and suicide mortality.
   Conclusion: In The Netherlands, living in an urban environment is not consistently related to higher mortality risks. Young adults, elderly, single and non- Western residents, especially, benefit from living in an urban environment. The urban environment seems to offer these subgroups better opportunities for a healthy life.

AB Background: The practice of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) in the Netherlands has been regulated since 2002 by the Euthanasia Act. In the ongoing debate about the interpretation of this Act, comparative information about the opinions of the different stakeholders is needed.
   Aim: To evaluate the opinions of Dutch physicians, nurses and the general public on the legal requirements for euthanasia and PAS.
   Design: A cross-sectional survey among Dutch physicians and nurses in primary and secondary care and members of the Dutch general public, followed by qualitative interviews among selected respondents. The participants were: 793 physicians, 1243 nurses and 1960 members of the general public who completed the questionnaire; 83 were interviewed.
   Results: Most respondents agreed with the requirement of a patient request (64-88%) and the absence of a requirement concerning life expectancy (48-71%). PAS was thought acceptable by 24-39% of respondents for patients requesting it because of mental suffering due to loss of control, chronic depression or early dementia. In the case of severe dementia, one third of physicians, 58% of nurses and 77% of the general public agreed with performing euthanasia based on an advance directive. Interviewees illustrated these findings and supported the Act.
   Conclusions: Health care professionals and the general public mostly support the legal requirements for euthanasia and PAS. The law permits euthanasia or PAS for mental suffering but this possibility is not widely endorsed. The general public is more liberal towards euthanasia for advanced dementia than health care professionals. We conclude that there is ample support for the law after eight years of legal euthanasia.

AB Child maltreatment is a major social problem with many adverse consequences, and a substantial number of maltreated children are not identified by health care professionals. In 2010, in order to improve the identification of maltreated children in hospitals, a new hospital-based policy was developed in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This policy was adapted from another policy that was developed in The Hague, the Netherlands, in 2007. In the new Amsterdam policy, all adults presenting at the emergency department due to domestic violence, substance abuse, and/or a suicide attempt are asked whether they have any children in their care. If this is the case, parents are urged to visit the outpatient pediatric department together with all of their children. During this visit, problems are evaluated and voluntary referrals can be arranged to different care organizations. If parents refuse to cooperate, their children are reported to the Dutch Child Abuse Counseling and Reporting Centre. The two aims of this study are to describe (1) characteristics of the identified families and (2) the referrals made to different voluntary and involuntary care organizations during the first 2 years after implementation of the policy. Data were collected from medical records. One hundred and six children from 60 households were included, of which 68 children because their mother was a victim of domestic violence. Referrals to care organizations were arranged for 99 children, of which 67 on a voluntary basis. The Amsterdam policy seems successful in arranging voluntary support for the majority of identified children.

AB Background. Mental health status may be closely related to an instability of intentions toward a premature death, but little is known about such instability following an explicit request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (EAS) and patient characteristics associated with a change of mind.
   Method. A questionnaire was sent to 6596 general practitioners in The Netherlands (response rate 60%). Of these, 1681 provided descriptions of the most recent explicit request for EAS they had received in the preceding 18 months.
   Results. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were related to a change of mind, but no relationship was found with the total score of the NOSGER Mood Dimension. Multinomial regression analysis revealed that patients who changed their mind had more mental health problems and less mental clarity than those who died by EAS. They also had fewer general health problems, had less unbearable and pointless suffering (according to the physician), were less concerned about loss of dignity and alternative treatment options were more frequently available. A further analysis revealed that mental health problems were more prevalent among patients whose requests were refused than among those who changed their mind. The physicians' evaluations of the reasons why a patient requested EAS were similar to a more objective measure of the patient characteristics.
   Conclusions. These findings suggest that mental health status must be carefully assessed, and possible instability of desire must be taken into account in the course of a request for EAS. These results require,replication, and future studies should adopt a prospective method.

AB Background: Different studies have shown similar or even lower mortality among homeless persons with compared to homeless persons without a severe mental disorder.
   Aims: To clarify the association between presence of a psychiatric diagnosis and mortality among the socially marginalized.
   Methods: The Public Mental health care (PMHc) is a legal task of the municipal authority aiming at prevention and intervention in case of (imminent) homelessness among persons with a serious shortage of self-sufficiency. The data of PMHc clients (N=6,724) and personally matched controls (N=66,247) were linked to the registries of Statistics Netherlands and analysed in a Cox model.
   Results: The increased mortality among PMHc clients, compared to the general population (HR=2.99, 95%-CI: 2.63-3.41), was associated with a broad range of death causes. Clients with a record linkage to the Psychiatric Case Registry Middle Netherlands ('PMHc+') had an increased risk of suicide (HR=2.63, 0.99-7.02, P=0.052), but a lower risk of natural death causes (HR=0.71, 0.54-0.92, P=0.011), compared to clients without this record linkage ('PMHc-'). Compared to controls, however, 'PMHc-' clients experienced substantially increased risks of suicide (HR=3.63, 1.42-9.26, P=0.007) and death associated with mental and behavioural disorders (ICD-10 Ch.V) (HR=7.85, 3.54-17.43, P<0.001).
   Conclusion: Psychiatric services may deliver an important contribution to the prevention of premature natural death among the socially marginalized.

AB ObjectivesTo compare rates of specific adverse outcomes between patients starting quetiapine, olanzapine, or risperidone use in the Netherlands.
   MethodsObservational study using the PHARMO Database Network, including patients starting quetiapine (4658), olanzapine (5856), or risperidone (7229) in 2000-2009, comparing rates of all-cause mortality, failed suicide attempts, extrapyrimidal symptoms (EPS), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypothyroidism, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
   Key findingsMedian follow-up until discontinuation/end of follow-up was 0.6years. Prescribed doses were generally lower than the approved defined daily doses, especially for quetiapine. Quetiapine was significantly associated with lower EPS rates (HR 0.18; 95% CI 0.13-0.24), but higher failed suicide attempt rates (HR 2.07; 95% CI 1.35-3.16) compared to risperidone. Quetiapine was significantly associated with lower EPS rates (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.42-0.84) and DM rates (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.44-0.97) compared to olanzapine. Rates for all-cause mortality, hypothyroidism, and stroke were similar between groups. AMI events were too infrequent to draw conclusions.
   ConclusionsQuetiapine was associated with lower EPS, but higher failed suicide attempt rates compared to risperidone. Quetiapine was associated with lower EPS and DM rates compared to olanzapine. The results should be interpreted with caution because of possible channelling and residual confounding. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Background: Most studies on attitudes towards euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) have been conducted in healthy populations. The aim of this study is to explore and describe attitudes towards, and wishes for, euthanasia/PAS in cancer patients with short life expectancy. Method: Semi-structured interviews with 18 cancer patients with a life expectancy of less than nine months. All patients were recruited from an inpatient palliative medicine unit. Results: Patients holding a positive attitude towards euthanasia/PAS do not necessarily want euthanasia/PAS for themselves. Wishes are different from requests for euthanasia/PAS. Fear of future pain and a painful death were the main reasons given for a possible wish for euthanasia/PAS. Worries about minimal quality of life and lack of hope also contributed to such thoughts. Wishes for euthanasia/PAS were hypothetical; they were future oriented and with a prerequisite that intense pain, lack of quality of life and/or hope had to be present. Additionally, wishes were fluctuating and ambivalent. Conclusion: The wish to die in these patients does not seem to be constant. Rather, this wish is more appropriately seen as an ambivalent and fluctuating mental 'solution' for the future. Health care providers should be aware of this when responding to utterances regarding euthanasia/PAS.

TI Considerations by Dutch Psychiatrists Regarding Euthanasia and
   Physician-Assisted Suicide in Psychiatry: A Qualitative Study
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (EAS) in psychiatry are permitted in the Netherlands under certain legal conditions. Doctors may help patients who suffer unbearably and who have no prospect of improvement from psychiatric illnesses. Although this practice is permitted, it remains controversial, and the acceptability of EAS and the conditions under which it should be allowed are still debated. As the number of psychiatric patients requesting EAS is increasing, Dutch psychiatrists are becoming more reluctant to consider EAS.
   Objective: This study aims for a better understanding of Dutch psychiatrists' considerations for supporting or rejecting EAS for psychiatric patients.
   Methods: The data for this qualitative study were collected through 17 in-depth interviews with Dutch psychiatrists. These interviews were held from January until June 2016 as a part of the Third Evaluation of the Dutch Termination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide Act.
   Results: Irrespective of their own position in the debate, most Dutch psychiatrists consider reasons for and against EAS, including moral (justice and equality, professional responsibility, compassion), epistemologic (how can one ever know the suffering is without prospect), practical, and contextual (mental health care provisions) reasons.
   Conclusions: The variation in views on EAS in psychiatry seems to be related to a difference in views on the nature of psychiatric diseases. Some psychiatrists stress the similarity between psychiatric and somatic diseases, whereas others stress the fundamental difference. These opposing views could be bridged by a pragmatic view, such as a 2-track approach to EAS.

AB Context. The practice of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (EAS) is always complex, but some cases are more complex than others. The nature of these unusually complex cases is not known.
   Objectives. To identify and categorize the characteristics of EAS requests that are more complex than others.
   Methods. We held in-depth interviews with 28 Dutch physicians about their perception of complex cases of EAS requests. We also interviewed 26 relatives of patients who had died by EAS. We used open coding and inductive analysis to identify various different aspects of the complexities described by the participants.
   Results. Complexities can be categorized into relational difficulties-such as miscommunication, invisible suffering, and the absence of a process of growth toward EAS-and complexities that arise from unexpected situations, such as the capricious progress of a disease or the obligation to move the patient. The interviews showed that relatives of the patient influence the process toward EAS.
   Conclusion. First, the process toward EAS may be disrupted, causing a complex situation. Second, the course of the process toward EAS is influenced not only by the patient and his/her attending physician but also by the relatives who are involved. Communicating and clarifying expectations throughout the process may help to prevent the occurrence of unusually complex situations. (C) 2014 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

AB Purpose: Cancer patients have generally requested for euthanasia and assisted suicide (EAS) more frequently than others. However, different terminal cancers are accompanied by different clinical courses. This study seeks to explore the relationship, if any, between EAS requesters and cancer types, as relates to the provision of end-of-life care in the Netherlands.
   Methods: Standardized questionnaires were retrospectively sent to all general practitioners (GPs) in 10 of 23 GP-districts in the Netherlands. Of the 3614 respondents (60%), 1442 could describe a most recent EAS request from a cancer patient.
   Results: Compared to all home cancer deaths, lung, pancreas, stomach oesophagus, lip-mouth-throat cancers and melanomas occur more frequently in the group of cancer patients who requested for EAS; while prostate, haemo-lymphatic, urinary tract, bladder and uterus cancer occur relatively less frequently. Vomiting, shortness of breath and anxiousness were symptoms positively associated, and old age was negatively associated with cancers in which patients relatively frequently request for EAS.
   Conclusion: There are differences in the extent to which patients with different cancer types request for EAS. Although shortness of breath, vomiting and anxiousness are associated with cancer types in which patients relatively frequently request for EAS, most symptoms are not associated with this. Possibly a common pathway, including more existential concerns, is important in the last stages of life. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This manuscript aimed at reviewing the literature on suicide in young people and to present the most recent findings regarding several important issues such as: the prevalence of suicidal behaviour in young people in Flanders and the Netherlands; the causes and risk factors of suicidality in this young age group; and the most effective prevention strategies.
   Recent epidemiological studies indicate that rates of fatal and non-fatal suicidal behaviour are high in Flemish young people in comparison with international figures and especially in comparison with Dutch youngsters. Research findings suggest that this increased risk for suicidality in Flemish youngsters can be associated with less adaptive coping-responses such as less communication, more use of alcohol and drugs, less problem-oriented coping and more anxiety. Socio-cultural differences in coping behaviour can therefore be associated with differences in risk of suicidal behaviour.
   An amplitude of studies regarding the causes and risk factors of suicidal behaviour in young people have led to a growing understanding of the pathways leading to suicidal behaviour. This knowledge makes it possible to describe a heuristic explanatory model of suicidal behaviour in which this behaviour can be viewed as the consequence of an interaction between trait- and state-dependent characteristics. The trait-dependent vulnerability includes a persistent predisposition or diathesis to suicidal behaviour and can be described in terms of biological and psychological characteristics. State-dependent factors include stressor-induced characteristics such as psychiatric and social variables.
   With regard to the prevention of suicidal behaviour in adolescents the abovementioned findings regarding the causes and risk factors, indicate that, at the individual level, prevention of suicide should include psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic strategies in the treatment of the associated psychiatric disorders and underlying vulnerability. At a more general population level, prevention is often directed or implemented at the school. Research regarding school-based prevention strategies have clearly shown that broad prevention programmes are needed, which focus not only on the youngsters themselves but also on the school personnel and in addition not only focus on suicide but more broadly on mental health and problem-solving/communication skills.

TI Establishing specialized health services for professional consultation
   in euthanasia: experiences in the Netherlands and Belgium
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID TERMINALLY-ILL; HOPELESSNESS; DEPRESSION; PHYSICIAN; OREGON; CANCER;
   DEATH
AB Background: The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg have adopted laws decriminalizing euthanasia under strict conditions of prudent practice. These laws stipulate, among other things, that the attending physician should consult an independent colleague to judge whether the substantive criteria of due care have been met. In this context initiatives were taken in the Netherlands and Belgium to establish specialized services providing such consultants: Support and Consultation for Euthanasia in the Netherlands (SCEN) and Life End Information Forum (LEIF) in Belgium. The aim of this study is to describe and compare these initiatives.
   Methods: We studied and compared relevant documents concerning the Dutch and Belgian consultation service (e.g. articles of bye-laws, inventories of activities, training books, consultation protocols).
   Results: In both countries, the consultation services are delivered by trained physicians who can be consulted in cases of a request for euthanasia and who offer support and information to attending physicians. The context in which the two organisations were founded, as well as the way they are organised and regulated, is different in each country. By providing information on all end-of-life care matters, the Belgian LEIF seems to have a broader consultation role than the Dutch SCEN. SCEN on the other hand has a longer history, is more regulated and organised on a larger scale and receives more government funding than LEIF. The number of training hours for physicians is equal. However, SCEN-training puts more emphasis on the consultation report, whereas LEIF-training primarily emphasizes the ethical framework of end-of-life decisions.
   Conclusion: In case of a request for euthanasia, in the Netherlands as well as in Belgium similar consultation services by independent qualified physicians have been developed. In countries where legalising physician-assisted death is being contemplated, the development of such a consultation provision could also be considered in order to safeguard the practice of euthanasia (as it can provide safeguards to adequate performance of euthanasia and assisted suicide).

AB The conceptualization of assisted death as an act performed by physicians has resulted in a lack of attention to nurses' roles and experiences with the processes that surround an assisted death. In this article, we synthesize evidence from 6 articles focusing on the experiences of 55 nurses from Canada, Belgium, and the Netherlands, with relevant ethical and policy implications derived from the literature. Nurses have a central role in negotiating inquiries about assisted death and in providing wraparound care for patients, families, and other health care providers. This role is impactful for nurses and requires significant personal and professional moral work.

AB Objective. To examine the practices that surround euthanasia, particularly among vulnerable patients, using qualitative observation-based data.
   Methods. A 15-month qualitative, observation-based study of home death and general practice in the greater Amsterdam region of The Netherlands. Study included observation and interviews with a sample of 15 (GPs and 650 of their patients, 192 of whom were living with terminal or life-threatening illness (with and without requests for euthanasia).
   Results. Euthanasia practice typically involves extensive deliberations, the majority of which do not end in a euthanasia death. Euthanasia discussions or 'euthanasia talk' share at least two consequences: (i) the talk puts the onus on patients to continue discussions towards a euthanasia death and (ii) there is a socio-therapeutic component, which tends to affirm social bonds and social life.
   Conclusion. While this qualitative evidence cannot disprove existence of abuse, it suggests that euthanasia practices have evolved in such a way that patients are more likely to talk about euthanasia than to die a euthanasia death.

AB There has been contentious debate over the years about whether there are morally relevant similarities and differences between the three practices of continuous deep sedation until death, physician-assisted suicide, and voluntary euthanasia. Surprisingly little academic attention has been paid to a comparison of the uses of these practices in the two types of circumstances in which they are typically performed. A comparative domains of ethics analysis methodological approach is used in the paper to compare 1) the use of the three practices in paradigm circumstances, and 2) the use of the practices in paradigm circumstances to their use in non-paradigm circumstances. The analytical outcomes suggest that a bright moral line cannot be demonstrated between any two of the practices in paradigm circumstances, and that there are significant, morally-relevant distinctions between their use in paradigm and non-paradigm circumstances. A thought experiment is employed to illustrate how these outcomes could possibly inform the decisions of hypothetical deliberators who are engaged in the collaborative development of assisted dying regulatory frameworks.

DE health; inequality; mortality; homicide; suicide
ID INCOME INEQUALITY; POPULATION HEALTH; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; DETERMINANT;
   TRENDS
AB We investigate whether changes in economic inequality affect mortality in rich countries. To answer this question we use a new source of data on income inequality: tax data on the share of pretax income going to the richest 10% of the population in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US between 1903 and 2003. Although this measure is not a good proxy for inequality within the bottom half of the income distribution, it is a good proxy for changes in the top half of the distribution and for the Gini coefficient. In the absence of country and year fixed effects, the income share of the top decile is negatively related to life expectancy and positively related to infant mortality. However, in our preferred fixed-effects specification these relationships are weak, statistically insignificant, and likely to change their sign. Nor do our data suggest that changes in the income share of the richest 10% affect homicide or suicide rates. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Tariq Ramadan; Yusuf al-Qaradawi; Paul Berman; Ian Buruma; Salafism;

AB Tariq Ramadan calls himself a bridge builder between Muslims and European culture, but contradictions in his theology prevent him from fulfilling this role. He is an Islamic intellectual who espouses democracy and pluralism, yet he believes that shari'a law is universal. He exhorts his European followers to refrain from anti-Semitic violence, yet he cites as an authority Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, who is an apologist for Palestinian suicide bombers. He calls for Muslims to be full participants in Western civic societies, yet he calls on Muslims to "resist" the neo-liberal economic order that forms the basis of Western society. Ramadan has made alliances with left wing politicians and academics in France, Britain, the Netherlands, and the United States, but he has a pattern of disappointing and frustrating his leftist allies. In the wake of terrorist attacks in Britain and the Netherlands, the British and Dutch governments called upon Ramadan to support peaceable brands of Islam in these traumatized countries. These efforts failed because Ramadan's most important constituency has always been "the Muslim street," and this makes it difficult for him to embrace liberal principles.

AB Background: Legal provisions in The Netherlands and Belgium currently allow physicians to actively end a patient's life at his or her request under certain conditions. The term that is used for this is "euthanasia." Discussion: The same term, "euthanasia," was used in Germany during the Nazi regime for a program of cleansing the "German nation" in which untold thousands of persons were denied human empathy or medical care and were thereby condemned to death. The medical profession played a leading role in the planning, administration, and supervision of this "euthanasia" program, with a large proportion of German physicians proactively shirking all moral responsibility and ultimately paving the way for the Holocaust. Conclusion: The term "euthanasia" was so abused during the Nazi regime as a camouflage word for murder of selected subpopulations with the willing participation of physicians, we believe that, regardless of the benevolent goals of current euthanasia practices, for historical reasons the term "euthanasia" must not be used with regards to current end-of-life care.

AB From the United States and Netherlands, we have 2 articles on back pain, with findings that indicate significant treatment differences between the countries, and a high likelihood of persistence. The Inflammatory Diet is now shown to be related to diabetes. Multiple perspectives on palliative care for the homeless. Could pharmacists assist in preventing suicide? There are changes in the practice of family medicine. Social determinants of health substantially influence health and medical care. Moreover, care for patients from deprived communities is under-reimbursed. Patient pre-existing conditions increased after the Affordable Care Act, suggesting that repealing pre-existing condition protections would likely exacerbate disparities in health and health care.

AB BackgroundRecently, euthanasia and assisted suicide (EAS) in patients with psychiatric disorders, dementia, or an accumulation of health problems has taken a prominent place in the public debate. However, limited is known about this practice. The purpose of this study was threefold: to estimate the frequency of requesting and receiving EAS among people with (also) a psychiatric disorder, dementia, or an accumulation of health problems; to explore reasons for physicians to grant or refuse a request; and to describe differences in characteristics, including the presence of psychiatric disorders, dementia, and accumulation of health problems, between patients who did and did not request EAS and between patients whose request was or was not granted.MethodsA nationwide cross-sectional survey study was performed. A stratified sample of death certificates of patients who died between 1 August and 1 December 2015 was drawn from the central death registry of Statistics Netherlands. Questionnaires were sent to the certifying physician (n=9351, response 78%). Only deceased patients aged 17years and who died a non-sudden death were included in the analyses (n=5361).ResultsThe frequency of euthanasia requests among deceased people who died non-suddenly and with (also) a psychiatric disorder (11.4%), dementia (2.1%), or an accumulation of health problems (8.0%) varied. Factors positively associated with requesting euthanasia were age (<80years), ethnicity (Dutch/Western), cause of death (cancer), attending physician (general practitioner), and involvement of a pain specialist or psychiatrist. Cause of death (neurological disorders, another cause) and attending physician (general practitioner) were also positively associated with receiving euthanasia. Psychiatric disorders, dementia, and/or an accumulation of health problems were negatively associated with both requesting and receiving euthanasia.ConclusionsEAS in deceased patients with psychiatric disorders, dementia, and/or an accumulation of health problems is relatively rare. Partly, this can be explained by the belief that the due care criteria cannot be met. Another explanation is that patients with these conditions are less likely to request EAS.

AB Palliative care, directed at improving the quality of life of terminally ill patients, is generally not aimed at any form of postponing or hastening death. It is possible that high quality palliative care could prevent requests for euthanasia. However, empirical evidence on this issue is scarce. In a national survey of end-of-life medical decisions in The Netherlands the subject of care at the end of life has been addressed. Data on terminally ill cancer patients who died after their request was granted and euthanasia had been performed were compared with those of terminally ill cancer patients who did not request euthanasia. The results show that the prevalence and severity of symptoms e. g., pain, feeling unwell, nausea, was higher in patients who died after their request was granted and euthanasia had been performed. No differences concerning the treatment of symptoms or the care provided were found between the two groups. The results suggest that the practice of euthanasia is mainly related to the patient's suffering.

AB Backgroun: Family members do not have an official position in the practice of euthanasia and physician assisted suicide (EAS) in the Netherlands according to statutory regulations and related guidelines. However, recent empirical findings on the influence of family members on EAS decision-making raise practical and ethical questions. Therefore, the aim of this review is to explore how family members are involved in the Dutch practice of EAS according to empirical research, and to map out themes that could serve as a starting point for further empirical and ethical inquiry.
   Methods: A systematic mixed studies review was performed. The databases Pubmed, Embase, PsycInfo, and Emcare were searched to identify empirical studies describing any aspect of the involvement of family members before, during and after EAS in the Netherlands from 1980 till 2018. Thematic analysis was chosen as method to synthesize the quantitative and qualitative studies.
   Results: Sixty-six studies were identified. Only 14 studies had family members themselves as study participants. Four themes emerged from the thematic analysis. 1) Family-related reasons (not) to request EAS. 2) Roles and responsibilities of family members during EAS decision-making and performance. 3) Families' experiences and grief after EAS. 4) Family and 'the good euthanasia death' according to Dutch physicians.
   Conclusion: Family members seem to be active participants in EAS decision-making, which goes hand in hand with ambivalent feelings and experiences. Considerations about family members and the social context appear to be very important for patients and physicians when they request or grant a request for EAS. Although further empirical research is needed to assess the depth and generalizability of the results, this review provides a new perspective on EAS decision-making and challenges the Dutch ethical-legal framework of EAS. Euthanasia decision-making is typically framed in the patient-physician dyad, while a patient-physician-family triad seems more appropriate to describe what happens in clinical practice. This perspective raises questions about the interpretation of autonomy, the origins of suffering underlying requests for EAS, and the responsibilities of physicians during EAS decision-making.

AB Homosexuality has been shown to be associated with suicidality and mental disorders. It is unclear whether homosexuality is related to suicidality, independently of mental disorders. This study assessed differences in lifetime symptoms of suicidality (death ideation, death wishes, suicide contemplation, and deliberate self-harm) between homosexual and heterosexual men and women, controlling for lifetime psychiatric morbidity. Interaction effects of age and the role of perceived discrimination were also examined. Data were collected on a representative sample of the Dutch population aged 18-64 years. Classification as heterosexual or homosexual was based upon reported sexual behavior in the preceding year. Of those sexually active, 2.8% of 2,878 men and 1.4% of 3,120 women had had same-sex partners. Homosexual men differed from their heterosexual counterparts on all four suicide symptoms (OR ranging from 2.58 to 10.23, with higher ORs for more severe symptoms), and on the sum total of the four symptoms; homosexual women only differed from heterosexual women on suicide contemplation (OR=2.12). Controlling for psychiatric morbidity decreased the ORs, but among men all associations were still significant; the significance for suicide contemplation among women disappeared. Younger homosexuals were not at lower risk for suicidality than older homosexuals in comparison with their heterosexual counterparts. Among homosexual men, perceived discrimination was associated with suicidality. This study suggests that even in a country with a comparatively tolerant climate regarding homosexuality, homosexual men were at much higher risk for suicidality than heterosexual men. This relationship could not only be attributed to their higher psychiatric morbidity. In women, there was no such clear relationship.

AB Background: Terminal sedation in patients nearing death is an important issue related to end-of-life care.
   Objective: To describe the practice of terminal sedation in the Netherlands.
   Design: Face-to-face interviews.
   Setting: The Netherlands.
   Participants: Nationwide stratified sample of 482 physicians; 410 responded and 211 of these reported characteristics of their most recent terminal sedation case. Measurements: Physician reports of frequency of terminal sedation (defined as the administration of drugs to keep the patient in deep sedation or coma until death, without giving artificial nutrition or hydration), characteristics of the decision-making process, drugs used, the estimated life-shortening effect, and frequency of euthanasia discussions.
   Results: Of respondents, 52% (95% CI, 48% to 57%) had ever used terminal sedation. Of the 211 most recent cases, physicians used terminal sedation to alleviate severe pain in 51% of patients (CI, 44% to 58%), agitation in 38% (CI, 32% to 45%), and dyspnea in 38% (CI, 32% to 45%). Physicians reported discussing with patients the decision to use deep sedation in 59% of the 211 most recent cases (CI, 52% to 66%) and the decision to forgo artificial nutrition or hydration in 34% (CI, 28% to 41%). Hastening death was partly the intention of the physician in 47% (CI, 41% to 54%) of cases and the explicit intention in 17% (CI, 13% to 22%) of cases.
   Limitations: The generalizability of physician reports about their most recent cases to all terminal sedation cases is uncertain. In addition, the findings are subject to recall bias and may not apply to other geographic settings.
   Conclusions: Terminal sedation precedes a substantial number of deaths in the Netherlands. In about two thirds of most recently reported cases, physicians indicated that in addition to alleviating symptoms, they intended to hasten death.

AB This study estimates the frequency of different medical end-of-life decisions (ELDs) made in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2007-2008, comparing these with 2004. Postal survey was carried out with 8857 medical practitioners, of whom 3733 (42%) practitioners replied, with 2869 having attended a person who died in the previous year. The proportion of UK deaths involving (1) voluntary euthanasia (0.21%; CI: 0-0.52), (2) physician-assisted suicide (0.00%) and (3) ending of life without an explicit request from the patient (0.30%; CI: 0-0.60) is low. Better questions about ELDs showed both non-treatment decisions (21.8%; CI: 19.0-24.5) and double effect measures (17.1%; CI: 14.6-19.6) to be much less common than suggested in earlier estimates, rarely involving intent to end life or being judged to have shortened life by more than a day. Continuous deep sedation (16.5%; CI: 14.3-18.7) is relatively common in UK medical practice, particularly in hospitals, home care settings and with younger patients. Further findings about the distribution of ELDs across subgroups are also reported. Survey research in this area requires careful control over question wording if valid estimates and comparisons of the prevalence of ELDs are to be made. The high rate of sedation compared with other countries may be a cause for concern. Palliative Medicine (2009); 23: 198-204

This contrasts with the laws on MAID in the Netherlands, which require that physicians only grant access to MAID if they concur with the patient that there are no other potential means of alleviating the suffering. In the Netherlands, when a doctor believes that other means to reduce the suffering exist, they must be tried before having access to MAID. This criterion is often applied and is considered an essential precaution to ensure that lives are not ended prematurely when other viable interventions exist. The Canadian emphasis on the patient's right to decide whether to try potential alternatives a physician may suggest, such as palliative care, instead of dying by MAID, gives patients the liberty to make informed decisions, even when they may not seem to be in their best interest. This contrasts with the belief in the Netherlands that the state has an obligation to protect citizens from making decisions that are not in their best interest, such as choosing to die when the intolerable suffering can be diminished sufficiently for the person to abandon the desire to end the suffering by dying. The Canadian parliament, when they consider expanding access to MAID, should incorporate the Dutch due care safeguards to ensure that death is not the solution when other ways of reducing suffering exist.

TI Does legal physician-assisted dying impede development of palliative
   care? The Belgian and Benelux experience
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID MAPPING LEVELS; EUTHANASIA; END; NETHERLANDS; SUICIDE; UPDATE; VIEW
AB Background In 2002, physician-assisted dying was legally regulated in the Netherlands and Belgium, followed in 2009 by Luxembourg. An internationally frequently expressed concern is that such legislation could stunt the development of palliative care (PC) and erode its culture. To study this, we describe changes in PC development 2005-2012 in the permissive Benelux countries and compare them with non-permissive countries.
   Methods Focusing on the seven European countries with the highest development of PC, which include the three euthanasia-permissive and four non-permissive countries, we compared the structural service indicators for 2005 and 2012 from successive editions of the European Atlas of Palliative Care. As an indicator for output delivery of services to patients, we collected the amounts of governmental funding of PC 2002-2011 in Belgium, the only country where we could find these data.
   Results The rate of increase in the number of structural PC provisions among the compared countries was the highest in the Netherlands and Luxembourg, while Belgium stayed on a par with the UK, the benchmark country. Belgian government expenditure for PC doubled between 2002 and 2011. Basic PC expanded much more than endowment-restricted specialised PC.
   Conclusions The hypothesis that legal regulation of physician-assisted dying slows development of PC is not supported by the Benelux experience. On the contrary, regulation appears to have promoted the expansion of PC. Continued monitoring of both permissive and non-permissive countries, preferably also including indicators of quantity and quality of delivered care, is needed to evaluate longer-term effects.

TI End-of-life decision-making across cancer types: results from a

   EUTHANASIA LAW; SYMPTOM BURDEN; RESPONSE RATES; BELGIUM; NETHERLANDS;
   OPIOIDS; ACCESS
AB BACKGROUND: The treatment of advanced cancer often involves potentially life-shortening end-of-life decisions (ELDs). This study aimed to examine the prevalence and characteristics of ELDs in different cancer types.
   METHODS: A nationwide death certificate study was conducted based on a large random sample of all deaths in Flanders, Belgium, between 1 January and 30 June 2013. All cancer deaths were selected (n = 2392). Attending physicians were sent a questionnaire about ELDs and the preceding decision-making process.
   RESULTS: The response rate was 58.3%. Across cancer types, a non-treatment decision occurred in 7.6-14.0%, intensified pain and symptom alleviation in 37.5-41.7%, euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide in 8.7-12.6%, and life shortening without explicit patient request in 1.0-2.4%. ELD prevalence did not differ significantly by cancer type. Reasons for ELDs were most frequently patient's physical suffering and lack of prospect of improvement. 'Anticipated further suffering' and 'unbearable situation for relatives' were reasons more often reported in haematological cancer than in other cancer types. Patient, family, and caregiver involvement in decision-making did not differ across cancer types.
   CONCLUSIONS: Euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide rates were relatively high in all cancer types. Neither the prevalence of ELDs nor characteristics of the decision-making process differed substantially between cancer types. This indicates a uniform approach to end-of-life care, including palliative care, across oncological settings.

TI Trajectories to seeking demedicalised assistance in suicide: a
   qualitative in-depth interview study
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID EUTHANASIA; PHYSICIAN; STATES
AB Background In the Netherlands, people can receive (limited) demedicalised assistance in suicide (DAS)-an option less well known than physician-assisted dying (PAD).
   Aim This study explores which trajectories people take to seek DAS, through open-coding and inductive analysis of in-depth interviews with 17 people who receive(d) DAS from counsellors facilitated by foundation De Einder.
   Results People sought DAS as a result of current suffering or as a result of anticipating possible prospective suffering. People with current suffering were unable or assumed they would be unable to obtain PAD. For people anticipating possible prospective suffering, we distinguished two trajectories. In one trajectory, people preferred PAD but were not reassured of help by the physician in due time and sought DAS as a backup plan. In the other trajectory, people expressed a preference for DAS mainly as a result of emphasising self-determination, independence, taking their own responsibility and preparing suicide carefully. In all trajectories, dissatisfaction with physician-patient communication-for instance about (a denied request for) PAD or fearing to discuss this-influenced the decision to seek DAS.
   Conclusions While PAD is the preferred option of people in two trajectories, obtaining PAD is uncertain and not always possible. Dissatisfaction with physician-patient communication can result in the physician not being involved in DAS, being unable to diagnose diseases and offer treatment nor offer reassurance that people seem to seek. We plea for more mutual understanding, respect and empathy for the limitations and possibilities of the position of the physician and the patient in discussing assistance in dying.

AB This article examines the Oregon Death with Dignity Act from a medical perspective. Drawing on case studies and information provided by doctors, families, and other care givers, it finds that seemingly reasonable safeguards for the care and protection of terminally ill patients written into the Oregon law are being circumvented. The problem lies primarily with the Oregon Public Health Division ("OPHD"), which is charged with monitoring the law. OPHD does not collect the information it would need to effectively monitor the law and in its actions and publications acts as the defender of the law rather than as the protector of the welfare of terminally ill patients. We make explicit suggestions for what OPHD would need to do to change that.

ID SAFETY
AB Context: The long-term mortality in adults treated with recombinant GH during childhood has been poorly investigated. Recently released data from the French part of the European Union Safety and Appropriateness of GH treatments in Europe (EU SAGhE) study have raised concerns on the long-term safety of GH treatment.
   Objective: To report preliminary data on long-term vital status and causes of death in patients with isolated GH deficiency or idiopathic short stature or born small for gestational age treated with GH during childhood, in Belgium, The Netherlands, and Sweden.
   Design: Data were retrieved from national registries of GH-treated patients and vital status from National Population Registries. Causes of death were retrieved from a National Cause of Death Register (Sweden), Federal and Regional Death Registries (Belgium), or individual patient records (The Netherlands).
   Patients: All patients diagnosed with isolated GH deficiency or idiopathic short stature or born small for gestational age started on recombinant GH during childhood from 1985-1997 and who had attained 18 yr of age by the end of 2010 were included. Vital status was available for approximately 98% of these 2,543 patients, corresponding to 46,556 person-years of observation.
   Main Outcome Measure: Vital status, causes of death, age at death, year of death, duration of GH treatment, and mean GH dose during treatment were assessed.
   Results: Among 21 deaths identified, 12 were due to accidents, four were suicides, and one patient each died from pneumonia, endocrine dysfunction, primary cardiomyopathy, deficiency of humoral immunity, and coagulation defect.
   Conclusions: In these cohorts, the majority of deaths (76%) were caused by accidents or suicides. Importantly, none of the patients died from cancer or from a cardiovascular disease. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 97: E213-E217, 2012)

TI Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide not meeting due care criteria
   in the Netherlands: a qualitative review of review committee judgements
SO BMJ OPEN
LA English
DT Review
ID END-OF-LIFE; DEATH; REQUEST
AB To assess how Dutch regional euthanasia review committees (RTE) apply the euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (EAS) due care criteria in cases where the criteria are judged not to have been met ('due care not met' (DCNM)) and to evaluate how the criteria function to set limits in Dutch EAS practice.
   Design A qualitative review using directed content analysis of DCNM cases in the Netherlands from 2012 to 2016 published on the RTE website (https://www.euthanasiecommissie.nl/) as of 31 January 2017.
   Results Of 33 DCNM cases identified (occurring 2012-2016), 32 cases (97%) were published online and included in the analysis. 22 cases (69%) violated only procedural criteria, relating to improper medication administration or inadequate physician consultation. 10 cases (31%) failed to meet substantive criteria, with the most common violation involving the no reasonable alternative (to EAS) criterion (seven cases). Most substantive cases involved controversial elements, such as EAS for psychiatric disorders or 'tired of life', in incapacitated patients or by physicians from advocacy organisations. Even in substantive criteria cases, the RTE's focus was procedural. The cases were more about unorthodox, unprofessional or overconfident physician behaviours and not whether patients should have received EAS. However, in some cases, physicians knowingly pushed the limits of EAS law. Physicians from euthanasia advocacy organisations were over-represented in substantive criteria cases. Trained EAS consultants tended to agree with or facilitate EAS in DCNM cases. Physicians and families had difficulty applying ambiguous advance directives of incapacitated patients.
   Conclusion As a retrospective review of physician self-reported data, the Dutch RTEs do not focus on whether patients should have received EAS, but instead primarily gauge whether doctors conducted EAS in a thorough, professional manner. To what extent this constitutes enforcement of strict safeguards, especially when cases contain controversial features, is not clear.

AB This Article examines the Oregon Death with Dignity Act from a medical perspective. Drawing on case studies and information provided by doctors, families, and other care givers, it finds that seemingly reasonable safeguards for the care and protection of terminally ill patients written into the Oregon law are being circumvented. The problem lies primarily with the Oregon Public Health Division ("OPHD"), which is charged with monitoring the law. OPHD does not collect the information it would need to effectively monitor the law and in its actions and publications acts as the defender of the law rather than as the protector of the welfare of terminally ill patients. We make explicit suggestions for what OPHD would need to do to change that.

ID OF-LIFE PRACTICES; GRONINGEN PROTOCOL
AB Since the Netherlands produced the Groningen protocol describing the methods to be used for pediatric euthanasia and Belgium passed laws authorizing euthanasia for children who consent to it, the issue of pediatric euthanasia has become a relevant topic to discuss. Most rejections of pediatric euthanasia fall into 1 or more of 3 categories, each of which has problems. This article shows how several recent arguments against pediatric euthanasia fail to prove that pediatric euthanasia is unacceptable. It does not follow from this that the practice is permissible but rather that if one is to reject such a practice, stronger arguments will need to be made, especially in countries where adult euthanasia or assisted suicide is already permitted.

   PREVALENCE; ALL-CAUSE; MORTALITY; OLD; AGE; ASSOCIATION; PERSPECTIVE
AB Background: Several studies have demonstrated increased mortality associated with depression and with anxiety. Mortality due to comorbidity of two mental disorders may be even more increased. Therefore, we investigated the mortality among patients with depression, with anxiety and with both diagnoses.
   Methods: By linking the longitudinal Psychiatric Case Register Middle-Netherlands, which contains all patients of psychiatric services in the Utrecht region, to the death register of Statistics Netherlands, hazard ratio's of death were estimated overall and for different categories of death causes separately.
   Results: We found an increased risk of death among patients with an anxiety disorder (N = 6919): HR = 1.45 (95%CI: 1.25-1.69), and among patients with a depression (N = 14,778): HR=1.83, (95%CI: 1.72-1.95), compared to controls (N = 103,824). The hazard ratios among both disorders combined (N=4260) were similar to those with only a depression: HR=1.91, (95% CI: 1.64-2.23). Among patients with a depression, mortality across all important disease-related categories of death causes (neoplasms, cardiovascular, respiratory, and other diseases) and due to suicide was increased, without an excess mortality in case of comorbid anxiety.
   Limitations: The presented data are restricted to broad categories of patients in specialist services. No data on behavioral or intermediate factors were available.
   Conclusions: Although anxiety is associated with an increased risk of death, the presence of anxiety as comorbid disorder does not give an additional increase in the risk of death among patients with a depressive disorder. The increased mortality among patients with depression is not restricted to suicide and cardiovascular diseases, but associated with a broad range of death causes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Euthanasia requests have increased as the number of debilitated patients rises in both developed and developing countries such as India due to medical, psychosocial-emotional, socioenvironmental, and existential issues amid fears of potential misuse. World's position: Albania, Colombia, the Netherlands, and Switzerland permit euthanasia conditionally. Australia's legalization of euthanasia has been withdrawn. The United States permits withdrawal of life support. Mexico and Norway permit active euthanasia. India's position: Following the Aruna Shanbaug case the Supreme Court granted legal sanction to passive, but not active, euthanasia that is valid till the Parliament legislates on euthanasia. Handling euthanasia requests: Acknowledging the complexity of the problem; individualizing the palliative approach; and accepting the There is no alternative' or There is no answer' (TINA) factor.

AB To describe the content of practice guidelines on euthanasia and assisted suicide (EAS) and to compare differences between settings and guidelines developed before or after enactment of the euthanasia law in 2002 by means of a content analysis. Most guidelines stated that the attending physician is responsible for the decision to grant or refuse an EAS request. Due care criteria were described in the majority of guidelines, but aspects relevant for assessing these criteria were not always described. Half of the guidelines described the role of the nurse in the performance of euthanasia. Compared with hospital guidelines, nursing home guidelines were more often stricter than the law in excluding patients with dementia (30% vs 4%) and incompetent patients (25% vs 4%). As from 2002, the guidelines were less strict in categorically excluding patients groups (32% vs 64%) and in particular incompetent patients (10% vs 29%). Healthcare institutions should accurately state the boundaries of the law, also when they prefer to set stricter boundaries for their own institution. Only then can guidelines provide adequate support for physicians and nurses in the difficult EAS decision-making process.

AB Background: Systematic screening to identify adolescents at risk for suicidal behavior is crucial to suicide prevention. Aims: The current practice of screening and follow-up actions taken by school nurses in schools for secondary education in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, was studied. Methods: In Rotterdam, an approach was developed in which, as a standard routine, students are invited to an interview with a school nurse after filling out a youth health survey in classroom setting. This health survey comprised, among other subjects, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and questions about suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The results from the interviews and the self-report questionnaires of nearly 4000 first-grade students in secondary education were analyzed. Results: The vast majority of invitations were not followed by any action from the school nurse. Also, the majority of students whose self-report led to an "Attention Subject" for the nurse were not considered to be at risk by the nurse. The self-report of recent suicidal thoughts added to the predictive value of emotional distress as measured by the SDQ and other self-report conclusions. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the additional value of self-reported suicidal thoughts for Dutch preventive practices in youth health care.

AB Background: End-of-life decisions remain controversial. Switzerland, with three main languages shared with surrounding countries and legal suicide assistance, allows exploration of the effects of cultural differences on end-of-life practices within the same legal framework.
   Methods: We conducted a death certificate study on a nationwide continuous random sample of Swiss residents. Using an internationally standardized tool, we sent 4998, 2965, and 1000 anonymous questionnaires to certifying physicians in the German-,French-, and Italian-speaking regions.
   Results: The response rates were 63.5%, 51.9%, and 61.7% in the German-, French-, and Italian-speaking regions, respectively. Non-sudden, expected deaths were preceded by medical end-of-life decisions (MELDs) more frequently in the German- than in the French- or Italian-speaking region (82.3% vs. 75.0% and 74.0%, respectively), mainly due to forgoing life-prolonging treatment (70.0%, 59.8%, 57.4%). Prevalence of assisted suicide was similar in the German- and French-speaking regions (1.6%, 1.2%), with no cases reported in the Italian-speaking region. Patient involvement was smaller in the Italian-than in the French- and German-speaking regions (16.0%, 31.2%, 35.6%). Continuous deep sedation was more frequent in the Italian- than in the French- and German-speaking regions (34.4%, 26.9%, 24.5%), and was combined with MELDs in most cases.
   Conclusion: We found differences in MELD prevalence similar to those found between European countries. On an international level, MELDs are comparably frequent in all regions of Switzerland, in line with the greater role given to patient autonomy. Our findings show how cultural contexts and legislation can interact in shaping the prevalence of MELDs.

AB Objectives: To study trends in reporting rates of euthanasia from 1990 to 2005 in relation to whether recommended or nonrecommended drugs were used, and the most important differences between reported and unreported cases in 2005.
   Research Design: Questionnaires were sent to a sample of 6860 physicians who had reported a death in 2005 (response 78%). Previously, 3 similar studies were done at 5-year intervals. The total number of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide cases was estimated using a "gold standard" definition: death was-according to the physician-the result of the use of drugs at the explicit request of the patient with the explicit goal of hastening death (denominator). The Euthanasia Review Committees provided the number of reported cases (numerator).
   Results: The reporting rate of euthanasia and physician-assisted Suicide increased from 18% in 1990, 41% in 1995, and 54% in 2001 to 80% in 2005. The reporting rate in the subgroup of euthanasia with recommended drugs (barbiturates and muscle relaxants) was 73% in 1995, 71% in 2001, and 99% in 2005. The reporting rate of euthanasia with nonrecommended drugs (eg, opioids) was below 3% in 1995, 2001, and 2005. Unreported euthanasia differed also from reported euthanasia in the fact that physicians less often labeled their act as euthanasia.
   Conclusions: Euthanasia with nonrecommended drugs is almost never reported. The total reporting rate increased because of all increase in the use of recommended drugs for euthanasia between 1995 and 2001, and an increase in the reporting rate for euthanasia with recommended drugs between 2001 and 2005.

AB INTRODUCTION: Euthanasia (EU) and/or physician-assisted suicide (PAS) is legal in some countries and being considered in others. Attitudes to EU/PAS among Danish geriatricians were studied.
   METHODS: An online questionnaire with 12 questions was e-mailed to all members of the Danish Geriatric Society.
   RESULTS: The response rate was 46% (120/261). A total of 55.8% (67/120) disagreed that EU is ethically justifiable, whereas 22.5% (27/120) found that EU is justifiable. Furthermore, 13.3% (16/120) agreed that EU should be offered as an alternative to palliative treatment, 73.4% (88/120) disagreed. A total of 64.2% (67/120) disagreed that PAS is ethically justifiable, whereas 19.2% (23/120) found that PAS is justifiable. In all, 15% (18/120) agreed that PAS should be offered as an alternative to palliative treatment, whereas 76.6% (92/120) disagreed. The impact of legalisation of EU/PAS on the relationship between physician and patient was believed to be negative by 62.2% (74/119), positive by 12.6% (15/119) and without implications by 25.2% (30/119). Younger physicians tended to be more positive towards EU/PAS.
   CONCLUSIONS: The majority of Danish geriatricians are opposed to EU and PAS.

ID OF-LIFE PRACTICES; LAW
AB Objectives: To describe and compare current legal procedures for notifying, controlling and evaluating (NCE-procedures) euthanasia in Belgium and the Netherlands, and to discuss the implications for a safe and controllable euthanasia practice.
   Methods: We systematically studied and compared official documents relating to the Belgian and the Dutch NCE-procedures for euthanasia.
   Results: In both countries, physicians are required to notify their cases to a review Committee, stimulating them to safeguard the quality of their euthanasia practice and to make societal control over the practice of euthanasia possible. However, the procedures in both countries differ. The main differences are that the Dutch notification and control procedures are more elaborate and transparent than the Belgian, and that the Belgian procedures are primarily anonymous, whereas the Dutch are not. Societal evaluation is made in both countries through the Committees' summary reports to Parliament.
   Conclusions: Transparent procedures like the Dutch may better facilitate societal control. Informing physicians about the law and the due care requirements for euthanasia, and systematic feedback about their medical actions are both pivotal to achieving efficient societal control and engendering the level of care needed when performing such far-reaching medical acts.

AB Psychoanalytically oriented day hospital therapy, later manualized and named mentalization-based treatment (MBT), has proven to be a (cost-) effective treatment for patients with severe borderline personality disorder and a high degree of psychiatric comorbidity (BPD) in the United Kingdom (UK). As to yet it has not been shown whether manualized day hospital MBT would yield similar results when conducted by an independent institute outside the UK. We investigated the applicability and treatment outcome of 18-month, manualized day hospital MBT in the Netherlands by means of a prospective cohort study with 45 Dutch patients with severe BPD and a high degree of comorbid Axis I and Axis II disorders. Outcomes were assessed each six months. Symptom distress, social and interpersonal functioning, and personality pathology and functioning all improved significantly, with effect sizes between 0.7 and 1.7. Suicide attempts, acts of self-harm, and care consumption were also significantly reduced. The results indicate that MBT can effectively be implemented in an independent treatment institute outside the UK. This study also supports the clinical effectiveness of manualized day hospital MBT in patients with severe BPD and a high degree of psychiatric comorbidity.

ID EUTHANASIA LAW; BELGIUM; NETHERLANDS; SUICIDE
AB Although physician-assisted death (PAD) is established in certain countries, the legality and ethics of this issue have been debated for decades in Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada has now settled the issue of legality nationally, and as a result of the decision in Carter v. Canada, PAD (which includes both physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia) will become legal on February 6, 2016. It is difficult to predict the potential demand for PAD in Canada. This paper highlights other countries' experiences with PAD in order to shed light on this question and to forecast issues that Canadian physicians will face once the change to the law comes into effect. At present, there is no legislative scheme in place to regulate the conduct of PAD. Physicians and their provincial colleges may find themselves acting as the de facto regulators of PAD if a regulatory vacuum persists. With their specialized knowledge of pharmacology and interdisciplinary leadership, anesthesiologists may be called upon to develop protocols for the administration of PAD as well as to administer euthanasia. Canadian anesthesiologists currently have a unique opportunity to consider the complex ethical issues they will face when PAD becomes legal and to contribute to the creation of a regulatory structure that will govern PAD in Canada.

TI Care, Coercion and Dignity at the End of Life
SO STUDIES IN CHRISTIAN ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Dignity; dying; care; coercion; present directives; assisted suicide
AB End-of-life debates in medical ethics often centre around several interrelated issues: improving care, avoiding coercion, and recognising the dignity and rights of the terminally ill. Care ethics advocates relational autonomy and non-abandonment. These commitments, however, face system pressures-economic, social and legal-that can be coercive. This article takes up two related aspects in this domain of ethics. Firstly, that competence and communication are core clinical ethics principles that can sidestep the overplayed dichotomies in end-of-life care. And secondly, it questions the assumption that advance directives are universally benevolent-comparing the provisions of the Council of Europe's 1999 recommendations on protection of human rights and dignity of the dying within the framework of the Irish context. The article also registers the unintended impacts of changing legal frameworks in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide in Europe, including recent proposals in the Netherlands. A focus on human dignity can provide a theologically and philosophically shared normative orientation that argues for present directives rather than only advance directives, and a presumption in favour of 'living up to death'. Dignity approaches not only grant rights but secure them by supporting ongoing initiatives that honour, rather than erode, the 'longevity dividend'.

TI Community care arrangements in the Netherlands
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
AB In several developed countries, the objective is a mental health system dominated by variants of community care arrangements as replacements for hospital. This is also true on the Netherlands. In recent years, several intensive casemanagement projects have been started for chronic psychiatric patients. This article looks at four well-known Dutch projects. All the patients in the four projects are very ill and most of them suffer from schizophrenia. The influence of the new forms of care on everyday problems is slightly positive. The new forms of care are feasible for most chronic patients. On the basis of the data, it cannot be said whether the risk of suicide increases, remains constant or even decreases. In three of the four projects there is a drop in compulsory admissions. In two of the four projects there is a spectacular decrease in number of bed days. In the third project, there is a sharp reduction in the number of bed days when the group is compared with a matched group. No figure could be obtained for the fourth project. The initial impressions are quite positive. But research remains vital, in particular randomised clinical trials which assign a high priority to the specification of target groups and of interventions and which focus more on the relationship between costs and benefits.

AB This paper reports findings from visits to palliative care settings and research units in the UK, Belgium and the Netherlands. The aim was to learn about clinicians' (both nurses and doctors) and academic researchers' understandings and experiences of palliative sedation for managing suffering at the end of life, and their views regarding its clinical, ethical and social implications. The project was linked to two larger studies of technologies used in palliative care. Eleven doctors, 14 nurses and 10 researchers took part in informal interviews. Relevant reports and papers from the academic, clinical and popular press were also collected from the three countries. The study took place in a context in which attention has been drawn towards palliative sedation by the legalisation of euthanasia in the Netherlands and Belgium, and by the reexamination of the legal position on assisted dying in the UK. In this context, palliative sedation has been posited by some as an alternative path of action. We report respondents' views under four headings: understanding and responding to suffering; the relationship between palliative sedation and euthanasia; palliative sedation and artificial hydration; and risks and uncertainties in the clinician-patient/family relationship. We conclude that the three countries can learn from one another about the difficult issues involved in giving compassionate care to those who are suffering immediately before death. Future research should be directed at enabling dialogue between countries: this has already been shown to open the door to the development of improved palliative care and to enhance respect for the different values and histories in each.

AB Background: Educational attainment has been shown to influence access to and quality of health care. However, the influence of educational attainment on decision-making at the end of life with possible or certain life-shortening effect (ELDs ie intensified pain and symptom alleviation, non-treatment decisions, euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide, and life-ending acts without explicit request) is scarcely studied. This paper examines differences between educational groups pertaining to prevalence of ELDs, the decision-making process and end-of-life treatment characteristics.
   Method: We performed a retrospective survey among physicians certifying a large representative sample of Belgian deaths in 2007. Differences between educational groups were adjusted for relevant confounders (age, sex, cause of death and marital status).
   Results: Intensified pain and symptom alleviation and non-treatment decisions are more likely to occur in higher educated than in lower educated patients. These decisions were less likely to be discussed with either patient or family, or with colleague physicians, in lower educated patients. A positive association between education and prevalence of euthanasia/assisted suicide (acts as well as requests) disappeared when adjusting for cause of death. No differences between educational groups were found in the treatment goal in the last week, but higher educated patients were more likely to receive opioids in the last day of life.
   Conclusion: There are some important differences and possible inequities between educational groups in end-of-life decision-making in Belgium. Future research should investigate whether the found differences reflect differences in knowledge of and adherence to patient preferences, and indicate a discrepancy in quality of the end of life.

TI Determinants of Public Attitudes towards Euthanasia in Adults and
   Physician-Assisted Death in Neonates in Austria: A National Survey
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article

   INDIVIDUALISM; NETHERLANDS; CARE
AB Background
   Euthanasia remains a controversial topic in both public discourses and legislation. Although some determinants of acceptance of euthanasia and physician-assisted death have been identified in previous studies, there is still a shortage of information whether different forms of euthanasia are supported by the same or different sub-populations and whether authoritarian personality dispositions are linked to attitudes towards euthanasia.
   Methods
   A large, representative face-to-face survey was conducted in Austria in 2014 (n = 1,971). Respondents faced three scenarios of euthanasia and one of physician assisted death differing regarding the level of specificity, voluntariness and subject, requiring either approval or rejection: (1) abstract description of euthanasia, (2) abstract description of physician-assisted suicide, (3) the case of euthanasia of a terminally-ill 79-year old cancer patient, and (4) the case of non-voluntary, physician assisted death of a severely disabled or ill neonate. A number of potential determinants for rejection ordered in three categories (socio-demographic, personal experience, orientations) including authoritarianism were tested via multiple logistic regression analyses.
   Results
   Rejection was highest in the case of the neonate (69%) and lowest for the case of the older cancer patient (35%). A consistent negative impact of religiosity on the acceptance across all scenarios and differential effects for socio-economic status, area of residence, religious confession, liberalism, and authoritarianism were found. Individuals with a stronger authoritarian personality disposition were more likely to reject physician-assisted suicide for adults but at the same time also more likely to approve of physician-assisted death of a disabled neonate.
   Conclusion

AB The recent practice in Belgium and the Netherlands of accepting addiction as a reason for performing euthanasia raises important issues for the field of addiction and the practice of euthanasia. In this paper we outline some of these issues. We also argue that physicians making decisions about whether to accept requests for euthanasia from people with an allegedly untreatable addiction should consider two issues carefully. They should ensure that: (1) the person has the capacity to give free and informed consent to undergo euthanasia; and (2) their request is the outcome of a deliberative process in which all reasonable treatment options and harm reduction measures have been offered to and considered by the person.

AB This article provides a critical analysis of Dutch euthanasia policy and practice. The research benefited from twenty-eight interviews conducted in the Netherlands during the summer of 1999 with some of the leading figures who dictate the decision-making process and take an active part in the debates. The discussion begins with a review of the two major Dutch reports on euthanasia and the conflicting views and interpretations offered by the literature. Next, I provide some data about the interviews, and then analysis indicating that the Dutch Guidelines on the policy and practice of euthanasia do not provide ample mechanisms against abuse. I argue that the Dutch Guidelines are insufficient, do not provide adequate control over the practice of euthanasia, and that the entire policy should be revised and made more coherent and more comprehensive.

TI Oral medical assistance in dying (MAiD): informing practice to enhance

LA English
DT Article
ID EUTHANASIA; ATTITUDES; SUICIDE
AB The legislation Bill C-14 legalized medical assistance in dying (MAiD) in Canada. After thorough assessments of eligibility by two clinicians, Bill C-14 allows for both intravenous-assisted death by a clinician (euthanasia) and prescription of oral medication for self-administration (assisted suicide). Nevertheless, since inception in June 2016, intravenous euthanasia is the main form of delivery of assisted death in Canada. The reasons why oral MAiD is underutilized in Canada are multifactorial. Currently, there is no consensus on either the medications or the protocols for oral administration, nor a comprehensive understanding of the potential side effects and complications associated with different regimens. The quality of evidence for optimal MAiD medications is low, so any suggested recommendations can only be informed by the global but generally anecdotal experience. The challenges for implementing oral MAiD in Canada include a need to enhance clinician comfort in prescribing oral medications as an alternative to intravenous administration. The goals for ideal oral MAiD medications are 100% effectiveness and minimal side effects, while ensuring that the needed dose is both palatable and deliverable in a tolerable oral volume. The Netherlands has the most experience worldwide and barbiturates have emerged as the most common, efficacious, and tolerable agents by patients. Based on this global experience and the over-arching goals for oral MAiD, we recommend the use of a secobarbital suspension combined with antiemetic prophylaxis.

AB Objective: Obtaining in-depth information from both patient and physician perspectives about what happens after a request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (EAS) is refused.
   Methods: In-depth interviews with nine patients whose EAS request was refused and seven physicians of these patients, and with three relatives of patients who had died after a request was refused and four physicians of these patients. Interviews were conducted at least 6 months after the refusal.
   Results: A wish to die remained in all patients after refusal, although it sometimes diminished. In most cases patient and physician stopped discussing this wish, and none of the physicians had discussed plans for the future with the patient or evaluated the patient's situation after their refusal. Physicians were aware of patients' continued wish to die.
   Conclusions: Patients who are refused EAS may subsequently be silent about a wish to die without abandoning it. Open communication about wishes to die is important, even outside the context of EAS, because if people feel unable to talk about them, their quality of life may be further diminished.
   Practice implications: Follow up appointments after refusal could give patients the opportunity to discuss their feelings and physicians to support them. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigates attitudes and practices of community pharmacists with respect to physician-assisted death. Between 15 February and 15 April 2002, we sent anonymous mail questionnaires to 660 community pharmacists in the eastern province of Flanders, Belgium. The response rate was 54% (n=359). Most of the pharmacists who responded felt that patients have the right to end their own life (73%), and that under certain conditions physicians may assist the patient in dying (euthanasia: 84%; physician-assisted suicide: 61%). Under the prevailing restrictive legislation, a quarter of the pharmacists were willing to dispense lethal drugs for euthanasia versus 86% if it were legalized, but only after being well informed by the physician. The respondents favour guidelines for pharmacists drafted by their own professional organizations (95%), and enforced by legislation (90%) to ensure careful end-of-life practice. Over the last two years, 7.3% of the responding pharmacists have received a medical prescription for lethal drugs and 6.4% have actually dispensed them. So we can conclude that community pharmacists in East Flanders were not adverse to physician-assisted death, but their cooperation in dispensing lethal drugs was conditional on clinical information about the specific case and on protection by laws and professional guidelines.

AB Purpose of the Study: This study aims to contribute an alternative understanding of the position of older people in the euthanasia and assisted suicide (EU/AS) debate.
   Design and Methods: Seven interviews were analyzed using Foucauldian discourse analysis, to explore concepts like knowledge, power, subjectification and surveillance.
   Results: The participants presented a "confused and conflicted" discourse, expressing the view that EU/AS is a family affair, whilst also articulating a strong sense of self-determination. Although a discourse of the medicalization of dying through medical control and surveillance was endorsed, an alternative discourse of "dying outside the medical gaze" emerged. Participants, who were in favor of EU/AS, felt "voiceless," as apparent double standards were applied in the debate, and powerful others, for example, physicians and politicians, seemed reluctant to engage. Within an "aged death" discourse, the anticipated dependency on poor care from (professional) others, made participants consider EU/AS as ways of avoiding this stage of life and the associated loss of dignity.
   Implications: By using Foucauldian discourse analysis, alternative power relationships were revealed which might give a different interpretation to the concept of the "slippery slope." Societal discourses and related behaviors, which devalue the dependent and old, might become internalized by older people, leading them to consider EU/AS as preferable end-of-life options.

AB In the Netherlands, there has been much debate on the question whether elderly people over 70 who are tired of life and who consider their life to be completed, should have legal options to ask for assisted dying. So far there has been little research into the experiences of these elderly people. In order to develop deliberate policy and care that targets this group of elderly people, it is necessary to understand their lifeworld. The aim of this paper is to describe the phenomenon 'life is completed and no longer worth living' from a lifeworld perspective, as it is lived and experienced by elderly people. Between April to December 2013, we conducted 25 in-depth interviews. A reflective lifeworld research design, drawing on the phenomenological tradition, was used during the data gathering and data analysis. The essential meaning of the phenomenon is understood as 'a tangle of inability and unwillingness to connect to one's actual life', characterized by a permanently lived tension: daily experiences seem incompatible with people's expectations of life and their idea of whom they are. While feeling more and more disconnected to life, a yearning desire to end life is strengthened. The experience is further explicated in its five constituents: I) a sense of aching loneliness; 2) the pain of not mattering; 3) the inability to express oneself; 4) multidimensional tiredness; and 5) a sense of aversion towards feared dependence. This article provides evocative and empathic lifeworld descriptions contributing to a deeper understanding of these elderly people and raises questions about a close association between death wishes and depression in this sample.

   Method: Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out from data collected among 1.000 general practitioners, oncologists, neurologists and HIV specialists (French cross-sectional. survey on palliative care, 2002).
   Results: 42.5% of physicians agreed with the statement that euthanasia should be, legalized as it is already the case in the Netherlands. Inadequate prescription of morphine and calling terminal sedation as active euthanasia were associated with a favorable opinion toward legalization of euthanasia.

AB There has been a debate in appropriateness of legalization of death with dignity and euthanasia in Japan. To clarify views about these issues, we conducted a large nationwide study of the bereaved whose family member died at palliative care units. The percentages of 429 bereaved family members (response rate 65%) who affirmed legal authorization were 52 for death with dignity and 45 for euthanasia and who affirmed assignment at the discretion of the physician involved were 37 for death with dignity and 38 for euthanasia. In conclusion, views about legalization of death with dignity and euthanasia among the bereaved are inconsistent. No consensus is reached as to legislation of these issues.

TI 'Setting a principled boundary'?: Euthanasia as a response to 'life
   fatigue'
SO BIOETHICS
LA English
DT Article
DE euthanasia; Netherlands; autonomy; beneficence; slippery slope
AB The Dutch case of Brongersma presents novel challenges to the definition and evaluation of voluntary euthanasia since it involved a doctor assisting the suicide of an individual who was (merely?) 'tired of life'. Legal officials had called on the courts to 'set a principled boundary', excluding such cases from the scope of permissible voluntary euthanasia, but they arguably failed. This failure is explicable, however, since the case seems justifiable by reference to the two major principles in favour of that practice, respect for autonomy and beneficence. Ultimately, it will be argued that those proponents of voluntary euthanasia who are wary of its use in such circumstances may need to draw upon 'practical' objections, in order to erect an otherwise arbitrary perimeter. Furthermore, it will be suggested that the issues raised by the case are not peculiarly Dutch in nature and that, therefore, there are lessons here for other jurisdictions too.

AB In the United States, different people have different rights to die. This Article traces the origins of death-sentenced prisoners' ability to enlist assistance in dying and compares it to the considerably more circumscribed right held by people with serious illness. It uses empirical research on "volunteers," death-sentenced prisoners who sought execution, to argue that the legal standard for adjudicating their requests to hasten execution should be changed. Empirical evidence suggests many of the concerns governing the regulation of assisted dying in the medical context are present in the death row case. This Article therefore urges courts to use a balancing test comparable to that developed in cases involving assisted dying in the medical context. Further, counsel should be appointed to articulate the state's interests in subjecting the conviction and sentence to appellate review.

AB The nursing profession in Germany is facing a public debate on legal and ethical questions concerning euthanasia on request and physician-assisted suicide. However, it seems questionable if the profession itself, individual nurses or the professional associations are prepared to be involved in such a public debate. To understand this hesitation, the present situation is considered in the light of the tradition and history of professional care in Germany. Obedience to medical as well as to religious authorities was long part of nurses' professional identity, but is no longer relevant. The lack of reflection and discussion on how to take a balanced view of ethical and political questions concerning nursing, and the role and responsibility of nurses in end-of-life decisions and situations of caring for dying people are discussed using the situation of nurses in the Netherlands as a comparison.

ID CARE ARRANGEMENTS; CASE-MANAGEMENT
AB In Amsterdam in the Netherlands, in 1993, an intensive case management project, was initiated. This article describes this well-known Dutch project as it was tested in a randomised clinical trial using regular outpatient and inpatient care as the control conditions. All the patients in this project are very ill and most of them suffer from schizophrenia. The new form of care has the same effect on everyday problems as regular care. The basis of this data is too narrow for the drawing of conclusions about the risk of suicide. Longer follow-up would be advisable in order to improve our understanding of this problem. There has been no drop in compulsory admissions. On the other hand, there has been a spectacular decrease in the number of bed days (a reduction of 66% in the second year of the ACT programme).

AB Introduction: When evaluating gender differences in mental disorders and suicidality, specifically between European countries, studies are sparse and frequently hindered by methodological issues, such as the limited items evaluated and inconsistent sampling designs.
   Methods: In ten European countries participating in the World Mental Health Survey Initiative, lifetime internalizing and externalizing disorders and suicidality were assessed among 37,289 respondents. Disorders were classified using DMS-IV criteria. Odds ratios (OR) for gender differences were calculated using logistic regression, while trends across age groups were tested via gender x age interaction.
   Results: Within countries, prevalence of any lifetime internalizing disorder ranged from 10.8% to 44.5% among women and 5.9% to 26.5% among men, with women having consistently higher odds than men (OR range: 1.52-2.73). Prevalence of any lifetime externalizing disorders ranged from 02% to 6.6% among vvomen and 2.2% to 22.4% among men, with women having consistently lower odds than men (OR range: 0.05-0.35). Any lifetime suicide attempt was found in 0.8-5.4% of women and 0.3-2.4% of men, showing inconsistent relative gender differences across countries (OR range: 0.77-4.72). Significant effects in gender OR across age groups were not observed for any internalizing disorder or suicide attempt, yet vvere present for any externalizing disorder in France (p=0.01), the Netherlands (p=0.05), and Spain (p = 0.02).
   Limitations: Mental disorders were assessed with the CIDI 3.0 and not psychiatric evaluations. Suicidality does not fully represent more important clinical events, such as suicide mortality.
   Conclusions: Consistent across European countries, internalizing disorders are more Common among women and externalizing disorders among men, whereas gender differences in suicidality varied. (C)2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Reporting of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in the
   Netherlands: descriptive study
SO BMC MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID OF-LIFE DECISIONS; MEDICAL-PRACTICE; OREGON; DEATH; CARE
AB Background: An important principle underlying the Dutch Euthanasia Act is physicians' responsibility to alleviate patients' suffering. The Dutch Act states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the presence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life. To demonstrate their compliance, the Act requires physicians to report euthanasia to a review committee. We studied which arguments Dutch physicians use to substantiate their adherence to the criteria and which aspects attract review committees' attention.
   Methods: We examined 158 files of reported euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide cases that were approved by the review committees. We studied the physicians' reports and the verdicts of the review committees by using a checklist.
   Results: Physicians reported that the patient's request had been well-considered because the patient was clear-headed (65%) and/or had repeated the request several times (23%). Unbearable suffering was often substantiated with physical symptoms (62%), function loss (33%), dependency (28%) or deterioration (15%). In 35%, physicians reported that there had been alternatives to relieve patients' suffering which were refused by the majority. The nature of the relationship with the consultant was sometimes unclear: the consultant was reported to have been an unknown colleague (39%), a known colleague (21%), otherwise (25%), or not clearly specified in the report (24%). Review committees relatively often scrutinized the consultation (41%) and the patient's (unbearable) suffering (32%); they had few questions about possible alternatives (1%).
   Conclusion: Dutch physicians substantiate their adherence to the criteria in a variable way with an emphasis on physical symptoms. The information they provide is in most cases sufficient to enable adequate review. Review committees' control seems to focus on (unbearable) suffering and on procedural issues.

AB Context. - Management of the end of life is a major social issue which was addressed in France by law, on April 22nd 2005. Nevertheless, a debate has emerged within French society about the legalization of euthanasia and/or assisted suicide (E/AS). This issue raises questions for doctors and most especially for anesthetists and intensive care physicians.
   Objective. - To highlight, dispassionately and without dogmatism, key points taken from the published literature and the experience of countries which have legislated for E/AS.
   Results. - The current French law addresses most of the end of life issues an intensive care physician might encounter. It is credited for imposing palliative care when therapies have become senseless and are withdrawn. However, this requirement for palliative care is generally applied too late in the course of a fatal illness. There is a great need for more education and stronger incentives for early action in this area. On the rare occasions when E/AS is requested, either by the patient or their loved-ones, it often results from a failure to consider that treatments have become senseless and conflict with patient's best interest. The implementation of E/AS cannot be reduced to a simple affirmation of the Principle of autonomy. Such procedures present genuine difficulties and the risk of drift.
   Conclusion. - We deliver a message of prudence and caution. Should we address painful end of life and moral suffering issues, by suppressing the subject, i.e. ending the patient's life, when comprehensive palliative care has not first been fully granted to all patients in need of it ?

TI The provision of medical assistance in dying: protocol for a scoping
   review
SO BMJ OPEN
LA English
DT Review
ID NETHERLANDS; EUTHANASIA; SUICIDE
AB Introduction Medical assistance in dying (MAID), a term encompassing both euthanasia and assisted suicide, was decriminalised in Canada in 2015. Although Bill C-14 legislated eligibility criteria under which patients could receive MAID, it did not provide guidance regarding the technical aspects of providing an assisted death. Therefore, we propose a scoping review to map the characteristics of the existing medical literature describing the medications, settings, participants and outcomes of MAID, in order to identify knowledge gaps and areas for future research.
   Methods and analysis We will search electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, PsycINFO), clinical trial registries, conference abstracts, and professional guidelines and recommendations from jurisdictions where MAID is legal, up to June 2017. Eligible report types will include technical summaries, institutional policies, practice surveys, practice guidelines and clinical studies. We will include all descriptions of MAID provision (either euthanasia or assisted suicide) in adults who have provided informed consent for MAID, for any reason, including reports where patients have provided consent to MAID in advance of the development of incapacity (eg, dementia). We will exclude reports in which patients receive involuntary euthanasia (eg, capital punishment). Two independent investigators will screen and select retrieved reports using pilot-tested screening and eligibility forms, and collect data using standardised data collection forms. We will summarise extracted data in tabular format with accompanying descriptive statistics and use narrative format to describe their clinical relevance, identify knowledge gaps and suggest topics for future research.
   Ethics and dissemination This scoping review will map the range and scope of the existing literature on the provision of MAID in jurisdictions where the practice has been decriminalised. The review will be disseminated through conference presentations and publication in a peer-reviewed journal. These results will be useful to clinicians, policy makers and researchers involved with MAID.

TI Perspectives of decision-making in requests for euthanasia: A

AB Background: Euthanasia has been legally performed in the Netherlands since 2002. Respect for patient's autonomy is the underpinning ethical principal. However, patients have no right to euthanasia, and physicians have no obligation to provide it. Although over 3000 cases are conducted per year in the Netherlands, there is little known about how decision-making occurs and no guidance to support this difficult aspect of clinical practice.
   Aim: To explore the decision-making process in cases where patients request euthanasia and understand the different themes relevant to optimise this decision-making process.
   Design: A qualitative thematic analysis of interviews with patients making explicit requests for euthanasia, most-involved relative(s) and treating physician.
   Participants/setting: Thirty-two cases, 31 relatives and 28 treating physicians. Settings were patients' and relatives' homes and physicians' offices.
   Results: Five main themes emerged: (1) initiation of sharing views and values about euthanasia, (2) building relationships as part of the negotiation, (3) fulfilling legal requirements, (4) detailed work of preparing and performing euthanasia and (5) aftercare and closing.
   Conclusions: A patient's request for euthanasia entails a complex process that demands emotional work by all participants. It is characterised by an intensive period of sharing information, relationship building and negotiation in order to reach agreement. We hypothesise that making decisions about euthanasia demands a proactive approach towards participants' preferences and values regarding end of life, towards the needs of relatives, towards the burden placed on physicians and a careful attention to shared decision-making. Future research should address the communicational skills professionals require for such complex decision-making.

AB Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is known to improve quality of life and to prolong survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. However, little is known about the circumstances of dying in ventilated ALS patients. In the light of the debate on legalizing euthanasia it is important to provide empirical data about the process of dying in these patients. In a structured interview, 29 family caregivers of deceased ALS patients were asked about their own and the patient's attitude toward physician-assisted suicide (PAS) and euthanasia, circumstances of dying, and the use of palliative medication. Quantitative and qualitative content analysis was performed on the data. Non-recurring suicidal thoughts were reported by five patients. Three patients and seven relatives had thought about PAS. Seventeen caregivers described the patients' death as "peaceful", while choking was reported in six bulbar patients. In final stages of dying, the general practitioner (GP) was involved in the treatment of 10 patients, with palliative medication including sedatives and opiates being administered in eight cases. In conclusion, in contrast to the Netherlands, where 20% of terminal ALS patients die from PAS or euthanasia, only a small minority of our patients seems to have thought about PAS. The legal situation in Germany (where euthanasia is illegal), a bias due to the selection of NIV patients as well as a high percentage of religious patients and those with good levels of social support from family and friends, might account for this. Most of our patients died peacefully at home from carbon dioxide narcosis, but choking was described in some bulbar patients. Thus, palliative care, especially the use of opiates, anxiolytics and sedatives should be optimized, and the involvement of GP should be strongly encouraged, especially in bulbar patients.

AB BackgroundSuicide is a major public health problem, and it remains unclear which processes link suicidal ideation and plans to the act of suicide. Growing evidence shows that the majority of suicidal patients diagnosed with major depression or bipolar disorder report repetitive suicide-related images and thoughts (suicidal intrusions). Various studies showed that vividness of negative as well as positive intrusive images may be reduced by dual task (e.g. eye movements) interventions taxing the working memory. We propose that a dual task intervention may also reduce frequency and intensity of suicidal imagery and may be crucial in preventing the transition from suicidal ideation and planning to actual suicidal behaviour. This study aims a) to evaluate the effectiveness of an Eye Movement Dual Task (EMDT) add-on intervention targeting suicidal imagery in depressed patients, b) to explore the role of potential moderators and mediators in explaining the effect of EMDT, and c) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of EMDT.MethodsWe will conduct a multi-center randomized clinical trial (RCT) evaluating the effects of EMDT in combination with usual care (n=45) compared to usual care alone (n=45). Participants will fill in multiple online batteries of self-report questionnaires as well as complete a semi-structured interview (Intrusion Interview), and online computer tasks. The primary outcome is the frequency and intrusiveness of suicidal imagery. Furthermore, the vividness, emotionality, and content of the suicidal intrusions are evaluated; secondary outcomes include: suicidal behaviour and suicidal ideation, severity of depression, psychological symptoms, rumination, and hopelessness. Finally, potential moderators and mediators are assessed.DiscussionIf proven effective, EMDT can be added to regular treatment to reduce the frequency and vividness of suicidal imagery.Trial registrationThe study has been registered on October 17th, 2018 at the Netherlands Trial Register, part of the Dutch Cochrane Centre (NTR7563).

AB Objective. To describe a method for identification, classification and assessment of maternal deaths in Denmark and to identify substandard care. Design. Register study and case audit based on data from the Registers of the Danish Medical Health Board, death certificates and hospital records. Setting. Denmark 2002-2006. Population. Women who died during a pregnancy or within 42 days after a pregnancy. Methods. Maternal deaths were identified by notification from maternity wards and data from the Danish National Board of Health. A national audit committee assessed hospital records of direct and indirect deaths. Main outcome measures. Maternal mortality ratio, causes of death and suboptimal care. Results. In the study period, 26 women died during pregnancy or within 42 days from direct or indirect causes, leading to a maternal mortality ratio of 8.0/100,000 live births. Causes of death were cardiac disease, thromboembolism, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, Streptococcus A infections, suicide, amniotic fluid embolism, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, asthma and diabetes. Conclusion. Our method proved valid and can be used for future research. Causes of death could be identified and learning points from the assessments could form the basis of focused education and guidelines. Future complementary 'near miss' studies and cooperation with other countries with comparable health systems are expected to improve the benefits of the enquiries, contributing to improved management of life-threatening conditions in pregnancy and childbirth.

ID UNITED-STATES; NETHERLANDS
AB Objective-Consultation of another physician is an important method of review of the practice of euthanasia. For the project "support and consultation in euthanasia in Amsterdam" which is aimed at professionalising consultation, a protocol for consultation was developed to support the general practitioners who were going to work as consultants and to ensure uniformity.
   Participants-Ten experts (including general practitioners who were experienced in euthanasia and consultation, a psychiatrist, a social geriatrician, a professor in health law and a public prosecutor) and the general practitioners who were going to use the protocol.
   Evidence-There is limited literature on consultation: discursive articles and empirical studies describing the practice of euthanasia.
   Consensus-An initial draft on the basis of the literature was commented on by the experts and general practitioners in two rounds. Finally, the protocol was amended after it had been used during the training of consultants.
   Conclusions-The protocol differentiates between steps that are necessary in a consultation and steps that are recommended, Guidelines about four important aspects of consultation were given: independence, expertise, tasks and judgment of the consultant. In 97% of 109 consultations in which the protocol was used the consultant considered the protocol to be useful to a greater or lesser extent. Although this protocol was developed locally, it also employs universal principles. Therefore it can be of use in the development of consultation elsewhere.

AB Dutch national LGBT policies are not bi-inclusive and this study provides suggestions for improvement, based on empirical research. Attention for bisexuality in policy appears simply to pay lip service and to endorse the construction of sexual orientation as a hetero/homo binary. The outcomes of our survey (n = 1449) and in-depth interviews (n = 38) of Dutch same-sex attracted young people suggest that special attention for bisexual people is warranted. Compared to exclusively same-sex attracted participants, the equally both-sex attracted participants scored worse on openness about their sexual attraction, visibility discomfort, perceived acceptance, and suicide attempts. Unique issues for bisexual-identified young people were identified as follows: marginalization of bisexuality; difficulty expressing bisexuality, particularly in relationships; and a lack of bisexual or bi-inclusive communities. These issues were all related to the hetero/homo binary and mononormativity. Suggested implications for more bi-inclusive policies focus on awareness of marginalization and invisibility of bisexuality, biphobia, community and capacity building, and comprehensive sexuality and gender education. Furthermore, rather than policies focusing on sameness, a comprehensive diversity perspective on sexuality and gender offers more space for bisexuality. This may be particularly relevant for young people who are exploring their sexuality and developing a sense of their sexual self.

AB BackgroundAssisted death and dementia is a controversial topic that, in recent years, has been subject to considerable clinical, ethical and political debate.
   ObjectiveThis paper reviews the international literature on attitudes towards assisted dying in dementia and considers the factors associated with these.
   DesignA systematic literature search was conducted in Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Excerpta Medica Database, PsychINFO and Web of Science between 1992 and August 2013. Electronic and hand searches identified 118 potential relevant studies. Eighteen studies met the full inclusion criteria and were screened using a quality assessment tool.
   ResultsHealth professionals hold more restrictive views towards assisted dying, which appear less affected by their cultural background, than the public, patients and carers. However, opinions within each population vary according to dementia severity and issues of capacity, as well as differing according to factors such as age, ethnicity, gender and religion of those surveyed. There also appears to be a trend towards more accepting attitudes over time.
   ConclusionsSociodemographic factors can influence attitudes towards assisted dying. The impact of these, however, may also differ according to the population surveyed. The findings from this review can contribute to current debates and inform clinical practice and future research in this area. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Previous research on the impact of parental loss on labor market outcomes in adulthood has often suffered from low sample sizes. To generate further insights into the long-term consequences of parental death, I use the Historical Sample of the Netherlands (HSN). The HSN contains occupational information on life courses of a sample of more than 8,000 males and almost 7,000 females born between 1850 and 1922, a period of important labor market transformations. Roughly 20 % of the sample population experienced parental death before age 16. Linear regression models show that maternal loss is significantly associated with lower occupational position in adulthood for both men and women, which points to the crucial importance of maternal care in childhood for socioeconomic outcomes in later life. This interpretation is supported by the finding that a stepmother's entry into the family is positively related with sons' occupational position later in life. In contrast to expectations, the loss of economic resources related to the father's death is generally not associated with lower status attainment in adulthood for men or for women. The results indicate, however, that the negative consequences of paternal death on men's socioeconomic outcomes decreased over time, illustrating the complex interaction between individual life courses and surrounding labor market transformations.

TI Legalising physician-assisted suicide in South Africa: Should it even be
   considered?
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOETHICS AND LAW
LA English
DT Article
ID EUTHANASIA; ETHICS
AB For many years, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) have been topics that no one dared to mention. However, over the past few decades, the subject has emerged as a very pertinent issue around the world, for a number of reasons - so much so that these life-ending practices have already been legalised or decriminalised in some developed countries, such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, and within certain states of the USA. In the states and countries where the practices have been legalised, or at least decriminalised, the effects of the legalisation have been relatively well documented. On the other hand, in countries like South Africa (SA), where they are illegal, whether or not they should be legalised (taking into consideration all the associated benefits and consequences) should be discussed, and a consensus reached, sooner rather than later. A consensus regarding the feasibility of legalising euthanasia and/or PAS in SA is needed because these practices (or mere requests for them) are becoming increasingly common, especially among people with terminal illnesses. Furthermore, the relative ease with which patients who desperately seek to end their life through either of the aforementioned methods, and are able to access them - by applying for them in countries where the pertinent laws and regulations are adjudged to be more liberal - is alarming. This highlights the importance and need for each country to set clear laws or parameters (and regulations, where applicable) that relate to these life-ending practices.

AB Adolescents seeking professional help with their gender identity development often present with psychological difficulties. Existing literature on psychological functioning of gender diverse young people is limited and mostly bound to national chart reviews. This study examined the prevalence of psychological functioning and peer relationship problems in adolescents across four European specialist gender services (The Netherlands, Belgium, the UK, and Switzerland), using the Child Behavioural Checklist (CBCL) and the Youth Self-Report (YSR). Differences in psychological functioning and peer relationships were found in gender diverse adolescents across Europe. Overall, emotional and behavioural problems and peer relationship problems were most prevalent in adolescents from the UK, followed by Switzerland and Belgium. The least behavioural and emotional problems and peer relationship problems were reported by adolescents from The Netherlands. Across the four clinics, a similar pattern of gender differences was found. Birth-assigned girls showed more behavioural problems and externalising problems in the clinical range, as reported by their parents. According to self-report, internalising problems in the clinical range were more prevalent in adolescent birth-assigned boys. More research is needed to gain a better understanding of the difference in clinical presentations in gender diverse adolescents and to investigate what contextual factors that may contribute to this.

ID LIFE; END; NETHERLANDS; DECISIONS; DEATH; CARE
AB The basic effort in "regulation of help in dying" is a cultural one. The social and professional energies must above all be directed towards a renovated "organisation of care in dying" that, far from breaking off our relationships, strengthens them. That, besides providing dignity to dying, facilitates "living" it humanely inasmuch as possible, attending to the bio-psycho-socio-emotional (and spiritual) dimension. At the individual level the desire to die rather than to continue living is a drama that requires mobilising the moral effort of everyone, according to the corresponding responsibility for exploring and evaluating the situation in the search for alternative plans. And, at the social level, the fact of not providing an open outcome to those highly exceptional situations (between 01-2%) can be a tragedy But the basic social effort does not lie at the end, in providing or not proving a way out, for a few patients (although the accumulated data for Oregon indicate that there is no slippery slope and in Holland there has been a change of attitude towards a fall in euthanasia facing the rise of the alternative of terminal sedation). The cultural, social, organisational, professional and individual effort from which we will all benefit comes much earlier, and involves changing our paradigm of care in particular at the end of life. Although death is inevitable, dying badly should not be so unavoidable.

AB Aim: In 2002, the Dutch Euthanasia Act came into effect, which made euthanasia available to individuals from the age of 12 and above. The objective of our study was to gain insight into how Dutch paediatricians and other physicians treating children feel about the regulation of physician-assisted dying.
   Methods: We interviewed 63 paediatricians, 125 general practitioners and 208 clinical specialists about their views on physician-assisted dying and the Euthanasia Act.
   Results: Of the paediatricians, 44% agreed with the age limit of 12 years, and 52% agreed with the requirement that parents be involved. Somewhat more than half thought the Act could contribute to the disclosure of end-of-life practices (52%), the quality of the review procedure (61%), careful decision making (54%) and the reporting rate (65%). These percentages were comparable for other physicians. A minority of the physicians in all groups indicated that, with this Act in place, they would be more willing to report such practices. The most optimistic in this respect were the paediatricians, of whom 39% expected such an effect.
   Conclusions: About half of Dutch paediatricians support the Euthanasia Act and expect it to achieve its aims, which is the same percentage as was found for other clinical specialists and general practitioners. However, most physicians do not foresee an increase in willingness to report cases of physician-assisted dying.

AB Objective: Public opinion and professional organisations dominate the euthanasia debate, and there is a need to understand the opinions of people confronted with euthanasia. The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients and their GPs talk about euthanasia, and if so, how they communicate about this.
   Methods: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were held with 20 GPs and 30 of their patients in primary care in the Netherlands, where euthanasia is legalised. The patients had a life expectancy of less than 6 months, and cancer, heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as underlying disease.
   Results: Many patients did not communicate about euthanasia with their GP. Neither the patient nor the GP were clear in formulating their expectations concerning future decision making.
   Conclusion: The initial patient-GP communication consisted of an exchange of opinions about situations in which euthanasia would be desirable. GPs had different opinions about who should initiate communication, and found it difficult to judge the right moment to talk.
   Practice implications: It is essential to pay attention to education in communication about dying and euthanasia and to train the GPs to gain insight in the patient's end-of-life preferences, and to direct care at the best possible quality of life.

AB The government of Quebec (Canada) is poised to adopt a proposition to legalize euthanasia in the form of "Medical Aid in Dying," which presents a new option for end-of-life care. This proposition arouses concerns among palliative care providers. The aim of this article is to provide a palliative care perspective on Quebec's proposition to legalize euthanasia. Based on the epistemological and methodological framework of critical theory, the following three questions are raised: First, in Quebec's current state of the law, is it possible to relieve the suffering of end-of-life patients? Second, can the Quebec proposition to legalize euthanasia in specific circumstances be harmful? Third, is the Quebec proposition on euthanasia compatible with palliative care and social values? In conclusion, recommendations and alternatives to the current Quebec proposition are suggested. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The debate about physician assistance in dying: 40 years of unrivalled

SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS

DT Article
ID VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA; NETHERLANDS; SUICIDE; DIE
AB Some issues in medical ethics have been present throughout the history of medicine, and thus provide us with an opportunity to ascertain: (1) whether there is progress in medical ethics; and (2) what it means to do good medical ethics. One such perennial issue is physician assistance in dying (PAD). This paper provides an account of the PAD debate in this journal over the last 40 years. It concludes that there is some (but limited) progress in the debate. The distinctions, analogies and hypothetical examples have proliferated, as have empirical studies, but very little has changed in terms of the basic arguments. The paper further argues that many of the contributions to the debate fail to engage fully with the concerns people have about the legal introduction of PAD in the healthcare system, perhaps because many of the contributions sit on the borderline between academic analysis and social activism.

AB Terminal sedation continues to fuel debate. When confronted with a patient for whom terminal sedation is considered a possible treatment option, decision making can be difficult. In this paper we focus on the clinical-ethical issues, with an aim to provide clinicians with ways of framing the issue from an ethical point of view. In addition to the clinical-ethical issues, terminal sedation touches upon interesting and complex questions of an essentially philosophical nature. What it means to be a "person" is one such question, and is a topic that is relevant to clinical, daily practice. Accordingly, in the latter part of this paper we draw briefly on selected philosophical positions to elucidate this question. A doctor's belief of what it means to be a "person" might well affect their actions. For example, if a doctor believes terminal sedation involves the destruction of the person, they might not be willing to proceed with it.

AB Purpose of review
   This article reviews evidence about the impact of immigration detention and other restrictive immigration policies on the mental health of children, young people and the adults who care for them. We review the implications of this for clinicians attempting to assess or work with incarcerated child and adult refugees and asylum seekers.
   Recent findings
   There are increasing numbers of adults and children seeking asylum across the globe and many nations use incarceration and other harsh and interceptive immigration practices. There is mounting evidence of the psychological harm associated with detention of already vulnerable adults and children. Australia is used as a case study.
   Summary
   Clinicians are required to consider the intersection of mental health assessment and treatment with human rights violations, and the impact of restrictive immigration policies, not only on asylum seekers and refugees but also on clinicians, clinical practice and professional ethics.

AB This article gives an overview of the nursing ethics arguments on euthanasia in general, and on nurses' involvement in euthanasia in particular, through an argument-based literature review. An in-depth study of these arguments in this literature will enable nurses to engage in the euthanasia debate. We critically appraised 41 publications published between January 1987 and June 2007. Nursing ethics arguments on ( nurses' involvement in) euthanasia are guided primarily by the principles of respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice. Ethical arguments related to the nursing profession are described. From a care perspective, we discuss arguments that evaluate to what degree euthanasia can be considered positively or negatively as a form of good nursing care. Most arguments in the principle-, profession- and care-orientated approaches to nursing ethics are used both pro and contra euthanasia in general, and nurses' involvement in euthanasia in particular.

AB Background: An international discussion about whether or not to legally permit euthanasia and (or) physician assisted suicide (EAS) is ongoing. Unbearable suffering in patients may result in a request for EAS. In the Netherlands EAS is legally permitted, and unbearable suffering is one of the central compulsory criteria. The majority of EAS is performed in cancer patients in the primary care practice. In around one in every seven end-of-life cancer patients dying in the primary care setting EAS is performed. The prevalence of unbearable symptoms and overall unbearable suffering in relationship to explicit requests for EAS was studied in a cohort of end-of-life cancer patients in primary care.
   Methods: A prospective study in primary care cancer patients estimated to die within six months was performed. Every two months suffering was assessed with the State-of-Suffering V (SOS-V). The SOS-V is a comprehensive instrument for quantitative and qualitative assessment of unbearable suffering related to 69 physical, psychological and social symptoms in five domains.
   Results: Out of 148 patients who were asked to participate 76 (51%) entered the study. The studied population were 64 patients who were followed up until death; 27% explicitly requested EAS, which was performed in 8% of the patients. The final interview per patient was analyzed; in four patients the SOS-V was missing. Unbearable symptoms were present in 94% of patients with an explicit request for EAS and in 87% of patients without an explicit request. No differences were found in the prevalence of unbearable suffering for physical, psychological, social and existential symptoms, nor for overall unbearable suffering, between patients who did or who did not explicitly request EAS.
   Conclusions: In a population of end-of-life cancer patients cared for in primary care no differences in unbearable suffering were found between patients with and without explicit requests for EAS. The study raises the question whether unbearable suffering is the dominant motive to request for EAS. Most patients suffered from unbearable symptoms, indicating that the compulsory criterion of unbearable suffering may be met a priori in most end-of-life cancer patients dying at home, whether they request EAS or not.

AB In the context of our investigation, we found information on 432 (76%) of the 569 Jewish dermatologists in Germany. There is evidence that 57 (10%) of the Jewish dermatologists were murdered in concentration camps, 61 (10.7%) died a natural death, 13 (2%) committed suicide, and 25 (4%) survived the Third Reich in Germany. After 1933, 276 (49%) Jewish dermatologists were able to leave Germany; the United States of America was the main destination and 107 (or 41%) emigrated there. A total of 34 (13%) Jewish dermatologists emigrated from Germany to Palestine and 16 to Latin America. Regarding emigration to other European countries, 20 of the Jewish dermatologists from Germany went to Great Britain (including Walter Freudenthal, 1893-1952, and Ernst Sklarz, 1894-1975), and 24 emigrated to other European countries, such as France (Rudolf Mayer, 1895-1962), Sweden (Carl Lennhoff, 1883-1963), and the Netherlands (Otto Schlein, 1895-1944).

TI Dutch criteria of due care for physician-assisted dying in medical
   practice: a physician perspective
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID EUTHANASIA; LIFE
AB Introduction: The Dutch Euthanasia Act (2002) states that euthanasia is not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with the statutory due care criteria. These criteria hold that: there should be a voluntary and well-considered request, the patient's suffering should be unbearable and hopeless, the patient should be informed about their situation, there are no reasonable alternatives, an independent physician should be consulted, and the method should be medically and technically appropriate. This study investigates whether physicians experience problems with these criteria in medical practice.
   Methods: In 2006, questionnaires were sent to a random, stratified sample of 2100 Dutch physicians (response rate: 56%). Physicians were asked about problems in their decision-making related to requests for euthanasia or assisted suicide after enforcement of the 2002 Euthanasia Act.
   Results: Of all physicians who had received a request for euthanasia or assisted suicide (75%), 25% had experienced problems in the decision-making with regard to at least one of the criteria of due care. Physicians who had experienced problems mostly indicated to have had problems related to evaluating whether or not the patient's suffering was unbearable and hopeless (79%) and whether or not the patient's request was voluntary or well considered (58%).
   Discussion: Physicians in The Netherlands most frequently reported problems related to aspects in which they have to evaluate the patient's subjective perspective( s). However, it can be questioned whether placing emphasis on these subjective aspects is an adequate fulfilment of the duties imposed on physicians, as laid down in the Dutch Euthanasia Act.

AB For the past 30 years, the Melbourne urologist Dr Rodney Syme has quietly-and more recently, not-so-quietly-assisted terminally and permanently ill people to die. This paper draws on Syme's recent book, A Good Death: An Argument for Voluntary Euthanasia, to identify and to reflect on some important challenges to what I outline as the traditional account of law, ethics, and end of life decisions. Among the challenges Syme makes to the traditional view is his argument that physicians' intentions are frail and unfairly expose physicians to moral and legal censure. Secondly, Syme argues that physician-assisted dying (PAD) should be framed as a form of palliative care, not as a kind of safety-chute for when palliative care fails. Thirdly, Syme himself is a rare breed: a dissident doctor who has opened himself up for scrutiny and criticism, by reflecting publicly on his experiences at the edge of the law. Syme's career illustrates that prohibition, just like legalization, is a social policy that carries social consequences. The paper acknowledges the variability and idiosyncratic nature of extra-legal physician-assisted dying, and argues that the best way forward is to attempt to weigh the social consequences of both policies. Advocates and opponents of PAD should recognize that both prohibition and legalization involve trade-offs and impose possible costs on patients and on society.

AB Although homophobic verbal victimization has been associated with negative mental health outcomes, little actually is known about its general prevalence and relationship to mental health among adolescents. In addition, the relationship of homophobic name-calling to mental health in gender non-conforming adolescents is not well understood. This study examined the relationship between homophobic verbal victimization and mental health in adolescents, accounting for their sexual orientation and level of gender non-conformity. Survey data was collected from 513 adolescents (ages 11-17) who attended eight schools in and around Amsterdam, the Netherlands; 56.7 % of the participating adolescents were female and 11.1 % reported same-sex attractions. As hypothesized, male adolescents and those with same-sex attractions were more likely to report victimization from homophobic name-calling than were their female and non-same-sex attracted peers. Contrary to expectations, homophobic name-calling was not independently associated with psychological distress after controlling for gender, sexual attractions, gender non-conformity, and other negative treatment by peers. The hypothesis that homophobic name-calling would be more strongly associated with psychological distress in male, same-sex attracted, and gender non-conforming adolescents was also not supported. The results suggest that same-sex attracted and gender non-conforming youth are particularly vulnerable to homophobic name-calling, in the Netherlands as in other contexts, but also that other forms of peer victimization may be more strongly related to mental health.

AB Objectives: To determine the direction and magnitude of participation bias in end-of-life research.
   Methods: Within the framework of a European survey on medical end-of-life decisions, a non-response study was conducted among physicians in Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. People were asked about their attitudes and experiences in the area of medial end-of-life decision. The response rates ranged from 12.8% (Netherlands) to 39.4% (Switzerland). The responders (n = 5403) and the non-responders (n = 866) were compared regarding socio-demographic characteristics, experiences with terminal patients and agreement with attitudes towards "end-of-life decisions". The reasons for non-participation to the study were analyzed.
   Results: Non-response did not cause socio-demographic distortion, but non-responders had statistically significantly fewer terminal patients than responders. Agreement rates were statistically significantly higher among responders than among non-responders for euthanasia, non-treatment decision and life-preserving statements. Neutral answers were statistically significantly more frequent among non-responders than among responders for life-preserving and euthanasia statements. The most commonly mentioned reason for non-participation was "lack of time".
   Conclusion: Non-participation does cause an overestimation of proponents of life-shortening, as well as of life-preserving end-of-life decisions. Non-responders more often have ambiguous attitudes towards end-of-life decisions than responders.

AB BackgroundThe clinical presentation of panic disorder (PD) is known to be highly heterogeneous, complicating research on its etiology, neurobiological pathways, and treatment. None of the attempts to identify PD subtypes have been independently reproduced, rendering the current literature inconclusive.
   MethodsUsing a data-driven, case-centered approach (factor mixture modeling) on a broad range of anxiety symptoms assessed with the Beck anxiety inventory, the present study identifies PD disorder subtypes in a large (n = 658), well-documented mixed-population sample from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), with subtypes being validated and detailed using a variety of clinical characteristics.
   ResultsA three-class, one-factor model proved superior to all other possible models (Bayesian information criterion = 13,200; Lo-Mendel-Rubin = 0.0295; bootstrapped likelihood ratio test 0.0001), with the first class, a cognitive-autonomic subtype, accounting for 29.8%, the second class, the autonomic subtype, for 29.9%, and a third class, the aspecific subtype, for 40.3% of the population. The cognitive-autonomic and autonomic subtypes showed significant differences compared to the aspecific subtype (e.g., comorbidity and suicide attempts) but on severity differed between themselves only.
   ConclusionThree qualitatively different PD subtypes were identified: a severe cognitive-autonomic subtype, a moderate autonomic subtype, and a mild aspecific subtype. Qualitative and quantitative differences were related to severity and clinical properties such as comorbidity, suicide attempts, sleep, and sense of mastery. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In January 2006 the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), a large university hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland, became the first hospital in Switzerland to allow assisted suicide (AS) in exceptional cases within its walls. However, euthanasia is illegal. This decision has posed several ethical and practical dilemmas for the hospital's palliative care consult service. To address these, the team embarked on a formal process of open dialogue amongst its members with the goal of identifying a collective response and position. This process involved meetings every 4 to 6 weeks over the course of 10 months. An iterative process unfolded. One of the principal dilemmas relates to finding a balance between the team's position against AS and the patient's autonomy and the institution's directive. Although all team members expressed opposition to AS, there were mixed opinions as to whether or not the team members should be present during the act if requested so by patients. Some thought this could be misinterpreted as complicity in the act and could send out mixed messages to the public and other health professionals about palliative care. Others felt that the team's commitment to nonabandonment obliged them to be present even if they did not provide the drug or give any advice or assistance. The implications of nonabandonment are explored, as are several other questions such as whether or not the teams are obliged to provide detailed information on AS when requested by patients.

TI Terminal sedation and euthanasia - A comparison of clinical practices

DT Article
ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; NETHERLANDS; REQUESTS; LIFE; END
AB Background: An important issue in the debate about terminal sedation is the extent to which it differs from euthanasia. We studied clinical differences and similarities between both practices in the Netherlands.
   Methods: Personal interviews were held with a nationwide stratified sample of 410 physicians (response rate, 85%) about the most recent cases in which they used terminal sedation, defined as administering drugs to keep the patient continuously in deep sedation or coma until death without giving artificial nutrition or hydration (n = 211), or performed euthanasia, defined as administering a lethal drug at the request of a patient with the explicit intention to hasten death (n = 123). We compared characteristics of the patients, the decision-making process, and medical care of both practices.
   Results: Terminal sedation and euthanasia both mostly concerned patients with cancer. Patients receiving terminal sedation were more often anxious (37%) and confused (24%) than patients receiving euthanasia (15% and 2%, respectively). Euthanasia requests were typically related to loss of dignity and a sense of suffering without improving, whereas requesting terminal sedation was more often related to severe pain. Physicians applying terminal sedation estimated that the patient's life had been shortened by more than 1 week in 27% of cases, compared with 73% in euthanasia cases.
   Conclusions: Terminal sedation and euthanasia both are often applied to address severe suffering in terminally ill patients. However, terminal sedation is typically used to address severe physical and psychological suffering in dying patients, whereas perceived loss of dignity during the last phase of life is a major problem for patients requesting euthanasia.

AB Aim To study the views of people in a largely Muslim country, Kuwait, of the acceptability of a life-ending action such as physician-assisted suicide (PAS).
   Method 330 Kuwaiti university students judged the acceptability of PAS in 36 scenarios composed of all combinations of four factors: the patient's age (35, 60 or 85 years); the level of incurability of the illness (completely incurable vs extremely difficult to cure); the type of suffering (extreme physical pain or complete dependence) and the extent to which the patient requests a life-ending procedure, euthanasia or PAS (no request, some form of request, repeated requests). In all scenarios, the patients were women who were receiving the best possible care. The ratings were subjected to cluster analysis and analyses of variance.
   Results Five clusters were found. For 44%, PAS was always very unacceptable, no matter what the circumstances. For 23%, it was unacceptable, but less so if the patient was older or requested it repeatedly. For 16%, it was unacceptable if the patient was young but was acceptable if the patient was elderly. For 5%, it was unacceptable if the patient had extreme pain but was acceptable if completely dependent. For 11%, it was unacceptable if the patient did not request it but acceptable if she did.
   Conclusion The majority of the Kuwaiti university students opposed PAS either categorically or with a slight variation according to circumstances. Nonetheless, a minority approved of PAS in some cases, particularly when the patient was elderly.

AB Background: The Netherlands is one of the few countries where euthanasia is legal under strict conditions. This study investigates whether Dutch newspaper articles use the term 'euthanasia' according to the legal definition and determines what arguments for and against euthanasia they contain.
   Methods: We did an electronic search of seven Dutch national newspapers between January 2009 and May 2010 and conducted a content analysis.
   Results: Of the 284 articles containing the term 'euthanasia', 24% referred to practices outside the scope of the law, mostly relating to the forgoing of life-prolonging treatments and assistance in suicide by others than physicians. Of the articles with euthanasia as the main topic, 36% described euthanasia in the context of a terminally ill patient, 24% for older persons, 16% for persons with dementia, and 9% for persons with a psychiatric disorder. The most frequent arguments for euthanasia included the importance of self-determination and the fact that euthanasia contributes to a good death. The most frequent arguments opposing euthanasia were that suffering should instead be alleviated by better care, that providing euthanasia can be disturbing, and that society should protect the vulnerable.
   Conclusions: Of the newspaper articles, 24% uses the term 'euthanasia' for practices that are outside the scope of the euthanasia law. Typically, the more unusual cases are discussed. This might lead to misunderstandings between citizens and physicians. Despite the Dutch legalisation of euthanasia, the debate about its acceptability and boundaries is ongoing and both sides of the debate are clearly represented.

AB Objectives: To investigate the views and experiences of British pharmacists in physician-assisted suicide ( PAS) and voluntary active euthanasia (VAE) and to examine whether differences in views were associated with personal characteristics.
   Method: A postal questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of 500 registered pharmacists, with addresses in England or Wales, stratified according to sex and community/hospital working environments.
   Main outcome measure: Pharmacists' reports of their views and experiences of PAS and VAE.
   Results: Completed questionnaires were received from 295 respondents (response rate: 59%). The majority of respondents (83%) reported that at times, a person had the right to choose their own manner of death; 61% and 53% thought that there should be changes in the Law to legalise VAE and PAS, respectively. If it were legal to do so, 63% stated that they would be willing to dispense medication for VAE and 64% for PAS. However, only 45% agreed that the pharmacist should have a role in advising the prescriber on the choice and dose of drugs used. Sex, age, and years registered as a pharmacist were not found to be significantly associated with views on the practices of PAS and VAE. However, pharmacists who reported having a religion were significantly less likely to favour such practices. On comparing the views of community and hospital pharmacists, community pharmacists were significantly less likely than expected to want to be informed about the intended purpose of lethal drugs.
   Conclusion: In this survey, while over half of British pharmacists did not disagree in principle to the legalisation of VAE and/or PAS, they were less supportive of direct involvement in such procedures. Religion was a discriminatory factor associated with negative views of VAE and PAS. The significant minority of pharmacists not wanting to know the purpose of drugs they suspected might be for PAS or VAE is not in accordance with professional accountability, reflecting the complex and sometimes conflicting legal and moral aspects of such practices when deciding upon a course of action.

TI When being 'tired of living' plays an important role in a request for
   euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide: patient characteristics and
   the physician's decision
SO HEALTH POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE 'tired of living'; physician-assisted suicide; request; euthanasia;
   ageing; medicalisation
ID MEDICALISATION; NONDISEASE
AB Background: In the Netherlands physicians are allowed to grant requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (EAS) if they meet several requirements of due care. According to jurisprudence, a physician is not allowed to end the life of a patient whose request for EAS is based on being 'tired of living', because such a request falls outside the medical domain. Our previous studies have shown that in spite of this, such requests are made approximately 400 times a year.
   Objectives: To learn more about patients who request EAS because they are tired of living, and about factors that influence the decision of the physician.
   Design: Questionnaires (n = 4842) completed by general practitioners (n = 3994).
   Results: According to the physicians, 17% of patients who requested EAS were 'tired of living'. Of 139 patients in whose request for EAS being tired of living played a major role, 47% suffered from cancer, 25% suffered from another severe disease and 28% had no severe disease. In all three groups the same three symptoms occurred most frequently, 'feeling bad', 'tired', and 'not active'. Each of these symptoms occurred in more than half of the patients in each group. Most of the requests from patients with cancer were granted, but those from patients who had some other severe disease, or no severe disease at all, were refused. Factors that were related to granting a request were: the presence of unbearable and hopeless suffering, the absence of alternatives, and the absence of depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions: Being tired of living can play a major role in requests for EAS, both in the absence and the presence of a severe disease. The high occurrence of symptoms in the absence of a classifiable severe disease implies that physical symptoms are prevalent in this group of patients, leaving the legal requirement for EAS of 'a medical cause' open to interpretation in the more complex medical practice.

AB In The Netherlands, there has been a continuing public debate about the acceptability and regulatory system for medical decision-making concerning the end of life. We studied attitudes of the Dutch general public towards different types of end-of-life decisions in various situations and compared them to attitudes of physicians.
   Questionnaires were mailed to 1777 members of the Dutch general public (response: 78%). A total of 391 Dutch physicians, including general practitioners, nursing home physicians and clinical specialists, were interviewed in person (response: 81%). In both the survey and physician interviews, questions were asked about attitudes towards active ending of life, terminal sedation, and increasing morphine with premature death as a likely consequence, using hypothetical cases of different patients. By logistic regression analysis, the differences between public and physicians' attitudes were assessed, as well as the associations between attitudes of the general public and their personal characteristics.
   Acceptance of active ending of life at the request of a terminally ill cancer patient was higher among the general public (85%) than among physicians (64%). For physicians, acceptance decreased to 36% for an incompetent adult, 11% for a patient without a serious disease, and 6% for a patient with dementia. For the general public, these percentages were 63%, 37%, and 62%, respectively. Between both groups, no differences were found in acceptance of terminal sedation and increasing morphine. For the general public, determinants of support for active ending of life were being non-religious, lower education, and having a single household.
   Acknowledging the observed differences in appreciation of end-of-life decision-making between the general public and physicians is important in doctor-patient communication and in public debate and policymaking. Continued monitoring of practices and informing the general public and policymakers about the clinical and ethical consequences of different types of end-of-life decisions is important.

AB The current article deals with the ethics and practice of physician-assisted suicide (PAS) and dying. The debate about PAS must take the important legal and ethical context of medical acts at the end of life into consideration, and cannot be examined independently from physicians' duties with respect to care for the terminally ill and dying. The discussion in Germany about active euthanasia, limiting medical intervention at the end of life, patient autonomy, advanced directives, and PAS is not fundamentally different in content and arguments from discussions led in other European countries and the United States. This must be emphasized, since it is occasionally claimed that in Germany a thorough discussion could not be held with the same openness as in other countries due to Germany's recent history. Still, it is worthwhile to portray the debate, which has been held intensively both among experts and the German public, from the German perspective. In general, it can be stated that in Germany debates about questions of medical ethics and bioethics are taking place with relatively large participation of an interested public, as shown, for instance, by the intense recent discussions about the legalisation of advanced directives on June 18 2009, the generation and use of embryonic stem cells in research or the highly difficult challenges for the prioritizing and rationing of scarce resources within the German health care system. Hence, the current article provides some insights into central medical and legal documents and the controversial public debate on the regulation of end-of-life medical care. In conclusion, euthanasia and PAS as practices of direct medical killing or medically assisted killing of vulnerable persons as "due care" is to be strictly rejected. Instead, we propose a more holistically-oriented palliative concept of a compassionate and virtuous doctor-cared dying that is embedded in an ethics of care.

   NATIONAL-SURVEY; END; NETHERLANDS; OPIOIDS; SEDATIVES; COUNTRIES;
   FLANDERS
AB Background: Legalization of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide has been heavily debated in many countries To help inform this debate, we describe the practices of euthanasia and assisted suicide, and the use of life-ending drugs without an explicit request from the patient, in Flanders, Belgium, where euthanasia is legal.
   Methods: We mailed a questionnaire regarding the use of life-ending drugs with or without explicit patient request to physicians who certified a representative sample (n = 6927) of death certificates of patients who died in Flanders between June and November 2007.
   Results: The response rate was 58.4%. Overall, 208 deaths involving the use of life-ending drugs were reported: 142 (weighted prevalence 2.0%) were with an explicit patient request (euthanasia or assisted suicide) and 66 (weighted prevalence 1.8%) were without an explicit request. Eutha-nasia and assisted suicide mostly involved patients less than 80 years of age, those with cancer and those dying at home. Use of life-ending drugs without an explicit request mostly involved patients 80 years of older, those with a disease other than cancer and those in hospital. Of the deaths without an explicit request, the decision was not discussed with the patient in 77.9% of cases. Compared with assisted deaths with the patient's explicit request, those without an explicit request were more likely to have a shorter length of treatment of the terminal illness, to have cure as a goal of treatment in the last week, to have a shorter estimated time by which life was shortened and to involve the administration of opioids.
   Interpretation: Physician-assisted deaths with an explicit patient request (euthanasia and assisted suicide) and with-out an explicit request occurred in different patient groups and under different circumstances Cases without an explicit request often involved patients whose diseases had unpredictable end-off life trajectories. Although opioids were used in most of these cases, misconceptions seem to persist about their actual life-shortening effects.

TI Till Death Do Us Part: The Lived Experience of an Elderly Couple Who
   Chose to End Their Lives by Spousal Self-euthanasia

ID SUICIDE PACTS; ENGLAND; WALES
AB Purpose: This article provides the first qualitative account of spousal self-euthanasia in older people, a previously unexplored phenomenon. It investigates the lived experience of a Dutch elderly couple who strongly wished-and chose-to die together at a self-directed moment, despite not suffering from a life-threatening disease or severe depression. It describes their subjective experiences and considerations prior to their self-chosen death.
   Methods: The case study focuses on the particular experience of one elderly couple (aged above 70) by presenting two personal accounts from an insider perspective. These were analyzed using a thematic existential phenomenological method.
   Results: Spousal self-euthanasia-which in the literature is associated with self-deliverance, self-determination, and a reasonable wish to die-is presented here as related to alienation from one's body and identity, the growing emptiness of life due to loss of activities, and an inability to reconcile oneself with one's changed "being-in-the-world." Their decision to end life is largely based on the anticipatory fear of further deterioration, further losing control, and not being able to control time and manner of death in the future. The couple's agreement to end their lives together, however, held both in an impasse, as their concerns, sense of time and logic differed significantly. In this case, a close relation between having a death wish and severe depression is questioned.
   Implications: This article concludes by outlining the practical implications for professionals working in gerontology and recommends further research on the relation between self-euthanasia and depression in elderly people.

AB To improve identification of child maltreatment, a new policy ('Hague protocol') was implemented in hospitals in The Netherlands, stating that adults attending the hospital emergency department after intimate partner violence, substance abuse or a suicide attempt should be asked whether they care for children. If so, these children are referred to the Reporting Center for Child Abuse and Neglect (RCCAN), for assessment and referrals to support services. An adapted, hospital-based version of this protocol ('Amsterdam protocol') was implemented in another region. Children are identified in the same manner, but, instead of a RCCAN referral, they are referred to the pediatric outpatient department for an assessment, including a physical examination, and referrals to services. We compared results of both protocols to assess how differences between the protocols affect the outcomes on implementation, detection of child maltreatment and referrals to services. Furthermore, we assessed social validity and results of a screening physical examination. We included 212 families from the Amsterdam protocol (cohort study with reports by pediatric staff and parents) and 565 families from the Hague protocol (study of RCCAN records and telephone interviews with parents). We found that the RCCAN identified more maltreatment than pediatric staff (98% versus at least 51%), but referrals to services were similar (82% versus 80% of the total sample) and parents were positive about both interventions. Physical examination revealed signs of maltreatment in 5%. We conclude that, despite the differences, both procedures can serve as suitable methods to identify and refer children at risk for maltreatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: While the new DSM-5 anxious distress specifier is of great clinical importance, no evidence exists for its longitudinal predictive validity for clinical outcomes in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). We examined the longitudinal validity of this specifier and validated it against DSM-IV-based comorbid anxiety disorder diagnoses.
   Methods: Data are from 1,080 patients with current MDD at baseline (September 2004 to February 2007), of which 911 participated in the 2-year follow-up (September 2006 to April 2009). Patients are from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, which is an ongoing longitudinal cohort study, and were sampled from the community, primary care, and outpatient specialized care settings. The specifier was constructed in the existing sample by 5 matching self-report items. Predictive outcomes were 2-year chronicity, time to remission of MDD, and functional disability. Discriminant performance and convergent validity of the specifier were also assessed.
   Results: The specifier was present in 54.2% of the sample. The specifier significantly outperformed anxiety disorders in predicting chronicity (OR = 1.96, P <.001, vs OR = 1.11, P =.49), time to remission of MDD (HR = 0.75, P =.002, vs HR = 0.94, P =.55), and functional disability (B = 10.03, P <.001, vs B = 2.53, P =.07). The specifier significantly discriminated in clinical characteristics, had convergent validity for anxiety characteristics, and poorly overlapped with DSM-IV-based anxiety disorder diagnoses (Cohen. =.09).
   Conclusions: The short anxious distress specifier outperforms DSM-IV-based anxiety disorder diagnoses as a longitudinal predictor for clinical outcomes in patients with MDD.

AB Background A regulatory signal suggested that sertindole was associated with a 10-fold increased risk of death. This observational study aimed to identify deaths and their causes in patients treated with sertindole.
   Methods Sertindole-treated patients in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Hungary, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom were identified and their vital status ascertained. Eventual cause of death and patient and treatment characteristics were ascertained. A nested case-control study compared on-treatment cardiac or unexplained deaths with randomly selected survivors matched on age and gender for potential risk factors.
   Results Eight thousand six hundred eight patients were identified as having initiated treatment with sertindole, for a total 3819 person-years exposure. Thirty-five had died since (all-cause mortality rate 0.92 per 100 person-years exposed). Of these, 15 (43%) had been previously reported to the regulatory authorities. Eight deaths were suicides, of which 2 (25%) had been previously reported; 11 were cardiac deaths, of which 8 (73%) had been reported. On average, patients who died because of cardiac disorders were older, and patients who committed suicide were younger than the other patients who died. The nested case-control study revealed that patients receiving sertindole were at a higher risk of premature cardiac or unexplained death if they had hypertension or other cardiovascular disorders associated with diabetes or metabolic disorder.
   Conclusion Overall and cardiovascular death rates were similar or lower than those observed in premarketing clinical trials. There was a very high reporting rate of all-cause and cardiovascular deaths that could have contributed to the regulatory alert. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The incidence of prostate cancer has dramatically increased worldwide in the past decade, with mortality rates also increasing in many countries. Once prostate cancer is diagnosed, it is important to rapidly begin a treatment regimen that is either potentially curative or impedes disease progression. When the disease is confined to the prostate, it can be cured by radical prostatectomy or irradiation therapy. However, there are no curative therapies for locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic diseases. Clearly, new therapies are needed for these patients. Gene therapy may provide additional therapeutic options with the potential to affect both localized and metastatic disease. Virus-mediated transduction of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene transfer, followed by a course of the prodrug ganciclovir (GCV), so-called suicide gene therapy, has been demonstrated by several investigators. The present in situ gene therapy clinical trial for human prostate cancer demonstrated safety, clinical efficacy, and biological effects of antitumor activity. HSV-tk clinical trials for prostate cancer are also ongoing in Japan, the Netherlands, and Mexico. Currently, numerous preclinical studies have reported immunomodulatory cytokine gene therapy, such as interleukin-2, interleukin-12, B7-1 (CD80), B7-2 (CD86) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Several clinical studies have been approved that potentially will show that these immunomodulatory gene therapies may generate an effective local and systemic antitumor activity and that should provide options for patients with prostate cancer. We review the multiple issues involved in current in situ gene therapy (gene/immunotherapy), its outcome, and future directions for patients with prostate cancer.

AB Objectives Although clinical evidence suggests important differences between unipolar mania and bipolar-I disorder (BP-I), epidemiological data are limited. Combining data from nine population-based studies, we compared subjects with mania (M) or mania with mild depression (Md) to those with BP-I with both manic and depressive episodes with respect to demographic and clinical characteristics in order to highlight differences. Methods Participants were compared for gender, age, age at onset of mania, psychiatric comorbidity, temperament, and family history of mental disorders. Generalized linear mixed models with adjustment for sex and age as well as for each study source were applied. Analyses were performed for the pooled adult and adolescent samples, separately. Results Within the included cohorts, 109 adults and 195 adolescents were diagnosed with M/Md and 323 adults and 182 adolescents with BP-I. In both adult and adolescent samples, there was a male preponderance in M/Md, whereas lifetime generalized anxiety and/panic disorders and suicide attempts were less common in M/Md than in BP-I. Furthermore, adults with mania revealed bulimia/binge eating and drug use disorders less frequently than those with BP-I. Conclusions The significant differences found in gender and comorbidity between mania and BP-I suggest that unipolar mania, despite its low prevalence, should be established as a separate diagnosis both for clinical and research purposes. In clinical settings, the rarer occurrence of suicide attempts, anxiety, and drug use disorders among individuals with unipolar mania may facilitate successful treatment of the disorder and lead to a more favorable course than that of BP-I disorder.

AB The term 'euthanasia' is not clearly defined. Euthanasia is evoked in many aspects of terminal care: interruption of curative treatment at the end of life, palliative care or the act of deliberately provoking death through compassion. A law on 'patients' rights and the end of life', promulgated in France on 22 April 2005, led to changes in the French Code of Public Health. In this work, we have first outlined the key provisions of this law and the changes it has brought, then we have compared current legislation on the subject throughout Europe, where a rapid overview of current practice in terminal patient care revealed four different types of legislation: the first authorizes euthanasia (in the sense of provoking death, if this choice is medically justified), the second legalizes 'assisted suicide', the third, which is sometimes referred to as 'passive euthanasia', consists of the non-administration of life-sustaining treatment and, finally, the fourth prohibits euthanasia in any form whatsoever. In the last section, we have attempted to clarify the as yet indistinct notion of 'euthanasia' in order to determine whether the conception of terminal care in the Law of 22 April 2005 was consistent with that put forward by the philosopher Francis Bacon, who claimed that, 'The physician's role is to relieve pain, not only when such relief can lead to healing, but also when it can proffer a calm and trouble-free death, thus putting an end to the suffering and the agony of death' (modern adaptation of the original quote).

AB Background One of the objectives of medicine is to relieve patients' suffering. As a consequence, it is important to understand patients' perspectives of suffering and their ability to cope. However, there is poor insight into what determines their suffering and their ability to bear it.
   Purpose To explore the constituent elements of suffering of patients who explicitly request euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (EAS) and to better understand unbearable suffering from the patients' perspective.
   Patients and methods A qualitative study using in-depth face-to-face interviews was conducted with 31 patients who had requested EAS. The grounded theory approach was used to analyse the data.
   Results Medical, psycho-emotional, socio-environmental and existential themes contributed to suffering. Especially fatigue, pain, decline, negative feelings, loss of self, fear of future suffering, dependency, loss of autonomy, being worn out, being a burden, loneliness, loss of all that makes life worth living, hopelessness, pointlessness and being tired of living were constituent elements of unbearable suffering. Only patients with a psychiatric (co) diagnosis suffered unbearably all the time.
   Conclusions Unbearable suffering is the outcome of an intensive process that originates in the symptoms of illness and/or ageing. According to patients, hopelessness is an essential element of unbearable suffering. Medical and social elements may cause suffering, but especially when accompanied by psycho-emotional and existential problems suffering will become 'unbearable'. Personality characteristics and biographical aspects greatly influence the burden of suffering. Unbearable suffering can only be understood in the continuum of the patients' perspectives of the past, the present and expectations of the future.

AB Background: withholding or withdrawing artificial administration of food and fluids, especially in incompetent patients, has been the subject of turbulent discussions. Insight into this practice may be useful in the debate, and also in the development of guidelines.
   Objectives: to gain insight into the frequency and circumstances of forgoing artificial administration of food and fluids in nursing homes.
   Design: we sent a written questionnaire to the nursing-home physicians of a stratified sample of 6060 people who died in the Netherlands in 1995, and interviewed a random sample of 74 nursing-home physicians.
   Setting: Dutch nursing homes.
   Main outcome measures: incidence of withholding or withdrawing artificial administration of food, patient characteristics and features of the decision-making process.
   Results: in 23% of deaths in nursing homes, artificial administration of food and fluids were foregone. In two-thirds of cases, life was shortened by 1 week at most. The decision was almost always discussed with competent patients. In the case of incompetent patients, the decision was almost always discussed with the patient's relatives. Frequently mentioned considerations in the decision were: the patient's (presumed) wish, low quality of life, no prospect of improvement and the desire not unnecessarily to prolong life.
   Conclusions: artificial administration of food and fluids is one of the most frequently forgone treatments in nursing homes. In general, the physician involves the patient or the patient's relatives and the nursing staff in the decision-making. In most cases, the nursing-home physicians thought that the decision to forgo artificial administration of food and fluids improved the patient's quality of dying.

AB Objective To obtain more accurate calculations of maternal and pregnancy-related mortality ratios in Sweden from 1988 to 2007 by using information from national registers and death certificates. Design A national register-based study, supplemented by a review of death certificates. Setting Sweden, 1988-2007. Population The deaths of 27 957 women of reproductive age (1549 years). Methods The Swedish Cause of Death Register, Medical Birth Register, and National Patient Register were linked. All women with a diagnosis related to pregnancy in at least one of these registers within 1 year prior to death were identified. Death certificates were reviewed to ascertain maternal deaths. Maternal mortality ratio (the number of maternal deaths/100 000 live births, excluding and including suicides), and pregnancy-related mortality ratio (number of deaths within 42 days after termination of pregnancy, irrespective of cause of death/100 000 live births) were calculated. Main outcome measures Direct and indirect maternal deaths and pregnancy-related deaths. Results The maternal mortality ratio in Sweden, based on the current method of identifying maternal deaths, was 3.6. After linking registers and reviewing death certificates, we identified 64% more maternal deaths, resulting in a ratio of 6.0 (or 6.5 if suicides are included). The pregnancy-related mortality ratio was 7.3. A total of 478 women died within a year after being recorded with a diagnosis related to pregnancy. Conclusions By including the 123 cases of maternal death identified in this study, the mean maternal mortality ratio from 1988 to 2007 was 64% higher than reported to the World Health Organization.

   DISEASE; TURKISH; SUICIDE; ASSOCIATION; ETHNICITY
AB Background: The quality of the healthcare system and its role in influencing mortality of migrant groups can be explored by examining ethnic variations in 'avoidable' mortality. This study investigates the association between the level of mortality from 'avoidable' causes and ethnic origin in the Netherlands and identifies social factors that contribute to this association.
   Methods: Data were obtained from cause of death and population registries in the period 1995 2000. We compared mortality rates for selected 'avoidable' conditions for Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese and Antillean/ Aruban groups to native Dutch.
   Results: We found slightly elevated risk in total 'avoidable' mortality for migrant populations (RR = 1.13). Higher risks of death among migrants were observed from almost all infectious diseases ( most RR > 3.00) and several chronic conditions including asthma, diabetes and cerebro-vascular disorders ( most RR > 1.70). Migrant women experienced a higher risk of death from maternity-related conditions ( RR = 3.37). Surinamese and Antillean/ Aruban population had a higher mortality risk ( RR = 1.65 and 1.31 respectively), while Turkish and Moroccans experienced a lower risk of death ( RR = 0.93 and 0.77 respectively) from all 'avoidable' conditions compared to native Dutch. Control for demographic and socioeconomic factors explained a substantial part of ethnic differences in 'avoidable' mortality.
   Conclusion: Compared to the native Dutch population, total 'avoidable' mortality was slightly elevated for all migrants combined. Mortality risks varied greatly by cause of death and ethnic origin. The substantial differences in mortality for a few 'avoidable' conditions suggest opportunities for quality improvement within specific areas of the healthcare system targeted to disadvantaged groups.

   Netherlands
ID ASSISTED SUICIDE; MEDICAL DECISIONS; EUTHANASIA; DEATH; NATIONWIDE
AB A social constructionist approach is taken to analyse the accounts of experiences of doctors who have provided end of life care, comprising five Dutch doctors and six New Zealand doctors who had not provided physician-assisted death, and five Dutch doctors who had. A core theme of 'commitment' to the patient crossed all interviews and when a request for assisted death was received this theme altered and evolved differently between the groups. All respondents reacted by exploring reasons for the request and offering palliative care. When the request persisted, those who had provided euthanasia entered into a 'contractual commitment', constructing another "vulnerable" self in the negotiations that invited the sympathy of the hearer. This evolved to 'sacrificial commitment' when the physician provided euthanasia despite negative personal psychological effects. Constructing a self who is willing to sacrifice personal comfort to relieve the suffering of another is useful in silencing criticism of actions. The two groups who had not provided euthanasia, intensified their efforts to find an alternative to assisted death in a 'pledged commitment' to the patient, constructing themselves as deeply committed to the patient in an intimate struggle to meet his/her need. While New Zealand doctors denied that euthanasia had ever been an option, some Dutch doctors evolved their commitment to 'potential sacrificial commitment', constructing an open-minded and accepting self, willing to consider euthanasia despite fears of negative personal consequences. The construction of alternative 'selves' in accounts is useful in inviting sympathy and silencing potential criticism of actions that may be construed negatively (because the patient was assisted to die, or because assistance to die was refused).

AB ObjectiveWe previously found that compared with Europe more parents of the USA patients were positive for a mood disorder, and that this was associated with early onset bipolar disorder. Here we examine family history of psychiatric illness in more detail across several generations.MethodsA total of 968 outpatients (average age 41) with bipolar disorder from four sites in the USA and three in the Netherlands and Germany (abbreviated as Europe) gave informed consent and provided detailed demographic and family history information on a patient questionnaire. Family history of psychiatric illness (bipolar disorder, unipolar depression, suicide attempt, alcohol abuse, substance abuse, and other illness) was collected for each parent, four grandparents, siblings, and children.ResultsParents of the probands with bipolar disorder from the USA compared with Europe had a significantly higher incidence of both unipolar and bipolar mood disorders, as well as each of the other psychiatric conditions listed above. With a few exceptions, this burden of psychiatric disorders was also significantly greater in the grandparents, siblings, and children of the USA versus European patients.ConclusionThe increased complexity of psychiatric illness and its occurrence over several generations in the families of patients with bipolar disorder from the USA versus Europe could be contributing to the higher incidence of childhood onsets and greater virulence of illness in the USA compared with Europe. These data are convergent with others suggesting increased both genetic and environmental risk in the USA, but require replication in epidemiologically-derived populations with data based on interviews of the family members.

AB Purpose of the Study: This study aims to further our understanding of the experiences of physicians when discussing physician-assisted dying (PAD) within the context of doctor-patient relationships in various sociolegal settings. Although patients bring up PAD in diverse settings, little is known about how physicians experience these discussions, and such experiences have not been directly compared across countries. Design and Methods: A total of 36 physicians in the Netherlands and the United States (including Oregon) were interviewed using individual semistructured interview guides. Interviews were conducted by a single interviewer, audiotaped, and independently transcribed. Inductive qualitative analysis, aided by NVivo7 software, directed purposive sampling of physicians until saturation was met. Multiple coders in a multidisciplinary team analyzed emerging themes and developed theory. Results: PAD discussions, which ranged from theoretical discussions to actual requests, could be gateways to discussions of other end-of-life issues important to patients and could strengthen doctor-patient relationships. Physicians found discussions to be emotionally intense, but often rewarding. Where PAD was legal, physicians utilized existing criteria to guide communication, and discussions were open and honest with patients and colleagues. Where PAD was illegal, conversations were less explicit, and physicians dealt with requests in relative isolation. In addition, physicians' views of their professional role, patients' rights, and religion influenced both their willingness to have and the content of PAD discussions. Implications: Discussion of PAD is an energy-consuming, yet potentially enriching part of the doctor-patient relationship.

AB Background: Evidence suggests that patients with bipolar disorder from the United States have an earlier age of onset and a more difficult course of illness than those from Germany and the Netherlands. These characteristics were related to a greater family burden of psychiatric illness and the experience of more psychosocial adversity in childhood. We hypothesized that this greater illness burden would extend to the offspring of the US patients.
   Methods: 968 outpatients (average age 41) with bipolar illness gave informed consent for participation in a treatment outcome network and filled out a detailed questionnaire about their illness and family history of illness, including whether their offspring had a diagnosis of depression, bipolar disorder, alcohol or substance abuse, suicide attempt or "other" illness. Of those with children, 356 were from the US and 132 were from Europe.
   Results: Compared to the Europeans, offspring of patients from the US had significantly (p < 0.001) more depression, bipolar disorder, drug abuse, and "other" illnesses. The number of illnesses in the offspring was related to the bipolar parent being from the US, having had childhood adversity, more than 20 prior episodes, and more parental psychiatric illness.
   Conclusions: While the findings are limited by their basis on self report, the distribution of the percentages in the US offspring are similar to those of Axelson et al. (2015) who used direct interviews. The higher burden of illness in the offspring and their in direct progenitors from the US compared to Europe warrant new attempts at better treatment and prevention. (c) 2016 The Authors.

AB Background Deinstitutionalization has been accompanied by a decreasing continuity of care in a number of countries. This study evaluates the effects of the Dutch model for deinstitutionalizing mental health care. Methods Details of users and their use of community- and hospital-based services between 1990 and 1999 were retrieved from the Groningen case register. The time between discharge from the hospital and the first subsequent community-based contact was the primary indicator for changes in continuity of care. Results The total proportion of discharges from hospital-based mental health care followed within 6 months by community-based care increased by 11% due to the improved availability of day treatment and home treatment. In terms of median survival time, aftercare in the years 1998/1999 was delivered more than twice as fast as in the years 1990/1991. Conclusions Study results supported the hypothesis in Dutch deinstitutionalization policy that the continuity of mental health care would benefit as to its longitudinal dimension.

SO PLOS ONE

AB Background
   Co-payments, used to control rising costs of healthcare, may lead to disruption of appropriate outpatient care and to increases in acute crisis treatment or hospital admission in patients with schizophrenia. An abrupt rise in co-payments in 2012 in the Netherlands offered a natural experiment to study the effects of co-payments on continuity of healthcare in schizophrenia.
   Methods
   Retrospective longitudinal registry-based cohort study. Outcome measures were (i) continuity of elective (planned) psychiatric care (outpatient care and/or antipsychotic medication); (ii) acute psychiatric care (crisis treatment and hospital admission); and (iii) somatic care per quarter of the years 2009-2014.
   Results
   10 911 patients with schizophrenia were included. During the six-year follow-up period the level of elective psychiatric outpatient care (-20%); and acute psychiatric care (-37%) decreased. Treatment restricted to antipsychotic medication (without concurrent outpatient psychiatric care) increased (67%). The use of somatic care also increased (24%). Use of acute psychiatric care was highest in quarters when only antipsychotic medication was received. The majority (59%) of patients received continuous elective psychiatric care in 2009-2014. Patients receiving continuous care needed only half the acute psychiatric care needed by patients not in continuous care. On top of these trends time series analysis (ARIMA) showed that the abrupt rise in co-payments from 2012 onwards coincided with significant increases in stand-alone treatment with antipsychotic medication and acute psychiatric care.
   Conclusions
   The use of psychiatric care decreased substantially among a cohort of patients with schizophrenia. The high rise in co-payments from 2012 onwards coincided with significant increases in stand-alone treatment with antipsychotic medication and acute psychiatric care.

AB This population-based study employing after-death interviews with proxies describes older persons' preferences regarding medical care at the end of life. Interviews were held with 270 proxy respondents of 342 deceased persons (age range 59-91) in the Netherlands, The deceased were respondents to the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam. The prevalence of advance directives (ADs), preferences for medical decisions at the end of life (i.e. withholding treatment, physician-assisted suicide euthanasia) and preferences about the focus of treatment in the last week of life (i.e. comfort care versus extending life) were examined. Written ADs were present in 14% of the sample. A quarter had designated a surrogate decision-maker. Co-morbidity and perceived self-efficacy (PSE) were positively associated with ADs. About half the sample had expressed a preference in favour or against one or more medical decisions at the end of life. Predictors positively associated with expressing a preference were co-morbidity, dying from cancer, and PSE. Being religious was negatively associated with expressing a preference. The knowledge of the proxy regarding the older person's preference for the focus of treatment was dependent on the patient's symptom burden as perceived by the proxy. The majority of older persons had died without either an AD, or having expressed preferences for end-of-life care. Stimulating the formulation of ADs may help professionals who work with older people to understand these preferences better, especially in the case of non-cancer patients and those with low PSE.

AB The approach to management of patients with advanced disease and serious illness has been strongly influenced by advances in science and technology, the increasing role of ethics in clinical practice, and the recognition of new rights and social changes. At the present time, decision malting is modulated by ethical and legal considerations. One of the challenges of clinical practice is to maintain the delicate balance between the technical aspects and the humanistic aspects of care. For the resolution of this challenge, this article proposes an ethical and legal framework that considers the goals of care and respects the basic values of autonomy, beneficence, and justice. Ethical and legal principles complement sound medical practice but should never replace it. At all times, clarification of the medical situation, good communication, and information about state of the art treatment proposals are essential. In the context of advanced illness, the most prominent issues relate to decision making, justice, and research.

AB In the context of an European collaborative research project (EURELD), a study on attitudes towards medical end-of-life decisions was conducted among physicians in Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Australia also joined the consortium. A written questionnaire with structured questions was sent to practising physicians from specialties frequently involved in the care of dying patients. 10,139 questionnaires were studied. Response rate was equal to or larger than 50% in all countries except Italy (39%). Apart from general agreement with respect to the alleviation of pain and symptoms with possible life-shortening effect, there was large variation in support-between and within countries-for medical decision that may result in the hastening of death. A principal component factor analysis found that 58% of the variance of the responses is explained by four factors. 'Country' explained the largest part of the variation of the standardized factor scores. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The aims of this study were to obtain information about the characteristics of requests for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (EAS) and to distinguish among different types of situations that can arise between the request and the physician's decision.
   Methods: All general practitioners in 18 of the 23 Dutch general practitioner districts received a written questionnaire in which they were asked to describe the most recent request for EAS they received.
   Results: A total of 3614 general practitioners responded to the questionnaire (response rate, 60%). Of all explicit requests for EAS, 44% resulted in EAS. In the other cases the patient died before the performance (13%) or finalization of the decision making (13%), the patient withdrew the request (13%), or the physician refused the request (12%). Patients' most prominent symptoms were "feeling bad," "tiredness," and "lack of appetite." The most frequently mentioned reasons for requesting EAS were "pointless suffering," "loss of dignity," and "weakness." The patients' situation met the official requirements for accepted practice best in requests that resulted in EAS and least in refused requests. A lesser degree of competence and less unbearable and hopeless suffering had the strongest associations with the refusal of a request.
   Conclusions: The complexity of EAS decision making is reflected in the fact that besides granting and refusing a request, 3 other situations could be distinguished. The decisions physicians make, the reasons they have for their decisions, and the way they arrived at their decisions seem to be based on patient evaluations. Physicians report compliance with the official requirements for accepted practice.

AB Objective: To determine attitudes among surgeons in Australia to assisted death, and the proportion of surgeons who have intentionally hastened death with or without an explicit request.
   Design: Anonymous, cross-sectional, mail-out survey between August and November 1999
   Participants. 683 out of 992 eligible general surgeons (68.9% response rate).
   Main outcome measures: Proportion of respondents answering affirmatively to questions about administering excessive doses of medication with an intention to hasten death.
   Results: 247 respondents (36.2%; 95% Cl, 32.6%-39.9%) reported that, for the purpose of relieving a patient's suffering, they have given drugs in doses that they perceived to be greater than those required to relieve symptoms with the intention of hastening death. More than half of these (139 respondents; 20.4% of all respondents; 95% Cl, 17.4%-23.6%) reported that they had never received an unambiguous request for a lethal dose of medication. Of all respondents, only 36 (5.3%; 95% Cl, 2.9%-6.1%) reported that they had given a bolus lethal injection, or had provided the means to commit suicide, in response to an unambiguous request.
   Conclusions. More than a third of surgeons surveyed reported giving drugs with an intention to hasten death, often in the absence of an explicit request. However, in many instances, this may involve the use of an infusion of analgesics or sedatives, and such actions may be difficult to distinguish from accepted palliative care, except on the basis of the doctor's self-reported intention. Legal and moral distinctions based solely on a doctor's intention are problematic.

AB The main premise of the Royal Dutch Medical Association's (RDMA) guideline on palliative sedation is that palliative sedation, contrary to euthanasia, is normal medical practice. Although we do not deny the ethical distinctions between euthanasia and palliative sedation, we will critically analyse the guideline's argumentation strategy with which euthanasia is demarcated from palliative sedation.
   First, we will analyse the guideline's main premise, which entails that palliative sedation is normal medical treatment. After this, we will critically discuss three crucial propositions of the guideline that are used to support this premise: (1) the patient's life expectancy should not exceed 2 weeks; (2) the aim of the physician should be to relieve suffering and (3) expert consultation is optional. We will conclude that, if inherent problematic aspects of palliative sedation are taken seriously, palliative sedation is less normal than it is now depicted in the guideline.

AB Black and minority ethnic (BME) populations are disproportionately detained in psychiatric hospitals.
   To examine the dangerousness criteria for compulsory court ordered admission to a psychiatric hospital in White and BME persons.
   We examined the psychiatric examinations for court ordered compulsory admissions in 506 White and 299 BME persons from October 2004 until January 2008 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The White and BME groups are compared using Chi-square tests and in case of significant differences with logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, mental disorders and socio-economic background.
   In BME persons, violence towards others and neglect of relatives were more often reasons to request court order admission as compared with Whites (39.8 vs. 25.3%, P < 0.001, respectively, 6.4 vs. 2.4%, P = 0.01). This remained true after adjustment for age, gender, mental disorders and socio-economic background [OR 1.56 (95% CI 1.12-2.18), P = 0.01, respectively; OR 3.08 (95% CI 1.31-7.26), P = 0.01]. The other reasons for a request of court order admission had a similar prevalence in both groups (suicide or self-harm, social decline, severe self-neglect, arousal of aggression of others, danger to the mental health of others, and the general safety of persons and goods).
   Violence towards others and neglect of relatives are more often a reason to request court ordered admission in BME than in White persons. BME patients are more often perceived as potentially dangerous to others.

SO FAMILY PRACTICE

AB Background. In the Netherlands, GPs performed euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (EAS) in similar to 1 of 10 end-of-life cancer patients in their care. Of all explicit requests for EAS directed at GPs, similar to 44% resulted in EAS. However, the suffering of patients who do and do not request EAS has never been studied. An important barrier for such research is the low prevalence of end-of-life cancer patients per practice (on average two/year). We studied whether it is possible to recruit end-of-life cancer patients, following-up for requests for EAS (if any), in an interview study in general practice, whether selection occurred and which were the threats and opportunities to recruitment. Our target was to recruit at least 50 patients.
   Methods. Characteristics of all eligible patients were monitored.
   Results. One in every three eligible patients were recruited by 44 GPs in a 3-year inclusion period, resulting in 64 patients in the interview study with follow-up until death. The prevalence of explicit requests for EAS was higher (27%; P = 0.026) in the interview sample, and the presence of a depressed mood according to the GP was lower (5%; P = 0.013) than in the sample with eligible but not participating patients.
   Conclusions. Recruitment of slightly more than the minimal target number of end-of-life cancer patients in this study in general practice was realized. Monitoring of all eligible patients permitted to evaluate the selection which occurred. Recruitment through GPs who were direct professional colleagues of one of the researchers was a positive recruitment factor.

AB A major issue in the care of terminally ill patients is communication and information provision. This paper reports the extent to which physicians in Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland discuss topics relevant to end of life care with terminally ill patients and their relatives (without first informing the patient), and possible associations between physician-specific characteristics and such discussions. Response rates to the postal survey ranged from 39% to 68% (n = 10139). Physicians in most of the countries except Italy in principle, always' discuss issues related to terminal illness with their patients but not with patients' relatives without first informing the patient, unless the relatives ask. Cross-national differences remained strong after controlling for physician characteristics. The majority of physicians appeared to support the principle of patient-centred care to terminally ill patients, consistent with palliative care philosophy and with the law and/or professional guidelines in most of the countries studied.

AB The euthanasia movement has started as a protest against the growing tendency in medicine to alienate individuals front their own death and dying as well as in search of a better death. However, increasing knowledge and expertise in palliative care have rendered discussion about the introduction of euthanasia unnecessary. Moreover euthanasia appears to be diametrically opposed to the sanctity of life ethics and a contradiction to the ethos of palliative care with its emphasis on active, holistic care and enhancement of quality of life. On the other hand, the more we gain experience in the field of palliative care, the more we realize that pain and suffering have many faces. Manly people agree that palliative care is not able to take away all euthanasia requests. Irrespective of the position we defend euthanasia as a filial option in the context of exhausted palliative care or palliative care as an alternative to euthanasia, further development of palliative care is necessary. We need more extensive research into pain and suffering experience, symptom control and palliative care services.

AB Previous research suggests different crime scene patterns reflect differences in the background characteristics of the offender. However, whether differences in crime scene patterns are related to offender psychopathology remains unclear. We hypothesise that schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depressive illness will each associate to a specific homicide crime scene pattern. Homicide data were obtained from the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness. Our sample comprised 759 homicides committed by offenders in contact with mental health services in the year preceding the offence and with an available psychiatric report. We used joint correspondence analysis to examine patterns between different methods of homicide, circumstances of homicide, victim gender, and victim age groups. Three homicide patterns were identified: male conflict homicide, intimate female homicide, and child homicide. Additionally, each homicide pattern was associated with one or more mental illnesses. Results are discussed in terms of the possible role of psychopathology in offender profiling research.

AB AimsAcute drug overdose, especially with paracetamol, may cause acute liver failure leading to registration for transplantation (ALFT). Population statistics and between-country differences for ALFT related to overdose have been poorly described. The aim of the present study was to evaluate overdose ALFT in the multi-country Study of Acute Liver Transplantation (SALT).
   MethodsAll adult overdose-related ALFT, with or without suicidal intent, in France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK between 2005 and 2007 were identified from liver transplant registries and hospital records. These were compared with whole-country and per capita use of paracetamol.
   ResultsSix hundred cases of ALFT were identified in 52 of 57 eligible transplant centres, of which 114 involved overdose (72 intentional, 10 non-intentional, 32 uncertain). Overdose represented 20% of all-cause ALFT: Ireland 52%, UK 28%, France 18%, the Netherlands 8%, and Italy 1%. Overdose ALFT were mostly females (61%), mean age 33.610.9years. A total of 111 (97%) of the overdoses involved paracetamol. Event rates ranged from one ALFT for 20.7 tons of paracetamol in Ireland, to one for 1074 tons in Italy and one case in 60 million inhabitants over 3years in Italy to one case in 286000 inhabitants per year in Ireland. Per-country event rates for non-overdose ALFT exposed to paracetamol were between 2.5 and 4.0 per million treatment-years sold.
   ConclusionsParacetamol overdose was found to represent one-sixth of all-cause ALFT. There was a 50-fold difference in Europe in the rates of paracetamol overdose ALFT, and a 200-fold difference per million inhabitants.

AB Recent studies have shown increased incidence of non-affective psychotic disorders (NAPD) among ethnic minorities compared to the native population, but not, or less so, in areas with a high own-group proportion. The aim is to investigate this ethnic density effect in Utrecht and whether this effect is due to higher rates of NAPD among Dutch persons in areas with high minority proportions. We also explore the geographical scale at which this effect occurs and the influence of social drift prior to NAPD.
   NAPD cases in the Psychiatric Case Registry Middle Netherlands (N = 2,064) and living in Utrecht during 2000-2009 were analyzed in a Poisson model in relation to both individual-level and district- vs. neighborhood-level characteristics.
   With increasing minority density, especially of the neighborhood, the rate ratios of NAPD significantly decreased among both non-Western (from 2.36 to 1.24) and Western immigrants (from 1.63 to 1.01), in comparison with Dutch persons. This was partly explained by higher rates of NAPD among Dutch persons in areas with high minority density. But there was also a trend to lower NAPD rates among non-Western minorities in these areas (P = 0.074).This trend was significant among Surinamese/Antilleans (P = 0.001) and Moroccans aged 18-30 years (P = 0.046). Among the Dutch, a social drift to minority-dense neighborhoods prior to NAPD registration was found.
   Our findings support the beneficial association with own-group presence at the smaller scale neighborhood level. Findings show also that this association is more pronounced in immigrant vs. native comparisons and is not found within all ethnic groups.

AB Background: Patients with bipolar disorder from the US have more early-onset illness and a greater familial loading for psychiatric problems than those from the Netherlands or Germany (abbreviated here as Europe). We hypothesized that these regional differences in illness burden would extend to the patients siblings.
   Methods: Outpatients with bipolar disorder gave consent for participation in a treatment outcome network and for filling out detailed questionnaires. This included a family history of unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, suicide attempt, alcohol abuse/dependence, drug abuse/dependence, and "other" illness elicited for the patients' grandparents, parents, spouses, offspring, and siblings. Problems in the siblings were examined as a function of parental and grandparental problems and the patients' adverse illness characteristics or poor prognosis factors (PPFs).
   Results: Each problem in the siblings was significantly (p < 0.001) more prevalent in those from the US than in those from Europe. In the US, problems in the parents and grandparents were almost uniformly associated with the same problems in the siblings, and sibling problems were related to the number of PPFs observed in the patients.
   Limitations: Family history was based on patient report.
   Conclusions: Increased familial loading for psychiatric problems extends through 4 generations of patients with bipolar disorder from the US compared to Europe, and appears to "breed true" into the siblings of the patients. In addition to early onset, a variety of PPFs are associated with the burden of psychiatric problems in the patients' siblings and offspring. Greater attention to the multigenerational prevalence of illness in patients from the US is indicated.

TI Advance Directives, Dementia, and Physician-Assisted Death
SO JOURNAL OF LAW MEDICINE & ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Physician-assisted suicide laws in Oregon and Washington require the person's current competency and a prognosis of terminal illness. In The Netherlands voluntariness and unbearable suffering are required for euthanasia. Many people are more concerned about the loss of autonomy and independence in years of severe dementia than about pain and suffering in their last months. To address this concern, people could write advance directives for physician-assisted death in dementia. Should such directives be implemented even though, at the time, the person is no longer competent and would not be either terminally ill or suffering unbearably? We argue that in many cases they should be, and that a sliding scale which considers both autonomy and the capacity for enjoyment provides the best justification for determining when: when written by a previously well-informed and competent person, such a directive gains in authority as the later person's capacities to generate new critical interests and to enjoy life decrease. Such an extension of legalized death assistance is grounded in the same central value of voluntariness that undergirds the current more limited legalization.

AB Little is known about the relative influence of shared and individual perceptions of prison climate on adjustment to incarceration. This study investigated the relationship between prison climate and well-being among a sample of 4,538 adults incarcerated in the Netherlands. Prison climate dimensions were considered both as prison unit-level variables and as individual-level perceptions. Multilevel analysis results showed that most variance for well-being is found at the individual rather than the unit level. This implies that it does not make much of a difference for well-being in which prison unit someone resides. Positive effects of prison climate on well-being were primarily found for individual perceptions of prison climate, rather than for the aggregate unit measures. More research is needed to determine whether this finding holds true in other countries. The findings confirm the importance of disentangling the contribution of prison climate at the individual and group level.

AB Familicide refers to the killing of multiple family members, most commonly the homicide of an intimate partner and at least one child. This study examines the prevalence of familicide in the United States. Second, it explores the relationship between the prevalence of familicide and the prevalence of financial problems in the United States by making use of Supplementary Homicide Reports data and newspaper reports. In the period of 2000-2009, familicide involving an intimate partner and child(ren) occurred approximately 23 times per year. The majority of the perpetrators were male, who committed the offense with a firearm. Familicides involving an intimate partner and child(ren) with financial motives alone occurred 4 to 5 times per year. The results showed that the association between familicide and financial problems is not a straightforward one. Even though correlational analyses suggest a relationship between the two, the prevalence of familicide motivated by financial problems was unrelated to periods of financial downfall. Directions for future research are discussed.

AB In recent years, the European euthanasia debate has become more intense, and the practice was legalized in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. We aimed to determine the current degree of public acceptance of euthanasia across Europe and investigate what factors explain differences.
   Data were derived from the 2008 wave of the European Values Survey (EVS), conducted in 47 European countries (N = 67,786, response rate = 69 %). Acceptance of euthanasia was rated on a 1-10 scale.
   Relatively high acceptance was found in a small cluster of Western European countries, including the three countries that have legalized euthanasia and Denmark, France, Sweden and Spain. In a large part of Europe public acceptance was relatively low to moderate. Comparison with the results of the previous EVS wave (1999) suggests a tendency towards a polarization in Europe, with most of Western Europe becoming more permissive and most of Eastern Europe becoming less permissive.
   There is roughly a West-East division in euthanasia acceptance among the European public, making a pan-European policy approach to the issue difficult.

DE Living Wills/Advance Directives; Neuroethics; Euthanasia
ID QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS; EUTHANASIA; EXPERIENCES; DIRECTIVES; REQUESTS
AB Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) by request and/or based on an advance directive are legal in The Netherlands under strict conditions, thus providing options for patients with Huntington's disease (HD) and other neurodegenerative diseases to stay in control and choose their end of life. HD is an inherited progressive disease characterised by chorea and hypokinesia, psychiatric symptoms and dementia. From a qualitative study based on interviews with 15 physicians experienced in treating HD, several ethical issues emerged. Consideration of these aspects leads to a discussion about the professional role of a physician in relation to the personal autonomy of a patient. Such a discussion can raise awareness that talking about end-of-life wishes with an HD patient is part of the legal, professional and moral responsibility of the physician, and that a letter of intent on behalf of the physician can improve active participation in the process. Discussion of these issues can help to advance the debate on euthanasia and PAS in HD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

AB This chapter reports on the symposium, "Translational neuroscience may inform treatment development for posttraumatic stress disorder" (Chair Leo Sher, M.D., Co-Chair - Alexander Neumeister, M.D.) that was held on June 28, 2009 during the 9th World Congress of Biological Psychiatry (June 28-July 2, 2009, Palace of Congresses (Le Palais des Congres de Paris), Paris, France). Compelling animal and human data indicate that stress compromises neurotrophic functions producing neural atrophy and reducing neuroplasticity resulting in dysfunction in brain circuitry associated with PTSD. This problem has been identified as the most important priority for studies of the neurobiology of PTSD. This symposium was the first translational interdisciplinary attack on this problem, from molecular neuroscience to treatment and targets major gaps in our understanding of the neurobiology, neural circuitry, phenomenology, and treatment of PTSD. Four research works were presented at the symposium: "Early postnatal stress: Impact on neural circuits and relevance to psychophysiology" by Machiko Matsumoto (Japan), "Long term alterations in brain and neurobiology in PTSD" by Eric Vermetten (Netherlands), "Mechanisms of resilience: Lessons from PET imaging" by Alexander Neumeister (USA) and "Neurobiology of suicidal behavior in PTSD and implications for suicide prevention" by Leo Sher (USA).

AB Introduction: With the legalization of active euthanasia in the Netherlands and Belgium in recent years, euthanasia has become a subject of discussion again. It is important that physicians, particularly oncologists express their opinion about euthanasia. The aim of this study was to reveal what pneumologists who worked in oncology clinics thought about euthanasia.
   Materials and Method: A questionnaire was distributed to 110 pneumologists and obtained data were analysed with SPSS.
   Results: The mean age of the pneumologists included in the study was 32.90 +/- 7.01 years. Of the pneumologists, 40.8% were against euthanasia and 46.7% believed that euthanasia was performed in Turkey although it was illegal. Thirty-one point five percent of the pneumologists working in oncology clinics and 14.3% of the pneumologists working in clinics other than oncology clinics faced euthanasia requests.
   Conclusion: The opinions of physicians taking care of terminally ill patients on euthanasia and patient rights are very important. Frequent requests for euthanasia and the physicians' belief that euthanasia is performed secretly in Turkey demonstrate that euthanasia should be discussed openly and attitude and approach towards euthanasia should be investigated.

AB This international comparative study addresses differences between adolescents who engage in deliberate self-harm (DSH) and who receive help following the DSH episode versus those who do not. A standardised self-report questionnaire was completed by Pupils aged 14-17 in Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, The Netherlands, and Norway (n=30532). An act of DSH in the year prior to the study was reported by 1660 participants. Nearly half (48.4%) had not received any help following DSH, 32.8% had received help from their social network only and 18.8% from health services. Except for Hungary, cross-national comparisons revealed remarkably similar findings. Adolescents who had been in contact with health services following DSH reported more often a wish to die, lethal methods, alcohol/drug problems and DSH in the family compared to those who had not. However, those who received no help or help from their social network only were also heavily burdened. (C) 2008 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB Background: This study compares prevalence and types of medical end-of-life decisions between the Dutch-speaking and French-speaking communities of Belgium. This is the first nationwide study that can make these comparisons and the first measurement after implementation of the euthanasia law (2002).
   Methods: We performed a mortality follow-back study in 2005-2006. Data were collected via the nationwide Sentinel Network of General Practitioners, an epidemiological surveillance system representative of all Belgian GPs. Weekly, all GPs reported the medical end-of-life decisions among all non-sudden deaths of patients in their practice. We compared the northern Dutch-speaking (60%) and southern French-speaking communities (40%) controlling for population differences.
   Results: We analysed 1690 non-sudden deaths. An end-of-life decision with possible life-shortening effect was made in 50% of patients in the Dutch-speaking community and 41% of patients in the French-speaking community (OR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.8). Continuous deep sedation until death occurred in 8% and 15% respectively (OR 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4 to 0.7). Community differences regarding the prevalence of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide were not significant.
   Community differences were more present among home/care home than among hospital deaths: non-treatment decisions with explicit life-shortening intention were made more often in the Dutch-speaking than in the French-speaking community settings (OR 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.9); while continuous deep sedation occurred less often in the Dutch-speaking community settings (OR 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.9).
   Conclusion: Even though legal and general healthcare systems are the same for the whole country, there are considerable variations between the communities in type and prevalence of certain end-of-life decisions, even after controlling for population differences.

AB Major depression disorder (MDD) is a complex and chronic disease that ranks fourth as cause of disability worldwide. About 14 million adults in the USA are believed to have MDD, and an estimated 75 % attempt suicide making MDD a major public health problem. Neuroticism has been recognized as an endophenotype of MDD; however, few genome-wide association (GWA) analyses of neuroticism as a quantitative trait have been reported to date. The aim of this study is to identify genome-wide genetic variants affecting neuroticism using a European sample. A linear regression model was used to analyze the association with neuroticism as a continuous trait in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety and Netherlands Twin Registry population-based sample of 2,748 individuals with Perlegen 600K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In addition, the neuroticism-associated genes/loci of the top 20 SNPs (p < 10(-4)) were examined with anti-social personality disorder (ASPD) in an Australian twin family study. Through GWA analysis, 32 neuroticism-associated SNPs (p < 10(-4)) were identified. The most significant association was observed with SNP rs4806846 within the TMPRSS9 gene (p = 7.79 x 10(-6)) at 19p13.3. The next best signal was in GRIN2B gene (rs220549, p = 1.05 x 10(-5)) at 12p12. In addition, several SNPs within GRIN2B showed borderline associations with ASPD in the Australian sample. In conclusion, these results provide a possible genetic basis for the association with neuroticism. Our findings provide a basis for replication in other populations to elucidate the potential role of these genetic variants in neuroticism and MDD along with a possible relationship between ASPD and neuroticism.

AB Objectives Patients with advanced disease sometimes express a wish to hasten death (WTHD). In 2012, we published a systematic review and meta-ethnography of qualitative studies examining the experience and meaning of this phenomenon. Since then, new studies eligible for inclusion have been reported, including in Europe, a region not previously featured, and specifically in countries with different legal frameworks for euthanasia and assisted suicide. The aim of the present study was to update our previous review by including new research and to conduct a new analysis of available data on this topic.
   Setting Eligible studies originated from Australia, Canada, China, Germany, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Thailand and USA.
   Participants Studies of patients with life-threatening conditions that had expressed the WTHD.
   Design The search strategy combined subject terms with free-text searching of PubMed MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL and PsycInfo. The qualitative synthesis followed the methodology described by Noblit and Hare, using the 'adding to and revising the original' model for updating a meta-ethnography, proposed by France et al. Quality assessment was done using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist.
   Results 14 studies involving 255 participants with life-threatening illnesses were identified. Five themes emerged from the analysis: suffering (overarching theme), reasons for and meanings and functions of the WTHD and the experience of a timeline towards dying and death. In the context of advanced disease, the WTHD emerges as a reaction to physical, psychological, social and existential suffering, all of which impacts on the patient's sense of self, of dignity and meaning in life.
   Conclusions The WTHD can hold different meanings for each individual-serving functions other than to communicate a genuine wish to die. Understanding the reasons for, and meanings and functions of, the WTHD is crucial for drawing up and implementing care plans to meet the needs of individual patients.

AB There is a large mortality gap between patients with a nonaffective psychotic disorder and those in the general population, is associated with both natural and nonnatural death causes. Objective: This study aims to assess whether mortality risks vary for different causes of death according to the duration since diagnosis and age in a large sample of patients with nonaffective psychotic! disorder. Methods: Data of patients with nonaffective psychotic disorder ( n = 12,580) from 3 Dutch psychiatric registers were linked to the cause of death register of Statistics Netherlands and compared with personally matched controls ( n = 124,143) from the population register. Death rates were analyzed by duration since the date of the registered diagnosis oldie (matched) patient and their age using a Poisson model. Results: Among patients, the rates of all-cause death decreased with longer illness duration. This was explained by lower suicide rates. For example, among those between 40 and 60 years of age, the rate ratios ( RR) of suicide during 2-5 and > 5 years were 0.52 and 0.46 ( p = 0.002), respectively, when compared with the early years after diagnosis'. Compared with controls, patients experienced higher rates of natural death causes during all stages and in all age categories, rate ratios 2.35-5.04; p < 0.001-0.025. There was no increase in these rate ratios with increasing duration or increasing age for patients when compared with controls. Conclusions: The high risk of natural death causes among patients with nonaffective psychotic disorder is already present at a comparatively young age. This suggests caution in blaming antipsychotics or the accumulating effects of adverse lifestyle factors, for premature death. It is better to proactively monitor and treat somatic problems from the earliest disease stages onward.

AB Background: End-of-life policies are hotly debated in many countries, with international evidence frequently used to support or oppose legal reforms. Existing reviews are limited by their focus on specific practices or selected jurisdictions. The objective is to review international time trends in end-of-life practices.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review of empirical studies on medical end-of-life practices, including treatment withdrawal, the use of drugs for symptom management, and the intentional use of lethal drugs. A search strategy was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Sociological Abstracts, PAIS International, Worldwide Political Science Abstracts, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences and CINAHL. We included studies that described physicians' actual practices and estimated annual frequency at the jurisdictional level. End-of-life practice frequencies were analyzed for variations over time, using logit regression.
   Results: Among 8183 references, 39 jurisdiction-wide surveys conducted between 1990 and 2010 were identified. Of those, 22 surveys used sufficiently similar research methods to allow further statistical analysis. Significant differences were found across surveys in the frequency of treatment withdrawal, use of opiates or sedatives and the intentional use of lethal drugs (X-2 > 1000, p < 0.001 for all). Regression analyses showed increased use of opiates and sedatives over time (p < 0.001), which could reflect more intense symptom management at the end of life, or increase in these drugs to intentionally cause patients' death.
   Conclusion: The use of opiates and sedatives appears to have significantly increased over time between 1990 and 2010. Better distinction between practices with different legal status is required to properly interpret the policy significance of these changes. Research on the effects of public policies should take a comprehensive look at trends in end-of-life practice patterns and their associations with policy changes.

AB Background: Precise knowledge of the epidemiology of suicidality provides necessary information for designing prevention programs. The aims of the present study were to investigate the prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideas and attempts in the general population of Europe.
   Methods: The European Study on the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMED) is a cross-sectional household survey carried out in a probability representative sample of non-institutionalised adults (aged 18 years or older) of six European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain). The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0) was administered to 21,425 individuals.
   Results: Lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation was 7.8% and of suicidal attempts 1.3%. Being women, younger and divorced or widowed were associated with a higher prevalence of suicide ideation and attempts. Psychiatric diagnoses were strongly related to suicidality. Among them, major depressive episode (Rate ratio 2.9 for lifetime ideas and 4.8 for lifetime attempts), dysthymia (RR 2.0 and 1.6), GAD (RR 1.8 and 2.3 for lifetime), PTSD (RR 1.9 and 2.0) and alcohol dependence (RR 1.7 and 2.5) were the most important. Population attributable risks for lifetime suicidal attempt was 28% for major depression.
   Limitations: Information about suicidal ideas and attempts was self reported, psychiatric diagnoses were made using fully structured lay interviews rather than clinician-administered interviews.
   Conclusions: In spite of meaningful country variation in prevalence, risk factors for suicidality are consistent in the European countries. Population prevention programmes should focus on early diagnosis and treatment of major depression and alcohol abuse and in those individuals with recent appearance of suicidal ideas.

AB In many European countries, the last decade has been marked by an increasing debate about the acceptability and regulation'of euthanasia and other end-of-life decisions in medical practice. Growing public sensibility to a 'right to die' for terminally ill patients has been one of the main constituents of these debates. Within this context. we sought to describe and compare acceptance of euthanasia among the general public in 33 European countries. We used the European Values Study data of 1999-2000 with a total of 41 125 respondents (63% response rate) in 33 European countries. The main outcome measure concerned the acceptance of euthanasia (defined as 'terminating the life of the incurably sick', rated on a scale from I to 10).
   Results showed that the acceptance of euthanasia tended to be high in some Countries (e.g. the Netherlands, Denmark, France, Sweden), while a markedly low acceptance was found in others (e.g. Romania. Malta and Turkey). A multivariate ordinal regression showed that weaker religious belief was the most important factor associated with a higher acceptance: however, there were also socio-demographic differences: younger cohorts. people from non-manual social classes, and people with a higher educational level tended to have a higher acceptance of euthanasia. While religious belief. sociodemographic factors, and also moral values (i.e. the belief in the right to self-determination) could largely explain the differences between countries, our findings suggest that perceptions regarding euthanasia are probably also influenced by national traditions and history (e.g. Germany). Thus, we demonstrated clear cross-national differences with regard to the acceptance of euthanasia, which can serve as an important basis for further debate and research in the specific countries.

AB Background
   The Netherlands was the first country in the world to implement a Euthanasia Act in 2002. It is unknown whether legalising euthanasia under strict conditions influences the number and nature of euthanasia requests.
   Aim
   To investigate changes in the number of, and reasons for, requests for euthanasia in Dutch general practice after implementation of the Euthanasia Act.
   Design of study
   Retrospective dynamic cohort study comparing 5 years before (1998-2002) and 5 years after (2003-2007) implementation of the Act.
   Method
   Standardised registration forms were used to collect data on requests for euthanasia via the Dutch Sentinel Practice Network. This network of 45 general practices is nationally representative by age, sex, geographic distribution, and population density.
   Results
   The mean annual incidence of requests before implementation amounted to 3.1/10 000 and thereafter to 2.8/10 000 patients. However, trends differed by sex. The number of requests by males decreased significantly from 3.7/10 000 to 2.6/10 000 (P = 0.008); the requests by females increased non-significantly from 2.6/10 000 to 3.1/10 000. Before and after implementation, cancer remained the major underlying disease for requesting euthanasia: 82% versus 77% for men; 73% versus 75% for females. Pain was a major reason for a request, increasing in the period before implementation (mean 27%), but declining in the period thereafter (mean 22%). Loss of dignity became a less important reason after implementation (from 18% to 10%, P = 0.04), predominantly due to a marked decrease in the number of females citing it as a reason (from 17% to 6%, P = 0.02).
   Conclusion
   There was no increase in demand for euthanasia after implementation of the Euthanasia Act. Pain as a reason for requesting euthanasia showed an increasing trend before implementation, but declined thereafter. Loss of dignity as a reason declined, especially in females.

AB Background: To report lifetime prevalences of suicidal ideation, plans and attempts, as well as risk factors for first onset suicidal behaviours and for the transition from ideation to first onset plan or attempt.
   Methods: Data were used from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 (NEMESIS-2), a nationally representative survey among the general population aged 18-64 years (N = 6646; response rate = 65.1%). Face-to-face interviews were administered between November 2007 and July 2009. Suicidal behaviours and DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0.
   Results: The lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, plan and attempt was 8.3%, 3.0% and 2.2%, respectively. Among ideators, the probability of ever making an attempt was 26.8%. 76.5% of transitions from ideation to attempt occurred within the first year after ideation onset. Risk factors for suicidal behaviours included being female, younger, less educated, having had childhood trauma and a prior mental disorder. The strongest risk factors for the transition from ideation to first onset attempt were characteristics of prior suicidal behaviours, such as an early age of ideation onset and prior plans.
   Limitations: Data were based on retrospective self-reports of mental disorders and suicidal behaviours.
   Conclusions: It is important that health professionals verify suicide plans of their patients with suicidal ideas. They should also discuss the way their patients deal with problems and the kind of help they need, because a substantial proportion of (first) attempts was not intended to kill oneself. Preventive measures are best offered within the first year after ideation onset. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Three studies have reported a seasonal variation in lithium serum levels, with higher levels during summer. Our objective was to investigate the impact of actual environmental temperature on lithium serum levels.
   Methods: A retrospective study was conducted using available records of lithium serum levels for the period between January 1995 and July 2004, obtained from three large teaching hospitals in The Netherlands. Lithium serum levels were linked to season and average daily temperature data obtained from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. An analysis was performed on all lithium serum levels not accounting for the intra-individual dependency of lithium serum levels. The association between season, temperature and both absolute lithium serum level and the frequency of potentially toxic serum levels was investigated. A mixed model analysis, accounting for intra-individual dependency of lithium serum levels, was performed.
   Results:A total of 41,102 lithium serum levels (3,054 patients) were included. A significant difference in mean lithium serum levels across seasons (p < 0.001) and temperature categories (p = 0.001) was found, peaking in summer [0.761 mmol/L, +/- standard error of the mean (SEM) 0.002] and at temperatures of 15-20 degrees C [0.762 mmol/L (+/- SEM 0.005)], and at a minimum in winter [0.748 mmol/L (+/- SEM 0.002)] and at < 0 degrees C [0.741 mmol/L (+/- SEM 0.005)]. The relative frequency of potentially toxic serum levels significantly differed between seasons (p = 0.023, highest in winter), but not between temperature categories (p = 0.481). A significant positive association for intra-individual lithium serum level and season (p < 0.001) and temperature (p < 0.001) was established.
   Conclusions:Season and environmental temperature have a statistically significant but therapeutically irrelevant effect on lithium serum levels.

AB This paper examines two recent Canadian legislative initiatives intended in whole or in part to combat cyberbullying: the Cyber-Safety Act of Nova Scotia and the Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act. Both pieces of legislation were responses to the suicide deaths of female teenagers Rehtaeh Parsons in Nova Scotia and Amanda Todd in British Columbia. It is questionable whether either suicide was directly caused by cyberbullying. Todd was primarily a victim of an adult "capper" living in the Netherlands, who persuaded her to expose her breasts via web cam, and then attempted to use the captured images to extort money and more images. Parsons was filmed engaging in what police concluded was consensual sex with several teenage boys at a house party. The cell phone video was posted on the Internet, making Parsons a victim of "sexting." In 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada fired a shot across the bow of Bill C-30, the immediate predecessor to the Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act, ruling that a police search (permissible under Bill C-30) in a child pornography case infringed upon constitutional protection against unreasonable search and seizure, and upon the right to privacy in cyberspace. In 2015, the Cyber-Safety Act of Nova Scotia was struck down by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia because it violated constitutional rights to freedom of expression and to life, liberty and security of person. In a criminal harassment case involving Twitter, the Ontario Court of Justice ruled in 2016 that Twitter is like a public square, where freedom of expression is protected, and where there is no reasonable expectation of privacy. These three court decisions can be expected to limit the extent to which Canadian legislators and law enforcement agencies can go in their efforts to pursue and prosecute cyberbullies and/or cyber criminals.

AB Context. Continuous deep sedation (CDS) until death can form an effective part of palliative care. In The Netherlands and Belgium, CDS is sometimes regarded as an alternative to euthanasia, and the involvement of palliative care specialists is low. Provision of CDS through opioids alone is not recommended.
   Objectives. This study investigates the use of CDS in the United Kingdom.
   Methods. A survey of 8,857 doctors, of whom 3,733 (42%) replied, with 2,923 reporting on their last patient who died.
   Results. In total, 18.7% (17.3-20.1) of the doctors attending a dying patient reported the use of CDS. CDS was more likely when patients were younger or were dying of cancer. Specialists in care of the elderly were least. likely to report the use of CDS; doctors in other hospital specialties were most likely to report its use. CDS was associated with a higher rate of requests from patients or relatives for a hastened death and with a greater incidence of other end-of-life decisions containing some intent to end life by the doctor. Doctors supporting legalization of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide, or who were nonreligious, were more likely to report using CDS. There was palliative care team involvement in half of all CDS cases, and prescription of opioids alone for sedation occurred in one-fifth of the cases but was not reported by specialists in palliative care.
   Conclusion. This study provides baseline data for monitoring future trends in the United Kingdom and highlights the need for a fuller understanding of the circumstances in which CDS occurs in particular care settings.

AB Several surveys of the German population concerning the attitude towards euthanasia in patients with terminal illness yielded contradictory results, ranging from high acquisition to high refusal rates. After a critical discussion of the methodological concepts of these investigations, we present the results of a representative study of 1957 German persons (age range: 14-96 years) which was performed by the institute USUMA in February 2001. Four different types of euthanasia were included in the study: active, passive, and indirect euthanasia as well as physician's assisted suicide. The affirmative response categories were,,declared will and unbearable pain", ,,declared will", ,,referred will", and ,,in the responsibility of the physician". Additionally, we asked to state the personal preference in the case of an own incurable illness. The resulting frequency distributions stress the autonomy of the patients (declared will) and the legal forms of professional euthanasia (passive and indirect euthanasia), independent from the degree of pain. The rank order of the hypothetic personal preferences was: passive euthanasia (26.1 %), active euthanasia (21.1 %), indirect euthanasia (13.1 %) and assisted suicide (6.2 %). For each category the hypothetic personal will to utilize euthanasia personally is markedly lower than the consent to legalize euthanasia in the society. This points to a diminished readiness of the population to seek for euthanasia. Persons aged 60 years and above deny all types of euthanasia significantly more often than younger persons. Persons with subjectively bad health status prefer the category ,,in the responsibility of the physician" more often than healthy subjects. The representative study proves that there is no polarized public opinion concerning euthanasia, rather there is a picture of high complexity.

AB There is evidence to suggest that both psychological characteristics and stressful life events are contributory factors in deliberate self-harm among young people. These links, and the possibility of a dose-response relationship between self-harm and both psychological health and life events, were investigated in the context of a seven-country school-based study. Over 30,000, mainly 15 and 16 year olds, completed anonymous questionnaires at secondary schools in Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and Australia. Pupils were asked to report on thoughts and episodes of self-harm, complete scales on depression and anxiety symptoms, impulsivity and self-esteem and indicate stressful events in their lives. Level and frequency of self-harm was judged according to whether they had thought about harming themselves or reported single or multiple self-harm episodes. Multinomial logistic regression assessed the extent to which psychological characteristics and stressful life events distinguished between adolescents with different self-harm histories. Increased severity of self-harm history was associated with greater depression, anxiety and impulsivity and lower self-esteem and an increased prevalence of all ten life event categories. Female gender, higher impulsivity and experiencing the suicide or self-harm of others, physical or sexual abuse and worries about sexual orientation independently differentiated single-episode self-harmers from adolescents with self-harm thoughts only. Female gender, higher depression, lower self-esteem, experiencing the suicide or self-harm of others, and trouble with the police independently distinguished multiple- from single-episode self-harmers. The findings reinforce the importance of psychological characteristics and stressful life events in adolescent self-harm but nonetheless suggest that some factors are more likely than others to be implicated.

AB Background: Most end-of-life decision-making studies have, until now, involved either the general population or newborn infants.
   Objective: To assess the frequency of end-of-life decisions preceding child death and the characteristics of the decision-making process in the Netherlands.
   Methods: Two studies were performed. The first was a death certificate study in which all 129 physicians reporting the death of a child aged between I and 17 years in the period August to December 2001 received a written questionnaire; the second was an interview study in which face-to-face interviews were held with 63 physicians working in pediatric hospital departments.
   Results: Some 36% of all deaths of children between the ages of I and 17 years during the relevant period were preceded by an end-of-life decision: 12% by a decision to refrain from potentially life-prolonging treatment; 21% by the alleviation of pain or symptoms with a possible life-shortening effect; and 2.7% by the use of drugs with the explicit intention of hastening death. The latter decision was made at the child's request in 0.7% and at the request of the family in 2% of cases. The interview study examined 76 cases of end-of-life decision making. End-of-life decisions were discussed with all 9 competent and 3 partly competent children, with the parents in all cases, with other physicians in 75 cases, and with nurses in 66 cases.
   Conclusions: While not inconsiderable, the percentage of end-of-life decisions was lower for children than for adults and newborn infants. Most children are not considered to be able to participate in the decision-making process. Decisions are generally discussed with parents and other caregivers and, if possible, with the child.

ID ASSISTED SUICIDE
AB Euthanasia was decriminalized in Quebec in December 2015, and Canada-wide in June 2016. Both the Provincial and Federal legislation have limited the right to medical assistance in dying (MAID) to end-of-life cases; which makes MAID inaccessible to most patients solely suffering from psychiatric illness. While some end-stage anorexia nervosa or elderly patients may meet the end-of-life criterion because of their medical comorbidities or their age (Kelly et al., 2003), repeated suicide attempts or psychotic disorganization would not qualify since they would not be seen as elements of an illness leading to a foreseeable "natural death" (Canada, 2016). This is in contradiction to other jurisdictions, such as Belgium and the Netherlands as well as the eligibility criteria stated in the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Carter v. Canada (Supreme Court of Canada, 2015). Here we analyze three cases of patients who presented to a psychiatric emergency department and requested MAID for psychiatric reasons. While none of the patients were eligible for MAID under Canadian law, we find that their demographics match closely that of patients granted MAID for psychiatric reasons in jurisdictions where that practice is allowed. Based on these cases, we comment on potentially negative consequences that may come from decriminalizing MAID for psychiatric reasons (such as an increased assessment burden on ED staff) and potentially positive consequences (such as encouraging suffering patients who had not consulted to seek care). While it is by no means our intention to take a political or moral stand on this important issue, or to conclusively weigh the negatives and positives of allowing MAID for psychiatric reasons, we do stress the importance of an active voice for psychiatry in this ongoing public debate.

AB Definition of the Problem Relief of suffering is a central goal of medicine. In recent years, an increasing recourse regarding the concept of suffering in medical practice can be observed. At the same time relatively few efforts have been made to clarify the concept of " suffering" or " unbearable suffering". This leads to several theoretical and practical problems that will be analyzed and discussed in this article. For this purpose I will examine the difficulties in applying the concept of suffering in medical practice, taking as an example the practice of deep, continuous palliative sedation. The problem will then be analyzed from a theoretical perspective. Arguments I will argue that in medical practice we are used to refer to a concept of suffering that ( a) is characterized by a strong normativity, ( b) is primarily understood as subjective, and ( c) is not differentiated with regard to content. Afterwards I will present two theoretical concepts of suffering and challenge whether they are functional for medical practice. Conclusion With regard to some philosophical- anthropological considerations I will argue that the normativity of suffering in medicine must be reconsidered.

AB The experience of the Netherlands in relation with the legalization and practice of euthanasia is better known in Spain than the Belgian experience in this matter. But the historical process of social debate in Belgium has many specific details which should be known by Spanish healthcare professionals, bioethicists, politicians and lawyers. This paper begins with a comparative analysis of both countries: Spain and Belgium and follows with a description of the milestones of the historical process of debating and, finally, passing the Belgian Law on Euthanasia in 2002. The next chapter consists of a description of the main contents of this important Law. The paper continues then with an approach to the epidemiology of the practice of euthanasia in Belgium and finishes with a description of the different positions of the actors of the process. Two positions are described more in depth: the opinion of the specialists in palliative care, and the opinion of the Catholic Church. The paper ends underlining the reason for the incorporation of the Belgian experience on euthanasia to the debate about the possibility of legalizing euthanasia in Spain.

AB On 16 February, 2017, Anil Ramdas (1958-2012) was commemorated in Amsterdam, five years after his suicide. This Surinam born author and media personality of Hindustan ancestry, had developed in the course of time into a thought provoking progressive intellectual. The themes he cherished in his essays and in his work for Dutch television were migration and identity, the values of western civilisation and the need for civility. On his return to the Netherlands, in 2003, after a three year stay as a correspondent in India, he became aware that, due to a change in the general cultural atmosphere, tolerance for immigrants had diminished. It made him question his own role as a 'non-western intellectual'. In February 2011, Ramdas published Badal, a novel of ideas on an autobiographical basis. Most reviews emphasised the autobiographical aspect, including Badal's alcoholism: Badal had to be identical to Anil Ramdas. In this article, Badal is interpreted as a complex, multi-layered, a-chronological novel, which explores the same themes as Ramdas' essays, using intertextual references to other novels and especially to songs and films. In the final analysis, it is a novel about the human condition, about loss and the demise of illusions.

TI When unbearable suffering incites psychiatric patients to request
   euthanasia: qualitative study
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID ASSISTED SUICIDE; PERSPECTIVES; NETHERLANDS; BELGIUM; LAW
AB Background
   The concept of 'unbearable suffering' is central to legislation governing whether euthanasia requests may be granted, but remains insufficiently understood, especially in relation to psychiatric patients.
   Aims
   To provide insights into the suffering experiences of psychiatric patients who have made a request for euthanasia.
   Method
   Testimonials from 26 psychiatric patients who requested euthanasia were analysed using QualiCoder software.
   Results
   Five domains of suffering were identified: medical, intrapersonal, interpersonal, societal and existential. Hopelessness was confirmed to be an important contributor. The lengthy process of applying for euthanasia was a cause of suffering and added to experienced hopelessness, whereas encountering physicians who took requests seriously could offer new perspectives on treatment
   Conclusions
   The development of measurement instruments to assess the nature and extent of suffering as experienced by psychiatric patients could help both patients and physicians to better navigate the complicated and sensitive process of evaluating requests in a humane and competent way. Some correlates of suffering (such as low income) indicate the need for a broad medical, societal and political debate on how to reduce the burden of financial and socioeconomic difficulties and inequalities in order to reduce patients' desire for euthanasia. Euthanasia should never be seen (or used) as a means of resolving societal failures.

AB Objectives: The Hague Protocol is used by professionals at the adult Emergency Departments (ED) in The Netherlands to detect child abuse based on three parental characteristics: (1) domestic violence, (2) substance abuse or (3) suicide attempt or self-harm. After detection, a referral is made to the Reporting Center for Child Abuse and Neglect (RCCAN). This study investigates whether implementing this Protocol will lead parents to avoid medical care.
   Method: We compared the number of patients (for whom the Protocol applied) who attended the ED prior to implementation with those attending after implementation. We conducted telephone interviews (n = 14) with parents whose children were referred to the RCCAN to investigate their experience with the procedure.
   Results: We found no decline in the number of patients, included in the Protocol, visiting the ED during the 4 year implementation period (2008-2011). Most parents (n = 10 of the 14 interviewed) were positive and stated that they would, if necessary, re-attend the ED with the same complaints in the future.
   Conclusion: ED nurses and doctors referring children based on parental characteristics do not have to fear losing these families as patients. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the drugs used in the alleviation of pain and symptoms (APS) with a possible life-shortening side effect in six European countries' end-of-life care. We sent mail questionnaires to physicians who signed a representative sample of death certificates in each country. APS with a possible life-shortening effect occurred from 19 % of all deaths in Italy to 26 % in Denmark. Physicians usually administered opioids (from 76 % of APS cases in Italy to 96 % in The Netherlands), but the type of opioids and administration Practice differed markedly between countries. The doses of opioids given in the last 24 hours also varied signifcantly and were usually lower than 300 mg oral morphine equivalent (from 83 % of cases in Belgium to 93 % in Sweden). The highly variable results bring into question whether existing guidelines for pain relief were applied appropriately and to what extent unfounded concerns about the possible life-shortening effect of opioids resulted in less than optimal Symptom management in end-of-life care.

AB Purpose of reviewThe aim of this review was to present and comment on recent data published on palliative sedation in palliative and end-of-life care. Palliative sedation is a medical procedure used to deal with the refractory symptoms occurring in the advanced stages of cancer. It has clinical, nursing, relational and ethical implications, making it a highly sensitive issue.Recent findingsOver the last 12 months, a number of authors have published interesting new findings on different areas of palliative sedation, that is prevalence, indications, monitoring, duration and choice of drugs. In particular, a clear definition of palliative sedation and of its more pronounced form, deep continuous sedation (DCS), has emerged. It has been confirmed that, when performed in the correct way and with the right aims, palliative sedation does not have a detrimental impact on survival.SummaryRecent findings confirm that palliative sedation is an integral part of a medical palliative care approach and is needed in certain clinical situations. It is a legitimate clinical practice from any ethical point of view. While oncologists should have a basic knowledge of the procedure, its in depth study is a core competency for palliative care physicians.

AB Despite advances in the care of infants, there remain many newborns whose medical conditions are incompatible with sustained life. At times, healthcare providers and parents may agree that prolonging life is not an appropriate goal of care, and they may redirect treatment to alleviate suffering. While pediatric palliative treatment protocols are gaining greater acceptance, there remain some children whose suffering is unrelenting despite maximal efforts. Due to the realization that some infants suffer unbearably (ie, the burdens of suffering outweigh the benefits of life), the Dutch have developed a protocol for euthanizing these newborns. In this review, I examine the ethical aspects of 6 forms of end of life care, explain the ethical arguments in support of euthanasia, review the history and verbiage of the United States regulations governing limiting and withdrawing life-prolonging interventions in infants, describe the 3 categories of neonates for whom the Dutch provide euthanasia, review the published analyses of the Dutch protocol, and finally present some practical considerations should some form of euthanasia ever be deemed appropriate.

AB ObjectivesTo investigate the prevalence and associated psychosocial factors of occasional and repetitive direct self-injurious behavior (D-SIB), such as self-cutting, -burning, -biting, -hitting, and skin damage by other methods, in representative adolescent samples from 11 European countries.
   MethodsCross-sectional assessment of adolescents was performed within the European Union funded project, Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE), which was conducted in 11 European countries. The representative sample comprised 12,068 adolescents (F/M: 6,717/5,351; mean age: 14.90.89) recruited from randomly selected schools. Frequency of D-SIB was assessed by a modified 6-item questionnaire based on previously used versions of the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI). In addition, a broad range of demographic, social, and psychological factors was assessed.
   ResultsOverall lifetime prevalence of D-SIB was 27.6%; 19.7% reported occasional D-SIB and 7.8% repetitive D-SIB. Lifetime prevalence ranged from 17.1% to 38.6% across countries. Estonia, France, Germany, and Israel had the highest lifetime rates of D-SIB, while students from Hungary, Ireland, and Italy reported low rates. Suicidality as well as anxiety and depressive symptoms had the highest odds ratios for both occasional and repetitive D-SIB. There was a strong association of D-SIB with both psychopathology and risk-behaviors, including family related neglect and peer-related rejection/victimization. Associations between psychosocial variables and D-SIB were strongly influenced by both gender and country. Only a minor proportion of the adolescents who reported D-SIB ever received medical treatment.
   ConclusionThese results suggest high lifetime prevalence of D-SIB in European adolescents. Prevalence as well as psychosocial correlates seems to be significantly influenced by both gender and country. These results support the need for a multidimensional approach to better understand the development of SIB and facilitate culturally adapted prevention/intervention.

AB Cross-sectional studies have produced clear inverted U-shaped curves between injury mortality and economic development; yet, this does not mean that single countries will necessarily follow similar curves as they grow richer over time. This study was conducted to examine whether previous cross-sectional findings can be verified using a longitudinal approach. Data for both injury mortality and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita were obtained from an official health database for the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for the period of 1960-1999. Regression models were then used to examine the longitudinal relationship between these two variables. Substantial improvements in injury mortality were observed in all income categories in the selected countries. For higher and middle high-income countries, injury mortality rates (all causes) increased until 1972, peaking in 1972 and then declining. For industrialized countries with relatively low GDP, injury mortality rates increased until 1977 and then declined. Using cubic regression lines for injury mortality rates, for all income categories, injury mortality rates increased tip to a GDP per capita of $3000-$4000, then decreased significantly. The rising trends of suicide and homicide rates were observed until countries attained a GDP per capita of around $13,000-$14,000 for all income categories. It is noteworthy that compared to the intentional injury categories, mortality due to road traffic accidents and injuries from falls declined earlier on in the economic development process. Longitudinal analysis among high-income countries confirms earlier cross-sectional findings; that is, most injury categories seem to follow inverted U-shaped trend lines, with declining trends after peaking at various stages of temporal and economical development. A comparison between time and economy suggests that differences in peaking time between countries for the same injury category is partly a reflection of temporal differences in economic development.

AB Context. There is much debate about euthanasia within the context of palliative care. The six criteria of careful practice for lawful euthanasia in The Netherlands aim to safeguard the euthanasia practice against abuse and a disregard of palliative treatment alternatives. Those criteria need to be evaluated by the treating physician as well as an independent euthanasia consultant.
   Objectives. To investigate 1) whether and how palliative treatment alternatives come up during or preceding euthanasia consultations and 2) how the availability of possible palliative treatment alternatives are assessed by the independent consultant.
   Methods. We interviewed 14 euthanasia consultants and 12 physicians who had requested a euthanasia consultation. We transcribed and analyzed the interviews and held consensus meetings about the interpretation.
   Results. Treating physicians generally discuss the whole range of treatment options with the patient before the euthanasia consultation. Consultants actively start thinking about and proposing palliative treatment alternatives after consultations, when they have concluded that the criteria for careful practice have not been met. During the consultation, they take into account various aspects while assessing the criterion concerning the availability of reasonable alternatives, and they clearly distinguish between euthanasia and continuous deep sedation. Most consultants said that it was necessary to verify which forms of palliative care had previously been discussed. Advice concerning palliative care seemed to be related to the timing of the consultation ("early" or "late"). Euthanasia consultants were sometimes unsure whether or not to advise about palliative care, considering it not their task or inappropriate in view of the previous discussions.
   Conclusion. Two different roles of a euthanasia consultant were identified: a limited one, restricted to the evaluation of the criteria for careful practice, and a broad one, extended to actively providing advice about palliative care. Further medical and ethical debate is needed to determine consultants' most appropriate role. J Pain Symptom Manage 2011; 42: 32-43. (C) 2011 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee.

AB Background. The objective was to determine the influence of systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure on the development of coronary heart disease over an 18-year period in a Dutch general practice population.
   Methods. The Nijmegen Cohort Study is a prospective cohort study with an 18-year follow-up. In 1977 systolic blood pressure, diastolic: blood pressure, and other cardiovascular risk factors were measured in 7,092 Caucasians, men and women. The screening took place in six general practices, participating in a university registration network. Cardiovascular disease and all mortality was registrated during the 1977-1995 period. A Cox proportional haz ard model was performed separately for men and women with the first onset of a coronary heart disease as the outcome variable. Age, smoking, serum cholesterol, blood pressure, and socioeconomic class were included as independent variables.
   Results. During the 18-year follow-up period, 205 men and 63 women suffered a nonfatal myocardial infarction. During this time, 205 deaths were identified, of which 54 were cardiovascular. Of all deaths, 139 were noncardiovascular, of which 10% mere due to accident or suicide, while in 12 participants the cause of death was uncertain. The analysis indicated that both the systolic and the diastolic blood pressure were independently associated with the Likelihood for developing coronary heart disease, as were the other risk factors. For coronary heart disease, the significant risk ratios for the systolic blood pressure were 1.6 for men and 2.1 for women. For the diastolic blood pressure a risk ratio was found of 1.4 for men and 2.0 for women.
   Conclusion. A significant relation between blood pressure and coronary heart disease was demonstrated. As mean blood pressures, cholesterol levels, smoking habits, and socioeconomic class in this cohort did not differ from other figures in The Netherlands, extrapolation of the results to the Dutch population is possible.

AB Many physicians and patients do not realize that it is legally and medically possible to donate organs after euthanasia. The combination of euthanasia and organ donation is not a common practice, often limited by the patient's underlying pathology, but nevertheless has been performed >40 times in Belgium and the Netherlands since 2005. In anticipation of patients' requests for organ donation after euthanasia and contributing to awareness of the possibility of this combination among general practitioners and medical specialists, the Maastricht University Medical Center and the Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam have developed a multidisciplinary practical manual in which the organizational steps regarding this combined procedure are described and explained. This practical manual lists the various criteria to fulfill and the rules and regulations the different stakeholders involved need to comply with to meet all due diligence requirements. Although an ethicist was involved in writing this paper, this report is not specifically meant to comprehensively address the ethical issues surrounding the topic. This paper is focused on the operational aspects of the protocol.
   After carefully reflecting on ethical and logistic considerations, the authors argue that organ donation after euthanasia is feasible.

AB Background: Requests for physician-assisted death (PAD) in patients with cognitive impairment are complex and require careful consideration. Of particular difficulty is determination of whether the request is voluntary and well considered. Results: Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) are both legal in The Netherlands, Luxemburg, Colombia, and Canada. Euthanasia is legal in Belgium, while PAS is legal in Switzerland and Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont, and California (USA). Upon a PAD request, evaluation of the capacity to consent medical treatment is relevant for the decision-making process, while evaluation of testamentary capacity is appropriate before an advance euthanasia directive is written. Anosognosia assessment throughout the Alzheimer's disease continuum provides essential and relevant information regarding the voluntary and well-considered nature of the PAD request; meanwhile, early assessment of hypernosognosia or subjective cognitive decline assists in formulation of a clinical prognosis. Furthermore, the assessment of physical and psychological suffering should incorporate verbal and nonverbal cues as well as consideration of the psychosocial factors that might affect due care criteria. Conclusion: The clinical approach to a PAD request should consider the legal framework and the decision-making capacity, assess memory deficit awareness and the perception of suffering, and evaluate mental competency when considered pertinent.

ID VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA; OPINIONS; LEGALIZATION; NETHERLANDS; DUTCH
AB Over the past three decades, active euthanasia and abortion have received increasing international attention. Since both these practices are relevant to the role of the nurse-midwife, it is important to know what influences their attitudes towards them. Therefore, the purpose of this study was: 1, to survey the attitudes of nurse-midwives' to active euthanasia and its legalization; 2, to determine the relationship between nurse-midwives' attitudes toward active euthanasia and its legalization, and attitudes toward abortion, self-reported religiosity and religious affiliation. The study setting was an international midwifery conference and the sample consisted of 139 nurse-midwives attending the conference. The majority of nurse-midwives displayed a positive attitude toward active euthanasia and its legalization. In addition, there was a positive relationship between their attitude to abortion and active euthanasia. Self-reported religiosity and religious affiliation were significantly related to attitudes toward active euthanasia and its legalization. An interesting positive relationship between country of practice and attitudes to euthanasia was also found. Nurse-midwives practicing in countries with more liberal euthanasia and assisted suicide legislation were more supportive of active euthanasia. With the increasing acceptance of active euthanasia's legalization, the results of this study pose some ethical questions that nurse-midwives internationally will have to consider.

AB Background: Quantitative studies in several European countries showed that 10-20% of older people have or have had a wish to die. Aims: To improve our understanding of why some older people develop a wish to die. Methods: In-depth interviews with people with a wish to die (n = 31) were carried out. Through open coding and inductive analysis, we developed a conceptual framework to describe the development of death wishes. Respondents were selected from two cohort studies. Results: The wish to die had either been triggered suddenly after traumatic life events or had developed gradually after a life full of adversity, as a consequence of aging or illness, or after recurring depression. The respondents were in a situation they considered unacceptable, yet they felt they had no control to change their situation and thus progressively "gave up" trying. Recurring themes included being widowed, feeling lonely, being a victim, being dependent, and wanting to be useful. Developing thoughts about death as a positive thing or a release from problems seemed to them like a way to reclaim control. Conclusions: People who wish to die originally develop thoughts about death as a positive solution to life events or to an adverse situation, and eventually reach a balance of the wish to live and to die.

AB Continuous deep sedation (CDS) is sometimes used to treat refractory symptoms in terminally ill patients. The aim of this paper was to estimate the frequency and characteristics of CDS in six European countries: Belgium, Denmark, Italy, The Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. Deaths reported to death registries were sampled and the reporting doctors received a mailed questionnaire about the medical decision making that preceded the death of the patient. The total number of deaths studied was 20,480. The response rate ranged between 44 % (Italy) and 75 % (The Netherlands). Of all deaths, CDS was applied in 2.5 % in Denmark and up to 8.5 % in Italy. Of all patients receiving CDS, 35 % (Italy) and up to 64 % (Denmark and The Netherlands) did not receive artificial nutrition or hydration. Patients who received CDS were more often male, younger than 80 years old, more likely to have had cancer, and died more often in a hospital compared to nonsudden deaths without CDS. The high variability of frequency and characteristics of CDS in the studied European countries points out the importance of medical education and scientific debate on this issue.

AB Purpose To study the association between depression and the incidence of explicit requests for euthanasia in terminally ill cancer patients. Patients and
   Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted on 138 consecutive cancer patients with an estimated life expectancy of 3 months or less, in the period between September 1999 and August 2003. At inclusion, participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. To identify "depressed mood" we used a cutoff score of 20. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analyses were used to assess the association between depressed mood and the risk of a request for euthanasia.
   Results Of 138 patients, 32 patients had depressed mood at inclusion. Thirty patients (22%) made an explicit request for euthanasia. The risk to request euthanasia for patients with depressed mood was 4.1 times higher than that of patients without depressed mood at inclusion (95% Cl, 2.0 to 8.5).
   Conclusion Depression in cancer patients with an estimated life expectancy of less than 3 months is associated with a higher likelihood to request for euthanasia. The question of whether depressed mood can adequately be treated in this terminally ill population, and if so, whether it would lower the incidence of requests for euthanasia needs further investigation.

AB The ethical (un) acceptability of euthanasia for severe physical suffering is undoubtedly one of the most controversial topics of our time. Perhaps even more controversial is the debate on whether euthanasia could also be justified for cases of mental suffering, which we understand as suffering without an underlying diagnosable condition or cause. Various widely debated cases from The Netherlands and Belgium have made this issue more than just a philosophical exercise. In this chapter we look into the ethical aspects of seeing mental suffering as a possibly allowable indication for euthanasia. First, we clarify the important concepts-such as 'physical suffering', 'psychological suffering', and 'mental suffering'-that are used throughout this chapter. Next we focus on the following key question: can one consistently claim a right to request euthanasia for patients with diagnosable physical or psychological sources of suffering, while denying the same right to patients with mental suffering without medical diagnosis? We do so by identifying various reasons that could be given to justify why mental suffering is relevantly different from physical or psychological suffering. We will discuss the claims that mental suffering should be seen as special as it: (1) diminishes a person's competence; (2) is a different type of suffering; (3) is undiagnosable; and (4) can never be proven to be incurable. We conclude with two important reasons to remain cautious about allowing euthanasia in cases of mental suffering.

AB Dysfunctional self-schemas are assumed to play an important role in suicidal ideation. According to recent information-processing models, it is important to differentiate between 'explicit' beliefs and automatic associations. Explicit beliefs stem from the weighting of propositions and their corresponding 'truth' values, while automatic associations reflect more simple associations in memory. Both types of associations are assumed to have different functional properties and both may be involved in suicidal ideation. Thus far, studies into self-schemas and suicidal ideation focused on the more explicit, consciously accessible traces of self-schemas and predominantly relied on self-report questionnaires or interviews. To complement these 'explicit' findings and more directly tap into self-schemas, this study investigated automatic self-associations in a large scale community sample that was part of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). The results showed that automatic self-associations of depression and anxiety were indeed significantly related to suicidal ideation and past suicide attempt. Moreover, the interactions between automatic self-depressive (anxious) associations and explicit self-depressive (anxious) beliefs explained additional variance over and above explicit self-beliefs. Together these results provide an initial insight into one explanation of why suicidal patients might report difficulties in preventing and managing suicidal thoughts.

AB The study aimed to determine whether some depressive, anxiety, and substance-use (DAS) disorders are mild, transient cases that remit without treatment. The first two waves of the first Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study were used (age 18-64 years at baseline; wave two N = 5618). Mental disorders were assessed using CIDI 1.1. Past-year and past-month measures of DAS disorders, health service use, and quality of life were assessed at both waves. Individuals with a past-year DAS disorder who received no prior lifetime treatment were significantly more likely than those who received treatment to: (1) remit from their index disorder(s) without subsequent treatment, (2) be free of comorbid disorders, and (3) not have attempted suicide during follow-up (remission rates: 68.5 versus 32.0 %, respectively, p < 0.001). However, these individuals had lower quality of life compared to healthy individuals. Results were similar for past-month measures. Results show that many people who meet criteria for a DAS disorder remit without treatment. However, the lowered quality of life scores in this group nonetheless underscores the negative impact on the presence of residual symptoms.

There is still a lack of knowledge on how people with care experience differ in their attitudes towards active euthanasia from those without. Aim: The aim of this study is to find out if and how care experience has an effect on the attitude toward voluntary active euthanasia. Method: In spring 2014 a cross-sectional survey was conducted among the Austrian population by a self-developed questionnaire (on basis of a qualitative pilot study). An online-survey was distributed among persons aged 16 to 65 years and a postal survey among those aged 65 years and older (n = 725). Descriptive data was analysed with IBM SPSS Version 2.0. Ethical approval has been provided by the Medical University Graz. Results: 48 % of the respondents have experience with care, 8.6 % as physicians or nurses, 43.7 % as family caregiver and 50 % as not caring relatives. Multiple answers were possible. People with caring experience - as nurses or family caregiver - show a significantly lower approval of voluntary active euthanasia (p = 0.04). Conclusions: Care experiences have an impact on the attitude towards voluntary active euthanasia. Thus, experiences of caring should be better included in end-of-life debates.

AB Objective. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of depression in end-of-life cancer patients requesting euthanasia in primary care, as well as to assess the relationship between depression and requesting euthanasia.
   Methods. Primary care patients with incurable cancer and an estimated life expectancy of half a year or shorter were interviewed every 2 months, using standardized psychometric instruments. Also, non-recruited eligible patients were monitored.
   Results. Out of 258 eligible patients, 76 patients were recruited, of whom 64 patients were followed up until death. Of these, 27% (n = 17) explicitly requested euthanasia. One patient suffered from major depression. According to the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 47% of the patients who explicitly requested euthanasia versus 28% of those without an euthanasia request suffered from a depressed mood at inclusion; the difference was not significant (P = 0.2). Corresponding figures for the last interview before death were 40% and 41% (P = 0.6).
   Conclusions. Major depression was not a major factor in explicit requests for euthanasia in end-of-life cancer patients in primary care. Further depressed mood was not associated with explicitly requesting euthanasia in this patient group, although statistical underpower cannot be ruled out in this small sample.

AB Background: In 2012, in The Netherlands a multidisciplinary practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of suicidal behavior was issued. The release of guidelines often fails to change professional behavior due to multiple barriers. Structured implementation may improve adherence to guidelines. This article describes the design of a study measuring the effect of an e-learning supported Train-the-Trainer program aiming at the training of the full staff of departments in the application of the guideline. We hypothesize that both professionals and departments will benefit from the program.
   Method: In a multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial, 43 psychiatric departments spread over 10 regional mental health institutions throughout The Netherlands will be clustered in pairs with respect to the most prevalent diagnostic category of patients and average duration of treatment. Pair members are randomly allocated to either the experimental or the control condition. In the experimental condition, the full staff of departments, that is, all registered nurses, psychologists, physicians and psychiatrists (n = 532, 21 departments) will be trained in the application of the guideline, in a one-day small interactive group Train-the-Trainer program. The program is supported by a 60-minute e-learning module with video vignettes of suicidal patients and additional instruction. In the control condition (22 departments, 404 professionals), the guideline shall be disseminated in the traditional way: through manuals, books, conferences, internet, reviews and so on. The effectiveness of the program will be assessed at the level of both health care professionals and departments.
   Discussion: We aim to demonstrate the effect of training of the full staff of departments with an e-learning supported Train-the-Trainer program in the application of a new clinical guideline. Strengths of the study are the natural setting, the training of full staff, the random allocation to the conditions, the large scale of the study and the willingness of both staff and management to participate in the study.

AB Questions concerning the drama at Schoonder Sigt: A closer look at the suicide of Robert Jacob Gordon in 1795
   Colonel Robert Jacob Gordon (1743-1795) is a famous explorer of Southern Africa, its geography, people, flora and fauna. His reputation as Military Commander of the Cape of Good Hope is, however, not so good. His resistance against the British attack in 1795 was defensive, mostly evading direct combat, and after three months he surrendered. Subsequently, some five weeks later, on the 25th of October 1795, Gordon committed suicide. South African historiography, based on prevailing rumour at the time, was convinced: his suicide was due to feelings of shame and remorse, reaction to social isolation and contempt. People accused Gordon of cowardice and his treacherous defence of the Cape, claiming that as an Orangist and Anglophile, Gordon had handed the Cape over to the British to prevent a Jacobin revolution, whereby he could be assured that the British custody would take care of the Cape until the restoration of the House of Orange.
   That Gordon was neither a coward nor a traitor, is the thesis of this article; and his suicide therefore had to have had another origin. Indeed, Gordon was an opponent of the 1789 French Revolution, and his Scottish stock might have him helped to cooperate with the British. But he did not neglect his duties and he was not betrayed by the British. Backed up by Commissioner Sluysken and the unanimous Political Council, he followed a defensive line of action, seeing the English opponent being the majority - in guns, men and professional experience - while he was not sure of the reliability of his own men, mercenaries and unruly burgher militia's - the countryside was in open conflict with the Company regime. For three months, Gordon kept the enemy at bay and retained his honour as a soldier, then he surrendered: as a professional soldier, he knew that prolonged warfare was useless, and would result in more victims and much damage. Fighting to the end, sacrificing oneself for one's honour or freedom of the nation - such feelings were foreign to 18th century officers.
   There is no knowledge of any sign of treason or sneaky cooperation by Gordon with the British army; nor is there any indication of disappointment by Gordon about the policy of the British occupier Some forty British officers honoured Gordon by being present at his funeral. There was indeed a small number of burghers and soldiers, inspired by Jacobin revolutionary nationalism, who deplored the surrender of the Cape to the British. They wrote to the Government in the Netherlands (by now the Batavian Republic) and accused the Colonial Government of treason. In their writings they called Gordon a coward and his behaviour treasonous and declared his suicide as being the result of remorse (the British forgot their promises to maintain the rights of the Dutch on the Cape Colony), social rejection and isolation.
   The accusers of the policies of Governor Sluysken and Commander Gordon are well-known: a junior clerk/schoolmaster (H. D. Campagne, as Jacobin agitator expelled by the British and for years kept imprisoned in England), an artillerist (PW.Marnitz), an assistant (assistent - C. L. Neethling, expelled, went to Holland), and the assistant ship's doctor (onderchirurgijn - J.P. Woyer, Graaff-Reinet, active in the so-called Swellendam Republic movement). Not the type of people with the knowledge to judge the situation! Their accusations were met with no response by the Batavian Government, which approved the official report by Governor Sluysken. This was an indirect disapproval of Neethling's book which was an attack of Sluysken's report, and he and his comrades were not rewarded for their revolutionary fervour: Neethling got nothing at all, Woyer was sent to the East (where he never arrived), only Campagne got some financial help, while as prisoner in England.
   It is evident that the South African historiography has given much too much credit to the revolutionary propaganda and gossip of Campagne, Marnitz, Neethling, Woyer and the anonymous pamphlet written in French Apologie de Robert de Gordon (1796). Encapsulated in the anti-imperialistic paradigm, dear to colonial historians (George McCall Theal) and the Afrikaner nationalists (C. Beyers), both the British and the VOC Regime are blamed The VOC leadership yielded to the reality, and Gordon had nothing to feel embarrassed about: the British were too strong, war is never the ultimate goal. There was not even a British plan to get hold of the Cape for ever; only to secure the Cape from the French hegemony (and the Batavian Republic was a vassal of Paris!). Not only the defence of the Cape, but also the interpretation of the mentality at the Cape, of the so-called Cape Town Jacobins and the "Republican movement" in the outermost districts Swellendam and Graaff-Reinet, have been described according to that paradigm. Their character and impact evidently are misunderstood, and both have been attributed an anachronistic ideology.
   In the context of this ideological historiography, everybody has explained the suicide of Gordon as idiosyncratic. However; there are many indications for another explanation of Gordon's suicide. Gordon wasn't the kind of man to suffer from gossip or the idiot accusations of stupid common soldiers. People said that his wife had rejected him, driving him to commit suicide - an all too common story. But there were other, serious problems. Since his last journey through the interior parts of the Cape, Gordon was ill. An illness that made him visibly meagre, and sometimes his behaviour was odd. His endeavours to strengthen the walls of the forts by hides and woolsacks were an evident example, and his riding around the Cape during the war remarkable. Some of his children, many years later, ended in a lunatic asylum. In a letter; written only two days before his death, Gordon confessed: I am almost distracted; his writing showed how emotions seemed to have overcome him. Gordon was ill. He felt that his tough body and strong mind were deteriorating - the idea to become a shadow of the man he used to be, seemed intolerable to him, and afraid of further physical and psychical decline, he took his pistol and shot himself

AB Objectives: HIV-infected patients are at increased risk of developing mental health symptoms, which negatively influence the treatment of the HIV-infection. Mental health problems in HIV-infected patients may affect public health. Psychopathology, including depression and substance abuse, can increase hazardous sexual behaviour and, with it, the chance of spreading HIV. Therefore, it is important to develop an optimal treatment plan for HIV-infected patients with mental health problems. The majority of HIV-infected patients in the Netherlands (almost 60%) are homosexual men.
   The main objectives of this study were to describe the clinical and demographic characteristics of patients with HIV who seek treatment for their mental health symptoms in the Netherlands. Secondly, we tested whether HIV infected and non-infected homosexual patients with a lifetime depressive disorder differed on several mental health symptoms.
   Methods: We compared a cohort of 196 patients who visited the outpatient clinic for HIV and Mental Health with HIV-infected patients in the general population in Amsterdam (ATHENA-study) and with non-HIV infected mental health patients (NESDA-study). DSM-IV diagnoses were determined, and several self-report questionnaires were used to assess mental health symptoms.
   Results: Depressive disorders were the most commonly occurring diagnoses in the cohort and frequent drug use was common. HIV-infected homosexual men with a depressive disorder showed no difference in depressive symptoms or sleep disturbance, compared with non-infected depressive men. However, HIV-positive patients did express more symptoms like fear, anger and guilt. Although they showed significantly more suicidal ideation, suicide attempts were not more prevalent among HIV-infected patients. Finally, the HIV-infected depressive patients displayed a considerably higher level of drug use than the HIV-negative group.
   Conclusion: Habitual drug use is a risk factor for spreading HIV. It is also more often diagnosed in HIV-infected homosexual men with a lifetime depression or dysthymic disorder than in the non-infected population. Untreated mental health problems, such as depressive symptoms and use of drugs can have serious repercussions. Therefore, general practitioners and internists should be trained to recognize mental health problems in HIV-infected patients.

AB Introduction: We aimed to assess the number of "missed cases" in the detection of child abuse based on the Hague Protocol. This protocol considers 3 parental characteristics of ED adult patients to identify child abuse: (1) domestic violence, (2) intoxication, and (3) suicide attempt or auto-mutilation.
   Methods: This study focuses on parents whose children should have been referred to the Reporting Centre for Child Abuse and Neglect (RCCAN) in the Hague, the Netherlands, according to the guidelines of the Hague Protocol. Data were collected from all referrals by the Medical Centre Haaglanden (Medisch Centrum Haaglanden) to the RCCAN in the Hague between July 1 and December 31, 2011. The hospital's database was searched to determine whether the parents had visited the emergency department in the 12 months before their child's referral to the RCCAN.
   Results: Eight missed cases out of 120 cases were found. The reasons for not referring were as follows: forgetting to ask about children and assuming that it was not necessary to refer children if parents indicated that they were already receiving some form of family support.
   Discussion: Barriers to identifying missing cases could be relatively easy to overcome. Regular training of emergency nurses and an automated alert in the electronic health record to prompt clinicians and emergency nurses may help prevent cases being missed in the future.

AB Objectives: To give insight into Dutch nursing staff's attitudes and involvement regarding euthanasia.
   Methods: The sample was recruited from a nation-wide existent research panel of registered nurses and certified nursing assistants. Descriptive analyses and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed.
   Results: 587 respondents (response of 65%) completed the questionnaire. The majority (83%) state that physicians have to discuss the decision about euthanasia with the nurses involved. Besides, 69% state that a physician should discuss a euthanasia request with nurses who have regular contact with a patient. Nursing staff who have religious or other beliefs that they consider important for their attitude towards end-of-life decisions, and staff working in a hospital or home care, are most likely to have this opinion. Being present during the euthanasia is quite unusual: only a small group (7%) report that this has ever been the case in their entire working life. Seven% (incorrectly) think they are allowed to administer the lethal drugs.
   Conclusion: The majority want to be involved in decision-making processes about euthanasia. Not all are aware that they are not legally allowed to administer the lethal drugs. Practice implications: Nursing staff should be informed of relevant existing legislation and professional guidelines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The article presents a quantitative look at the European homicide research published in selected main international journals in the field of social science criminology (SSC) since 2000. Building on our previous, mainly narrative work (Kivivuori et al., 2012), we use search string targeting article titles in selected SSC journals. The aim is to capture the basic features and patterns of homicide research conducted by scholars affiliated with European institutions and departments. Research activity is then examined in terms of its quantity, patterns and trends, with attention to theoretical approaches and emphases. Our analyses suggest that European homicide research is increasing, is relatively concentrated to specific countries with strong homicide research traditions, and shows a rising percentage of female scholars. In terms of method and substance, qualitative and mixed methods appear to be ascendant, and research increasingly focuses on sub-types of homicide rather than on homicide in general. The most frequent topic of special homicide research is intimate partner homicide, with genocide and homicide-suicide studies also drawing European attention. The theoretical traditions of SSC-based homicide research are nearly always acknowledged and often explicitly developed. Social control theory emerges as the most discussed and ascendant theory. In addition to narrative commentary of emerging themes, we describe the 'uses of theory' in European homicide research, and detect a fruitful tension between nomothetic and idiographic approaches.

TI Euthanasia in psychiatry can never be justified. A reply to Wijsbek
SO THEORETICAL MEDICINE AND BIOETHICS

ID TERMINALLY ILL; DEPRESSION; DESIRE; DEATH
AB In a recent article, Henri Wijsbek discusses the 1991 Chabot "psychiatric euthanasia" case in the Netherlands, and argues that Chabot was justified in helping his patient to die. Dutch legislation at the time permitted physician assisted suicide when the patient's condition is severe, hopeless, and unbearable. The Dutch Supreme Court agreed with Chabot that the patient met these criteria because of her justified depression, even though she was somatically healthy. Wijsbek argues that in this case, the patient's integrity had been undermined by recent events, and that this is the basis for taking her request seriously; it was unreasonable to expect that she could start again. In this paper, I do not challenge the Dutch euthanasia criteria in the case of somatic illness, but I argue that both Chabot and Wijsbek are wrong because we can never be sufficiently confident in cases of severe exogenous depression to assist the patient in her irreversible act. This is partly because of the essential difference between somatic and mental illness, and because of the possibility of therapy and other help. In addition, I argue that Wijsbek's concept of integrity cannot do the work that he expects of it. Finally, I consider a 2011 position paper from the Royal Dutch Medical Association on euthanasia, and the implications it might have for Chabot-style cases in the future.

AB Using Functional Measurement (Anderson, 2008), Frileux, Lelievre, Munoz Sastre, Mullet, and Sorum (2003) examined the joint impact of several key factors on lay people's judgments of the acceptability of physicians' interventions to end patients' lives. The level of acceptability was high, and the information integration rule that best described the participants' judgments was Acceptability = Patient's Request + Patient's Age + Residual Suffering + Incurability. Critics suggested, however, that acceptability was high because the ethical problem was framed in terms of acceptability (Murphy, 2007). Presenting participants with acceptability scales may have caused the life-ending procedure to be represented in participants' mind as basically "acceptable". By contrast, presenting participants with unacceptability scales might cause the procedure to be represented as basically "unacceptable". In the present study, therefore, we directly compared lay people's judgments of the acceptability of life-ending procedures under two opposite conditions - an acceptability condition, and an unacceptability condition. The life-ending procedure did not appear as more acceptable to participants responding in terms of acceptability than to those responding in terms of unacceptability. In addition, the impacts of the factors describing the end-of-life situations were not affected by the type of judgment scale that was used. Functional Measurement seems to be resistant to goal-framing effects; the findings that have been observed using acceptability scales can be considered as robust.

AB Introduction: The aim of this study is to measure the prevalence of suicidal ideation and thoughts of death in elementary school children in a European survey and to determine the associated socio-demographic and clinical factors.
   Methods: Data refer to children aged 6-12 (N=7062) from Italy, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Germany, and the Netherlands randomly selected in primary schools. Suicidal thoughts and death ideation were measured using a computerized pictorial diagnostic tool from the Dominic Interactive (DI) completed by the children. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was administrated to teachers and parents along with a socio-demographic questionnaire.
   Results: Suicidal ideation was present in 16.96% of the sample (from 9.9 in Italy to 26.84 in Germany), death thoughts by 21.93% (from 7.71% in Italy to 32.78 in Germany). Sl and DT were more frequent in single-parent families and large families. Externalizing disorders were strongly correlated with Sl and DT after controlling for other factors and this was true for internalizing disorders only when reported by the children.
   Conclusion: Recognizing suicidal ideation in young children may be recommended as part of preventive strategies such as screening in the context of the presence of any mental health problems whether externalizing or internalizing. (C) 2015 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Step-down dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) is a treatment consisting of 3 months of residential DBT plus 6 months of outpatient DBT. The program was specifically developed for people suffering from severe borderline personality disorder (BPD). The present study examines the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of step-down DBT compared to 12 months of regular, outpatient DBT.
   Methods: Eighty-four participants reporting high levels of BPD-symptoms (mean age 26 years, 95% female) were randomly assigned to step-down versus standard DBT. Measurements were conducted at baseline and after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The Lifetime Parasuicide Count and BPD Severity Index (BPDSI) were used to assess suicidal behaviour, non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and borderline severity. Costs per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) were calculated using data from the EQ-5D-3L and the Treatment Inventory Cost in Psychiatric Patients (TIC-P).
   Results: In step-down DBT, 95% of patients started the program, compared to 45% of patients in outpatient DBT. The probability of suicidal behaviour did not change significantly over 12 months. The probability of NSSI decreased significantly in step-down DBT, but not in outpatient DBT. BPDSI decreased significantly in both groups, with the improvement leveling off at the end of treatment. While step-down DBT was more effective in increasing quality of life, it also cost significantly more. The extra costs per gained QALY exceeded the (sic)80,000 threshold that is considered acceptable for severely ill patients in the Netherlands.
   Conclusions: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial in the Netherlands showed that 9 months of step-down DBT is an effective treatment for people suffering from severe levels of BPD. However, step-down DBT is not more effective than 12 months of outpatient DBT, nor is it more cost-effective. These findings should be considered tentative because of high noncompliance with the treatment assignment in outpatient DBT. Furthermore, the long-term effectiveness of step-down DBT, and moderators of treatment response, remain to be evaluated.

AB Background: In 2003-2004 and 2007-2008, the regulatory banning of SSRI use in pediatrics and young adults due to concerns regarding suicidality risk coincided with negative media coverage. SSRI use trends were analyzed from 2000-2010 in the Netherlands (NL) and the UK, and whether trend changes might be associated with media coverage of regulatory warnings.
   Methods: Monthly SSRIs sales were presented as DDDs/1000 inhabitants/day. SSRI-use trends were studied using time-series segmented regression analyses. Timing of trend changes was compared with two periods of media coverage of warnings. Annual Dutch SSRI prescription data were analyzed by age group.
   Results: Trend changes in SSRI use largely corroborated with the periods of media coverage of warnings. British SSRI use declined from 3.9 to 0.7 DDDs/month (95%CI 3.3;4.5 & 0.5;0.9, respectively) before the first warning period (2003-2004). A small decrease of -0.6 DDDs/month (-1.2; -0.05) was observed in Dutch SSRI use shortly after 2003-2004. From 20072008, British SSRI use stabilized, whilst Dutch SSRI use diminished to -0.04 DDDs/month (-0.4;0.3). Stratified analyses showed a rapid decrease of -1.2 DDDs/month (-2.1;-1.7) in UK paroxetine use before 2003-2004, but only a minimal change in Dutch paroxetine use (-0.3 DDDs/month -0.8;0.2). Other SSRI use, especially (es) citalopram, increased during 2003-2004 in both countries. Significant reductions in Dutch paroxetine use were observed in pediatrics, adolescents, and young adults after 2003-2004.
   Conclusion: Changes in SSRI use (NL & UK) were associated with the timing of the combined effect of media coverage and regulatory warnings. Our long-term assessment illustrates that changes in SSRI use were temporal, drug-specific and more pronounced in pediatrics and young adults. The twofold increase in SSRI use over one decade indicates that regulatory warnings and media coverage may come and go, but they do not have a significant impact on the overall upward trend of SSRI use as a class in both countries.

TI A post-mortem survey on end-of-life decisions using a representative
   sample of death certificates in Flanders, Belgium: research protocol

AB Background: Reliable studies of the incidence and characteristics of medical end-of-life decisions with a certain or possible life shortening effect (ELDs) are indispensable for an evidence-based medical and societal debate on this issue. This article presents the protocol drafted for the 2007 ELD Study in Flanders, Belgium, and outlines how the main aims and challenges of the study (i.e. making reliable incidence estimates of end-of-life decisions, even rare ones, and describing their characteristics; allowing comparability with past ELD studies; guaranteeing strict anonymity given the sensitive nature of the research topic; and attaining a sufficient response rate) are addressed in a post-mortem survey using a representative sample of death certificates.
   Study design: Reliable incidence estimates are achievable by using large at random samples of death certificates of deceased persons in Flanders (aged one year or older). This entails the cooperation of the appropriate administrative authorities. To further ensure the reliability of the estimates and descriptions, especially of less prevalent end-of-life decisions (e.g. euthanasia), a stratified sample is drawn. A questionnaire is sent out to the certifying physician of each death sampled. The questionnaire, tested thoroughly and avoiding emotionally charged terms is based largely on questions that have been validated in previous national and European ELD studies. Anonymity of both patient and physician is guaranteed through a rigorous procedure, involving a lawyer as intermediary between responding physicians and researchers. To increase response we follow the Total Design Method (TDM) with a maximum of three follow-up mailings. Also, a non-response survey is conducted to gain insight into the reasons for lack of response.
   Discussion: The protocol of the 2007 ELD Study in Flanders, Belgium, is appropriate for achieving the objectives of the study; as past studies in Belgium, the Netherlands, and other European countries have shown, strictly anonymous and thorough surveys among physicians using a large, stratified, and representative death certificate sample are most suitable in nationwide studies of incidence and characteristics of end-of-life decisions. There are however also some limitations to the study design.

AB Background: Extensive debate surrounds the practice of continuous sedation until death to control refractory symptoms in terminal cancer care. We examined reported practice of United Kingdom, Belgian and Dutch physicians and nurses.
   Methods: Qualitative case studies using interviews.
   Setting: Hospitals, the domestic home and hospices or palliative care units.
   Participants: In all, 57 Physicians and 73 nurses involved in the care of 84 cancer patients.
   Results: UK respondents reported a continuum of practice from the provision of low doses of sedatives to control terminal restlessness to rarely encountered deep sedation. In contrast, Belgian respondents predominantly described the use of deep sedation, emphasizing the importance of responding to the patient's request. Dutch respondents emphasized making an official medical decision informed by the patient's wish and establishing that a refractory symptom was present. Respondents employed rationales that showed different stances towards four key issues: the preservation of consciousness, concerns about the potential hastening of death, whether they perceived continuous sedation until death as an alternative' to euthanasia and whether they sought to follow guidelines or frameworks for practice.
   Conclusion: This qualitative analysis suggests that there is systematic variation in end-of-life care sedation practice and its conceptualization in the United Kingdom, Belgium and the Netherlands.

AB Background: Primary care physicians provide palliative home care. In cancer patients dying at home in the Netherlands (45% of all cancer patients) euthanasia in about one out of every seven patients indicates unbearable suffering. Symptom prevalence, relationship between intensity of symptoms and unbearable suffering, evolvement of symptoms and unbearability over time and quality of unbearable suffering were studied in end-of-life cancer patients in primary care.
   Methods: 44 general practitioners during three years recruited cancer patients estimated to die within six months. Every two months patients quantified intensity as well as unbearability of 69 symptoms with the State-of-Suffering-V (SOS-V). Also overall unbearable suffering was quantified. The five-point rating scale ranged from 1 (not at all) to 5 (hardly can be worse). For symptoms assessed to be unbearable the nature of the suffering was additionally investigated with open-ended questions. The final interviews were analyzed; for longitudinal evolvement also the pre-final interviews were analyzed. Symptom intensity scores 4 and 5 were defined to indicate high intensity. Symptom unbearability scores 4 and 5 were defined to indicate unbearable suffering. Two raters categorized the qualitative descriptions of unbearable suffering.
   Results: Out of 148 requested patients 51% participated; 64 patients were followed up until death. The SOS-V was administered at least once in 60 patients (on average 30 days before death) and at least twice in 33 patients. Weakness was the most frequent unbearable symptom (57%). Pain was unbearable in 25%. Pain, loss of control over one's life and fear of future suffering frequently were unbearable (89-92%) when symptom intensity was high. Loss of control over one's life, vomiting and not being able to do important things frequently were unbearable (52-80%) when symptom intensity was low. Unbearable weakness significantly increased between pre-final and final interview. Physical suffering, loss of meaning, loss of autonomy, experiencing to be a burden, fear of future suffering and worrying more frequently occurred in patients suffering unbearably overall.
   Conclusions: Weakness was the most prevalent unbearable symptom in an end-of-life primary care cancer population. Physical suffering, loss of meaning and loss of autonomy more frequently occurred in patients who suffered unbearably overall.

AB Background: Euthanasia and other end-of-life decisions are acceptable to the large majority of the Dutch public. Insight in the relationships of such acceptance, with characteristics considered important for a 'good death', may contribute to the understanding of this liberal attitude. Method: Questionnaires were mailed to 1777 members of the Dutch public (response: 78%), containing questions relating to a good death, attitudes towards euthanasia, terminal sedation and increasing morphine, and demographics. Associations between characteristics of a good death and attitudes towards these end-of-life decisions were analysed. Findings: Characteristics that were considered important for a good death were: the possibility to say goodbye to loved ones (94%), dying with dignity (92%), being able to decide about end-of-life care (88%), and dying free of pain (87%). Acceptance of euthanasia, terminal sedation and increasing morphine were related to the wish to have a dignified death, and with concerns about burdening relatives with terminal care. Acceptance of euthanasia was also associated with the wish to be able to decide about medical end-of-life treatments and about the moment of death. Interpretation: Besides saying farewell and dying pain free and with dignity, many members of the Dutch public consider values of control and maintenance of independence as important for a good death.

ID OF-LIFE PRACTICES; PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; NETHERLANDS; BELGIUM;
   DECISIONS; TRENDS
AB The article examines the so-called slippery slope argument (SSA) against the legalization of active voluntary euthanasia (AVE). According to the SSA, by legalizing AVE, the least morally controversial type of euthanasia, we will take the first step onto a slippery slope and inevitably end up in the moral abyss of widespread abuse and violations of the rights of the weakest and most vulnerable patients. In the first part of the paper, empirical evidence to the contrary is presented and analyzed: None of the forecasted regrettable trends can be elicited from the body of existing statistical data. Accordingly, we have no good reason to believe either that we already are, or are sooner or later going to be, sliding into a moral abyss. A related question is then considered: Would it not be wiser and safer to stick to the status quo and preserve the existing legal ban on AVE even if the risk of its abuse is uncertain and may well turn out to be relatively low? It is argued that such an appeal to precautionary reasoning fails to justify an outright legal ban on AVE for at least two reasons: (i) it grossly underestimates the hidden moral costs of current legal arrangements (competent terminal patients suffer both disrespect for their autonomous will and deprivation of the good of a timely death) and (ii) the ban is both too inefficient and disproportionate to qualify as a reasonable measure of precaution.

AB Euthanasia is a controversial issue in today's society. In countries where euthanasia is legal, it is mainly associated with people with cancer. We retrospectively studied the frequency and basis of patients' requests for active euthanasia in the oncology setting. Methods. Recurrent requests for euthanasia made by the patients of Leon-Berard cancer center (Lyon, France) between 2001 and 2003 were recorded by questioning the physicians and nurse supervisors in charge or by collecting information from the minutes of multidisciplinary palliative care meetings. We also collected information on the general health status of the patients, their motives and their evolution over time, as well as responses from caregivers. Results. We identified 16 requests for euthanasia. These involved 8 men, 7 women and I child (median age, 56 years), corresponding to 1% of the total deaths recorded during the period. In 2 cases, the request had come from the family only. The most frequent motives were psychological distress (38%), desire for self-autonomy (31%) and pain (31%). Half of the patients, particularly those striving for autonomy, persisted with their request until death, whereas 2 of 3 requests motivated by physical or psychological distress were not maintained. Sedation was administered to 3 patients in response to recurrent requests. Conclusion. Requests for euthanasia in cancer patients are rare but may occur. Sometimes suffering is not relieved by palliative care and the request is maintained. Dealing with these patients puts caregivers in a difficult situation.

AB Objective. To determine the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among homosexual and heterosexual persons.
   Design. Secondary data analysis.
   Method. Data from a representative sample of 7076 Dutch adults (ages: 18-64 years) were collected for the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS) in 1996. The classification as heterosexual or homosexual was based on reported sexual behaviour in the preceding year. Of the 5998 classified and thus sexually active respondents (84.8%), 2.8% Of 2878 men and 1.4% of 3120 women had had same-sex partners. Differences in prevalence rates, in lifetime and in the preceding 12 months, were tested by means of logistic regression analysis controlled for demographic factors.
   Results. Homosexual men had a higher 12-month prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders (17-1 and 19.5%) respectively than heterosexual men (5.2 and 7.6%). Homosexual women had a higher 12-month prevalence of substance use disorders (14.0%) than heterosexual women (2.9%). Lifetime prevalence rates reflected differences in the same disorders, except that mood disorders were more frequently observed in homosexual (48.8%) than in heterosexual women (24.3%). The proportion of persons with greater than or equal to I DSM-III-R diagnoses was only higher among homosexual (67.4%) than heterosexual women (39.1%). More homosexual than heterosexual persons had greater than or equal to 2 disorders during their preceding lifetimes (men: 37.8 versus 14.4%; women: 39.5 versus 21.3%).
   Conclusion. Psychiatric disorders were more prevalent among homosexual than heterosexual persons.

ID INTENSIVE-CARE UNITS; EUTHANASIA; ATTITUDES; DEATH
AB Background: In this study we investigated (a) to what extent physicians have experience with performing a range of end-of-life decisions (ELDs), (b) if they have no experience with performing an ELD, would they be willing to do so under certain conditions and (c) which background characteristics are associated with having experience with/or being willing to make such ELDs.
   Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was sent to 16,486 physicians from specialities in which death is common: Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland.
   Results: The response rate differed between countries (39-68%). The experience of foregoing life-sustaining treatment ranged between 37% and 86%: intensifying the alleviation of pain or other symptoms while taking into account possible hastening of death between 57% and 95%, and experience with deep sedation until death between 12% and 46%. Receiving a request for hastening death differed between 34% and 71%, and intentionally hastening death on the explicit request of a patient between 1% and 56%.
   Conclusion: There are differences between countries in experiences with ELDs, in willingness to perform ELDs and in receiving requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. Foregoing treatment and intensifying alleviation of pain and symptoms are practiced and accepted by most physicians in all countries. Physicians with training in palliative care are more inclined to perform ELDs, as are those who attend to higher numbers of terminal patients. Thus, this seems not to be only a matter of opportunity, but also a matter of attitude.

AB Anxiety and depression frequently co-occur with borderline personality disorder. Relatively little research examined the presence of borderline personality features and its main domains (affective instability, identity problems, negative relationships and self-harm) in individuals with remitted and current anxiety and depression. Participants with current (n=597) or remitted (n=1115) anxiety and/or depression and healthy controls (n=431) were selected from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Assessments included the Personality Assessment Inventory Borderline Features Scale and several clinical characteristics of anxiety and depression.
   Borderline personality features were more common in depression than in anxiety. Current comorbid anxiety and depression was associated with most borderline personality features. Anxiety and depression status explained 29.7% of the variance in borderline personality features and 3.8% (self-harm) to 31% (identity problems) of the variance in the four domains. A large part of the variance was shared between anxiety and depression but both disorders also explained a significant amount of unique variance. The severity of anxiety and depression and the level of daily dysfunctioning was positively associated with borderline personality features. Individuals with a longer duration of anxiety and depression showed more affective instability and identity problems. These findings suggest that patients with anxiety and depression may benefit from an assessment of personality pathology as it may have implications for psychological and pharmacological treatment.

AB Background: Physician-assisted dying at the end of life has become a significant issue of public discussion. While legally available in a number of countries and jurisdictions, it remains controversial and illegal in New Zealand.
   Aim: The study aimed to explore the reasons some healthy older New Zealanders oppose physician-assisted dying in order to inform current debate.
   Design: Recorded interviews were transcribed and analysed by the authors after some edits had been made by respondents.
   Setting/participants: In all, 11 older participants (over 65 years) who responded to advertisements placed in Grey Power magazines and a University of Auckland email list were interviewed for around 1 h and asked a number of open-ended questions.
   Results: Four central themes opposing physician-assisted dying were identified from the interviews: one's personal experience with health care and dying and death, religious reasoning and beliefs, slippery slope worries and concern about potential abuses if physician-assisted dying were legalised.
   Conclusions: An important finding of the study suggests that how some older individuals think about physician-assisted dying is strongly influenced by their past experiences of dying and death. While some participants had witnessed good, well-managed dying and death experiences which confirmed for them the view that physician-assisted dying was unnecessary, those who had witnessed poor dying and death experiences opposed physician-assisted dying on the grounds that such practices could come to be abused by others.

   NETHERLANDS; MORTALITY; CARE
AB Background Finnmark County is the northernmost county in Norway. For several decades, the rate of mortality after injury in this sparsely inhabited region has remained above the national average. Following documentation of this discrepancy for the period 1991-1995, improvements to the trauma system were implemented. The present study aims to assess whether trauma-related mortality rates have subsequently improved.
   Methods All injury-associated fatalities in Finnmark from 1995-2004 were identified retrospectively from the National Registry of Death and reviewed. Low-energy trauma in elderly individuals and poisonings were excluded.
   Results A total of 453 cases of trauma-related death occurred during the study period, and 327 of those met the inclusion criteria. Information was retrievable for 266 cases. The majority of deaths (86%) occurred in the pre-hospital phase. The main causes of death were suicide (33%) and road traffic accidents (21%). Drowning and snowmobile injuries accounted for an unexpectedly high proportion (12 and 8%, respectively). The time of death did not show trimodal distribution. Compared to the previous study period, there was a significant overall decline in injury-related mortality, yet there was no change in place of death, mechanism of injury, or time from injury until death.
   Conclusions Changes in injury-related mortality cannot be linked to improvements in the trauma system. There was no change in the epidemiological patterns of injury. The high rate of on-scene mortality indicates that any major improvement in the number of injury-related deaths lies in targeted prevention.

   ABILITIES; CHILDREN; ERROR; RISK
AB Since the emergence of twin studies in the 1920s, time and again the question of possible twin-singleton differences in intelligence has been posed. This study addressed the issue through a meta-analysis Of published studies on this theme. Twins on the average seem to have lower IQs than singletons. The best estimate I-or this group difference is 4.2 IQ points (less than one-third of a standard deviation), with a great divide between Study Outcomes of less vs more recent birth cohorts (5.1 vs 0.5 IQ points, respectively). The evidence is based on studies from Six Countries (including population-based ones of entire birth cohorts), a massive database (comparisons of more than 30,000 twins with nearly 1.6 million singletons), a variety of intelligence tests, and birth cohorts spanning most of the 20th century, but, for the most part, on an age range limited to children and adolescents. The effect shows considerable between-study heterogeneity but appears robust (fail-safe N calculations), not due to influential individual studies (sensitivity analysis) or publication bias, was present since the very first published Studies (Cumulative meta-analysis), and appears generalizable across sex, zygosity, and other intelligence domains beyond the verbal. There are insufficient data as to whether the effect persists over the lifespan, exists as well within families, or has ceased in recent birth cohorts of highly developed countries (Denmark and The Netherlands). Likely causes of the effect appear to be prenatal and perinatal factors (reduced fetal growth and shorter gestation for twins).

AB Objective To assess how euthanasia in terminally ill cancer patients affects the grief response of bereaved family and friends.
   Design Cross sectional study
   Setting Tertiary referral centre for oncology patients in Utrecht, the Netherlands.
   Participants 189 bereaved family members and close friends of terminally ill cancer patients who died by euthanasia and 316 bereaved family members and close friends of comparable cancer patients who died a natural death between 1992 and 1999.
   Main outcome measures Symptoms of traumatic grief assessed by the inventory of traumatic grief, current feelings of grief assessed by the Texas revised inventory of grief, and post-traumatic stress reactions assessed by the impact of event scale.
   Results The bereaved family and friends of cancer patients who died by euthanasia had less traumatic grief symptoms (adjusted difference - 5.29 (95% confidence interval - 8.44 to - 2.15)), less current feeling of grief (adjusted difference 2.93 (0.85 to 5.01)); and less post-traumatic stress reactions (adjusted difference - 2.79 (- 5.33 to - 0.25)) than the family and friends of patients who died of natural causes. These differences were independent of other risk factors.
   Conclusions The bereaved family and friends of cancer patients who died by euthanasia coped better with respect to grief symptoms and post-traumatic stress reactions than the bereaved of comparable cancer patients who died a natural death. These results should not be interpreted as a plea for euthanasia, but as a plea for the same level of care and openness in all patients who are terminally ill.

AB Samples recruited at lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) venues have certain benefits, but a major drawback is that these samples are prone to bias as they only contain LGB participants who visit such venues. Empirical data with regard to the potential differences between LGB community samples and LGB general samples may shed some light on the generalizability of research findings from convenience samples recruited through LGB venues. The current study attempted to contribute to existing knowledge by examining differences in social demographics, sexual orientation, minority stress, and mental health between a convenience sample recruited at LGB venues ("community sample," N = 3,403) and an LGB sample recruited from a general research panel in the Netherlands ("panel sample," N = 1,000). Various differences were found. In general, community participants were younger, reported a more exclusive same-sex sexual orientation, were more open about their sexual orientation, had lower levels of internalized homonegativity, and encountered more negative social reactions on their LGB status. They also reported higher levels of psychological distress and suicidality. The Nagelkerke R (2) of the analyses (which were adjusted for sociodemographic differences) ranged from .08 (suicide plans among men) to .27 (sexual attraction among women). However, while the estimates of sociodemographics, sexual orientation, minority stress, and mental well-being differed, the relationships between these constructs were comparable in both samples. Implications and suggestions for future studies are discussed.

AB The growing support for voluntary active euthanasia (VAE) is evident in the recently approved Dutch Law on Termination of Life on Request. Indeed, the debate over legalized VAE has increased in European countries, the United States, and many other nations over the last several years. The proponents of VAE argue that when a patient judges that the burdens of living outweigh the benefits, euthanasia can be justified. If some adults suffer to such an extent that VAE is justified, then one may conclude that some children suffer to this extent as well. In an attempt to alleviate the suffering of extremely ill neonates, the University Medical Center Groningen developed a protocol for neonatal euthanasia. In this article, I first present the ethical justifications for VAE and discuss how these arguments relate to euthanizing ill neonates. I then argue that, even if one accepts the justification for VAE in adults, neonatal euthanasia cannot be supported, primarily because physicians and parents can never accurately assess the suffering of children. I then argue that without the testament of the patient herself as to the nature and magnitude of her suffering, physicians can never accurately weigh the benefits and burdens of a child's life, and therefore any such system would condemn to death some children whose suffering is not unbearable. I conclude that because the primary duty of physicians is to never harm their patients, neonatal euthanasia cannot be supported.

TI The labelling and reporting of euthanasia by Belgian physicians: a study
   of hypothetical cases
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID OF-LIFE DECISIONS; ASSISTED SUICIDE; END; ATTITUDES; OPIOIDS;
   NETHERLANDS; INTENTIONS; SEDATION; MORPHINE; DEATH
AB Background: Belgium legalized euthanasia in 2002. Physicians must report each euthanasia case to the Federal Control and Evaluation Committee. This study examines which end-of-life decisions (ELDs) Belgian physicians label 'euthanasia', which ELDs they think should be reported and the physician characteristics associated with correct labelling of euthanasia cases, the awareness that they should be reported and the reporting of them. Methods: Five hypothetical cases of ELDs: intensified pain alleviation, palliative/terminal sedation, euthanasia with neuromuscular relaxants, euthanasia with morphine and life-ending without patient request were presented in a cross-sectional survey of 914 physicians in Belgium in 2009. Results: About 19% of physicians did not label a euthanasia case with neuromuscular relaxants 'euthanasia', 27% did not know that it should be reported. Most physicians labelled a euthanasia case with morphine 'intensification of pain and symptom treatment' (39%) or 'palliative/terminal sedation' (37%); 21% of physicians labelled this case 'euthanasia'. Cases describing other ELDs were sometimes also labelled 'euthanasia'. Factors associated with a higher likelihood of labelling a euthanasia case correctly were: living in Flanders, being informed about the euthanasia law and having a positive attitude towards societal control over euthanasia. Whether a physician correctly labelled the euthanasia cases strongly determined their reporting knowledge and intentions. Conclusion: There is no consensus among physicians about the labelling of euthanasia and other ELDs, and about which cases must be reported. Mislabelling of ELDs could impede societal control over euthanasia. The provision of better information to physicians appears to be necessary.

TI Referral of patients with depression to mental health care by Dutch
   general practitioners: an observational study
SO BMC FAMILY PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
ID SPECIALISTS; DISORDERS; PHYSICIANS; SYMPTOMS; SERVICES
AB Background: Depression is a common illness, often treated in primary care. Guidelines provide recommendations for referral to mental health care. Several studies investigated determinants of referral, none investigated guideline criteria as possible determinants. We wanted to evaluate general practitioner's referral of depressed patients to mental health care and to what extent this is in agreement with (Dutch) guideline recommendations.
   Methods: We used data of primary care respondents from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety with major depressive disorder in the past year (n = 478). We excluded respondents with missing data (n = 134). Referral data was collected from electronic patient files between 1 year before and after baseline and self report at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Logistic regression was used to describe association between guideline referral criteria (e. g. perceived need for psychotherapy, suicide risk, severe/chronic depression, antidepressant therapy failure) and referral.
   Results: A high 58% of depressed patients were referred. Younger patients, those with suicidal tendency, chronic depression or perceived need for psychotherapy were referred more often. Patients who had used = 2 antidepressants or with chronic depression were more often referred to secondary care. Referred respondents met on average more guideline criteria for referral. However, only 8-11% of variance was explained.
   Conclusion: The majority of depressed patients were referred to mental health care. General practitioners take guideline criteria into account in decision making for referral of depressed patients to mental health care. However, other factors play a part, considering the small percentage of variance explained. Further research is necessary to investigate this.

AB The Kennedy Axis V is a routine outcome measurement instrument which can assist the assessment of the short-term risk for violence and other adverse patient outcomes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the interrater reliability and clinical utility of the instrument when used by mental health nurses in daily care of patients with mental illness. This cross-sectional study was conducted in inpatient and outpatient adult psychiatric care units and in one adolescent inpatient unit at a university hospital in the Netherlands. Interrater reliability was measured based on the independent scores of two different nurses for the same patients. The clinical utility of the instrument was evaluated by means of a clinical utility questionnaire. To gain a deeper understanding of rating difficulties at the adolescent unit, additional data were collected in two focus group interviews. The overall results revealed a substantial level of agreement between nurses (intraclass correlation coefficient and Pearson 0.79). Some rating challenges were identified, including difficulties with scoring the instrument and using tailor-made interventions related to the scores. These challenges can be resolved using refined training and implementation strategies. When the Kennedy Axis V is accompanied by a solid implementation strategy in adult mental health care, the instrument can be used for short-term risk assessment and thereby contribute in efforts to reduce violence, suicide, self-harm, severe self-neglect, and enhanced objectivity in clinical decision-making.

TI Can physicians conceive of performing euthanasia in case of psychiatric

DT Article
ID OF-LIFE DECISIONS; NETHERLANDS; ATTITUDES; NURSES; DEATH
AB Background Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (EAS) in patients with psychiatric disease, dementia or patients who are tired of living (without severe morbidity) is highly controversial. Although such cases can fall under the Dutch Euthanasia Act, Dutch physicians seem reluctant to perform EAS, and it is not clear whether or not physicians reject the possibility of EAS in these cases.
   Aim To determine whether physicians can conceive of granting requests for EAS in patients with cancer, another physical disease, psychiatric disease, dementia or patients who are tired of living, and to evaluate whether physician characteristics are associated with conceivability. A cross-sectional study (survey) was conducted among 2269 Dutch general practitioners, elderly care physicians and clinical specialists.
   Results The response rate was 64% (n=1456). Most physicians found it conceivable that they would grant a request for EAS in a patient with cancer or another physical disease (85% and 82%). Less than half of the physicians found this conceivable in patients with psychiatric disease (34%), early-stage dementia (40%), advanced dementia (29-33%) or tired of living (27%). General practitioners were most likely to find it conceivable that they would perform EAS.
   Conclusions This study shows that a minority of Dutch physicians find it conceivable that they would grant a request for EAS from a patient with psychiatric disease, dementia or a patient who is tired of living. For physicians who find EAS inconceivable in these cases, legal arguments and personal moral objections both probably play a role.

AB Objectives: To describe the existence of policy statements on euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (EAS) and practice guidelines for all medical end-of-life decisions in Dutch health care institutions in 2005, whether the existence of practice guidelines is related to characteristics of institutions, and to compare the existence of policies in 2005 and 1994.
   Methods: Questionnaires were sent to 566 institutions (all Dutch hospitals, nursing homes, general psychiatric hospitals, institutions for the mentally disabled, hospices) from October 2005 through March 2006.
   Results: Most institutions (70%) had a written policy statement concerning EAS. EAS was usually allowed under specific conditions (75%). Institutions mainly had practice guidelines for EAS and do-not-resuscitate decisions (62% and 63%). A minority had guidelines on palliative sedation (27%), alleviation of symptoms (27%) and withdrawing or withholding treatment (33%). In general, there were more practice guidelines in 2005 than in 1994. Larger institutions and institutions with an ethics committee more often had practice guidelines. Religious affiliation of an institution did not seem to be related to the existence of guidelines.
   Conclusions: Since many institutions still do not have practice guidelines for medical end-of-life decisions. they should be stimulated to introduce practice guidelines, being a first step in improving the quality of the care on institutional level.

   DISTINCTION; KNOWLEDGE; DEATH
AB Background: Public opinion polls indicate that a majority of Canadians are in favour of euthanasia. However, there have been many criticisms of the validity of these findings. The objective of this study was to assess public opinion towards euthanasia while controlling for possible threats to validity indicated in the literature review.
   Methods: A telephone public opinion poll was conducted in 2002 with a representative sample of the general population of Quebec (n=991; response rate=49.8%). Respondents were asked about their support for euthanasia and treatment withdrawal and, for comparison, were asked a previously used question on euthanasia (Gallup) which has been criticized for methodological problems. Respondents were also asked to distinguish between euthanasia and other end-of-life decisions in hypothetical scenarios.
   Results: Eleven percent more people supported euthanasia with the Gallup question than the question developed in this study. Support for euthanasia (69.6%) was less prevalent than for treatment withdrawal (85.8%). Respondents who failed to distinguish between euthanasia and treatment withdrawal or withholding treatment in hypothetical scenarios were more likely to support euthanasia in public opinion poll questions. Furthermore, there is a significant relationship between opinions about the acceptability of euthanasia and inaccurate knowledge of the nature of euthanasia.
   Interpretation: Public opinion polls on euthanasia must be interpreted in the light of the wording of the question. Education of the population concerning euthanasia and other end-of-life decisions may be considered to be an important prerequisite to engage in public debate concerning the legalization of euthanasia.

AB Objective:To survey amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) health care providers to determine attitudes regarding physician-assisted death (PAD) after the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) invalidated the Criminal Code provisions that prohibit PAD in February 2015.Methods:We conducted a Canada-wide survey of physicians and allied health professionals (AHP) involved in the care of patients with ALS on their opinions regarding (1) the SCC ruling, (2) their willingness to participate in PAD, and (3) the PAD implementation process for patients with ALS.Results:We received 231 responses from ALS health care providers representing all 15 academic ALS centers in Canada, with an overall response rate for invited participants of 74%. The majority of physicians and AHP agreed with the SCC ruling and believed that patients with moderate and severe stage ALS should have access to PAD; however, most physicians would not provide a lethal prescription or injection to an eligible patient. They preferred the patient obtain a second opinion to confirm eligibility, have a psychiatric assessment, and then be referred to a third party to administer PAD. The majority of respondents felt unprepared for the initiation of this program and favored the development of PAD training modules and guidelines.Conclusions:ALS health care providers support the SCC decision and the majority believe PAD should be available to patients with moderate to severe ALS with physical or emotional suffering. However, few clinicians are willing to directly provide PAD and additional training and guidelines are required before implementation in Canada.

AB Background: Since Belgium legalised euthanasia, the number of performed euthanasia cases for psychological suffering in psychiatric patients has significantly increased, as well as the number of media reports on controversial cases. This has prompted several healthcare organisations and committees to develop policies on the management of these requests.
   Method: Five recent initiatives that offer guidance on euthanasia requests by psychiatric patients in Flanders were analysed: the protocol of Ghent University Hospital and advisory texts of the Flemish Federation of Psychiatry, the Brothers of Charity, the Belgian Advisory Committee on Bioethics, and Zorgnet-Icuro. These were examined via critical point-by-point reflection, focusing on all legal due care criteria in order to identify: 1) proposed measures to operationalise the evaluation of the legal criteria; 2) suggestions of additional safeguards going beyond these criteria; and 3) remaining fields of tension.
   Results: The initiatives are well in keeping with the legal requirements but are often more stringent. Additional safeguards that are formulated include the need for at least two positive advices from at least two psychiatrists; an a priori evaluation system; and a two-track approach, focusing simultaneously on the assessment of the patient's euthanasia request and on that person's continuing treatment. Although the initiatives are similar in intent, some differences in approach were found, reflecting different ethical stances towards euthanasia and an emphasis on practical clinical assessment versus broad ethical reflection.
   Conclusions: All initiatives offer useful guidance for the management of euthanasia requests by psychiatric patients. By providing information on, and proper operationalisations of, the legal due care criteria, these initiatives are important instruments to prevent potential abuses. Apart from the additional safeguards suggested, the importance of a decision-making policy that includes many actors (e.g. the patient's relatives and other care providers) and of good aftercare for the bereaved are rightly stressed. Shortcomings of the initiatives relate to the aftercare of patients whose euthanasia request is rejected, and to uncertainty regarding the way in which attending physicians should manage negative or conflicting advices, or patients' suicide threats in case of refusal. Given the scarcity of data on how thoroughly and uniformly requests are handled in practice, it is unclear to what extent the recommendations made in these guidelines are currently being implemented.

AB Background In the Netherlands, in 2002, euthanasia became a legitimate medical act, only allowed when the due care criteria and procedural requirements are met. Legally, an Advanced Euthanasia Directive (AED) can replace direct communication if a patient can no longer express his own wishes. In the past decade, an exponential number of persons with dementia (PWDs) share a euthanasia request with their physician. The impact this on physicians, and the consequent support needs, remained unknown. Our objective was to gain more insight into the experiences and needs of Dutch general practitioners and elderly care physicians when handling a euthanasia request from a person with dementia (PWD). Methods We performed a qualitative interview study. Participants were recruited via purposive sampling. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using the conventional thematic content analysis. Results Eleven general practitioners (GPs) and elderly care physicians with a variety of experience and different attitudes towards euthanasia for PWD were included. Euthanasia requests appeared to have a major impact on physicians. Difficulties they experienced were related to timing, workload, pressure from and expectations of relatives, society's negative view of dementia in combination with the 'right to die' view, the interpretation of the law and AEDs, ethical considerations, and communication with PWD and relatives. To deal with these difficulties, participants need support from colleagues and other professionals. Although elderly care physicians appreciated moral deliberation and support by chaplains, this was hardly mentioned by GPs. Conclusions Euthanasia requests in dementia seem to place an ethically and emotionally heavy burden on Dutch GPs and elderly care physicians. The awareness of, and access to, existing and new support mechanisms needs further exploration.

AB Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of end-of-life decisions and to describe their characteristics and the preceding decision-making process in minors in Belgium.
   Design: Population-based postmortem anonymous physician survey.
   Setting: Flanders, Belgium.
   Participants: All physicians signing the death certificates of all patients (N=250) aged 1 to 17 years who died between June 2007 and November 2008 in Flanders, Belgium.
   Outcome Measures: Prevalence and characteristics of end-of-life decisions and the preceding decision-making process.
   Results: For 165 of the 250 deaths, a physician questionnaire was returned (70.5%). In 36.4%, death was preceded by an end-of-life decision. Drugs were administered to alleviate pain and symptoms with a possible life-shortening effect in 18.2% of all deaths, nontreatment decisions were made in 10.3%, and lethal drugs without the patient's explicit request were used in 7.9%. No cases of euthanasia, ie, the use of drugs with the explicit intention to hasten death at the patient's explicit request, were reported. Poor clinical prospects (84.6%) and low quality of life expectations (61.5%) were important reasons for the physicians to engage in end-of-life decisions. Parents were involved in decision making in 85.2% of these decisions, patients in 15.4%.
   Conclusions: Medical end-of-life decisions are frequent in minors in Flanders, Belgium. Whereas parents were involved in most end-of-life decisions, the patients themselves were involved much less frequently, even when the ending of their lives was intended. At the time of decision making, patients were often comatose or the physicians deemed them incompetent or too young to be involved.

DT Article
ID RATIONAL SUICIDE; MENTAL-ILLNESS; EUTHANASIA; LIFE
AB Objectives: The aim of this paper is to provide insight into what it means to live with the intention to end life at a self-chosen moment from an insider perspective.
   Setting: Participants who lived independent or semidependent throughout the Netherlands.
   Participants: 25 Dutch older citizens (mean age of 82 years) participated. They were ideating on a self-chosen death because they considered their lives to be no longer worth living. Inclusion criteria were that they: (1) considered their lives to be 'completed'; (2) suffered from the prospect of living on; (3) currently wished to die; (4) were 70 years of age or older; (5) were not terminally ill; (6) considered themselves to be mentally competent; (7) considered their death wish reasonable.
   Design: In this qualitative study, in-depth interviews were carried out in the participants' everyday home environment (median lasting 1.56 h). Verbatim transcripts were analysed based on the principles of phenomenological thematic analysis.
   Results: The liminality or 'in-betweenness' of intending and actually performing self-directed death (or not) is characterised as a constant feeling of being torn explicated by the following pairs of themes: (1) detachment and attachment; (2) rational and nonrational considerations; (3) taking control and lingering uncertainty; (4) resisting interference and longing for support; (5) legitimacy and illegitimacy.
   Conclusions: Our findings show that the in-between period emerges as a considerable, existential challenge with both rational and non-rational concerns and thoughts, rather than a calculative, coherent sum of rational considerations. Our study highlights the need to take due consideration of all ambiguities and ambivalences present after a putatively rational decision has been made in order to develop careful policy and support for this particular group of older people.

AB Australia's intermittent attempts to legalise euthanasia are typically fraught with brief, polarised, and often sensationalised, public debate. Yet beyond the sensitive arguments in favour and in opposition of reform, the practical antecedents of change that may determine Australia's genuine aptitude to enact reforms have been largely neglected. Phronetic legal inquiry thus offers insights into the euthanasia law reform experience, using Australian and international case comparisons to examine covert power dynamics, cultural discourses, and social and institutional structures that affect the practices of the legislature. On this basis, it is argued that Australia's medical profession, and particularly its dominant providers of palliative care, are hampered by an entrenched culture of medicalisation and paternalism, within which patient autonomy provides only a veneer of self-determination. This can be strikingly contrasted with the Dutch approach of patient-centred care, which seeks to produce collaborative, respectful dialogue between physician and patient and to integrate the principles of autonomy and beneficence. Furthermore, these contrasting medical cultures represent issues in the broader policymaking context, as Australia's health policy remains unduly subject to the pressure of unrepresentative yet influential conservative interest groups, most prominently including the Australian Medical Association. This pressure serves to suppress public opinion on the issue of euthanasia in a parliamentary climate that remains stifled by bipartisan alliances and political inertia. It is therefore argued that Australia's prospects for successful voluntary euthanasia law reform rest on the dual pillars of developing a more patient-centred medical culture and challenging the prevailing paternalistic approach to health policymaking in Australia's currently unrepresentative political landscape.

AB Purpose Our aim was to describe and assess the medicinal products and doses used for euthanasia in a series of cases, identified within an epidemiological death certificate study in Belgium, where euthanasia was until recently legally forbidden and where guidelines for euthanasia are not available.
   Methods In a random sample of the deaths in 1998 in Belgium, the physicians who signed the death certificates were identified and sent an anonymous mail questionnaire. The questionnaires of the deaths classified as euthanasia cases were reviewed by a multi-disciplinary panel.
   Results A total of 22 among 1925 questionnaires pertained to voluntary euthanasia. In 17 cases, detailed information on the euthanatics (medicinal substances used for euthanasia) used was provided. Opioids were used in 13 cases (in 7 as a single drug). Time between last dose and expiry ranged from 4 to 900 min. The panel judged that only in 4 cases effective euthanatics were used.
   Conclusions In the end-of-life decision cases perceived by Belgian physicians as euthanasia, pharmacological practices were disparate, although dominated by the use of morphine, in the very late phase of dying, in doses which were unlikely to be lethal. Most physicians clandestinely engaging in euthanasia in Belgium seemed unaware of procedures for guaranteeing a quick, mild and certain death. Information on the pharmacological aspects of euthanasia should be included in the medical curriculum and continuing medical education, at least in countries with a legal framework permitting euthanasia under specified conditions.

AB Background. Sedative drugs are often used at the end of life for different clinical indications, and sometimes sedation is not interrupted until the patient dies. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of patients who died while deeply sedated in Italy in 2007.
   Methods. Cross-sectional survey which asked physicians about the last death that occurred among their assisted patients during the last year, and about their attitudes towards end-of-life decisions. All general practitioners (N=5,710) and a random sample of hospital physicians (N=8,950) from 14 Italian provinces were invited to participate.
   Results. The response rate was 20%. Among 1855 reported deaths, 1466 (79.2%) were classified by physicians as expected or non-sudden; 18.2% of these expected or non-sudden deaths occurred while the patient was deeply sedated. GPs were the least likely to report deep sedation, whereas anesthetists were the most likely. In 8% of cases, sedation occurred along with an abrupt increase in the dosage of opioids during the last day of life, reaching a dosage considered higher than necessary by the doctor. No association with positive attitudes of the physician towards physician assisted death was found, whereas reporting sedation was associated with a positive attitude towards respecting the choice of relatives to forgo life-sustaining treatment in the case of an incompetent patient.
   Conclusion. Our study confirms the high prevalence of patients in Italy who die while being deeply sedated and shows that different practices may converge under the same label. Careful descriptive language is needed.

AB Objective To investigate attitudes towards physician-assisted death in minors among all physicians involved in the treatment of children dying in Flanders, Belgium over an 18-month period, and how these are related to actual medical end-of-life practices.
   Design Anonymous population-based postmortem physician survey.
   Setting Flanders, Belgium.
   Participants Physicians signing death certificates of all patients aged 1-17 years who died between June 2007 and November 2008.
   Main outcome measures Attitudes towards physician-assisted death in minors and actual end-of-life practices in the deaths concerned.
   Results 124 physicians for 70.5% of eligible cases (N=149) responded. 69% favour an extension of the Belgian law on euthanasia to include minors, 26.6% think this should be done by establishing clear age limits and 61% think parental consent is required before taking life-shortening decisions. Cluster analysis yielded a cluster (67.7% of physicians) accepting of, and a cluster (32.2% of physicians) reluctant towards physician-assisted death in minors. Controlling for physician specialty and patient characteristics, acceptant physicians were more likely to engage in practices with the intention of shortening a patient's life than were reluctant physicians.
   Conclusion A majority of surveyed Flemish physicians appear to accept physician-assisted dying in children under certain circumstances and favour an amendment to the euthanasia law to include minors. The approach favoured is one of assessing decision-making capacity rather than setting arbitrary age limits. These stances, and their connection with actual end-of-life practices, may encourage policy-makers to develop guidelines for medical end-of-life practices in minors that address specific challenges arising in this patient group.

AB Past research demonstrated that age at onset might account for different clinical and etiological characteristics in panic disorder (PD). However, prior research relied on arbitrary choices of age cut-offs. Using a data-driven validated method, this study aimed to examine differences between early and late onset PD in various determinants. Admixture analysis was used to determine the best fitting model of age at onset distribution in PD. Data was collected from 511 individuals (ages 18-65) with PD diagnoses, who participated in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). DSM-IV comorbidities and various measures of childhood adversities, suicidal behavior, anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed. The best fitting cut-off score between early and late age at onset groups was 27 years (early age at onset <= 27 years). Univariate tests showed that participants with early onset PD were younger and more likely to be female. Early onset PD was associated with agoraphobia, higher frequency of childhood trauma and life events, and higher rates of suicide attempts as compared to late onset PD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that only current age, childhood trauma and agoraphobia remained significantly associated with early onset PD. Findings suggest that 27 years marks two onset groups in PD, which are slightly distinct. Early onset PD is independently associated with exposure to childhood trauma and increased avoidance. This highlights the importance of subtyping age of onset in PD. Clinical implications are further discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To investigate the prevalences of formal DSM-IV diagnoses in pre-motor-symptomatic and motor-symptomatic mutation carriers at different stages of Huntington's disease compared to a control group of first-degree noncarrier relatives and the general population.
   Method: Between May 2004 and August 2006, 154 verified mutation carriers and 56 verified noncarriers were recruited from the outpatient clinics of the Neurology and Clinical Genetics departments of Leiden University Medical Center and from a regional nursing home. To assess the 12-month prevalences of DSM-IV diagnoses, the sections for depression, mania, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychosis/schizophrenia of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview were used. Prevalences in the Dutch general population were extracted from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS).
   Results: Both presymptomatic and symptomatic mutation carriers portrayed significantly more major depressive disorder (p = .001 and p < .001, respectively) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (p = .003 and p = .01, respectively) than the general population. Symptomatic mutation carriers also showed an increased prevalence (p = .01) of nonaffective psychosis. Psychiatric disorders were more prevalent, although not significantly (p = .06), in mutation carriers compared to first-degree relatives who were noncarriers. Noncarriers did not differ from the general population.
   Conclusion: Psychiatric disorders occur frequently in Huntington's disease, often before motor symptoms appear. In addition, first-degree noncarrier relatives do not show more psychiatric disorders compared to the general population, although they grew up in comparable, potentially stressful circumstances. Taking these findings together, psychopathology in Huntington's disease seems predominantly due to cerebral degeneration rather than to shared environmental risk factors.

AB Background - Migration during the 1990s has been high and has been characterised by new migrations. Migration has been a key force in the demographic changes of the European population. Due to the different condition of migration in Europe, variables related to mental health of migrants are: motivation for migration, living conditions in the home and in the host country.
   Aims - To give an overview on (i) prevalence of mental disorders; suicide; alcohol and drug abuse; (ii) access to mental health and psychosocial care facilities of migrants in the European region, and (iii) utilisation of health and psychosocial institution of these migrants.
   Methods - Non-system review of the literature concerning mental health disorders of migrants and their access to and their consumption of health care and psychosocial services in Europe.
   Results - It is impossible to consider "migrants" as a homogeneous group concerning the risk for mental illness. The literature showed (i) mental health differs between migrant groups, (ii) access to psychosocial care facilities is influenced by the legal frame of the host country: (iii) mental health and consumption of care facilities is shaped by migrants used patterns of help-seeking and by the legal frame of the host country.
   Conclusion - Data on migrant's mental health is scarce. Longitudinal studies are needed to describe mental health adjusting for life conditions in Europe to identify those factors which imply an increased risk of psychiatric disorders and influence help seeking for psychosocial care. In many European countries migrants fall outside the existing health and social services, particularly asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants. (C)2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Refugee immigration to European countries including the Federal Republic of Germany has increased rapidly over the last few years; however, little information on refugee morbidity and mortality in Europe is available.
   This study, conducted at the Department of Forensic Medicine of the Charit, - University Medicine in Berlin, and the Federal Institute of Forensic and Social Medicine Berlin, involved a prospective analysis of autopsy data from 38 refugee fatalities during a 30-month period.
   Between January 2015 and June 2017, a total of 38 autopsies were carried out on refugees aged between 0 and 78 years old, 32 of which were male and 6 female. In 66% of the cases an unnatural manner of death was recorded, of which the leading causes were accidents (32%), followed by suicides (24%), homicides (24%) and 16% were due to drug intoxication. Of the accidental deaths, falls from a height and drowning were most common. Natural manners of death made up less than one third of fatalities, whereby cardiovascular diseases were predominant and one individual died from an infectious disease.
   Refugees represent a heterogeneous population group. Considering the extraordinary and diverse burdens imposed on refugees by virtue of their predicament, numerous factors can lead to adverse impacts on their physical and mental health. Further studies will be necessary to generate sufficient data about the morbidity and mortality of refugees in Germany for the development and application of customized preventive measures.

AB Background: Prior research indicates that the factors that trigger suicidal ideation may differ from those that maintain it, but studies into the maintenance of suicidal ideation remain scarce. Our aim was to assess the longitudinal course of suicidal ideation, and to identify predictors of persistent suicidal ideation.
   Methods: We used data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). We performed a linear mixed-effects growth model analysis (n = 230 with current suicidal ideation at baseline) to assess the course of suicidal ideation over time (baseline through 2-, 4-, 6- and 9-year follow-up). We used logistic regression analysis (n = 195) to test whether factors previously associated with the incidence of suicidal ideation in the literature (insomnia, hopelessness, loneliness, borderline personality traits, childhood trauma, negative life events) also predict persistence of suicidal ideation (i.e., reporting ideation at two consecutive assessment points, 6-and 9-years). We controlled for socio-demographics, clinical diagnosis and severity, medication use, and suicide attempt history.
   Results: Suicidal ideation decreased over time, and this decrease became slower with increasing time, with the majority of symptom reductions occurring in the first two years of follow-up. More severe insomnia and hopelessness were associated with increased odds of persistent suicidal ideation, and hopelessness was a significant mediator of the relationship between insomnia and persistent suicidal ideation.
   Limitations: Findings may not generalize to those with more severe suicidal ideation due to dropout of those with the worst clinical profile.
   Conclusions: Targeting insomnia and hopelessness in treatment may be particularly important to prevent the persistence of suicidal ideation.

AB The aim of the study was to investigate attitudes of secondary school students towards acceptability of requests by minors for end-of-life decisions (ELDs) with a possible life-shortening effect: non-treatment decisions, potentially life-shortening alleviation of pain and symptoms (APS) and euthanasia.
   A cross-sectional survey was conducted among second and fourth grades students in 20 secondary schools in Flanders, Belgium. An anonymous structured questionnaire was administered to measure attitudes towards acceptability of requests for euthanasia and other ELDs, towards the right to be informed about terminal prognosis and their own desire to be informed.
   In total, 1769 students participated. In case of a terminal patient, 61% found a request for euthanasia acceptable, 60% a request for APS and 69% a request for non-treatment decision, compared with 18% (euthanasia) and 50% (APS) in case of a non-terminal patient. Acceptance was highest among: boys, participants older than 14 years and participants from general as opposed to technical and vocational education. Sixty-six per cent said the parents' opinion not being asked was a circumstance that should hold back a physician from administering a lethal drug. Ninety per cent of participants thought a minor has the right to be informed about terminal prognosis of a disease while 78% would like to be informed themselves.
   Attitudes towards ELD requests varied with case and participant characteristics and type of ELD. The studied adolescents have a clear wish to be informed about terminal prognosis. Physicians and caregivers should adequately involve adolescents in decision making and tailor prognosis-related information to their needs and level of competency.

   ACTIVE EUTHANASIA; HASTENED DEATH; ATTITUDES; AUSTRALIA; MEDICINE;
   NETHERLANDS; PERCEPTIONS
AB Within developed nations, there is increasing public debate about and apparent endorsement of the appropriateness of euthanasia as an autonomous choice to die in the face of intolerable suffering. Surveys report socio-demographic differences in rates of acceptance of euthanasia, but there is little in-depth analysis of how euthanasia is understood and positioned within the social and moral lives of individuals, particularly those who might be considered Suitable candidates-for example, terminally-ill cancer patients. During discussions with 28 such patients in Australia regarding medical decisions at the end of life, euthanasia was raised by 13 patients, with the others specifically asked about it. Twenty-four patients spoke positively of euthanasia, 19 of these voicing some concerns. None identified euthanasia as a currently favoured option. Four were completely against it. Endorsement for euthanasia was in the context of a hypothetical future or for a hypothetical other person, or temporally associated with acute pain. Arguments supporting euthanasia framed the issue as a matter of freedom of choice, as preserving dignity in death, and as Curbing intolerable pain and suffering, both of the patient and of those around them. A common analogy featured was that of euthanising a dog. These arguments were typically presented as self-evident justification for euthanasia, construed as an appropriate choice to die, with opposers positioned as morally inferior or ignorant. The difficulties of ensuring 'choice' and the moral connotations of 'choosing to die,' however, worked to problematise the appropriateness of euthanising specific individuals. We recommend further empirical investigation of the moral and social meanings associated with euthanasia. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Cost analysis of medical assistance in dying in Canada
SO CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID OF-LIFE PRACTICES; EUTHANASIA LAW; BELGIUM; TRENDS; SUICIDE
AB BACKGROUND: The legalization of medical assistance in dying will affect health care spending in Canada. Our aim was to determine the potential costs and savings associated with the implementation of medical assistance in dying.
   METHODS: Using published data from the Netherlands and Belgium, where medically assisted death is legal, we estimated that medical assistance in dying will account for 1%-4% of all deaths; 80% of patients will have cancer; 50% of patients will be aged 60-80 years; 55% will be men; 60% of patients will have their lives shortened by 1 month; and 40% of patients will have their lives shortened by 1 week. We combined current mortality data for the Canadian population with recent end-of-life cost data to calculate a predicted range of savings associated with the implementation of medical assistance in dying. We also estimated the direct costs associated with offering medically assisted death, including physician consultations and drug costs.
   RESULTS: Medical assistance in dying could reduce annual health care spending across Canada by between $34.7 million and $138.8 million, exceeding the $1.5-$14.8 million in direct costs associated with its implementation. In sensitivity analyses, we noted that even if the potential savings are overestimated and costs underestimated, the implementation of mdedical assistance in dying will likely remain at least cost neutral.
   INTERPRETATION: Providing medical assistance in dying in Canada should not result in any excess financial burden to the health care system, and could result in substantial savings. Additional data on patients who choose medical assistance in dying in Canada should be collected to enable more precise estimates of the impact of medically assisted death on health care spending and to enable further economic evaluation.

AB Aim. The aim of this paper was to describe the frequency and the characteristics of continuous deep sedation in terminally ill patients.
   Methods. All patients who died in home palliative care units in the Florence area between March 1-December 31, 2000 and July 1, 2003-June 30, 2004 were prospectively analysed with regard to social, demographic, and clinical characteristics.
   Results. The data presented refer to 1075 patients (331 in 2000 and 744 in 2003-2004). Continuous deep sedation was applied in 14.2% and in 12% of patients, respectively. At baseline, patients who were sedated during the final stages of their life were more likely to be younger in age, to have poorer quality of life and better performance status. Such characteristics did not differ between the two periods. Hydration was not performed in 65% of all patients who finally received sedation in the period 2003-2004 versus 33% in those who did in 2000. In 2003-2004, the decision to use sedation was discussed with patients in 39% of those who were sedated. In 2003-2004, we noticed an increase in the use of benzodiazepines for continuous deep sedation from 43% to 87%. The increase in opioid average dosage from the onset of sedation until the last 24 h of their life was about seven-fold in 2000 and almost twice that amount in 2003-2004 in those patients who were not undergoing treatment with opioids when sedation started.
   Conclusion. The monitoring of end-of-life decision making and of medical practices involved in continuous deep sedation contributes to an enhancement in the quality of caring for terminally ill patients.

AB Drug utilization studies have applied different methods to various data types to describe medication use, which hampers comparisons across populations. The aim of this study was to describe the time trends in antidepressant prescribing in the last decade and the variation in the prevalence, calculated in a uniform manner, in seven European electronic healthcare databases.
   Annual prevalence per 10,000 person-years (PYs) was calculated for 2001-2009 in databases from Spain, Germany, Denmark, the United Kingdom (UK), and the Netherlands. Prevalence data were stratified according to age, sex, antidepressant type (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors [SSRIs] or tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs]) and major indications.
   The age- and sex-standardized prevalence was lowest in the two Dutch (391 and 429 users per 10,000 PYs) and highest in the two UK (913 and 936 users per 10,000 PYs) populations in 2008. The prevalence in the Danish, German, and Spanish populations was 637, 618, and 644 users per 10,000 PY respectively. Antidepressants were prescribed most often in 20- to 60-year-olds in the two UK populations compared with the others. SSRIs were prescribed more often than TCAs in all except the German population. In the majority of countries we observed an increasing trend of antidepressant prescribing over time. Two different methods identifying recorded indications yielded different ranges of proportions of patients recorded with the specific indication (15-57 % and 39-69 % for depression respectively).
   Despite applying uniform methods, variations in the prevalence of antidepressant prescribing were obvious in the different populations. Database characteristics and clinical factors may both explain these variations.

TI Age at Onset of Bipolar Disorder Related to Parental and Grandparental

AB Objective: The age at onset of bipolar disorder varies greatly in different countries and continents. The association between load of family history of psychiatric illness and age at onset has not been adequately explored.
   Methods: 979 outpatients with bipolar disorder (from 4 sites in the United States and 3 in the Netherlands and Germany) gave informed consent and completed a questionnaire about their demographics, age at onset of illness, and family history of unipolar and bipolar disorder, alcohol and substance abuse comorbidity, suicide attempts, and "other" illnesses in their parents, 4 grandparents, and any offspring. We examined how the parental and grandparental burden of these illnesses related to the age at onset of the patients' bipolar disorder.
   Results: The burden of family psychiatric history was strongly related to an earlier age at onset of illness in both US and European patients (F-3,F-906 = 35.42, P<.0001). However, compared to the Europeans, patients in the United States had both more family history of most difficulties and notably earlier age at onset. Earlier age at onset was associated with a greater illness burden in the patient's offspring (t(568) = 4.1, P<.0001).
   Conclusions: More parental and grandparental psychiatric illness was associated with an earlier age at onset of bipolar disorder, which is earlier in the United States compared with Europe and is strongly related to a poor long-term prognosis. This apparent polygenic contribution to early onset deserves further study and therapeutic attempts at ameliorating the transgenerational impact.

AB This study investigates the background and evolution of requests to forgo treatment and hasten death in terminally ill cancer patients. Physicians participating in a nationwide study on end-of-life decision making were asked whether they were treating a terminally ill cancer patient whose life expectancy was longer than 7 week but no longer than 3 months and who they would continue to treat until the patient's death. Of the 120 physicians who had a patient who met the inclusion criteria, 85 (70.8 %) completed a questionnaire each month until the patient's death. The questionnaire provided information on the patient's symptoms, concerns, and requests involving end-of-life decisions. Most patients suffered from cancer of the gastrointestinal tract or the respiratory system, and 66 % died within 2 months of the initial interview. The prevalence of requests involving end-of-life decisions increased during the last 3 months of a patient's life. The evolution of a request was especially related to an increase in the number of severe symptoms and concerns. Requests to forgo treatment were related to general weakness, whereas loss of dignity was a major reason for requests to hasten death. Physical suffering alone appeared to lead to less drastic requests than suffering blended by concerns and psychological problems leading to requests for hastened death. The results emphasize the importance of gaining insight into the Patients' suffering to provide meaningful assistance. J Pain Symptom Manage 2006;31:100-110.

AB Introduction With an ageing population, end-of-life care is increasing in importance. The present work investigated characteristics and time trends of older peoples' attitudes towards euthanasia and an end-of-life pill.
   Methods Three samples aged 64 years or older from the Longitudinal Ageing Study Amsterdam (N = 1284 (2001), N = 1303 (2005) and N = 1245 (2008)) were studied. Respondents were asked whether they could imagine requesting their physician to end their life (euthanasia), or imagine asking for a pill to end their life if they became tired of living in the absence of a severe disease (end-of-life pill). Using logistic multivariable techniques, changes of attitudes over time and their association with demographic and health characteristics were assessed.
   Results The proportion of respondents with a positive attitude somewhat increased over time, but significantly only among the 64-74 age group. For euthanasia, these percentages were 58% (2001), 64% (2005) and 70% (2008) (OR of most recent versus earliest period (95% CI): 1.30 (1.17 to 1.44)). For an end-of-life pill, these percentages were 31% (2001), 33% (2005) and 45% (2008) (OR (95% CI): 1.37 (1.23 to 1.52)). For the end-of-life pill, interaction between the most recent time period and age group was significant.
   Conclusions An increasing proportion of older people reported that they could imagine desiring euthanasia or an end-of-life pill. This may imply an increased interest in deciding about your own life and stresses the importance to take older peoples' wishes seriously.

AB Objective: To establish the role of psychiatrists and mental disorder in assisted dying practices in countries and states where such practices are legal. Methods: The authors reviewed the Assisted Dying Acts and official statistical reports from Belgium, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, and the states of Washington and Oregon in the USA. The data extracted related to the role of psychiatrists in assisted dying practices, and the relevance of capacity, 'suffering', and mental disorder. Results: A psychiatry referral is recommended or required by all countries and states in certain circumstances. These circumstances include mental disorder 'impairing judgement' in Oregon and Washington, and cases of exclusive mental disorder in European countries. 'Exclusive tnental disorder' refers to those with a mental disorder (e.g., major depression) who apply for assisted dying in the absence of any terminal physical illness. Capacity/competence and necessary suffering must be present. On average, 5.4% (range 4.2%-6.7%) of applicants see a psychiatrist. Patients with exclusive mental disorder can apply for assisted dying in European countries but not in Oregon and Washington; actual figures are low. Conclusions: No country has a blanket policy of mandatory psychiatric review but the specialty contributes in circumstances of exclusive mental disorder or when there is doubt regarding capacity and sound judgement. The absence of a mandatory role for psychiatrists means that reversible psychopathology may be missed. As a result, the patient's decision to end his/her life may be more informed by treatable mental disorder than by his/her lifelong preferences. (Psychosomatics 2012; 53:319-326)

AB Purpose: In the legal performance of the euthanasia procedure, unbearable suffering, one of the requirements of due care, is difficult to assess. Evaluation of the current knowledge of unbearable suffering is needed in the ongoing debate about the conditions on which EAS can be approved.
   Methods: Using an integrative literature review, we evaluated publications with definitions of suffering in general or in end-of-life situations and with descriptions of suffering in the context of a request for EAS.
   Data synthesis: From the 1482 citations identified, we included 55 publications: 20 articles about definitions of suffering and 35 empirical studies on suffering. We found no definition of unbearable suffering in the context of a request for EAS. Qualitative patient-centered studies revealed the most motivations, and the most motivations named by only one of the three parties involved. The studies of relatives were limited, mainly quantitative and retrospective. We found no studies that brought together the views of the patients, relatives, and healthcare professionals.
   Conclusions: There is no generally accepted definition of 'unbearable suffering' in the context of a request for EAS. On the basis of the articles reviewed, we propose the following conceptual definition: 'Unbearable suffering in the context of a request for EAS is a profoundly personal experience of an actual or perceived impending threat to the integrity or life of the person, which has a significant duration and a central place in the person's mind'. Further patient-centered qualitative research into suffering is needed to clarify this definition. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Background: We wanted to examine how the acceptance of euthanasia among the general public in Western Europe has changed in the last decades, and we wanted to look for possible explanations. Methods: We analysed data from the European Values Surveys, held in 1981, 1990, and 1999-2000 in 12 West European countries. In each country, representative samples of the general public were interviewed using the same structured questionnaire in all countries. Euthanasia was explained in the questionnaires as 'terminating the life of the incurably sick'. Results: A total of 46 199 respondents participated in the surveys. A significant increase in acceptance of euthanasia could be observed in all countries except (West) Germany. While the average increase in euthanasia acceptance was 22%, the increase was particularly obvious in Belgium, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. Although changes in several characteristics of respondents, such as decrease in religious beliefs, rising belief in the right to self-determination, and (to a lesser extent) rise in levels of education, were associated with growing acceptance of euthanasia, they could only partly explain the increase of euthanasia acceptance over the years. Conclusions: An increase of euthanasia acceptance among the general public took place over the last two decades in almost all West European countries, possibly indicating a growing support for personal autonomy regarding medical end-of-life decisions. If this trend continues, it is likely to increase the public and political debate about the (legal) regulation of euthanasia under certain conditions of careful medical practice in several West European countries.

AB Background: Although dignity is increasingly considered a goal of palliative care, little research has evaluated the understanding of dignity at the end of life from a caregiver's perspective. Objective: The study objective was to investigate and compare the views of trained volunteers and SCEN physicians on maintaining dignity for patients reaching the end of life. Design: The study is a survey questionnaire study.Subjects: Subjects were two groups of caregivers involved in care for dying patients: trained volunteers (n=236) and end-of-life consultants (SCEN physicians; n=427). Measurements: Measurement was done via the Dutch version of the 22-item Patient Dignity Inventory on symptoms and experiences that have been shown to influence the sense of dignity in terminally ill patients. Respondents were asked to rate on a five-point scale the extent to which they considered the items as influential on dignity in terminally ill patients, and as problematic in practice in maintaining dignity for patients in the last phase of life. Results: Overall, volunteers indicated items more frequently as influential to dignity and as problematic in maintaining dignity at the end of life, compared to SCEN physicians. Volunteers gave significantly higher ratings than SCEN physicians to most of the social items, and to half of the psychological and existential items. Conclusions: It seems that SCEN physicians consider the physical aspects of suffering to be most influential and problematic in practice in preserving dignity, while volunteers think psychosocial aspects are most important in preserving dignity at the end of life. These findings suggest that the role and responsibilities of caregivers involved in care for terminally ill patients affect the factors that they think influence dignity.

TI The Development of an Instrument To Measure Factors that Influence

AB Background: Preserving dignity can be considered as a goal of palliative care. To provide dignity-conserving care, it is relevant to identify the factors that influence a patient's self-perceived dignity. This study aims to develop an instrument to measure factors affecting self-perceived dignity that has good content validity and is appropriate for use in practice.
   Methods: Data were collected in the Advance Directives Cohort Study. In 2008, the cohort received a questionnaire with 31 items that might influence one's self-perceived dignity. For a subsample of people with poor health (n = 292), we analyzed which items could be removed because of the mean scores for presence of the item and its influence on dignity.
   Results: The 31 items fell into four domains: evaluation of self in relation to others, functional status, mental state, and care and situational aspects. Mean scores for presence and influence on dignity showed large differences and were not correlated. Six items were scarcely present and did not substantially affect self-perceived dignity. Because three of these were expected to influence dignity in other settings, only three items could be removed and two items could be combined into one. After calculating correlations between conceptually similar items, one extra item could be removed.
   Conclusion: Reducing the instrument to 26 items and dichotomizing the answer option for presence increases its feasibility for use in practice. The instrument offers an important step to better understanding the phenomenon of self-perceived dignity by gaining information directly from patients.

AB OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to investigate the attitudes of adolescent cancer survivors toward end-of-life decisions with life-shortening effects, including nontreatment decisions (NTDs), intensified alleviation of pain and symptoms (APS), and euthanasia, and the influence of illness experience on these attitudes.
   METHODS: Adolescent cancer survivors were interviewed with a structured questionnaire using hypothetical case descriptions. The results were compared with a study of 1769 adolescents without experience of chronic illness.
   RESULTS: Eighty-three adolescents, 11 to 18 years of age, were interviewed. In terminal situations, 70% to 90% found requests for NTDs acceptable, 84% requests for APS, and 57% to 64% requests for euthanasia. Requests for end-of-life decisions were less acceptable in non-terminal situations, where 28% found requests for NTDs acceptable, 39% to 47% requests for APS, and 11% to 21% requests for euthanasia. Frequently cited reasons for holding back physicians from administering a lethal drug to a child were the child not being well informed about his or her condition (92%) and the parents' opinion not being asked (92%). Compared with adolescents without experience with chronic illness, cancer survivors were more accepting toward requests for NTDs and APS in terminal situations.
   CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent cancer survivors, like other adolescents, want to be involved in medical decision-making at the end of life. They value autonomous decision-making, without excluding parents from the process. The experience of living through a life-threatening illness can alter adolescents' attitudes toward requests for NTDs and APS. Pediatrics 2009; 124: e1142-e1148

AB The present study examines reasons for adolescent deliberate self-harm. A cross-sectional survey using an anonymous self-report questionnaire was carried out in seven countries (Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway). Data on 30,477 school pupils between the ages of 14-17 were analysed. Past year and lifetime deliberate self-harm were assessed, along with the self-reported reasons for deliberate self-harm. The results showed that 'wanted to get relief from a terrible state of mind' and 'wanted to die' were most commonly reported. Principal component analysis indicated two underlying dimensions in the reasons for deliberate self-harm, i.e. a cry of pain motive and/or a cry for help motive. The majority of self-harmers reported at least one cry of pain motive ('to die', 'to punish myself', and 'to get relief from a terrible state of mind') and an additional cry for help motive ('to show how desperate I was feeling', to frighten someone', 'to get my own back on someone', 'to find out whether someone really loved me', and 'to get some attention'). Females reported more reasons than males. Only females showed an age difference, with girls aged 16-17 more frequently reporting a cry for help motive. There was considerable consistency in choice of motives across countries and genders. Systematic assessment of the reasons for deliberate self-harm can help clinicians to better understand the meaning of self harming behaviour, select appropriate treatment, suggest alternative coping strategies, and hopefully prevent future suicidal behaviour.

AB Background: Information on the natural course of subthreshold depression and risk factors for the development of a full-blown depressive disorder in the general population is scarce. This information is crucial to understand the development of depression and to advance indicated depression prevention.
   Methods: Using longitudinal data from a representative population-based study (the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2) we assessed 3-year course of subthreshold depression (depressive symptoms causing clinically significant distress for at least 2 weeks, or for 3 days per month for a year; n = 120), compared to an asymptomatic group (n = 4111) and a depressive disorder group (major depression or dysthymia; n = 294). Next, risk factors for the development of a depressive disorder among adults with subthreshold depression were determined.
   Results: Twelve percent of the subthreshold cases developed a full-blown depressive disorder during 3-year follow-up. Risk factors were lower social support, having recurrent short episodes of depressive symptomatology, remitted and current anxiety disorder, remitted substance use disorder, lifetime suicide thoughts, a chronic physical disorder and diminished mental and physical functioning.
   Limitations: The number of subjects with subthreshold depression that developed a depressive disorder was small. This limits the possibility to detect significant risk factors.
   Conclusion: Only a minority of the subthreshold cases developed a full-blown depressive disorder over three years. This shows that subthreshold depression does not, by itself, carry an a priori risk to warrant focusing indicated prevention. The identified risk factors could help to detect those subthreshold cases in whom depression prevention is economically and practically viable.

AB Objectives: To describe the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients who sought medication under the Washington State Death with Dignity (DWD) Act since its inception in 2009.
   Methods: Chart review at 3 tertiary medical centers in the Seattle/Puget Sound region and comparison to publicly available data of ALS and all-cause DWD cohorts from Washington and Oregon.
   Results: In Washington State, 39 patients with ALS requested DWD from the University of Washington, Virginia Mason, and Swedish Medical Centers beginning in 2009. The median age at death was 65 years (range 46-86). Seventy-seven percent of the patients used the prescriptions. All of the patients who used the medications passed away without complications. The major reasons for patients to request DWD as reported by participating physicians were loss of autonomy and dignity and decrease in enjoyable activities. Inadequate pain control, financial cost, and loss of bodily control were less commonly indicated. These findings were similar to those of the 92 patients who sought DWD in Oregon. In Washington and Oregon, the percentage of patients with ALS seeking DWD is higher compared to the cancer DWD cohort. Furthermore, compared to the all-cause DWD cohort, patients with ALS are more likely to be non-Hispanic white, married, educated, enrolled in hospice, and to have died at home.
   Conclusions: Although a small number, ALS represents the disease with the highest proportion of patients seeking to participate in DWD. Patients with ALS who choose DWD are well-educated and have access to palliative or life-prolonging care. The use of the medications appears to be able to achieve the patients' goals without complications.

AB Background: Little is known about the practice of palliative sedation (PS) in Germany. This paper presents an analysis of sedation-related data obtained from the German standardized core documentation system (HOPE) for palliative care patients.
   Methods: HOPE was complemented by an optional module on ethical decision making (EDM) which was pretested in 2004, data was collected in 2005-6 during the annual 3-month census. Data was analyzed descriptively from palliative care units (PCU - representative) and inpatient hospice (H - non-representative control group). Chi(2) test was used to test for differences between the reported data per item and year within one kind of setting (significance level p <= 0.05). Free-text entries were categorized inductively.
   Results: Datasets were obtained for 1,944 patients (P) with EDM. PS was performed in 13.0/11.8% (2005/2006) P in palliative care units (PCU) and 25.5/22.9% in hospices (H). Main reasons for PS in PCU were dyspnea, pain, fear or anxiety, in H reasons were inconsistent, high prevalence of psychosocial reasons. Most PS in PCU and about half of the PS in H were intermittent. Sedated P were younger than non-sedated. Only 7 P received PS after asking for euthanasia. The most used medication was midazolam.
   Conclusions: This study reveals a first insight into the use and practice of PS in German PCU and H. For a more detailed systematic survey into the course of decision-making and procedures, a new complementary optional module on PS is being developed by the HOPE group.

AB Background This study aimed to examine prevalence and risk factors of deliberate self-harm in Dutch and Dutch-speaking Belgian adolescents. Method A cross sectional survey using an anonymous self report questionnaire was performed in both countries. Data on 4,431 Belgian and 4,458 Dutch 15 16 year-old school pupils were analyzed. Results Results showed a significant difference between the two countries indicating that lifetime and past year prevalence of deliberate self-harm were both 2.8 times higher in Belgian adolescents than in Dutch adolescents. Further analyses identified differences in the prevalence of factors associated with deliberate self-harm, with Belgian adolescents showing significant higher scores on anxiety, less problem-oriented coping and more common use of alcohol and soft drugs. Belgian adolescents were also at higher risk for the experience of several life events in the previous year and before that such as conflicts with peers, parents and partner, being bullied at school or exposure to suicidal behavior in family and friends. In addition, Belgian adolescents showed less communication with family or teachers about their problems and difficulties. Conclusions The results of the study suggest that the increased risk of deliberate self-harm among Belgian adolescents may be associated with an increased reporting of several important life events and with additional ineffective problem-solving such as less problem-oriented coping, more substance use and less communication about their problems. These results support the assumption that sociocultural aspects of nations can influence the risk of deliberate self-harm and are important to consider when developing prevention strategies.

AB To explore medical students' views of assisted death practices in patient cases that describe different degrees and types of physical and mental suffering, an anonymous survey was administered to all students at one medical school. Respondents were asked about the acceptability of assisted death activities in five patient vignettes and withdrawal of life support in a sixth vignette. In the vignettes, actions were performed by four possible agents: the medical student personally; a referral physician; physicians in general; or non-physicians. Of 306 medical students, 166 (54 %) participated. Respondents expressed opposition or uncertainty about assisted death practices in the five patient cases that illustrated severe forms of suffering which were secondary to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, treatment-resistant depressive and somatoform disorders, antisocial and sexually violent behavior, or AIDS. Students supported the withdrawal of life support in the sixth vignette depicting exceptional futility secondary to AIDS. Students were especially opposed to their own involvement and to the participation of non-physicians in assisted death activities. Differences in views related to sex, religious beliefs, and personal philosophy were found. Medical students do not embrace assisted death practices, although they exhibit tolerance regarding the choices of medical colleagues. How these attributes of medical students will translate into future behaviors toward patients and peers remains uncertain. Medical educators must strive to understand the perspectives of physicians-in-training. Expanded, empirically informed education that is attuned to the attitudes of medical students may be helpful in fulfilling the responsibility of imparting optimal clinical care skills.

AB In 2002, Belgium saw the enactment of 3 laws concerning euthanasia, palliative care, and patient rights that are likely to affect end-of-life decision making. This report examines trends in the occurrence and decision-making process of end-of-life practices in different patient groups since these legal changes. A large-scale retrospective survey in Flanders, Belgium, previously conducted in 1998 and 2001, was repeated in 2007. Questionnaires regarding end-of-life practices and the preceding decision-making process were mailed to physicians who certified a representative sample (N = 6927) of death certificates. The 2007 response rate was 58.4%. In patient groups in which the prevalence of life-ending drug use without explicit patient request has dropped, performance of euthanasia and assisted suicide has increased. The consistent increase in intensified pain and symptom alleviation was found in all patient groups except cancer patients. In 2007, competent patients were slightly more often involved in the discussion of end-of-life practices than in previous years. Over the years, involvement of the patient in decision making was consistently more likely among younger patients, cancer patients, and those dying at home. Physicians consulted their colleagues more often than in previous years for euthanasia and nontreatment decisions. The euthanasia law and emerging palliative care culture have substantially affected the occurrence and decision making for end-of-life practices in Belgium. Efforts are still needed to encourage shared end-of-life decision making, as some patients would benefit from advance care planning.

AB Objectives: To assess French district nurses' opinions towards euthanasia and to study factors associated with these opinions, with emphasis on attitudes towards terminal patients.
   Design and setting: An anonymous telephone survey carried out in 2005 among a national random sample of French district nurses.
   Participants: District nurses currently delivering home care who have at least 1 year of professional experience. Of 803 district nurses contacted, 602 agreed to participate (response rate 75%).
   Main outcome measures: Opinion towards the legalisation of euthanasia (on a five-point Likert scale from '' strongly agree '' to '' strongly disagree ''), attitudes towards terminal patients (discussing end-of-life issues with them, considering they should be told their prognosis, valuing the role of advance directives and surrogates).
   Results: Overall, 65% of the 602 nurses favoured legalising euthanasia. Regarding associated factors, this proportion was higher among those who discuss end-of-life issues with terminal patients (70%), who consider competent patients should always be told their prognosis (81%) and who value the role of advance directives and surrogates in end-of-life decision-making for incompetent patients (68% and 77% respectively). Women and older nurses were less likely to favour legalising euthanasia, as were those who believed in a god who masters their destiny.
   Conclusions: French nurses are more in favour of legalising euthanasia than French physicians; these two populations contrast greatly in the factors associated with this support. Further research is needed to investigate how and to what extent such attitudes may affect nursing practice and emotional well-being in the specific context of end-of-life home care.

AB Changes in medical practices during transitions in regulating healthcare are rarely investigated. In this study, we investigated changes in medical end-of-life decisions with a possible or certain life-shortening effect (ELDs) that occurred during the legalization process of euthanasia in Belgium. We took representative random samples from deaths reported to registries in Flanders, Belgium in 1998 (n = 3999) at the beginning of the process and in 2001 (N = 5005), at the end of the process. The reporting physicians received an anonymous mail questionnaire about possible ELDs preceding the death involved. We found no significant shifts in the epidemiology of diseases between 1998 and 2001. The overall incidence of ELDs did not change. The incidence decreased for euthanasia, administering life-ending drugs without patient's explicit request, and alleviation of pain and symptoms with life-shortening co-intention. Incidence increased for alleviation of pain and symptom without life-shortening intention, and remained stable for non-treatment decisions. All decisions in 2001 were more often discussed with patients, their relatives and nurses. In 2001, continuous deep sedation was reported in 8.3% of deaths. We can conclude that physicians' end-of-life practices have substantially changed during the short but tumultuous legalization process of euthanasia in Belgium. Although follow-up research is needed to investigate the continuance of these changes, it is important for policy makers to keep in mind that social factors related to transitions in healthcare regulation may play an important role in the physicians' actual behaviour.

AB In the last decade, the number of patients continuously deeply sedated until death increased up to fourfold. The reasons for this increase remain unclear.
   To identify socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of sedated patients, and concurrent possibly life-shortening medical end-of-life decisions.
   Cross-sectional death certificate study in German-speaking Switzerland in 2001 and 2013.
   Non-sudden and expected deaths (2001: N = 2281, 2013: N = 2256) based on a random sample of death certificates and followed by an anonymous survey on end-of-life practices among attending physicians.
   Physicians' reported proportion of patients continuously deeply sedated until death, socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, and possibly life-shortening medical end-of life decisions.
   In 2013, physicians sedated four times more patients continuously until death (6.7% in 2001; 24.5.5% in 2013). Four out of five sedated patients died in hospitals, outside specialized palliative care units, or in nursing homes. Sedation was more likely among patients younger than 65 (odds ratio 2.24, 95% CI 1.6 to 3.2) and those dying in specialized palliative care (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.8) or in hospitals (1.7, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.3). Forgoing life-prolonging treatment with the explicit intention to hasten or not to postpone death combined with intensified alleviation of symptoms was very strongly associated with continuous deep sedation (OR 6.8, 95% CI 4.7 to 9.8).
   In Swiss clinical practice, continuously deeply sedated patients predominantly died outside specialized palliative care. The increasing trend over time appears to be related to changes in medical end-of-life practice rather than to patient's clinical characteristics.

AB Context. Since the legalization of euthanasia, physicians in Belgium may, under certain conditions, administer life-ending drugs at the explicit request of a patient.
   Objectives. To study the attitudes of Belgian physicians toward the use of life-ending drugs and euthanasia law, factors predicting attitudes, and factors predicting whether a physician has ever performed euthanasia.
   Methods. In 2009, we sent a questionnaire to a representative sample of 3006 Belgian physicians who, because of their specialty, were likely to be involved in the care of the dying.
   Results. Response rate was 34%. Ninety percent of physicians studied were accepting of euthanasia for terminal patients who had extreme uncontrollable pain/symptoms. Sixty-six percent agreed that the euthanasia law contributes to the carefulness of physicians' end-of-life behavior; 10% agreed that the law impedes the development of palliative care. Religious beliefs and geographic region were strong determinants of attitude. Training in palliative care did not influence attitudes regarding euthanasia, but trained physicians were less likely to agree that the euthanasia law impedes the development of palliative care than were nontrained physicians. One in five physicians had performed euthanasia; they were more likely to be nonreligious, older, specialist, trained in palliative care, and to have had more experience in treating the dying.
   Conclusion. Most physicians studied support euthanasia for terminal patients with extreme uncontrollable pain/symptoms and agree that euthanasia can be part of good end-of-life care. Although physicians had little involvement in the process of legalizing euthanasia, they now generally endorse the euthanasia law. J Pain Symptom Manage 2011; 41: 580-593.

AB Background The Dutch euthanasia law regulates physician assistance in dying for patients who are suffering unbearably from a medical condition. We studied the attitudes of the Dutch population to assistance in dying for older persons who have a wish to die without the presence of a serious medical condition.
   Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a random sample of the Dutch public (response rate 78%, n= 1960), using statements and vignettes about attitudes to assistance in dying for older persons who are tired of living.
   Results A minority of 26% agreed with a vignette in which a physician warrants the request for physician-assisted suicide of an older person who is tired of living without having a serious medical condition. Furthermore, 21% agreed with the statement 'In my opinion euthanasia should be allowed for persons who are tired of living without having a serious disease'. People supporting euthanasia for older persons who are tired of living were more likely than opponents to be highly educated (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.1 to 2.3), to be non-religious (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.3 to 2.3), to have little trust in physicians (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2 to 2.2), and to prefer to make their own healthcare decisions (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.3 to 2.3).
   Conclusions Although it is lower than the level of support for assistance in dying for patients whose suffering is rooted in a serious medical condition, our finding that a substantial minority of the general public supports physician assistance in dying for older people who are tired of living implies that this topic may need to be taken seriously in the debate about end-of-life decision-making.

AB Background: In recent decades, the general public has become increasingly receptive toward a legislation that allows active voluntary euthanasia (AVE). The purpose of this study was to survey the current attitude towards AVE within the Austrian population and to identify explanatory factors in the areas of socio-demographics, personal experiences with care, and ideological orientation. A further objective was to examine differences depending on the type of problem formulation (abstract vs. situational) for the purpose of measuring attitude.
   Methods: A representative cross-sectional study was conducted across the Austrian population. Data were acquired from 1,000 individuals aged 16 years and over based on telephone interviews (CATI). For the purpose of measuring attitude toward AVE, two different problem formulations (abstract vs. situational) were juxtaposed.
   Results: The abstract question about active voluntary euthanasia was answered negatively by 28.8%, while 71.2% opted in favour of AVE or were undecided. Regression analyses showed rejection of AVE was positively correlated with number of adults and children in the household, experience with care of seriously ill persons, a conservative worldview, and level of education. Mean or high family income was associated with lower levels of rejection. No independent correlations were found for variables such as sex, age, political orientation, self-rated health, and experiences with care of terminally ill patients. Correlation for the situational problem formulation was weaker and included fewer predictors than for the abstract question.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that factors relating to an individual's interpersonal living situation and his/her cognitive convictions might be important determinants of the attitude toward AVE. If and to the extent that personal care experience plays a role, it is rather associated with rejection than with acceptance of AVE.

AB Background: Strongly marked ideological positions on the impact of palliative care and limited hard data plague the debate on physician-assisted death.
   Methods: A national cross-sectional study on the requests to hasten death (RHD) was conducted among 789 French palliative care organisations. Data were collected for all patients with RHD encountered during year 2010. Data on patients' characteristics, medical, psychological and social context, symptoms, nature of palliative management, patient's evolution and palliative care team's interpretation of the request were obtained.
   Findings: A majority of centres responded and 342 teams provided descriptions of 783 RHD, 476 by a patient, 258 by relatives or close friends and 49 by the nursing staff. Cancer was the most frequent pathology (72%) and 68% of the patients had entered terminal stage. Patients rarely appeared with uncontrolled pain (3.7%), but had difficulties with feeding (65%), moving (54%), excretion (49%), or were cachectic (39%); 31% were considered to be anxio-depressive; 79% did not give physical reasons for their request; 37% of RHD were maintained and 24% fluctuated despite provision of regular follow-up by a palliative care team to 83% of all cases; 68% of patients died within a month; the interpretation of RHD by the staff was a wish for relief (69%), patient's inextricable situation (44%), actual desire not to continue living (36%) or to be helped to die (30%).
   Interpretation: The large number of described cases provides, for the first time, comprehensive hard data on the evolution of RHDs in a country that has not legalised euthanasia. Whatever the way RHD are expressed, they are frequently maintained despite adequate palliative care with suitable control of pain and psychological support by specialists. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Context. Since 2002, the administration of a lethal drug by a physician at the explicit request of the patient has been legal in Belgium. The incidence of euthanasia in Belgium has been studied, but the process and outcomes of euthanasia requests have not been investigated.
   Objectives. To describe which euthanasia requests were granted, withdrawn, and rejected since the enactment of the euthanasia law in terms of the characteristics of the patient, treating physician, and aspects of the consultation with a second physician.
   Methods. A representative sample of 3006 Belgian physicians received a questionnaire investigating their most recent euthanasia request.
   Results. The response rate was 34%. Since 2002, 39% of respondents had received a euthanasia request. Forty-eight percent of requests had been carried out, 5% had been refused, 10% had been withdrawn, and in 23%, the patient had died before euthanasia could be performed. Physicians' characteristics associated with receiving a request were not being religious, caring for a high number of terminally ill patients, and having experience in palliative care. Patient characteristics associated with granting a request were age, having cancer, loss of dignity, having no depression, and suffering without prospect of improvement as a reason for requesting euthanasia. A positive initial position toward the request from the attending physician and positive advice from the second physician also contributed to having a request granted.
   Conclusion. Under the Belgian Act on Euthanasia, about half of the requests are granted. Factors related to the reason for the request, position of the attending physician toward the request, and advice from the second physician influence whether a request is granted or not.

AB Background Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) may have a life-long impact on mental health and are related to physical disease, such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in adulthood. Research on ACEs suffers from recall bias when performed with adults.
   Objective: To estimate the prevalence of ACEs and the interrelationships between ACEs as reported by children, and to determine the impact on their self-reported quality of life (QoL). Children's opinions on the ACE-Questionnaire were also obtained.
   Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted with a child version of the ACE-Questionnaire. This questionnaire assesses parental separation or divorce, physical and emotional child abuse and neglect, sexual violence, domestic violence, household substance abuse, psychological issues or suicide, and incarceration of a household member. QoL was measured with the Kidscreen-10.
   Participants and setting: The questionnaire was completed by 644 children at a mean age of 11 years (range 9-13 years), in the two last grades of regular elementary schools, recruited throughout the Netherlands.
   Results: Data were weighted by ethnicity to obtain a representative sample of children in Dutch elementary education. Of all children, 45.3% had one or more out of ten ACEs. Child maltreatment was experienced by 26.4%. ACEs often co-occurred. A higher number of ACEs correlated with a lower mean level of QoL (p < 0.001). Mean QoL was 8.5 points lower (Cohen's d = 0.8) in children who experienced child maltreatment. Children's opinions on the questionnaire were positive in 82.4%.
   Conclusion: Prevention of ACEs, professional training and trauma-focus in schools are urgently needed.

AB This article analyses domestic and foreign reactions to a 2008 report in the British Medical Journal on the complementary and, as argued, synergistic relationship between palliative care and euthanasia in Belgium. The earliest initiators of palliative care in Belgium in the late 1970s held the view that access to proper palliative care was a precondition for euthanasia to be acceptable and that euthanasia and palliative care could, and should, develop together. Advocates of euthanasia including author Jan Bernheim, independent from but together with British expatriates, were among the founders of what was probably the first palliative care service in Europe outside of the United Kingdom. In what has become known as the Belgian model of integral end-of-life care, euthanasia is an available option, also at the end of a palliative care pathway. This approach became the majority view among the wider Belgian public, palliative care workers, other health professionals, and legislators. The legal regulation of euthanasia in 2002 was preceded and followed by a considerable expansion of palliative care services. It is argued that this synergistic development was made possible by public confidence in the health care system and widespread progressive social attitudes that gave rise to a high level of community support for both palliative care and euthanasia. The Belgian model of so-called integral end-of-life care is continuing to evolve, with constant scrutiny of practice and improvements to procedures. It still exhibits several imperfections, for which some solutions are being developed. This article analyses this model by way of answers to a series of questions posed by Journal of Bioethical Inquiry consulting editor Michael Ashby to the Belgian authors.

AB Background: Early onset depression (EOD) and late onset depression (LOD) may be different phenomena. In this study, differences between EOD and LOD in symptomatology, psychiatric characteristics and psychosocial/somatic factors were examined.
   Methods: Baseline data were from 1104 participants with a current major depressive disorder participating in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (age range 18-65 years). DSM-IV diagnoses, depressive symptoms and age of onset were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Analyses were performed by using a continuous as well as a dichotomous (cut-off 40 years) age of onset indicator.
   Results: Differences between EOD and LOD were observed: longer duration of symptoms (p<.001), a personal history of depressive episodes (p<.001), a serious suicide attempt (p<.001), childhood events (p<.001), a family history of depression (p=.03), and high neuroticism (p<.001) were more often present in EOD than in LOD. Also differences in symptomatology were observed: feelings of sadness (p<.001), diminished concentration (p=.02) and suicidal thoughts (p=.001) were significantly less prevalent at a higher age of onset, whereas decreased appetite/weight loss (p=.01) was more prominent at a higher age of onset. Limitations: The age of first depression onset was asked retrospectively and might be biased by selective recall. However, participants can likely recall whether symptoms started earlier or later in life.
   Conclusions: Despite similarities, our observed differential findings in symptoms, psychiatric characteristics, and psychosocial factors between EOD and LOD further support that EOD is associated with more frequent occurrence of some clinical features of depression. These differential findings are important factors to keep in mind for diagnostics, treatment, and prevention. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Deliberate self-harm among young people is an important focus of policy and practice internationally. Nonetheless, there is little reliable comparative international information on its extent or characteristics. We have conducted a seven-country comparative community study of deliberate self-harm among young people. Method: Over 30,000 mainly 15- and 16-year-olds completed anonymous questionnaires at school in Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway. Study criteria were developed to identify episodes of self-harm; the prevalence of self-harm acts and thoughts, methods used, repetition, reasons given, premeditation, setting for the act, associations with alcohol and drugs, hospitalisation, and whether other people knew, were examined. Results: Self-harm was more than twice as common among females as males and, in four of the seven countries, at least one in ten females had harmed herself in the previous year. Additional young people had thought of harming themselves without doing so. More males and females in all countries except Hungary cut themselves than used any other method, most acts took place at home, and alcohol and illegal drugs were not usually involved. The most common reasons given were 'to get relief from a terrible state of mind' followed by 'to die', although there were differences between those cutting themselves and those taking overdoses. About half the young people decided to harm themselves in the hour before doing so, and many did not attend hospital or tell anyone else. Just over half those who had harmed themselves during the previous year reported more than one episode over their lifetime. Conclusions: Deliberate self-harm is a widespread yet often hidden problem in adolescents, especially females, which shows both similarities and differences internationally.

AB This study aimed to examine differences in all-cause mortality and main causes of death across different migrant and local-born populations living in six European countries. We used data from population and mortality registers from Denmark, England & Wales, France, Netherlands, Scotland, and Spain. We calculated age-standardized mortality rates for men and women aged 0-69 years. Country-specific data were pooled to assess weighted mortality rate ratios (MRRs) using Poisson regression. Analyses were stratified by age group, country of destination, and main cause of death. In six countries combined, all-cause mortality was lower for men and women from East Asia (MRRs 0.66; 95 % confidence interval 0.62-0.71 and 0.76; 0.69-0.82, respectively), and Other Latin America (0.44; 0.42-0.46 and 0.56; 0.54-0.59, respectively) than local-born populations. Mortality rates were similar for those from Turkey. All-cause mortality was higher in men and women from North Africa (1.09; 1.08-1.11 and 1.19; 1.17-1.22, respectively) and Eastern Europe (1.30; 1.27-1.33 and 1.05; 1.01-1.08, respectively), and women from Sub-Saharan Africa (1.34; 1.30-1.38). The pattern differed by age group and country of destination. Most migrants had higher mortality due to infectious diseases and homicide while cancer mortality and suicide were lower. CVD mortality differed by migrant population. To conclude, mortality patterns varied across migrant populations in European countries. Future research should focus both on migrant populations with favourable and less favourable mortality pattern, in order to understand this heterogeneity and to drive policy at the European level.

AB PURPOSE Little is known about the role family physicians play when a patient deliberately hastens death by voluntarily stopping eating and drinking (VSED). The purpose of this study was to gain more insight for family physicians when confronted with patients who wish to hasten death by VSED. We aimed to describe physicians' involvement in VSED, to describe characteristics and motives of their patients, and to describe the process of VSED in terms of duration, as well as common symptoms in the last 3 days of life.
   METHODS We undertook a survey of a random national sample of 1,100 family physicians (response rate 72%), and 500 of these physicians received questions about their last patient who hastened death by VSED.
   RESULTS Of the 978 eligible physicians, 708 responded (72.4%); 46% had cared for a patient who hastened death by VSED. Of the 500 physicians who received the additional questions, 440 were eligible and 285 (64.8%) responded; they described 99 cases of VSED. Seventy percent of these patients were aged older than 80 years, 76% had severe disease (27% with cancer), and 77% were dependent on others for everyday care. Frequent reasons for the patients' death wish were somatic (79%), existential (77%), and dependence (58%). Median time until death was 7 days, and the most common symptoms before death were pain, fatigue, impaired cognitive functioning, and thirst or dry throat. Family physicians were involved in 62% of cases.
   CONCLUSIONS Patients who hasten death by VSED are mostly in poor health. It is not unlikely for family physicians to be confronted with VSED. They can play an important role in caring for these patients and their proxies by informing them of VSED and by providing support and symptom management during VSED.

AB Background: During the disease course of high-grade glioma (HGG) patients, the goal of therapy eventually shifts from primarily life-prolongation to primarily sustaining the quality of life as good as possible. End-of-life care is aimed at prolongation of life with good quality, but inevitably also may require medical decisions for prevention and relief of suffering with a potential life shortening effect. Few data are available on this end-of-life decision (ELD) making process in HGG patients, with decreased consciousness, confusion or cognitive deficits preventing them to participate. In this study the ELD-making process in HGG patients is described.
   Methods: Physicians and relatives of a cohort of 155 deceased HGG patients were identified to fill in a questionnaire regarding the end-of-life conditions (patients' ELD preferences, patients' competence) and ELD-making (forgoing treatment and the administration of drugs with a potential life-shortening effect) for their patient or relative. Data were analysed with descriptive statistics.
   Findings: Of 101 patients, physicians completed surveys including questions about ELDs (62% response rate). More than half of the patients relatively early became incompetent to make decisions due to delirium, cognitive deficits and/or decreasing consciousness. In 40% of patients the physician did not discuss ELD preferences with his/her patient. At least one ELD was made in 72% of patients, most often this comprised the withdrawal of dexamethasone. Palliative sedation was performed in 30% of patients and physician assisted death in 7%.
   Interpretation: ELDs are common practises amongst HGG patients, although their preferences towards ELDs are frequently unknown to the physician. Because the majority of patients become incompetent towards death, participation in ELD-making is only possible with advanced care planning. Hence, timely discussion of ELD preferences is encouraged.

We also manually reviewed references in recent reviews of epidemiology of bipolar disorder.
   Study Selection: All studies reporting rates for mania or hypomania in community epidemiologic samples with participants up to 21 years of age.
   Data Extraction: All articles were coded to extract relevant variables. Prevalence rates were calculated from reported number of cases with bipolar disorders, then logit transformed. Twelve studies were included, enrolling 16,222 youths between the ages of 7 and 21 years during a period from 1985 to 2007. Six samples were from the United States; 6 were from other countries (the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain, Mexico, Ireland, and New Zealand).
   Results:The overall rate of bipolar disorder was 1.8% (95% CI, 1.1%-3.0%). There was no significant difference in the mean rates between US and non-US studies, but the US studies had a wider range of rates. The highest estimates came from studies that used broad definitions and included bipolar disorder not otherwise specified. Year of enrollment was negatively correlated with prevalence (r=-0.04) and remained nonsignificant when controlling for study methodological differences.
   Conclusions: Mean rates of bipolar disorder were higher than commonly acknowledged and not significantly different in US compared to non-US samples, nor was there evidence of an increase in rates of bipolar disorder in the community over time. Differences in diagnostic criteria were a main driver of different rates across studies. J Clin Psychiatry 2011;72(9):1250-1256 (C) Copyright 2011 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB Objective: Given that a cohort effect is rarely mentioned as one of the possible contributors to the increased incidence of childhood-onset bipolar disorder in the United States, we reexamined evidence for the phenomenon within our outpatient Bipolar Collaborative Network.
   Methods: 968 outpatients (mean age, 41 years) with DSM bipolar disorder from 1995 to 2002 from 4 sites in the United States and 3 in the Netherlands and Germany (abbreviated as Europe) gave informed consent and provided detailed demographic, illness, and family history information on a patient questionnaire. Family history of bipolar disorder, depression, suicide attempt, alcohol abuse, substance abuse, and "other" illness was collected for each parent and the 4 grandparents. Age at onset and family history of illness burden were then assessed as a function of the age of the patient at network entry.
   Results: Data for patients aged 35 years or older (n = 613) were included in the first analysis. Compared to older patients, those who were younger when they entered the network had an earlier age at onset of their bipolar disorder (r = 0.33, P < .001). Similarly, the youngest patients at entry (representing the most recent cohorts) had parents and grandparents with more psychiatric illness than patients born in earlier cohorts (n = 968).
   Conclusions: These preliminary data, taken with the substantial literature, suggest a cohort effect for earlier age at onset of bipolar disorder and greater burden of psychiatric disorders in 2 generations of direct progenitors of our patients. The resulting likely increase in severity of bipolar illness in future generations based on this earlier age at onset and increased familial loading, particularly in the United States, deserves focused clinical and public health attention and attempts at amelioration.

AB Background: Previous research suggests that family caregivers contemplate suicide at a higher rate than the general population. Much of this research has been disease specific and in relatively small samples. This study aimed to compare suicidal thoughts between non-caregivers and informal caregivers of people with a variety of conditions, in a large representative sample, and to identify significant risk factors.
   Methods: The general population study NEMESIS-2 (N at baseline = 6646) included 1582 adult caregivers at the second wave (2010-2012) who also participated at the third wave (2013-2015). Suicidal thoughts were assessed over 4 years, with the Suicidality Module of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0. The presence of suicidal thoughts was estimated and risk factors for suicidal thoughts were assessed with logistic regression analyses adjusted for age and gender.
   Results: Thirty-six informal caregivers (2.9%) reported suicidal thoughts during the 4 year study period. The difference between caregivers and non-caregivers (3.0%) was not significant. Among caregivers, significant risk factors for suicidal thoughts included being unemployed, living without a partner, having lower levels of social support, having a chronic physical disorder, a mood disorder or an anxiety disorder, and having impaired social, physical and emotional functioning. These risk factors were also found in non-caregivers. No caregiving-related characteristics were associated with suicidal thoughts.
   Conclusion: There was no elevated rate of suicidal thoughts in caregivers and risk factors for suicidal thoughts in caregivers were consistent with risk factors in non-caregivers. No association between caregiving characteristics and suicidal thoughts was found. Caregivers with limited resources and in poorer health might still benefit from prevention and intervention efforts.

AB Context. Sedation at the end of life, regardless of the nomenclature, is an increasingly debated practice at both clinical and bioethical levels. However, little is known about the characteristics and trends in scientific publications in this field of study.
   Objectives. This article presents a bibliometric analysis of the scientific publications on continuous sedation until death.
   Methods. Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO (R)) were searched for the indexed material published between 1945 and 2011. This search resulted in bibliographic data of 273 published outputs that were analyzed using bibliometric techniques.
   Results. Data revealed a trend of increased scientific publication from the early 1990s. Published outputs, diverse in type (comments/letters, articles, reviews, case reports, editorials), were widely distributed across 94 journals of varying scientific disciplines (medicine, nursing, palliative care, law, ethics). Most journals (72.3%) were classified under Medical and Health Sciences, with the Journal of Pain and Symptom Management identified as the major journal in the field covering 12.1% of the total publications. Empirical research articles, mostly of a quantitative design, originated from 17 countries. Although Japan and The Netherlands were found to be the leaders in research article productivity, it was the U.K. and the U.S. that ranked top in terms of the quantity of published outputs.
   Conclusion. This is the first bibliometric analysis on continuous sedation until death that can be used to inform future studies. Further research is needed to refine controversies on terminology and ethical acceptability of the practice, as well as conditions and modalities of its use.

AB Background: About half of the persons who die in developed countries are very old (aged 80 years or older) and this proportion is still rising. In general, there is little information available concerning the circumstances and quality of the end of life of this group. Objective: This study aims (1) to describe the incidence and characteristics of medical end-of-life decisions with a possible or certain life-shortening effect (ELDs) and terminal sedation among very old patients who died nonsuddenly, (2) to describe the characteristics of the preceding decision-making process, and (3) to compare this with the deaths of younger patients. Methods: A sample of 5,005 death certificates was selected from all deaths in Flanders (Belgium) in the second half of 2001 (before euthanasia was legalized). Questionnaires were mailed to the certifying physicians. Results: Response rate was 58.9%. An ELD was made for 53.6% very old (aged 80+) patients who died nonsuddenly (vs. 63.3% for the younger patients). Use of life-ending drugs occurred among 1.1% (six times less frequently than in younger patients), with no euthanasia cases, pain and symptom alleviation with a possible life-shortening effect among 27.3% (two times less frequently), and withholding or withdrawing life-prolonging treatments among 25.2% (slightly more frequently). Terminal sedation occurred among 6.9% of the cases, two times less frequently than for the younger patients. ELDs were not often discussed with very old patients. Among competent patients this was less than compared with younger patients. Conclusion: ELDs are less common for very old than for younger patients. Physicians seem to have a more reluctant attitude towards the use of lethal drugs, terminal sedation and participation in decision-making when dealing with very old patients. Advance care planning should increase the involvement of very old competent and noncompetent patients in end-of-life decision-making. Copyright (c) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB In many European countries there is a public debate about the acceptability and regulation of euthanasia. In 2002, Belgium became the second country after the Netherlands to enact a law on euthanasia. Although euthanasia rarely occurs, the complexity of the clinical-ethical decision making surrounding euthanasia requests and the need for adequate support reported by caregivers, means that healthcare institutions increasingly need to consider how to responsibly handle euthanasia requests. The development of written ethics policies on euthanasia may be important to guarantee and maintain the quality of care for patients requesting euthanasia. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, development, position, and communication of written ethics policies on euthanasia in Flemish nursing homes. Data were obtained through a cross-sectional mail survey of general directors of all Catholic nursing homes in Flanders, Belgium. Of the 737 nursing homes invited to participate, 612 (83%) completed the questionnaire. Of these, only 15% had a written ethics policy on euthanasia. Presence of an ethics committee and membership of an umbrella organization were independent predictors of whether a nursing home had such a written ethics policy. The Act on Euthanasia and euthanasia guidelines advanced by professional organizations were the most frequent reasons (76% and 56%, respectively) and reference sources (92% and 64%, respectively) for developing ethics policies on euthanasia. Development of ethics policies occurred within a multidisciplinary context. In general, Flemish nursing homes applied the Act on Euthanasia restrictively by introducing palliative procedures in addition to legal due care criteria. The policy was communicated to the consulting general practitioner and nurses in 74% and 89% of nursing homes, respectively.
   Although the overall prevalence of ethics policies on euthanasia was low in Flemish nursing homes, institution administrators displayed growing awareness of bearing responsibility for stimulating dialogue and reflection about how to deal with euthanasia requests within their institution.

AB The application of medical technology to prolong life at the expense of quality of life is widely debated in end-of-life care. A national survey of 3733 UK doctors reporting on the care of 2923 people who had died under their care is reported here. Results show that there was no time to make an 'end-of-life decision' (deciding to provide, withdraw or withhold treatment) for 8.5% of those reporting deaths. A further 55.2% reported decisions which they estimated would not hasten death and 28.9% reported decisions they had expected to hasten death. A further 7.4% reported deaths where they had to some degree intended to hasten death. Where patients or someone else had made a request for a hastened death, doctors were more likely to report expecting or at least partly intending to hasten death. Doctors usually made these decisions in consultation with colleagues, relatives and, where feasible, with patients. Intensive care specialists were particularly likely to report a degree of intention to hasten the end of life and to have treated patients lacking the capacity to discuss these decisions. Palliative medicine specialists were the least likely to report decisions they expected or at least partly intended to end life, in spite of reporting a high incidence of requests from their patients for a hastened death. Doctors with strong religious beliefs or who opposed the legalisation of assisted dying were unlikely to report such decisions. Elderly women and those with dementia are groups considered vulnerable in societies where a permissive approach is taken to hastening death in end-of-life care. but doctors describing these deaths were no more likely to report decisions which they expected or at least partly intended to end life. The survey suggests that concerns about the sanctity of life, as well as estimates of the quality of life, enter clinical decision-making. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Euthanasia is legal only in the Netherlands and Belgium, but it is on occasion performed by physicians elsewhere. We recruited in France two convenience samples of 221 lay people and of 189 professionals (36 physicians, 92 nurses, 48 nurse's aides, and 13 psychologists) and asked them how acceptable it would be for a patient's physician to perform euthanasia in each of 72 scenarios. The scenarios were all combinations of three levels of the patient's life expectancy (3 days, 10 days, or 1 month), four levels of the patient's request for euthanasia (no request, unable to formulate a request because in a coma, some form of request, repeated formal requests), three of the family's attitude (do not uselessly prolong care, no opinion, try to keep the patient alive to the very end), and two of the patient's willingness to undergo organ donation (willing or not willing). We found that most lay people and health care professionals structure the factors in the patient scenarios in the same way: they assign most importance to the extent of requests for euthanasia by the patient and least importance (the lay people) or none (the health professionals) to the patient's willingness to donate organs. They also integrate the information from the different factors in the same way: the factors of patient request, patient life expectancy, and (for the lay people) organ donation are combined additively, and the family's attitude toward prolonging care interacts with patient request (playing a larger role when the patient can make no request). Thus we demonstrate a common cognitive foundation for future discussions, at the levels of both clinical care and public policy, of the conditions under which physician-performed euthanasia might be acceptable.

AB Background: It has been suggested that homosexuality is associated with psychiatric morbidity. This study examined differences between heterosexually and homosexually active subjects in 12-month and lifetime prevalence of DSM-III-R mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders in a representative sample of the Dutch population (N=7076; aged 18-64 years).
   Methods: Data were collected in face-to-face interviews, using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Classification as heterosexual or homosexual was based on reported sexual behavior in the preceding year. Five thousand nine hundred ninety-eight (84.8%) of the total sample could be classified: 2.8% of 2878 men and 1.4% of 3120 women had had same-sex partners. Differences in prevalence rates were tested by logistic regression analyses, controlling for demographics.
   Results: Psychiatric disorders were more prevalent among homosexually active people compared with heterosexually active people. Homosexual men had a higher 12-month prevalence of mood disorders (odds ratio [OR]=2.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.54-5.57) and anxiety disorders (OR=2.61; 95% CI= 1.44-4.74) than heterosexual men. Homosexual women had a higher 12-month prevalence of substance use disorders (OR=4.05; 95% CI=1.56-10.47) than heterosexual women. Lifetime prevalence rates reflect identical differences, except for mood disorders, which were more frequently observed in homosexual than in heterosexual women (OR=2.41; 95% CI=1.26-4.63). The proportion of persons with 1 or more diagnoses differed only between homosexual and heterosexual women (lifetime OR=2.61; 95% CI=1.31-5.19). More homosexual than heterosexual persons had 2 or more disorders during their lifetimes (homosexual men: OR=2.70; 95% CI=1.66-4.41; homosexual women: OR=2.09; 95% CI=1.07-4.09).
   Conclusion: The findings support the assumption that people with same-sex sexual behavior are at greater risk for psychiatric disorders.

AB Context. According to guideline recommendations, barbiturates and neuromuscular relaxants are the recommended drugs for euthanasia.
   Objectives. To describe changes over time in drugs used to perform euthanasia and differences in case characteristics according to the drugs used.
   Methods. Repeated population-based mortality follow-back study among physicians attending a large representative sample of deaths in 1998, 2007, and 2013 in Flanders, Belgium.
   Results. In 1998, we identified 25 euthanasia cases (1.2% of all deaths), 142 cases in 2007 (2.0% of all deaths), and 349 cases in 2013 (4.6% of all deaths). Use of recommended drugs to perform euthanasia increased from 11.9% of euthanasia cases in 1998 to 55.3% in 2007 and 66.8% in 2013 (P < 0.001). In 2013, cases with recommended drugs compared with nonrecommended drugs more often involved requests expressed both orally and in writing (86.8%/14.1%; P < 0.001), consultation with colleague physicians (93.8%/69.1%; P < 0.001), and administration in the presence of another physician (98.3%/54.3%; P < 0.001), and were more often self-labeled by physicians as euthanasia (95.5%/0.9%; P < 0.001) and reported to the euthanasia review committee (92.3%/3.8%; P < 0.001). Between 2007 and 2013, physicians consistently labeled cases in which nonrecommended drugs were used as palliative sedation (72.8%/78.4%; P = 0.791) or alleviation of pain and symptoms (13.2%/15.0%; P > 0.999).
   Conclusion. Physicians in Flanders are increasingly using the recommended drugs for euthanasia. This suggests that guidelines and training regarding the conduct and pharmacological aspects of euthanasia may have had important effects on the practice of euthanasia. However, the declining but persisting use of nonrecommended drugs requires further attention. (C) 2018 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Background: Depressive symptoms are common in older adults. The effectiveness of pharmacological treatments and the availability of psychological treatments in primary care are limited. A behavioural approach to depression treatment might be beneficial to many older adults but such care is still largely unavailable. Behavioural Activation (BA) protocols are less complicated and more easy to train than other psychological therapies, making them very suitable for delivery by less specialised therapists. The recent introduction of the mental health nurse in primary care centres in the Netherlands has created major opportunities for improving the accessibility of psychological treatments for late-life depression in primary care. BA may thus address the needs of older patients while improving treatment outcome and lowering costs. The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of BA in comparison with treatment as usual (TAU) for late-life depression in Dutch primary care. A secondary goal is to explore several potential mechanisms of change, as well as predictors and moderators of treatment outcome of BA for late-life depression.
   Methods/design: Cluster-randomised controlled multicentre trial with two parallel groups: a) behavioural activation, and b) treatment as usual, conducted in primary care centres with a follow-up of 52 weeks. The main inclusion criterion is a PHQ-9 score > 9. Patients are excluded from the trial in case of severe mental illness that requires specialized treatment, high suicide risk, drug and/or alcohol abuse, prior psychotherapy, change in dosage or type of prescribed antidepressants in the previous 12 weeks, or moderate to severe cognitive impairment. The intervention consists of 8 weekly 30-min BA sessions delivered by a trained mental health nurse.
   Discussion: We expect BA to be an effective and cost-effective treatment for late-life depression compared to TAU. BA delivered by mental health nurses could increase the availability and accessibility of non-pharmacological treatments for late-life depression in primary care.

AB Physicians may hasten death by medical decisions to end life (MDEL) that have been extensively researched. However, outside the medical domain, some individuals hasten their death by Voluntary Refusal of Food and Fluid while receiving some palliative care (VRFF) or by Independently taking Lethal Medication attended by a Confidant (ILMC). Both dying trajectories are more or less under the control of the individuals themselves. No survey data are available on how often these self-directed deaths occur in the Dutch population. We have isolated VRFF and ILMC from other dying trajectories in a population-based study employing after-death interviews with relatives, friends or nurses. Members of a research database that is representative of the Dutch population (n = 31,516) were asked whether they had been a confidant in someone's decision to hasten death by VRFF or ILMC. In this sample, 144 deaths that conformed to our definitions were reported by proxies. We have computed an annual frequency of 2.1% VRFF deaths and of 1.1% ILMC deaths. The annual frequencies of VRFF and ILMC appear to be roughly the same as the yearly frequency of physician-assisted dying (1.8%). In seventy percent of those who had died by VRFF or ILMC, a diagnosis of cancer or a serious illness was reported by the informant. The proxies retrospectively described the self-directed hastening of death by both methods as a dignified death in about 75% of deaths. Both VRFF and ILMC require strenuous efforts and reflect a strong desire to control the process of dying. End-of-life research has shown that some control over the time of death is an important aspect of a 'good death' in western countries. We therefore presume that these self-directed methods for hastening death in consultation with proxies occur in other countries as well. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The purpose is to determine some clinical features of self-injurious behavior, family functions and self-esteem in self-injurious adolescents in comparison to a control group. Apart from that, one purpose is to evaluate the relationships between self-esteem and some clinical features regarding self-injurious behavior in the case group. Methods: A group of 70 adolescents with self-injurious behavior who admitted to the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic were included in the study as well as another group of 70 adolescents with similar age and gender distribution to the case group who does not have self-injurious behavior. Self-injurious behavior information form, Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale and Family Assessment Device are applied to both the case and control groups. Results: The present study suggests that low self-esteem, unhealthy family functions and smoking are independent risk factors for self-injurious behavior. It has been found out that the adolescents who injure themselves more frequently and more seriously in the case group have lower self esteem. It has been found out that the presence of self-injurious family member or friend does not create a significant difference in the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale total point average of the adolescents in the case group. Besides, it has been revealed that alcohol consumption and smoking in the adolescents in the case group do not create a significant difference in the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale total point averages. Discussion: There is a need for studies that assess the main factors related to the association of self-injurious behavior with smoking and self-esteem, and that determine the direction of causality between them. In our study, the findings that are related to family functions seem to suggest that self-injurious behavior in adolescents might be related to unhealthy family environment. This finding shows the importance of assessing family functions along with the characteristics of the adolescent and the family.

TI Cultural differences affecting euthanasia practice in Belgium: One law

AB Since 2002, Belgium has had a national law legalising euthanasia. The law prescribes several substantive due care requirements and two procedural due care requirements, i.e. consultation with an independent physician and reporting of euthanasia to a Federal Control Committee. A large discrepancy in reporting rates between the Dutch-speaking (Flanders) and the French-speaking (Wallonia) parts of Belgium has led to speculation about cultural differences affecting the practice of euthanasia in both regions. Using Belgian data from the European Values Study conducted in 2008 among a representative sample of the general public and data from a large-scale mail questionnaire survey on euthanasia of 480 physicians from Flanders and 305 from Wallonia (conducted in 2009), this study presents empirical evidence of differences between both regions in attitudes towards and practice of euthanasia. Acceptance of euthanasia by the general population was found to be slightly higher in Flanders than in Wallonia. Compared with their Flemish counterparts, Walloon physicians held more negative attitudes towards performing euthanasia and towards the reporting obligation, less often labelled hypothetical cases correctly as euthanasia, and less often defined a case of euthanasia having to be reported. A higher proportion of Flemish physicians had received a euthanasia request since the introduction of the law. In cases of a euthanasia request, Walloon physicians consulted less often with an independent physician. Requests were more often granted in Flanders than in Wallonia (51% vs 38%), and performed euthanasia cases were more often reported (73% vs 58%). The study points out some significant differences between Flanders and Wallonia in practice, knowledge and attitudes regarding euthanasia and its legal requirements which are likely to explain the discrepancy between Wallonia and Flanders in the number of euthanasia cases reported. Cultural factors seem to play an important role in the practice of (legal) euthanasia and the extent to which legal safeguards are followed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,

AB Background. Medical end-of-life decisions (ELDs) have been discussed for several years in different countries, but little is known about the involvement of GPs in these ELDs.
   Objectives. The aim of the present study was to establish the incidence and characteristics of ELDs by GPs.
   Method. We selected 3999 deaths, a 20% random sample of all registered deaths during the first 4 months of 1998 in Flanders, Belgium, and mailed anonymous questionnaires to the attesting physicians. Here we focus exclusively on the 1647 deaths certified by GPs.
   Results. The GPs returned 1067 questionnaires (response rate of 64.8%). At least one ELD was made in 39.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 37.8-41.2] of all primary care deaths. The incidence of euthanasia (including physician-assisted suicide) was 1.5% (95% CI 0.9-2.3) (incidence higher among more educated patients and at home), of administration of lethal drugs without the patient's explicit request 3.8% (95% CI 2.9-5.0) (higher among cancer patients), of alleviation of pain and symptoms with possibly life-shortening effect 18.6% (95% CI 17.0-20.2) (higher among cancer patients and married patients) and of non-treatment decisions 15.6% (95% CI 14.2-17.2) (higher among cancer patients and in nursing homes). The decision was not discussed with the patient in three out of four of the ELDs. A colleague was consulted in one in four ELD cases.
   Conclusion. ELDs are common in general practice in Flanders, Belgium, despite the restrictive law concerning euthanasia at the time of this study. The incidence of these ELDs varies with cause and place of death, the patient's education and the GP's religion and age. Requirements of prudent practice regarding ELDs are rather poorly met by GPs. Further international research and debate is needed to highlight the GPs' important role in end-of-life care.

AB Context. In many countries, physicians are confronted with requests for euthanasia. Notwithstanding that euthanasia is legally permitted in Belgium, it remains the subject of intense debate.
   Objectives. To gather in-depth empirical data on how general practitioners (GPs) deal with these requests in Belgium.
   Methods. Mortality follow-back study in 2005-2006 via the nationwide Sentinel Network of General Practitioners. Standardized face-to-face interviews were conducted with GPs for all the reported patients who did not die suddenly or totally unexpectedly at home, as judged by the GP.
   Results. We conducted 205 interviews. Of these, 27 patients had at some point expressed a wish to receive a drug administered by a physician with the explicit intention to end life, that is, euthanasia. Thirteen of these formulated their requests explicitly and repeatedly, according to their GP. Compared with patients who expressed a wish but not an explicit/repeated request for euthanasia, those patients' requests were more often documented (8 of 13 vs. 2 of 14; P = 0.01), and reiterated until their final days of life (6 of 13 vs. 0 of 14; P = 0.02). Five patients received euthanasia. For the other 22 patients, GPs gave different reasons for not acceding to the request, often related to criteria stipulated in the Belgian law on euthanasia, and sometimes related to personal reasons.
   Conclusion. It is not uncommon for patients to ask their GP for euthanasia, although explicit requests remain relatively rare. Requests tend to vary widely in form and content, and far more are expressed than complied with. For many GPs, the Belgian law on euthanasia serves as a guiding principle in this decision-making process, although in a minority of the cases, a GP's personal opinion toward euthanasia seems to be decisive.

AB Background: Unbearable suffering most frequently is reported in end-of-life cancer patients in primary care. However, research seldom addresses unbearable suffering. The aim of this study was to comprehensively investigate the various aspects of unbearable suffering in end-of-life cancer patients cared for in primary care.
   Methods: Forty four general practitioners recruited end-of-life cancer patients with an estimated life expectancy of half a year or shorter. The inclusion period was three years, follow-up lasted one additional year. Practices were monitored bimonthly to identify new cases. Unbearable aspects in five domains and overall unbearable suffering were quantitatively assessed (5-point scale) through patient interviews every two months with a comprehensive instrument. Scores of 4 (serious) or 5 (hardly can be worse) were defined unbearable. The last interviews before death were analyzed. Sources providing strength to bear suffering were identified through additional open-ended questions.
   Results: Seventy six out of 148 patients (51%) requested to participate consented; the attrition rate was 8%, while 8% were alive at the end of follow-up. Sixty four patients were followed up until death; in 60 patients interviews were complete. Overall unbearable suffering occurred in 28%. A mean of 18 unbearable aspects was present in patients with serious (score 4) overall unbearable suffering. Overall, half of the unbearable aspects involved the domain of traditional medical symptoms. The most frequent unbearable aspects were weakness, general discomfort, tiredness, pain, loss of appetite and not sleeping well (25%-57%). The other half of the unbearable aspects involved the domains of function, personhood, environment, and nature and prognosis of disease. The most frequent unbearable aspects were impaired activities, feeling dependent, help needed with housekeeping, not being able to do important things, trouble accepting the situation, being bedridden and loss of control (27%-55%). The combination of love and support was the most frequent source (67%) providing strength to bear suffering.
   Conclusions: Overall unbearable suffering occurred in one in every four end-of-life cancer patients. Half of the unbearable aspects involved medical symptoms, the other half concerned psychological, social and existential dimensions. Physicians need to comprehensively assess suffering and provide psychosocial interventions alongside physical symptom management.

AB Objectives End-of-life policy reforms are being debated in many countries. Research evidence is used to support different assumptions about the effects of public policies on end-of-life practices. It is however unclear whether reliable international practice comparisons can be conducted between different policy contexts. Our aim was to assess the feasibility of comparing similar end-of-life practices in different policy contexts.
   Methods This is a scoping review of empirical studies on medical end-of-life practices. We developed a descriptive classification of end-of-life practices that distinguishes practices according to their legal status. We focused on the intentional use of lethal drugs by physicians because of international variations in the legal status of this practice. Bibliographic database searches were supplemented by expert consultation and hand searching of reference lists. The sensitivity of the search strategy was tested using a set of 77 articles meeting our inclusion criteria. Two researchers extracted end-of-life practice definitions, study methods and available comparisons across policy contexts. Canadian decision-makers were involved to increase the policy relevance of the review.
   Results In sum, 329 empirical studies on the intentional use of lethal drugs by doctors were identified, including studies from 19 countries. The bibliographic search captured 98.7% of studies initially identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. Studies on the intentional use of lethal drugs were conducted in jurisdictions with permissive (62%) and restrictive policies (43%). The most common study objectives related to the frequency of end-of-life practices, determinants of practices, and doctors' adherence to regulatory standards. Large variations in definitions and research methods were noted across studies. The use of a descriptive classification was useful to translate end-of-life practice definitions across countries. A few studies compared end-of-life practice in countries with different policies, using consistent research methods. We identified no comprehensive review of end-of-life practices across different policy contexts.
   Conclusions It is feasible to compare end-of-life practices in different policy contexts. A systematic review of international evidence is needed to inform public deliberations on end-of-life policies and practice.

AB Background: The terminally ill person's autonomy and control are important in preserving the quality of life in situations of unbearable suffering. Voluntary stopping of eating and drinking (VSED) at the end of life has been discussed over the past 20 years as one possibility of hastening death. This article presents a 'systematic search and review' of published literature concerned with VSED as an option of hastening death at the end of life by adults with decision-making capacity.
   Methods: Electronic databases PubMed, EBSCOhost CINAHL and Ovid PsycINFO were systematically searched. Additionally, Google Scholar was searched and reference lists of included articles were checked. Data of the included studies were extracted, evaluated and summarized in narrative form.
   Results: Overall, out of 29 eligible articles 16 were included in this review. VSED can be defined as an action by a competent, capacitated person, who voluntarily and deliberately chooses to stop eating and drinking with the primary intention of hastening death because of the persistence of unacceptable suffering. An estimated number of deaths by VSED was only provided by one study from the Netherlands, which revealed a prevalence of 2.1% of deaths/year (on average 2800 deaths/year). Main reasons for patients hastening death by VSED are: readiness to die, life perceived as being pointless, poor quality of life, a desire to die at home, and the wish to control the circumstances of death. The physiological processes occurring during VSED and the supportive care interventions could not be identified through our search.
   Conclusions: The included articles provide marginal insight into VSED for hastening death. Research is needed in the field of theory-building and should be based on qualitative studies from different perspectives (patient, family members, and healthcare workers) about physiological processes during VSED, and about the prevalence and magnitude of VSED. Based on these findings supportive care interventions for patients and family members and recommendations for healthcare staff should be developed and tested.

AB Identifying child abuse and neglect solely on the grounds of child characteristics leaves many children undetected. We developed a new approach (Hague protocol) based on characteristics of parents who attend the Emergency Department (ED) because they have the following problems: (1) intimate partner violence, (2) substance abuse, or (3) suicide attempt or other serious psychiatric problems. The goal of this protocol is to enable the Reporting Center for Child Abuse and Neglect (RCCAN) to rapidly assess family problems and offer voluntary community based support to these parents. The aim of this study is to assess whether this protocol for screening adults presenting for care in the Emergency Department can identify children at high risk for maltreatment. A before and after study was conducted at 9 EDs in 3 regions in the Netherlands (one intervention region and 2 control regions). During the period January 2006 to November 2007, prior to the introduction of the Hague protocol, from a total of 385,626 patients attending the ED in the intervention region 4 parents (1 per 100,000) were referred to the RCCAN. In the period after introduction of the protocol (December 2007 to December 2011), the number rose to 565 parents from a total of 885,301 patients attending the ED (64 per 100,000). In the control region, where the protocol was not implemented, these figures were 2 per 163,628(1 per 100,000) and 10 per 371,616 (3 per 100,000) respectively (OR= 28.0 (95 CI 4.6-170.7)). At assessment, child abuse was confirmed in 91% of referred cases. The protocol has a high positive predictive value of 91% and can substantially increase the detection rate of child abuse in an ED setting. Parental characteristics are strong predictors of child abuse. Implementing guidelines to detect child abuse based on parental characteristics of parents attending the adult section of the ED can increase the detection rate of child abuse and neglect allowing appropriate aid to be initiated for these families.

TI Euthanasia in Belgium: trends in reported cases between 2003 and 2013

AB Background: In 2002, the Belgian Act on Euthanasia came into effect, regulating the intentional ending of life by a physician at the patient's explicit request. We undertook this study to describe trends in officially reported euthanasia cases in Belgium with regard to patients' sociodemographic and clinical profiles, as well as decision-making and performance characteristics.
   Methods: We used the database of all euthanasia cases reported to the Federal Control and Evaluation Committee on Euthanasia in Belgium between Jan. 1, 2003, and Dec. 31, 2013 (n = 8752). The committee collected these data with a standardized registration form. We analyzed trends in patient, decision-making and performance characteristics using a (2) technique. We also compared and analyzed trends for cases reported in Dutch and in French.
   Results: The number of reported euthanasia cases increased every year, from 235 (0.2% of all deaths) in 2003 to 1807 (1.7% of all deaths) in 2013. The rate of euthanasia increased significantly among those aged 80 years or older, those who died in a nursing home, those with a disease other than cancer and those not expected to die in the near future (p < 0.001 for all increases). Reported cases in 2013 most often concerned those with cancer (68.7%) and those under 80 years (65.0%). Palliative care teams were increasingly often consulted about euthanasia requests, beyond the legal requirements to do so (p < 0.001). Among cases reported in Dutch, the proportion in which the person was expected to die in the foreseeable future decreased from 93.9% in 2003 to 84.1% in 2013, and palliative care teams were increasingly consulted about the euthanasia request (from 34.0% in 2003 to 42.6% in 2013). These trends were not significant for cases reported in French.
   Interpretation: Since legalization of euthanasia in Belgium, the number of reported cases has increased each year. Most of those receiving euthanasia were younger than 80 years and were dying of cancer. Given the increases observed among non-terminally ill and older patients, this analysis shows the importance of detailed monitoring of developments in euthanasia practice.

TI The addition of STEPPS in the treatment of patients with bipolar
   disorder and comorbid borderline personality features: a protocol for a
   randomized controlled trial
SO BMC PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Bipolar disorder; Borderline personality disorder; Randomized controlled
   trial; STEPPS
ID IMPACT
AB Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) both are severe and chronic psychiatric disorders. Both disorders have overlapping symptoms, and current research shows that the presence of a BPD has an adverse effect on the course of BD. The limited research available shows an unfavorable illness course, a worse prognosis and response to medication, longer treatment duration, more frequent psychiatric admissions, higher drop-out, increased risk of substance abuse, increased risk of suicide, and more impairment of social and occupational functioning. However, there is no research available on the effect of specific psychotherapeutic treatment for this patients.
   Methods/Design: This paper presents the protocol of a RCT to investigate the presence of borderline personality features in patients treated for BD (study part 1) and the effectiveness of STEPPS (Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving) added to treatment as usual (TAU) for BD compared to TAU in patients with BD and comorbid borderline personality features (study part 2). STEPPS is a validated and effective intervention for BPD. The study population consists of patients treated for BD at specialized outpatient clinics for BD in the Netherlands. At first the prevalence of comorbid borderline personality features in outpatients with BD is investigated. Inclusion criteria for study part 2 is defined as having three or more of the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria of BPD, including impulsivity and anger bursts. Primary outcomes will be the frequency and severity of manic and depressive recurrences as well as severity, course and burden of borderline personality features. Secondary outcomes will be quality of life, utilizing mental healthcare and psychopathologic symptoms not primarily related to BD or BPD. Assessment will be at baseline, at the end of the intervention, and at 12 and 18 months follow-up.
   Discussion: This will be the first randomized controlled trial of a specific intervention in patients with BD and comorbid BPD or borderline personality features. There are no recommendations in the guideline of treatment of bipolar disorders for patients with this complex comorbidity. We expect that a combined treatment aimed at mood disorder and emotion regulation will improve treatment outcomes for these patients.

AB Background: Continuous sedation, contrary to euthanasia, has been increasingly accepted among medical professionals worldwide. In the Netherlands, a national guideline for continuous palliative sedation has been developed to contribute to the quality of palliative sedation practice. The present follow-up study investigated whether the practice of continuous sedation has changed after the introduction of this guideline.
   Methods: This study compared the practice of continuous sedation before and after the introduction of the guideline on December 7, 2005. A baseline measurement was performed between February 1, 2003, and May 1, 2005, with an enrollment of 492 physicians (medical specialists, general practitioners, and nursing home physicians). From January 1 to June 30, 2007, after the introduction of a national guideline for palliative sedation, a follow-up study was performed with the respondents of the baseline study. Physicians were asked to report on their last case of deep and continuous sedation in the past 12 months.
   Results: This study reports the results of the follow-up study and compares them to the results of the baseline study. The response rate was 69.3% (n=341). Of these physicians, 160 reported a last case of continuous sedation in both the baseline and the follow-up studies. Physicians reported a significant increase in patient involvement in decision making, from 72.3% to 82.2%. Pain remained the most often reported reason to start sedation, whereas exhaustion as a reason for sedation increased. The use of benzodiazepines increased from 69.9% to 90.4%. In the first and second measurements, symptom-directed treatment during sedation was applied in 56% to 58% of the cases. In the second period, there was more often an explicit decision to not give artificial hydration during sedation (78.8% vs 56.3%). Of the physicians, 34.2% were convinced that sedation shortened the life of the patient because of dehydration.
   Conclusions: After the introduction of the guideline, physicians reported that changes in palliative sedation practice conform to the recommendations of this guideline. For example, benzodiazepines were used for sedation more frequently than before and patient involvement in the decision-making process improved. Possible effects of dehydration and the large variation in symptom-directed treatment during sedation deserve careful attention.

AB Introduction: Industrial countries are experiencing substantial increases in cancer prevalence. While advanced cancer therapies resulted in prolonged survival most neoplasms still are incurable. Especially advanced stages of cancer are often accompanied by severe pain and other disabling symptoms. Sufficient pain and symptom control is needed to maintain a decent quality of life for cancer patients. However, expert palliative care for patients suffering from cancer pain is still insufficient. These deficits have encouraged pro-euthanasia pressure groups demanding legitimation of physician-assisted-suicide in Germany. Acting under the guise of promoting patient's autonomy these groups are gaining additional momentum from similar legislation recently passed in the Netherlands. Methods: Hospice movement and specialists in palliative medicine reject euthanasia as unethical and instead push for the global development of palliative care services. To address these issues the project SUPPORT was established in the Southern part of Lower-Saxony in 1996 with approval by the local ethics committee and sponsored by the German Ministry of Health. A palliative-care-team (PCT) of nurses and physicians with expert knowledge in palliative medicine supports patients after discharge from hospital by providing state-of-the-art palliative care at home. The PCT is available as a 24/7 standby service and can be called on demand by general practitioners, members of outpatient nursing services as well as by patients and their relatives. By cooperating with the PCT these professional and lay caregivers improve their knowledge and skills regarding pain and symptom control for terminally ill patients. Results: During almost 4 years of practical work more than 50 % of the patients enrolled in the project died at home compared to about 20% under regular conditions. These data point out quite impressively that due to the PCT-interventions recurrent hospitalisations in a majority of cancer pain patients can be avoided when expert knowledge and help is available at home for patients, their relatives and caregivers whenever needed. Conclusion: When sufficiently supported at home by palliative experts the number of patients dying at home is reasonably higher than the rate observed under regular conditions. This would also comply with the wishes of most patients who prefer to die in the privacy of their own home. The project data suggest that the concept of SUPPORT should be capable to improve the current state of palliative medicine in other areas of Germany as well.

AB Background: The "Patients' Rights and End of Life Care" Act came into force in France in 2005. It allows withholding/withdrawal of life-support treatment, and intensified use of medications that may hasten death through a double effect, as long as hastening death is not the purpose of the decision. It also specifies the requirements of the decision-making process. This study assesses the situation by examining the frequency of end-of-life decisions by patients' and physicians' characteristics, and describes the decision-making processes.
   Methods: We conducted a nationwide retrospective study of a random sample of adult patients who died in December 2009. Questionnaires were mailed to the physicians who certified/attended these deaths. Cases were weighted to adjust for response rate bias. Bivariate analyses and logistic regressions were performed for each decision.
   Results: Of all deaths, 16.9% were sudden deaths with no information about end of life, 12.2% followed a decision to do everything possible to prolong life, and 47.7% followed at least one medical decision that may certainly or probably hasten death: withholding (14.6%) or withdrawal (4.2%) of treatments, intensified use of opioids and/or benzodiazepines (28.1%), use of medications to deliberately hasten death (i.e. not legally authorized) (0.8%), at the patient's request (0.2%) or not (0.6%). All other variables held constant, cause of death, patient's age, doctor's age and specialty, and place of death, influenced the frequencies of decisions. When a decision was made, 20% of the persons concerned were considered to be competent. The decision was discussed with the patient if competent in 40% (everything done) to 86% (intensification of alleviation of symptoms) of cases. Legal requirements regarding decision-making for incompetent patients were frequently not complied with.
   Conclusions: This study shows that end-of-life medical decisions are common in France. Most are in compliance with the 2005 law (similar to some other European countries). Nonetheless, the study revealed cases where not all legal obligations were met or where the decision was totally illegal. There is still a lot to be done through medical education and population awareness-raising to ensure that the decision-making process is compatible with current legislation, the physician's duty of care and the patient's rights.

   NOTIFICATION
AB Objectives To estimate the rate of reporting of euthanasia cases to the Federal Control and Evaluation Committee and to compare the characteristics of reported and unreported cases of euthanasia.
   Design Cross sectional analysis.
   Setting Flanders, Belgium. Participants A stratified at random sample was drawn of people who died between 1 June 2007 and 30 November 2007. The certifying physician of each death was sent a questionnaire on end of life decision making in the death concerned.
   Main outcome measures The rate of euthanasia cases reported to the Federal Control and Evaluation Committee; physicians' reasons for not reporting cases of euthanasia; the relation between reporting and non-reporting and the characteristics of the physician and patient; the time by which life was shortened according to the physician; the labelling of the end of life decision by the physician involved; and differences in characteristics of due care between reported and unreported euthanasia cases.
   Results The survey response rate was 58.4% (3623/6202 eligible cases). The estimated total number of cases of euthanasia in Flanders in 2007 was 1040 (95% CI 970 to 1109), thus the incidence of euthanasia was estimated as 1.9% of all deaths (95% CI 1.6% to 2.3%). Approximately half (549/1040 (52.8%, 95% CI 43.9% to 60.5%)) of all estimated cases of euthanasia were reported to the Federal Control and Evaluation Committee. Physicians who perceived their case as euthanasia reported it in 93.1% (67/72) of cases. Cases of euthanasia were reported less often when the time by which life was shortened was less than one week compared with when the perceived life shortening was greater (37.3% v 74.1%; P<0.001). Unreported cases were generally dealt with less carefully than reported cases: a written request for euthanasia was more often absent (87.7% v 17.6% verbal request only; P<0.001), other physicians and caregivers specialised in palliative care were consulted less often (54.6% v 97.5%; 33.0% v 63.9%; P<0.001 for both), the life ending act was more often performed with opioids or sedatives (92.1% v 4.4%; P<0.001), and the drugs were more often administered by a nurse (41.3% v 0.0%; P<0.001).
   Conclusions One out of two euthanasia cases is reported to the Federal Control and Evaluation Committee. Most non-reporting physicians do not perceive their act as euthanasia. Countries debating legalisation of euthanasia should simultaneously consider developing a policy facilitating the due care and reporting obligations of physicians.

TI Effectiveness of preventive cognitive therapy while tapering
   antidepressants versus maintenance antidepressant treatment versus their
   combination in prevention of depressive relapse or recurrence (DRD
   study): a three-group, multicentre, randomised controlled trial
SO LANCET PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID METAANALYSIS; DISORDER; RELAPSE/RECURRENCE; PHARMACOTHERAPY; PLACEBO
AB Background Keeping individuals on antidepressants after remission or recovery of major depressive disorder is a common strategy to prevent relapse or recurrence. Preventive cognitive therapy (PCT) has been proposed as an alternative to maintenance antidepressant treatment, but whether its addition would allow tapering of antidepressants or enhance the efficacy of maintenance antidepressant treatment is unclear. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of antidepressants alone, with PCT while tapering off antidepressants, or PCT added to antidepressants in the prevention of relapse and recurrence.
   Methods In this single-blind, multicentre, parallel, three-group, randomised controlled trial, individuals recruited by general practitioners, pharmacists, secondary mental health care, or media were randomly assigned (10: 10: 8) to PCT and antidepressants, antidepressants alone, or PCT with tapering of antidepressants, using computer-generated randomised allocation stratified for number of previous depressive episodes and type of care. Eligible participants had previously experienced at least two depressive episodes and were in remission or recovery on antidepressants, which they had been receiving for at least the past 6 months. Exclusion criteria were current mania or hypomania, a history of bipolar disorder, any history of psychosis, current alcohol or drug abuse, an anxiety disorder that requires treatment, psychological treatment more than twice a month, and a diagnosis of organic brain damage. The primary outcome was time-related proportion of individuals with depressive relapse or recurrence in the intention-to-treat population, assessed four times in 24 months. Assessors were masked to treatment allocation, whereas physicians and participants could not be masked. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register, number NTR1907.
   Findings Between July 14, 2009, and April 30, 2015, 2486 participants were assessed for eligibility and 289 were randomly assigned to PCT and antidepressant (n=104), antidepressant alone (n=100), or PCT with tapering of antidepressant (n=85). The overall log-rank test was significant (p=0.014). Antidepressants alone were not superior to PCT while tapering off antidepressants in terms of the risk of relapse or recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 0.86, 95% CI 0.56-1.32; p=0.502). Adding PCT to antidepressant treatment resulted in a 41% relative risk reduction compared with antidepressants alone (0.59, 0.38-0.94; p=0.026). There were two suicide attempts (one in the antidepressants alone group and one in the PCT with tapering of antidepressants group) and one death (in the PCT and antidepressants group) not related to the interventions during the 24 months' follow-up.
   Interpretation Maintenance antidepressant treatment is not superior to PCT after recovery, whereas adding PCT to antidepressant treatment after recovery is superior to antidepressants alone. PCT should be offered to recurrently depressed individuals on antidepressants and to individuals who wish to stop antidepressants after recovery.

AB Background Previous trials have shown that pridopidine might reduce motor impairment in patients with Huntington's disease. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether higher doses of pridopidine than previously tested reduce motor symptoms in a dose-dependent manner while maintaining acceptable safety and tolerability.
   Methods PRIDE-HD was a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2, dose-ranging study in adults (aged >= 21 years) with Huntington's disease at outpatient clinics in 53 sites across 12 countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA). Eligible patients had clinical onset after age 18 years, 36 or more cytosine-adenine-guanine repeats in the huntingtin gene, motor symptoms (Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score [UHDRS-TMS] >= 25 points), and reduced independence (UHDRS independence score <= 90%). Patients were randomly assigned (1: 1: 1: 1: 1) with centralised interactive-response technology to receive one of four doses of pridopidine (45, 67.5, 90, or 112.5 mg) or placebo orally twice a day for 52 weeks. Randomisation was stratified within centres by neuroleptic drug use. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in the UHDRS-TMS from baseline to 26 weeks, which was assessed in all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment (full analysis set). Participants and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2013-001888-23) and ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT02006472).
   Findings Between Feb 13, 2014, and July 5, 2016, 408 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=82) or pridopidine 45 mg (n=81), 67.5 mg (n=82), 90 mg (n=81), or 112.5 mg (n=82) twice daily for 26 weeks. The full analysis set included 397 patients (81 in the placebo group, 75 in the 45 mg group, 79 in the 67.5 mg group, 81 in the 90 mg group, and 81 in the 112.5 mg group). Pridopidine did not significantly change the UHDRS-TMS at 26 weeks compared with placebo at any dose. The most frequent adverse events across all groups were diarrhoea, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, falls, headache, insomnia, and anxiety. The most common treatment-related adverse events were insomnia, diarrhoea, nausea, and dizziness. Serious adverse events occurred in the pridopidine groups only and were most frequently falls (n=5), suicide attempt (n= 4), suicidal ideation (n=3), head injury (n=3), and aspiration pneumonia (n=3). No new safety or tolerability concerns emerged in this study. One death in the pridopidine 112.5 mg group due to aspiration pneumonia was considered to be possibly related to the study drug.
   Interpretation Pridopidine did not improve the UHDRS-TMS at week 26 compared with placebo and, thus, the results of secondary or tertiary analyses in previous trials were not replicated. A potentially strong placebo effect needs to be ruled out in future studies.

AB IMPORTANCE Patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) do not respond sufficiently to several consecutive treatments for major depressive disorder. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising treatment for these patients, but presently placebo effects cannot be ruled out.
   OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of DBS of the ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule (vALIC), controlling for placebo effects with active and sham stimulation phases.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Twenty-five patients with TRD from 2 hospitals in the Netherlands were enrolled between March 22, 2010, and May 8, 2014. Patients first entered a 52-week open-label trial during which they received bilateral implants of 4 contact electrodes followed by optimization of DBS until a stable response was achieved. A randomized, double-blind, 12-week crossover phase was then conducted with patients receiving active treatment followed by sham or vice versa. Response and nonresponse to treatment were determined using intention-to-treat analyses.
   INTERVENTIONS Deep brain stimulation targeted to the vALIC.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The change in the investigator-rated score of the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17) was the main outcome used in analysis of the optimization phase. The primary outcome of the crossover phase was the difference in the HAM-D-17 scores between active and sham DBS. The score range of this tool is 0 to 52, with higher scores representing more severe symptoms. Patients were classified as responders to treatment (>= 50% decrease of the HAM-D-17 score compared with baseline) and partial responders (>= 25 but <50% decrease of the HAM-D-17 score).
   RESULTS Of 25 patients included in the study, 8 (32%) were men; the mean (SD) age at inclusion was 53.2 (8.4) years. Mean HAM-D-17 scores decreased from 22.2 (95% CI, 20.3-24.1) at baseline to 15.9 (95% CI, 12.3-19.5) (P = .001), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores from 34.0 (95% CI, 31.8-36.3) to 23.8 (95% CI, 18.4-29.1) (P < .001), and Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-report scores from from 49.3 (95% CI, 45.4-53.2) to 38.8 (95% CI, 31.6-46.0) (P = .005) in the optimization phase. Following the optimization phase, which lasted 51.6 (22.0) weeks, 10 patients (40%) were classified as responders and 15 individuals (60%) as nonresponders. Sixteen patients entered the randomized crossover phase (9 responders [56%], 7 nonresponders [44%]). During active DBS, patients scored significantly lower on the HAM-D-17 scale (13.6 [95% CI, 9.8-17.4]) than during sham DBS (23.1 [95% CI, 20.6-25.6]) (P < .001). Serious adverse events included severe nausea during surgery (1 patient), suicide attempt (4 patients), and suicidal ideation (2 patients).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Deep brain stimulation of the vALIC resulted in a significant decrease of depressive symptoms in 10 of 25 patients and was tolerated well. The randomized crossover design corroborates that vALIC DBS causes symptom reduction rather than sham.

AB Background Antiviral treatment is currently not recommended for patients with chronic hepatitis B with a low viral load. However, they might benefit from acquiring a functional cure (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] loss with or without formation of antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen [anti-HBs]). We assessed HBsAg loss during peg-interferon-alfa-2a (peg-IFN) and nucleotide analogue combination therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B with a low viral load.
   Methods In this randomised controlled, open-label trial, patients were enrolled from the Academic Medical Center (AMC), Amsterdam, Netherlands. Eligible patients were HBsAg positive and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) negative for more than 6 months, could be treatment naive or treatment experienced, and had alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations less than 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). Participants were randomly assigned (1: 1: 1) by a computerised randomisation programme (ALEA Randomisation Service) to receive peg-IFN 180 mu g/week plus adefovir 10 mg/day, peg-IFN 180 mu g/week plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 245 mg/day, or no treatment for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with serum HBsAg loss among those who received at least one dose of study drug or had at least one study visit (modified intention-to-treat population [mITT]). All patients have finished the initial study of 72 weeks and will be observed for up to 5 years of follow-up. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00973219.
   Findings Between Aug 4, 2009, and Oct 17, 2013, 167 patients were screened for enrolment, of whom 151 were randomly assigned (52 to peg-IFN plus adefovir, 51 to peg-IFN plus tenofovir, and 48 to no treatment). 46 participants in the peg-IFN plus adefovir group, 45 in the peg-IFN plus tenofovir group, and 43 in the no treatment group began treatment or observation and were included in the mITT population. At week 72, two (4%) patients in the peg-IFN plus adefovir group and two (4%) patients in the peg-IFN plus tenofovir group had achieved HBsAg loss, compared with none of the patients in the no treatment group (p= 0.377). The most frequent adverse events (>30%) were fatigue, headache, fever, and myalgia, which were attributed to peg-IFN dosing. Two (4%) serious adverse events were reported in the peg-IFN plus adefovir group (admission to hospital for alcohol-related pancreatitis [week 6; n=1] and pregnancy, which was electively aborted [week 9; n=1]), three (7%) in the peg-IFN plus tenofovir group (admission to hospital after a suicide attempt during a severe depression [week 23; n=1], admission to hospital for abdominal pain [week 2; n=1], and an elective laminectomy [week 40; n=1]), and three (7%) in the no treatment group (admission to hospital for septic arthritis [week 72; n=1], endocarditis [week 5; n=1], and hyperthyroidism [week 20; n=1]).
   Interpretation In patients with chronic hepatitis B with a low viral load, combination treatment (peg-IFN plus adefovir and peg-IFN plus tenofovir) did not result in significant HBsAg loss compared with no treatment, which does not support the use of combination treatment in this population of patients.

AB Background
   Proponents of early intervention have argued that outcomes might be improved if more therapeutic efforts were focused on the early stages of schizophrenia or on people with prodromal symptoms. Early intervention in schizophrenia has two elements that are distinct from standard care: early detection, and phase-specific treatment (phase-specific treatment is a psychological, social or physical treatment developed, or modified, specifically for use with people at an early stage of the illness). Early detection and phase-specific treatment may both be offered as supplements to standard care, or may be provided through a specialised early intervention team. Early intervention is now well established as a therapeutic approach in America, Europe and Australasia.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the effects of: (a) early detection; (b) phase-specific treatments; and (c) specialised early intervention teams in the treatment of people with prodromal symptoms or first-episode psychosis.
   Search strategy
   We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (March 2009), inspected reference lists of all identified trials and reviews and contacted experts in the field.
   Selection criteria
   We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) designed to prevent progression to psychosis in people showing prodromal symptoms, or to improve outcome for people with first-episode psychosis. Eligible interventions, alone and in combination, included: early detection, phase-specific treatments, and care from specialised early intervention teams. We accepted cluster-randomised trials but excluded non-randomised trials.
   Data collection and analysis
   We reliably selected studies, quality rated them and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we estimated relative risks (RR), with the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where possible, we calculated the number needed to treat/harm statistic (NNT/H) and used intention-to-treat analysis (ITT).
   Main results
   Studies were diverse, mostly small, undertaken by pioneering researchers and with many methodological limitations (18 RCTs, total n=1808). Mostly, meta-analyses were inappropriate. For the six studies addressing prevention of psychosis for people with prodromal symptoms, olanzapine seemed of little benefit (n=60, 1 RCT, RR conversion to psychosis 0.58 CI 0.3 to 1.2), and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) equally so (n=60, 1 RCT, RR conversion to psychosis 0.50 CI 0.2 to 1.7). A risperidone plus CBT plus specialised team did have benefit over specialist team alone at six months (n=59, 1 RCT, RR conversion to psychosis 0.27 CI 0.1 to 0.9, NNT 4 CI 2 to 20), but this was not seen by 12 months (n=59, 1 RCT, RR 0.54 CI 0.2 to 1.3). Omega 3 fatty acids (EPA) had advantage over placebo (n=76, 1 RCT, RR transition to psychosis 0.13 CI 0.02 to 1.0, NNT 6 CI 5 to 96). We know of no replications of this finding.
   The remaining trials aimed to improve outcome in first-episode psychosis. Phase-specific CBT for suicidality seemed to have little effect, but the single study was small (n=56, 1 RCT, RR suicide 0.81 CI 0.05 to 12.26). Family therapy plus a specialised team in the Netherlands did not clearly affect relapse (n=76, RR 1.05 CI 0.4 to 3.0), but without the specialised team in China it may (n=83, 1 RCT, RR admitted to hospital 0.28 CI 0.1 to 0.6, NNT 3 CI 2 to 6). The largest and highest quality study compared specialised team with standard care. Leaving the study early was reduced (n=547, 1 RCT, RR 0.59 CI 0.4 to 0.8, NNT 9 CI 6 to 18) and compliance with treatment improved (n=507, RR stopped treatment 0.20 CI 0.1 to 0.4, NNT 9 CI 8 to 12). The mean number of days spent in hospital at one year were not significantly different (n=507, WMD, -1.39 CI -2.8 to 0.1), neither were data for 'Not hospitalised' by five years (n=547, RR 1.05 CI 0.90 to 1.2). There were no significant differences in numbers 'not living independently' by one year (n=507, RR 0.55 CI 0.3 to 1.2). At five years significantly fewer participants in the treatment group were 'not living independently' (n=547, RR 0.42 CI 0.21 to 0.8, NNT 19 CI 14 to 62). When phase-specific treatment (CBT) was compared with befriending no significant differences emerged in the number of participants being hospitalised over the 12 months (n=62, 1 RCT, RR 1.08 CI 0.59 to 1.99). Phase-specific treatment E-EPA oils suggested no benefit (n=80, 1 RCT, RR no response 0.90 CI 0.6 to 1.4) as did phase-specific treatment brief intervention (n=106, 1 RCT, RR admission 0.86 CI 0.4 to 1.7).
   Phase-specific ACE found no benefit but participants given vocational intervention were more likely to be employed (n=41, 1 RCT, RR 0.39 CI 0.21 to 0.7, NNT 2 CI 2 to 4). Phase-specific cannabis and psychosis therapy did not show benefit (n=47, RR cannabis use 1.30 CI 0.8 to 2.2) and crisis assessment did not reduce hospitalisation (n=98, RR 0.85 CI 0.6 to 1.3). Weight was unaffected by early behavioural intervention.
   Authors' conclusions
   There is emerging, but as yet inconclusive evidence, to suggest that people in the prodrome of psychosis can be helped by some interventions. There is some support for specialised early intervention services, but further trials would be desirable, and there is a question of whether gains are maintained. There is some support for phase-specific treatment focused on employment and family therapy, but again, this needs replicating with larger and longer trials.
