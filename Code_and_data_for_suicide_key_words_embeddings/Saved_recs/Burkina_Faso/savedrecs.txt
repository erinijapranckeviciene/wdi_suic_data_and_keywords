AB Background Data from other settings suggest that female sex workers (FSWs) are regularly exposed to violence and risks of psychological and physical trauma, although less is known about the effects of this violence. The objective of this study was to understand the experiences of violence and relationships with mental health symptomatology among FSWs. Methods: A mixed-methods design was used to explore the contexts and social perceptions of violence and mental health effects among FSW in Burkina Faso in 2013. Results: In all, 696 FSWs were recruited via respondent-driven sampling and enrolled in the study in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Seventy participants were also recruited into qualitative research. Nearly two-thirds of quantitative respondents (61.7%) reported experiencing lifetime physical violence, of whom 77.4% reported experiencing violence after initiating sex work. Further, 40.9% of participants reported forced non-consensual sex, most of which occurred after they had started sex work (73.0%). In some cases, the male perpetrator used physical force to force non-consensual sex. Forced non-consensual sex was often without condoms. Among quantitative participants, 41.8% reported ever having feelings of depression; there was also a high prevalence of suicide ideation in this group. Qualitative participants also described feelings of depression, alienation, and suicide ideation. Some qualitative participants described using protective methods to avoid violence and to promote social protection among FSWs. Conclusions: The findings suggest that stigma and physical and sexual abuse are prevalent among FSWs. Within this context of sex work, lifetime experiences of physical and sexual violence were highly correlated with self-reported mental health symptoms.

AB Background: To analyze the features of the acute poisoning cases admitted to Yalgado Ouedraogo University Hospital (CHU) in Ouagadougou.
   Methods: It is a prospective study conducted in 2014. All the poisoning cases admitted to the Medical and Paediatric Emergency services in Yalgado Ouedraogo University Hospital (CHU) in Ouagadougou since January to December 2014 were included in this study. The clinical records of poisoned patients were analysed. The data collection was done through a questionnaire.
   Results: Acute poisoning comprised 672(5%) out of 13442 of all the admissions to the Medical and Paediatric Emergency services in Yalgado Ouedraogo University Hospital (CHU) in Ouagadougou. About 47% of the poisoned were children up to 16 years old. Also, 55% of the poisoned were female. Medicines were the major responsible factor (41%) and then household products (27%). The poisonings were mainly (70%) accidental and unintentional; and the remaining were intentional (suicide attempt). The study tools were clinical diagnosis, history taking, and physical examination. The outcomes were positive in 70% of the cases; but negative and resulting in death in 3% of cases. About 7% of those poisoned ran away during their hospitalisation and 20% were transferred to other wards for the rest of their treatment.
   Conclusion: The study provided an inventory of the situation regarding acute poisoning in the emergency services of Yalgado Ouedraogo University Hospital in Ouagadougou.
