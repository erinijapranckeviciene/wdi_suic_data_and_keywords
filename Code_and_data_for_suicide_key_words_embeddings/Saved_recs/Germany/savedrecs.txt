AB As in many countries, the numbers of older prisoners are rising in Germany, but scientific information on this group is scarce. For the current study, a survey was used that included all prison suicides in Germany between the years of 2000 and 2013. Suicide rates of the elderly prisoners exceeded the suicide rates of the general population and the same age group. We observed a continuous decrease in the suicide rate of elderly prisoners. When compared to the younger suicide victims in prison, significantly more elderly suicide victims were: female, of German nationality, remand prisoners, or serving a life sentence. In Germany, elderly prisoners are a vulnerable subpopulation of the prison population. Higher suicide rates than in the same age group in the general population indicate unmet needs regarding mental disorders and their specific treatment.

AB Background. Suicide mortality is usually higher among men than among women. In socially disadvantaged groups, this relationship can be reversed. We investigated whether this is the case among Turkish migrants in Germany.
   Material and methods. We calculated age and sex-specific suicide rates for Turkish nationals residing in (West) Germany (11186 suicides) and for Germans aged below 65 years based on death registration data covering the period 1980-1997.
   Results. Age-adjusted suicide rates among Turks were lower than among Germans (relative risk 0.3). Among Turkish girls and young women under 18 years, however, the relative risk compared to Germans was 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.4-2.3). The male-to-female ratio in this age group was 3.2 among Germans and 0.6 among Turks. Discussion. Overall,Turks living in Germany have a lower suicide mortality than Germans. Possible explanations include a high level of social coherence in the Turkish community and religious prohibitions. The high suicide rate among Turkish girls and young women could indicate the presence of social or cultural conflict situations.

AB Objective According to a recent survey based on the years 20052007, the highest suicide rate in Germany was found for the town Weiden (Bavaria, Upper Palatinate). We aimed at having a closer look at this finding by using a longer investigation period (20002008).
   Methods Suicide rates of Weiden were contrasted with suicide rates of Bavaria and Germany. Data were obtained from the Bavarian State Office for Statistics and Data Processing and the German Federal Statistical Office.
   Results The finding named above was based on the influence of a data outlier (2006) in the number of annual suicides which is clearly evened out by examining the longer investigation period from 2000-2008. The suicide rate of Weiden is indeed higher than suicide rate of Germany and slightly higher than suicide rate of Bavaria, but not to such a drastic degree as had been stated.
   Conclusions Investigation period and number of inhabitants have to be considered at interpreting suicide rate studies to prevent jumping to a conclusion.

ID EXPECTED YEARS; LIFE LOST; TRENDS
AB Aim: To assess suicide mortality in comparison to traffic accidents and homicide deaths in Germany in the year 2010 and to compare years of life lost (YLL) due to these unnatural deaths. Methods: Mortality data were provided by the Federal Statistical Office giving death rates (related to 100,000 inhabitants) and proportions (related to 100 deaths of individuals) for suicide, traffic accidents and homicide as well as YLL data. Results: A total of 14,441 unnatural deaths (suicide, traffic accidents, homicide) were reported in 2010 in Germany. Of those, 10,021 subjects (69.4%) committed suicide, 3,942 (27.3%) died in traffic accidents, 478 (3.3%) were murdered. Suicide death rates were by far the highest, with rates for men (18.6) three times higher than for women (6.1). For both sexes, suicide rates increased with age, whereas suicide as a proportion of all causes of death was higher in younger age groups. In both sexes, suicide was the leading cause of YLL (men: 314 YLL, women: 90 YLL). Conclusions: Suicide is the leading cause of unnatural death and YLL. The sex-and age-specific patterns in suicide mortality call for different action plans to target high risk groups.

This finding adds to similar evidence from other countries (Austria, Belarus, British Isles, Denmark, Netherlands, and USA), suggestive of positive ecologic (group-level) associations between indicators for cognitive ability and suicide prevalence, whilst off setting prior inconclusive evidence for Germany from Voracek (2006) on the same question.

AB The authors designed a questionnaire to investigate the differences in German and Japanese general Practitioners' (GP) awareness of suicide and attitudes toward patients with suicidal ideation in their respective societies. The purpose of this study was to obtain insights leading to a better means of suicide prevention in primary care in Japan. The background for conducting the study was declining suicides in the past 20 years and the lower suicide rate in Germany compared with the present situation in Japan, where the number of suicides has in recent years continued to exceed 30,000, resulting in a suicide rate approximately 2 times higher than that in Germany. The questionnaire was randomly mailed to GPs in Okayama-Prefecture (western Japan) and Hamburg-State (northern Germany) and was collected in the same way. The patterns of answers were compared between the 2 countries, and the differences were statistically analyzed. Japanese GPs seem to have a lower will to prevent suicide in daily practice compared to German GPs and a great lack of knowledge about treatment of suicidal patients. These observations suggest that improving GPs' interest in the problem of suicide and providing training programs for the treatment of patients with suicidal intentions might be a means of achieving better suicide prevention in Japan.

AB At the end of 2015 the German parliament passed a new law, entitled Business-like Suicide Assistance, that effectively ended a rather liberal legal take on assisted suicide in Germany. The motivation behind the law was to prohibit Right-to-Die organisations such as Sterbehilfe Deutschlande.V as well as repeatedly acting individuals from assisting people in committing suicide. In response to the passing of 217 several individuals and organisations appealed to the German Federal Constitutional Court, asking it to rule the law unconstitutional. The court started debating six appeals earlier in 2019, and a decision is expected to be communicated by autumn/winter 2019. This article outlines the new law and articulates some concerns.

AB In 2006, 67 persons were killed in aircraft accidents in Germany and involving German aircrafts abroad. In spite of extensive investigation of each aircraft accident, there are no reliable data as to the number of suicides by aircraft. We report on a 50-year-old man who committed suicide by willfully crashing his Beech "Sierra" aircraft minutes after take off from an airport close to the town of Rendsburg, Germany. Before killing himself, the intoxicated pilot had sent an SMS announcing his suicide plans to a friend. The findings of the medico-legal investigation and the results of a review of aircraft accident reports by the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Investigation (BFU) regarding suicidal plane crashes are presented.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate potential differences between homicide-suicide cases in which the perpetrator does or does not write a suicide note. As homicide-suicides are complex types of lethal violence for which the aggressor cannot be held accountable, suicide notes may be a valuable source of information about the background of these cases and the perpetrators' motives. We use a national sample of N=288 homicide-suicide cases in Germany applying group comparisons and chi-square tests for relevant variables. Perpetrators killing their own children and perpetrators leaving children behind before killing themselves write significantly more suicide notes than other perpetrators. Even though note writers and no note writers are similar regarding most sociodemographic characteristics, other differences question the generalizability between these 2 groups.

AB Suicide rates in Germany consistently decreased from 1991 to 2006, but this trend was reversed in 2007. Underlying this reversal were large increases in suicides due to gassing in females and in being overrun in males. During a similar time period (2005-2013), Asian and some Western countries have also observed abrupt increases in suicides due to certain gasses, and the availability of "how-to" information on the Internet about these painless methods of suicide is thought to play a role in their increased use. This study used data from the Federal Statistics Office of Germany to examine current trends in overall suicide mortality in Germany (2007-2015) as well by age, gender, and suicide methods. Also assessed was whether suicides via newly emergent methods are associated with the frequency of corresponding Internet searches using data from Google Trends. Joinpoint regression analyses indicated significant increases in the overall suicide rate (Average Annual Percentage Change (AAPC) = 2.37%) for females, but not males. The largest annual increases were observed in gassing self-intoxication suicides (AAPC = 13.93%), the majority of which involved carbon monoxide. The increase in gassing suicides was larger in females (500%), compared to males (164%). The frequency of suicides by gassing was significantly associated with Internet searches for "carbon monoxide poisoning" for both male and female subgroups, independent of age group. This study provides the updated suicide surveillance data that are necessary for suicide prevention activities. Results are congruent with the recent abrupt rises in carbon monoxide suicides in other countries.

AB Background Overall, decreasing suicide mortality rates were observed in the last decades in most Western populations. However, it remains unclear, whether these favourable trends occurred uniformly in particular suicide methods. Therefore, the present study evaluated time trends of suicide mortality by method in Germany over the period 1991 - 2002. Methods A total of 145,865 fatal suicide cases of men and women aged 15 years and with available suicide method were recorded by the Federal Statistical Office of Germany (suicides coded "death following a suicide attempt" were excluded). Based on these data, seven different suicide methods were defined. Poisson regression was used to estimate the age-adjusted annual percentage change (AAPC) of the number of each suicide method. Results The most frequently used suicide methods in both sexes were hanging, strangling or suffocation (HSS) with 55.8% in men and 39.9% in women, followed by self-poisoning. Statistically significant declines of the number of suicides were observed, in descending order, for self-poisoning, drowning and HSS in both sexes. In contrast, methods using firearm discharges or stab with a sharp object remained in roughly constant level. Modifications of time trends were observed for several methods by age classes. Conclusions The present study demonstrates different time trends for suicide methods. Further examinations are recommended in particular concerning possible reasons for the choice of a suicidal method.

AB Specific risk factors for suicide among female prisoners were examined using an exhaustive sample of all suicides in German prisons between 2000 and 2013. The rate of prison suicide was lower among female (53,5/100,000) than among male prisoners (101/100,000). Differences between the genders regarding the various risk factors for prison suicide are few. Significant differences were observed only for bullying among men and higher percentages of drug withdrawal syndrome among women. Factors specific to the prison setting that contribute to suicide risk in incarcerated women should be examined. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Suicides account for over one million deaths per year worldwide with depression among the most important risk factors. Epidemiological research into the relationship between antidepressant utilization and suicide mortality has shown heterogeneous and contradictory results. Different methodological approaches and limitations could at least partially explain varying results. This is the first study assessing the association of suicide mortality and antidepressant sales across Germany using complex statistical approaches in order to control for possible confounding factors including spatial dependency of data. German suicide counts were analyzed on a district level (n = 402) utilizing ecological Poisson regressions within a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Due to significant spatial effects between adjacent districts spatial models were calculated in addition to a baseline non-spatial model. Models were adjusted for several confounders including socioeconomic variables, quality of psychosocial care, and depression prevalence. Separate analyses were performed for Eastern and Western Germany and for different classes of antidepressants (SSRIs and TCAs). Overall antidepressant sales were significantly negatively associated with suicide mortality in the non-spatial baseline model, while after adjusting for spatially structured and unstructured effects the association turned out to be insignificant. In sub-analyses, analogue results were found for SSRIs and TCAs separately. Suicide risk shows a distinct heterogeneous pattern with a pronounced relative risk in Southeast Germany. In conclusion, the results reflect the heterogeneous findings of previous studies on the association between suicide mortality and antidepressant sales and point to the complexity of this hypothesized link. Furthermore, the findings support tailored suicide preventive efforts within high risk areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide and assisted suicide are not criminal acts in Germany. However, attempting suicide may create a legal duty for physicians to try to save a patient's life. This study presents data on medical students' legal knowledge and ethical views regarding physician assisted suicide (PAS). ne majority of 85 respondents held PAS to be illegal. More than a third of the students viewed PAS in certain situations to be ethically acceptable whereas a smaller proportion thought that it should be legal. Compared with German physicians the medical students taking part in this study were less opposed to PAS. The majority perceived the undergraduate training concerning ethical aspect of assisted death as deficient.

   Criminal law injustice; Ban of assisted suicide organisations
AB Definition of the problem In the current ethical debate on physician-assisted suicide in Germany new sanctions in criminal law are debated from different sides. Whereas in the beginning the debate focused only on the ban of organised forms of suicide assistance, the explicit licensing of assisted suicide is also now requested by physicians. Arguments Considering the approach to include prohibition of assisted suicide within the German Criminal Code, the article shows that the impunity of suicide and suicide assistance has a long tradition in Germany. The impunity of assisted suicide cannot only be systematically and factually justified, but also in terms of content. A criminalization can be neither legally nor ethically justified. Conclusion The authors advocate-with reference to different legal drafts in the German Federal Parliament (Deutscher Bundestag)-for an open discourse within the medical profession and for a revision of the professional law.

AB Despite comprehensive prevention programs in Germany, suicide has been on the rise again since 2007. The underlying reasons and spatiotemporal risk patterns are poorly understood. We assessed the spatiotemporal risk of suicide per district attributable to multiple risk and protective factors longitudinally for the period 2007-11. Bayesian space-time regression models were fitted. The nationwide temporal trend showed an increase in relative risk (RR) of dying from suicide (RR 1.008, 95% credibility intervals (CI) 1.001-1.016), whereas district-specific deviations from the grand trend occurred. Striking patterns of amplified risk emerged in southern Germany. While the number of general practitioners was positively related (RR 1.003, 95% CI 1.000-1.006), income was negatively and nonlinearly related with suicide risk, as was population density. Unemployment was associated and showed a marked nonlinearity. Neither depression prevalence nor mental health service supply were related. The findings are vital for the implementation of future suicide prevention programs. Concentrating preventive efforts on vulnerable areas of excess risk is recommended.

AB Background: Railway suicides strongly impact psychological and socioeconomic aspects of the railway company, its employees and possible eye witnesses. We aimed to assess the incidence of railway suicides compared with the total burden of suicides in Germany and its time trend over a 10-year observation period. Methods: From 1991 to 2000, a total of 8653 fatal railway suicides were recorded by the national central registry of all passenger accidents on the German railway net. To assess time trends, the average annual percentage change ( AAPC) of the number of suicides was estimated using Poisson regression. Adjustments were made for two age groups and measures of availability. Results: Railway suicides accounted for 7.0% ( annual range 5.0 - 7.9%) of all suicides in Germany. The time trend of the number of suicides by all means declined, with a significant stronger decline for older subjects [ AAPC - 2.2; 95% confidence intercal (CI) -3.0 to -1.5; and -4.2; 95% CI -5.2 to -3.0]. An AAPC of 1.8% ( 95% CI 0.1 - 3.4) indicated an increasing time trend of the number of railway suicides for subjects aged <= 65 years, whereas, in contrast, fatal incidences for subjects aged > 65 years exhibited a strong decrease ( AAPC -6.2%; 95% CI - 10.9 to - 1.3). Conclusions: The present study demonstrates different time trends for railway suicides compared with all suicides. It underlines the urgent need for amplified research efforts in the particular field of railway suicides. Further examinations are recommended, in particular concerning possible reasons for this suicidal method.

AB In many countries, suicide is the most frequent cause of prison deaths; moreover, the respective national penal suicide rates are consistently several times higher than the suicide rates in the general population. To assess the situation in German prisons, an assessment of all suicides in German prisons by means of a survey was carried out for the time from 2000 to 2011. The mean rate per year of prison suicides in Germany from 2000 to 2011 was 105.8 per 100,000 male inmates and 54.7 per 100,000 female inmates. Male prisoner suicide rates significantly declined during the period under investigation; no significant trend was evident for female prisoners in pre-trial detention but a noteworthy increase was apparent in the suicide rate of female sentenced prisoners. A significant positive relationship can be demonstrated between occupation density and the suicide rate for both men and women. These results should be taken as a challenge for further research on the reasons for the unexpected increase of suicide rate in female sentenced prisoners and as well on the effect of population density on prison suicide rate.

   DEATH
AB Background: Whereas German suicide rates had a clear decreasing tendency between 1991 and 2006, they increased from 2007 to 2010. Deeper analyses of suicide data might help to understand better this change. The aim of this study was to analyze 1) whether recent trends can be related to changes in specific suicide methods and diverge by gender and age; 2) whether the decrease of suicide rates before 2007 as well as the increase from 2007 to 2010 are driven by the same suicide method.
   Methods: Analyses were based on suicide data from the Federal Statistical Office of Germany. For 1998-2010, 136.583 suicide cases of men and women with known age and suicide method could be identified. These data were analyzed by joinpoint regression analysis, allowing identification of the best fitting point in time ("joinpoint") at which the suicide rate significantly changes in magnitude or direction.
   Results: The national downward trend between 1998 and 2007 was mainly due to corresponding changes in self-poisoning by other means than drugs (e. g., pesticides) (annual percentage change (APC)<= -4.33), drowning (APC <= -2.73), hanging (APC <= -2.69) and suicides by firearms (APC <= -1.46) in both genders. Regarding the overall increase of age-adjusted suicide rates in Germany 2007-2010, mainly the increase of self-poisoning (e. g., by drugs) and "being overrun" (APC >= 1.50) contributed to this trend.
   Limitations: The true suicide rates might have been underestimated because of errors in the official death certificates.
   Conclusions: Increase in suicide rates in Germany since 2007 went along with corresponding changes for "being overrun" and "self-poisoning". Copycat suicides following the railway suicide of the goalkeeper Robert Enke partly contributed to the results. Thus, prevention of Werther effects and limitation of the availability of high pack sizes for drugs are of special relevance for the reversal of this trend.

DE Psychotherapy; Inpatient suicide; Preventive measures; Suicide rates;

ID IMPLEMENTATION; INPATIENTS
AB Suicide prevention is a core responsibility of psychiatry and psychotherapy. Periods of change in psychiatric inpatient treatment concepts are usually also accompanied by an increase in psychopathological behavior and with increased suicide rates in psychiatric hospitals, as seen in the 1970s and 1980s in Germany. That this represented a real increase of inpatient suicides during those years was confirmed and subsequently the number and rate of inpatient suicides has decreased from approximately 280 out of 100,000 admissions of patients in 1980 to approximately 50 in 2014. Death can also occur in psychiatric hospitals and an absolute prevention is not possible even under optimal conditions of therapy and nursing, communication and security. The suicide rate has clearly decreased over the last two decades in relation to admissions. The group of young male schizophrenic patients newly identified as having a high clinical suicide risk has decreased among the suicide victims whereas the percentage of severely depressed patients with delusions has increased. This reduction could be associated with the comprehensive improvements in educational and training programs in the field of suicide and suicide prevention, objectification of coping methods, development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, improvements in therapy and relationship possibilities and a general reduction in the number of suicides in Germany.

AB As a result of scientific publications indicating that the last two decades have seen an increase in the number of suicides in the US Armed Forces, the topic of suicide in the military of other countries, such as Germany, has also received a lot of attention in media and science alike. Risk factors for suicidal behaviour and suicide were identified in several research projects in the US, Canada, the UK, and Germany. Until now, German suicide research among military service personnel has mainly focused on epidemiological aspects of suicides and suicidality, individual risk factors, sub-groups at risk for suicide, suicides and deployment abroad, and associations of suicide and suicide attempts with acute mental disorders. The key findings are summarized in this review article. Efforts should be made to develop and evaluate risk group-focused and occupation-focused prevention and intervention programs. Future multinational studies should address potential differences between risk groups for fatal and non-fatal suicidal behaviour.

AB The purpose of this study was to analyze the differences in the disposition and frequency of recent life events preceding suicide in two cities with different socio-political backgrounds: Tallinn in Estonia and Frankfurt/Main in Germany. The information about 156 suicidents in Tallinn and 163 suicidents in Frankfurt was compiled using the psychological autopsy technique [Shneidman, E. S. (1981). The psychological autopsy. Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior, 11, 325-340; Jacobs, D., & Klein-Benheim, M. (1995). The psychological autopsy: A useful tool for determining proximate causation in suicide cases. Bulletin of American Academy of Psychiatry Law, 23(2), 165-182]. General population controls were matched by age and sex.
   The occurrence of recent life events was similar among suicidents in Tallinn (81%) and Frankfurt (77%). However, in both sites only male suicides had higher risk of occurrence of any life event than controls (Tallinn: OR' = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.1-3.7; Frankfurt: OR' = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.0-4.1) and the mean number of life events was significantly higher among male suicidents in Tallinn in comparison with controls. This may indicate that males are more sensitive to the rapid changes in a society undergoing transition. It seems that it is not the number of life events, but rather their meaning and disposition that creates the risk of suicide, Family discord (weighted OR = 4.5; 95% CI 2.5-8.1), loss of job (weighted OR = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.0-6.4) and financial deterioration (weighted OR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.3-3.8) were more prevalent among suicides in Tallinn in comparison with those in Frankfurt. The most significant differences between suicides and controls were family discord, separation and loss of job in Tallinn and somatic illness in Frankfurt.
   These differences between the two societies, post-Soviet Estonia and Germany, could be explained by the different positions of Estonia and Germany on the survival/self-expression dimensions recorded by the World Value Survey. People in Estonia tend to emphasize economic and physical security above all other goals, and feel threatened by the changes taking place in society. In Germany, good health is considered a necessity for a consumer and self-expressive style of life, and poor health is perceived as a serious threat to the quality of life in a post-materialistic value system.

AB Background: There is limited international as well as national research on suicide events in prisons and in forensic psychiatric hospitals. This retrospective study compares completed suicide events within these two high-risk populations in state institutions over a time period of 5 years from 2000 to 2004.
   Material and Methods: Data was collected through a nationwide survey: all forensic psychiatric hospitals within Germany were contacted via postal mail and received a questionnaire concerning the suicide events from 2000 to 2004. All federal lands of Germany were similarly assessed by a survey endorsed by the respective federal ministries of justice. All prison institutions (100%) participated in the survey, while 84% (53 units) of the forensic psychiatric hospitals nationwide contributed. A comparative statistical analysis was conducted using Fisher's exact test or the Mann-Whitney U-test (age). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to assess adjusted effects. For the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the months until suicide were analyzed followed by a Cox-regression analysis.
   Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the mean suicide rate in forensic psychiatric hospitals (123/100.000, 95% confidence interval: [0.00103, 0.00147]) and in the prison system (130/100.000, 95% confidence interval: [0.00109, 0.00154]). Patients who committed suicide in the forensic hospitals were, in comparison to the prison system, more likely to have committed a violent offense and have had a prior history of suicide attempts. The duration from admission into the institution to the suicide event was significantly shorter in the prison group. Also, younger people commited suicide earlier during their stay in a forensic psychiatric hospital or prison.
   Conclusions: While the results suggest a necessity to optimize data collection in the prison system (prior suicide events and history of mental disorder), it is important to discuss the current discharge arrangements within the forensic hospitals.

AB Background: Following the railway suicide of Robert Enke, a famous German football goal keeper, short-term copycat effects have been found. Main aims of the present study were to analyze long-term effects of this incidence and to compare them with overall national suicide data, as well as to investigate possible "anniversary effects".
   Methods: For long-term effects, the number of railway suicidal acts in the two years before and after Robert Enke's suicide (10th November 2009) were compared. For anniversary effects, the corresponding 2-week-periods in 2009, 2010 and 2011 were analyzed. Incidence ratios with 95% confidence intervals were computed.
   Results: Compared to the two years before Enke's suicide the incidence ratio of the number of railway suicidal acts in the 2-year-period following this event increased by 18.8% (95% confidence interval (CI)=11.0-27.1%; p < 0.001). The median number of suicidal acts per day increased from 2 to 3 (p < 0.001). This effect remains significant after excluding short-term 2-week effects of Enke's suicide. An anniversary effect was not present. The increase of fatal railway suicides between 2007 and 2010 (25%) was significantly different from that for the total number of suicides in Germany (6.6%) (p < 0.0001).
   Limitations: Due to missing data, analyses regarding gender were limited and regarding age not feasible.
   Conclusions: Long-term effects of Enke's suicide on railway suicidal acts in Germany in the sense of copycat behavior are probable as this increase cannot be explained by corresponding changes of the total number of suicides in Germany. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The existence of the so-called "Werther effect" is well confirmed, and there are several recommendations on how the media should (not) report suicide to minimize the risk of copycat behavior. Unfortunately, very little is known about how suicide is actually reported. The article examines the German press coverage of six celebrity suicides with respect to compliance with guidelines on suicide reporting and analyzes changes in suicides in the wake of the reporting. It concludes that German media do not respect the recommendations in a substantial number of their articles. In addition, a significant increase in suicides and similar suicides is found.

AB Insufficient treatment of depression is one of the most important causes of suicide. The Nuremberg Alliance against Depression (funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research) tried to improve the quality of care for patients suffering from depression. This multilevel programme focussed on close cooperation with general practitioners, a public relation campaign about depression, involvement of other professional groups, and reinforcement of self-help activities.
   The project was realised in the city of Nuremberg, Germany in 2001-2002. Changes in the frequency of suicidal acts (successful and attempted suicides) compared to a baseline (2000) and a control region (Wuerzburg, Germany) were prospectively defined as the main outcome criterion.
   The frequency of suicidal acts decreased significantly (-21.7%) compared to the control region. This reduction was mainly due to a lower rate of suicide attempts.
   Many other regions in Germany and Europe followed the Nuremberg model project and have initiated regional alliances against depression.

ID SUICIDE; MEDIA
AB The Werther effect is a highly regarded phenomenon in media effect research. Since the trail-blazing studies conducted by the American sociologist Phillips, there have been a great many attempts to quantify and evaluate imitative deeds that follow genuine suicides and apparent attempts at suicide. This paper starts by tracing the milestones along the way of research into the Werther effect. The concrete imitation patterns following suicides are then discussed, and the implications for responsible journalistic reporting that arise out of them are presented.
   This seems to be necessary, since despite many-sided and detailed findings on the Werther effect in Germany, there have so far been no experiments devoted to ways of exploiting these research results practically in a suicide prevention programme. Whilst in other countries preliminary guidelines for journalistic reporting have already been elaborated and in some countries even implemented, such efforts are still only in the very early stages in Germany.

AB Pesticide poisoning is a major public health issue especially in low-income countries. WHO figures show about 3 million pesticide poisonings occurring worldwide annually. A recent systematic review estimated that 360 000 fatalities result from self-poisoning with pesticides, accounting for approximately 30 per cent of all suicides worldwide. We analyzed the German cause-of-death registry with respect to pesticide-specific ICD codes. We present crude and age-standardized mortality rates plus the percentage of all suicides that are intentional pesticide poisonings. From 1980 to 2010 the number of fatal pesticide poisoning in Germany dropped from 506 to 39. The crude mortality rate decreased from 6.5 per 1 million inhabitants in 1980 to 0.5 in 2010. Reduced availability of toxic pesticides in Germany played the biggest role in the decline of fatal pesticide poisoning. We worry that declines in pesticide poisonings in industrialized countries are not matched in developing countries.

AB Data on the effect of the September 11, 2001 (9/11) terror attacks on suicide rates remain inconclusive. Reportedly, even people located far from the attack site have considerable potential for personalizing the events that occurred on 9/11. Durkheim's theory states that suicides decrease during wartime; thus, a decline in suicides might have been expected after 9/11.
   We conducted a time series analysis of 164,136 officially recorded suicides in Germany between 1995 and 2009 using the algorithm introduced by Box and Jenkins.
   Compared with the average death rate, we observed no relevant change in the suicide rate of either sex after 9/11. Our estimates of an excess of suicides approached the null effect value on and within a 7-day period after 9/11, which also held when subsamples of deaths in urban or rural settings were examined.
   No evidence of Durkheim's theory attributable to the 9/11 attacks was found in this sample.

DE Affect; assisted suicide; legal pluralism; uncertainty
ID ETHNOGRAPHY
AB In December 2015, Germany implemented its first official law regulating organized assistance to suicide. Prior to the implementation of the 217 of the criminal code, assisted suicide was already regulated by 18 different sets of mutually contradictory medical norms, but despite their coexistence within the federal jurisdiction, these norms did not overlap at state level and were binding only to registered members of each medical association. After the implementation of the 217 StGB, however, the new legal pluralism on assisted suicide turned into one of overlaps, where medical norms and official law were oftentimes on opposing sides. This new plural legal landscape became a source of doubts and suspicions for those involved with assisted suicide on the ground level, shrouding assisted suicide with an affective perception of illegality and making the state be perceived through a general sense of mistrust and uncertainty. In this sense, this article first presents the production of a new legal pluralism on assisted suicide following the implementation of the 217 StGB to, subsequently, discuss how this legal landscape obscured the question of legality by enhancing uncertainties on the ground level and constituting an affective mode of governance.

AB Inpatient Suicide in the Hospital - Overview and Recent Data on Suicide During Psychiatric Inpatient Treatment Research in suicide among psychiatric inpatients has begun in Germany in the 1970' s. Up to now, two important results have been achieved: first, there was an effective increase in suicides during psychiatric inpatient treatment in the 1970' s and 1980' s, and second, this increase particularly involved young schizophrenic men. In most inpatient suicide studies, the number of schizophrenic suicides amounts to 40-60%, for affective disorders to 20-30%. Suicides of schizophrenic inpatients have to be seen in the context of the course of the illness. Knowledge about course and outcome of schizophrenia play an important role in the psychodynamics of inpatient suicide.

AB The purpose of this research was to assess the effect of major social changes in Germany since 1989 on mortality due to intentional injury. Mechanisms and types of fatal intentional injury in East and West Germany between 1970 and 1995 were determined from death certificates and compared with judicial data on violent crime convictions and recent public survey data on citizen fear of crime. The number of homicides among East German males increased between 1989 and 1991, and the homicide rate remains high when compared with West German males (although lower than that of American males). Homicide among German females is less common, presently about equally likely in East and West. Violent crime in general has become more frequent in Germany, and citizen fear of crime has increased markedly, especially in the East. Non-citizens are convicted for an increasing number of homicides and assaults. Rates of suicide were declining in East and West before reunification, and these rates have continued to decline. Social changes in Europe since 1989 have led to noticeable increases in violence and homicide in Germany, which in turn have reduced feelings of security among German citizens, especially in the East. Suicide rates have not been affected. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB During the past years suicide statistics in Germany showed a dramatic decrease of suicide rates. Such a reduction in a comparatively short time period is not explainable by an altered frequency of major psychiatric disorders or certain neurobiological conditions that may underlie suicide; other factors causing or leading to suicide and their modification have to be considered. This overview illustrates various risk factors for suicide different from neurobiology. Epidemiological aspects and the effect of political, social and economic contributions to suicide rates are exemplified. With regard to the incidence of major psychiatric disorders the paper focuses on physical illnesses and their risk of suicide. Finally the significance of changes in the accessibility of suicide methods is discussed.

AB Suicide rates of male and female physicians are about 3-5 times higher compared with the general public. Detailed studies about medical student suicides in the United States exist but similar current data from German speaking countries are lacking.
   In this study suicide among medical students in Germany, Austria and Switzerland was analyzed using Medline and Google search engines and information from insurance companies, public institutions, statistical agencies and leading scientists in Germany, Austria and Switzerland was requested. The incidence of suicide among medical students at the Medical University of Innsbruck was also examined.
   In publications from German speaking countries some medical student suicides are mentioned but current statistics were not available. Between 2006 and 2011 the Tyrolean State Police in Austria registered 14 suicides by students of all disciplines. At Innsbruck Medical University (approximately 2,800 medical students) it was found that 6 medical students committed suicide between June 2007 and June 2012 (rate 36 per 100,000).
   The suicide risk of medical students at the Medical University of Innsbruck appears to be increased. Because of a lack of comparable data it is not possible to show whether these observations can be extrapolated to other universities. It appears that there was no single special event which triggered suicide by the medical students but a combination of individual risk factors and the environment was involved. However, this problem receives insufficient attention.

AB Despite disconcerting numbers, the subject of suicide in old age still lacks the necessary attention. Suicides of elderly persons only come into the focus of public interest if they involve prominent personalities.
   This article presents the characteristics of suicides in Zwickau, with a focus on persons over the age of 65 years. The data for Zwickau were compared to the results of national and international studies.
   A retrospective statistical study of all deaths by intentional self-harm was carried out for the years 1994-2013 in the urban area of Zwickau. The study included death certificates, investigation and autopsy records. The deaths were examined with respect to demographic aspects, suicide method, motivation and prior notification.
   Older adults (> 65 years) showed the highest rates of suicide in Germany and also internationally. The investigation of deaths by suicide in the town of Zwickau, West Saxony, during the period 1994-2013 showed a statistically significant higher suicide rate in the age group over 80 years old.
   Given the demographic development in Germany, the increasing multimorbidity and social isolation of older people, a further increase in suicide in old age is to be expected. The problems associated with this phenomenon should be expounded in the coming years. It is necessary to extend preventive measures and to educate older people about existing offers of help.

Times of changes in psychiatric inpatient treatment conceptions usually come along with an increase of psychopathology and with increasing suicide rates in psychiatric hospitals to, like seen in the seventies and eighties of last century in Germany. After a real increase of inpatient suicides during those years the number and rate of inpatient suicides decreased from about 280 of 100 000 admissions of patients in 1980 to about 50 in 2014. Young male schizophrenic patients were identified as the new high risk group despite the severely depressed patients with delusions as a traditional high risk group. Nowadays suicide prevention is part of all educational programs in psychiatry and psychotherapy.

AB Background
   Suicide prediction during psychiatric in-patient treatment remains an unresolved challenge.
   Aims
   To identify determinants of railway suicides in individuals receiving in-patient psychiatric treatment.
   Method
   The study population was drawn from patients admitted to six psychiatric hospitals in Germany during a 10-year period (1997-2006). Data from 101 railway suicide cases were compared with a control group of 101 discharged patients matched for age, gender and diagnosis.
   Results
   Predictors of suicide were change of therapist (OR=22.86, P=0.004), suicidal ideation (OR=7.92, P<0.001), negative or unchanged therapeutic course (OR=7.73, P<0.001), need of polypharmaceutical treatment (OR=2.81, P=0.04) and unemployment (OR=2.72, P=0.04). Neither restlessness nor impulsivity predicted in-patient suicide.
   Conclusions
   Suicidal ideation, unfavourable clinical course and the use of multiple psychotropic substances (reflecting the severity of illness) were strong determinants of railway suicides. The most salient finding was the vital impact of a change of therapist. These findings deserve integration into the clinical management of patients with serious mental disease.

AB Compared to normal population, the risk for suicidal behaviour is much higher in psychiatric inpatients. The aim of the study was to find predictors for suicidal behaviour. Another question concerned the existence of any differences between patients with suicidal attempts, suicides and those without any suicidal behaviour. For this purpose 78 patients were included to the study, who were in-patients of a psychiatric hospital in Northern Germany in the years 1980 to 1998. Each of them belonged to one of the above mentioned groups. Data were compared according to the "Drillingsmethode". According to our results severe depressive symptoms, former suicidal attempts, bad events in childhood, a long duration of illness, comorbidities and complications in the course of disease-treatment were typical not only for the group of suicide attempters but also for the group with suicides. As for the suicide attempters a more negative prognosis by clinicians could be revealed compared to those with suicides.

AB Purpose: Ethnic minority groups show elevated suicide attempt rates across Europe. Evidence suggests a similar trend for women of Turkish origin in Germany, yet data on suicidal behaviour in minorities in Germany is scarce. The objective was to examine rates of suicidal behaviour, underlying motives, and to explore the effectiveness of an intervention program.
   Methods: From 05/2009-09/2011, data on all suicide attempts among women of Turkish origin who presented at a hospital-based emergency unit in Berlin, Germany, were collected. A multi-modal intervention was conducted in 2010 and the effects of age, generation and the intervention on suicide attempt rates were examined.
   Results: At the start, the highest rate was found in women aged 18-24 years with 225.4 (95% CI = 208.8-242.0)/100,000. Adjustment disorder was the most prevalent diagnosis with 49.7% (n = 79), being more common in second-generation women (P = .004). Further analyses suggested an effect of the intervention in the youngest age group (trend change of beta = -1.25; P = .017).
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest a particularly high rate of suicide attempts by 18-24-year-old, second-generation women of Turkish origin in Berlin. Furthermore, our results suggest a trend change in suicide attempts in women aged 18-24 years related to a population-based intervention program. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The majority of fatalities on the European Union (EU) railways are suicides, representing about 60% of all railway fatalities. The aim of this study was to compare time patterns of suicidal behaviour on railway tracks in Germany between two observation periods (1995-1998 and 2005-2008) in order to investigate their stability and value in railway suicide prevention.
   Methods: Cases were derived from the National Central Registry of person accidents on the German railway network (STABAG). The association of daytime, weekday and month with the mean number of suicides was analysed applying linear regression. Potential differences by observation period were assessed by adding observation period and the respective interaction terms into the linear regression. A 95% confidence interval for the mean number of suicides was computed using the t distribution.
   Results: A total of 7,187 railway suicides were recorded within both periods: 4,102 (57%) in the first period (1995-1998) and 3,085 (43%) in the second (2005-2008). The number of railway suicides was highest on Mondays and Tuesdays in the first period with an average of 3.2 and 3.5 events and of 2.6 events on both days in the second period. In both periods, railway suicides were more common between 6: 00 am and noon, and between 6: 00 pm and midnight. Seasonality was only prominent in the period 1995-1998.
   Conclusions: Over the course of two observation periods, the weekday and circadian patterns of railway suicides remained stable. Therefore, these patterns should be an integral part of railway suicide preventive measures, e. g. gatekeeper training courses.

AB Background The factors most strongly associated with suicide are age and gender-more men than women, and, more people over 65 kill themselves. As a number of Governments have targets to reduce suicide levels we compare elderly suicide rates over a 20-year period in England and Wales. And the major Western countries focusing upon age and gender.
   Method WHO mortality data were used to calculate three-year average General Population Suicide Rates (GPSR) for 1979-1981 to 1997-1999 and rates of people aged 65-74 and 75+ suicide by gender to provide ratios of change and a statistical comparison of England and Wales and the Major Western countries over the period.
   Results Male GSPR: '65-74' suicide ratios fell significantly in six countries and in three for the '75+'. Female GSPR: '65-74' suicide ratios fell in every country except Spain. Proportionately, there were more suicides in the over 65s in countries with an 'extended family' tradition, Spain, Italy, Germany, France and Japan, than in the five 'secular' countries. England and Wales male '65-74' suicide fell significantly more than Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Netherlands and the USA, and did significantly better than the other countries for all female senior citizen suicides.
   Conclusion Suicide of the over-65s has improved in seven countries, especially in England and Wales, who had the greatest proportional reduction, which reflects well upon the psycho-geriatric and community services. However, in all countries, male 65-74 rates did not match the female out so extra efforts are needed to improve male rates. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB As social science evolved during the second half of the nineteenth century, the phenomenon of suicide received significant attention from sociologists. The issue of the frequency of suicides in the Imperial German armed forces proved highly sensitive. Official sources sought to minimize evidence of the mistreatment of soldiers in their presentation of suicide data, while critics of militarism, especially in the Social Democratic Party, used suicides in the military to expose what they regarded as systemic abuse. The issue became a case study in the potential politicization of social science findings and the polarization of public discourse in Imperial Germany.

AB In international epidemiological studies, associations between suicides and body height, or body mass index (BMI) were found. Because of the recently growing number of suicides in Germany, a closer look on different anthropometric measures of suicide victims autopsied at the Institute of Forensic Medicine of the Goethe-University in Frankfurt/Main, Germany, was taken.
   A retrospective analysis of 1,271 non-natural death cases autopsied between 2006 and 2010 was performed. A total of 566 other than suicide (control group) and 245 suicide cases (study group) with a given body height and weight aged between 18 and 96 years were examined.
   Body mass indices of the 18-59-year-old male and 60-79-year-old female suicide victims were significantly lower. Old-aged women who committed suicide exhibited beside a significant lower body mass a significantly slender body shape measured as smaller pelvic circumference, waist circumference, and waist-to-tallness ratio. Self-poisoning was by far the leading suicide method in both genders. The victims of the suicide method hanging were the youngest on average, and this method was most common in the male underweight and female lightly normal weight BMI categories, whereas old, overweight, and obese men killed themselves predominantly with firearms.
   The analysis showed that body measures of suicide cases in comparison to other non-natural death circumstance cases differ. For criminal procedural reasons, all suicide cases should be autopsied. But high autopsy rates are also needed for scientific research and to ensure a high level of patient safety.

AB The suicide risk in Germany increases with age. The suicide rates follow the so called "Hungarian" pattern. Especially the percentage of older females among all suicides has increased unproportionally in recent years in relation to their percentage in the population. Every second suicide of a female is today a suicide of a female older than 60 years. The main suicide method among older persons is hanging. Suicide attempts are rare among older persons; however, the rates are increasing among the oldest age groups. The suicide attempts of older persons are committed with a higher lethality and show rarely appellative components. Suicide attempt methods are often poisoning with pharmaceuticals. In total the suicide and suicide attempt rates among elderly are underestimated due to indirect methods (passive reactions, e.g. noneating). Reasons for suicides and suicide attempts among older persons are often psychic illnesses (mostly depression), motives often include loss of partners, loss of the social network, fear of the consequences of somatic illnesses and loss of freedom of action. Thus, often the social situation of older persons with suicide attempts changed before suicide was attempted.

TI Suicide at the end of the Third Reich
SO JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
AB The Third Reich culminated in a massive wave of suicides. This article traces the origins of this wave, which took place in the spring of 1945, when there was a general feeling among Germans that everything was coming to an end, and analyses its background with reference to nazi propaganda, the nazi cult of death and the Allied occupation of Germany and its aftermath. It will ask whether this wave of suicides also sheds light on the extent to which German society as a whole had developed an ideological commitment to the nazis. Many Germans felt that there had been a complete breakdown of norms and values, which cannot be explained only by the breakdown of the Third Reich. Many people who committed suicide did not perceive politics, war and everyday life as unconnected, but as elements that merged during a very difficult time. The history of the wave of suicides at the end of the Third Reich sheds new light on the decline and fall of the Third Reich and the difficult transition of Germany from a fascist to a post-fascist society.

AB According to official statistics every year 11,000 persons in Germany die from suicide. 20 years ago nearly 19,000 suicides were registered. What are the causes for this decrease? Do suicide preventive measures contribute to the reduction of suicide rates? Different universal prevention strategies ( e. g. restriction of access to means) and selective approaches ( programs for special high-risk groups; e. g. patients after attempted suicide) are presented and discussed regarding their preventive value. In most cases it is hardly possible to scientifically prove the efficacy of suicide prevention strategies. Neither the role of psychosocial interventions nor the impact of psychotropic agents can be sufficiently quantified. Due to various methodological reasons ( e. g. small sample sizes and the lack of randomization), interpretation of the data is difficult. In terms of a comprehensive approach of suicide prevention a combination of different activities should be most adequate in the long run.

AB To investigate age and sex-specific changes in rates, methods used and characteristics of suicide attempters receiving medical care, over a 15-year period in two European WHO catchment areas (Stockholm, Sweden; and Wurzburg, Germany).
   The data for this study were obtained from the WHO/EURO Multicentre Study on Suicidal Behaviour for the period 1989-2003. Sex-specific, person-based suicide attempt rates were calculated for each year separately for the age groups 15-24 and 25 or above. The Chi-square test for trend was applied to estimate changes in proportions of socio-demographic and socio-economic variables.
   Significantly, increasing trends in suicide attempt rates occurred in young females, and in males and females aged 25 or above in Wurzburg. On the contrary, men 25 years and above showed a significant decrease in suicide attempt rates in Stockholm. Young females in Wurzburg tended to use less violent methods for their attempts whereas in Stockholm young females were increasingly inclined to attempt suicide using violent methods. In Stockholm, young female suicide attempters tended to be more often economically inactive, particularly due to an increasing proportion of students. Young females in Wurzburg were often less well educated, as were their young male counterparts. This contrasted with trends in the education of men and women of 25 or above in Stockholm.
   The results of this study suggest temporal changes in trends, methods used and in the social profile of suicide attempters.

AB Both international and national research on suicide events in prisons and in forensic psychiatric hospitals is scarce. This study compares suicide cases within the prison system (2000-2013) to those within the forensic hospital (2000 2016)in Berlin. The mean suicide rate in the forensic hospital was higher than in the prison system. Patients who committed suicide in the forensic hospital were, in comparison to the prison system, more likely to: be older, suffer from schizophrenia and a substance abuse disorder, have a longer duration of stay, have committed a violent offense, have previously obtained a school degree and have a prior history of suicide attempts. While the results suggest a necessity to optimize data collection in the prison system (prior suicide events and history of mental disorder), it is important to discuss methods to improve the prospects of patients within a forensic institution.

AB Following the September 11th 2001 atrocity, Western Government policies focused more on 'defense,' which undermines Government's commitment to reducing suicide. Annual US and major Western countries suicides were compared with '9/11' deaths to highlight the extent of mortality associated with mental disorder, homicide and road deaths are reviewed for contrast. The 3,074 fatalities of 9/11 are set against the US three year annual average 29,691 suicides, 17,077 homicides and 47,775 road deaths, thus every two weeks more US citizens died violently than on 9/11. In the majority of countries, there were more suicides than 9/11 victims, with suicides exceeding the 9/11 atrocity 18 times in Russia, nine in Japan and the US and three times in France and Germany. Annual suicides compared with terrorist violence should inform policy.

AB Background In late 2015, Germany passed a law ( 217 StGB) prohibiting persons from aiding others in committing suicide on a regular, repetitive basis. Despite intensive societal debate and surveys about assisted dying, the present study was the first to examine attitudes towards the new legal regulation among professionals.
   Methods In early 2016, all participants of a congress on palliative care received a one-page anonymous questionnaire to complete until the end of the conference. The questionnaire consisted of questions regarding assisted suicide and the new law. The participants were asked to express their agreement or disagreement on a 4 to 5-point Likert scale.
   Results 457 questionnaires (48 %) were completed, 138 from physicians, 318 from nurses, 1 non specified. More than 80 % knew about the new law. Only half of the respondents supported it. 54 % felt that the law did not sufficiently differentiate between an illegal form of assisted suicide and a form exempt from prosecution. For more than 40 % the new law made no sense.
   Conclusion Professionals engaged in terminal care were reluctant to support a criminal liability of "business-like" physician-assisted suicide and suspected greater uncertainty among professionals in end of life care.

AB Recent research suggests that search volumes of the most popular search engine worldwide, Google, provided via Google Trends, could be associated with national suicide rates in the USA, UK, and some Asian countries. However, search volumes have mostly been studied in an ad hoc fashion, without controls for spurious associations. This study evaluated the validity and utility of Google Trends search volumes for behavioral forecasting of suicide rates in the USA, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Suicide-related search terms were systematically collected and respective Google Trends search volumes evaluated for availability. Time spans covered 2004 to 2010 (USA, Switzerland) and 2004 to 2012 (Germany, Austria). Temporal associations of search volumes and suicide rates were investigated with time-series analyses that rigorously controlled for spurious associations. The number and reliability of analyzable search volume data increased with country size. Search volumes showed various temporal associations with suicide rates. However, associations differed both across and within countries and mostly followed no discernable patterns. The total number of significant associations roughly matched the number of expected Type I errors. These results suggest that the validity of Google Trends search volumes for behavioral forecasting of national suicide rates is low. The utility and validity of search volumes for the forecasting of suicide rates depend on two key assumptions ("the population that conducts searches consists mostly of individuals with suicidal ideation", "suicide-related search behavior is strongly linked with suicidal behavior"). We discuss strands of evidence that these two assumptions are likely not met. Implications for future research with Google Trends in the context of suicide research are also discussed.

AB Background and method. Suicide research has identified regional and local clusters of increased suicide prevalence. As part of a comprehensive prevention strategy to fight railway suicides, we sought to identify such particular clusters on the German Railway net (total length 37,080 km) during a 6-year observation period (19972002). Data stem from the central registry of all person accidents on the German Railway net.
   Results. During the observation period, a total of 5,731 suicides (in average 18 cases per week) were registered. Against expectation derived from distribution patterns in the general suicide research, we found a preponderance in the southern part compared to the northern part of Germany and a significant downward trend from west to east (p=0.004). Most suicides occurred on open track (66%) compared to suicides at railway platforms (34%). We identified 16 places of high risk with 6 to 29 suicides per railway km. Of these high risk places, 75% were in the proximity of psychiatric hospitals. Conclusion. Increased awareness for regional and local suicide clusters, initiatives to reduce the accessibility and warning infra-red beams are among recommendations for suicide prevention derived from these data.

AB Objective: The study aimed at exploring prevalence and risk factors of inpatient suicides and attempted suicides in a psychiatric hospital.
   Method: Based on the German psychiatric basic documentation system, 20,543 patients with 40,451 episodes of inpatient care (1995-2004) in a psychiatric state hospital were included. Besides univariate analyses, multivariate logistic regression analyses and classification and regression tree analyses were performed.
   Results: Forty-one inpatient suicides were recorded. Risk of inpatient suicide is increased for patients with resistance to psychopharmacological treatment, previous suicide attempt, severe side effects and supportive psychotherapy before admission. Two hundred fourteen inpatient suicide attempts occurred during the 10-year period. Risk factors of inpatient suicide attempt are assault, personality disorder, previous suicide attempt, psychopharmacological treatment resistance, suicidal thoughts at admission, schizophrenia, depression, female sex and length of stay.
   Conclusion: The identified risk factors underline the need for a cautious investigation of previous suicide attempts as well as for giving special attention to patients who have problems with psychopharmacotherapy during hospitalization. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The research group "Suicide and Psychiatric Hospital" has studied inpatient suicides in psychiatric hospitals in Baden-Wurttemberg and Bavaria (Germany) from 1970-1996. Whereas suicides in depression and schizophrenia are described very well, a description of addicted inpatients who commited suicide is still missing. Patients and Methods: We studied the data of substance dependent patients of the collective of 726 inpatient suicides. Results and Conclusions: Among the generally rare suicides of addicted inpatiens - 33 of 726 - about 81% were alcohol dependent. The frequency of suicide in this group of patients decreased from 6.7% in the years 1970-1984 to 1.4% between 1990 and 1996. Whereas the age remained more or less stable in the middle of the fifth decade, the time from hospitalisation until suicide shortened from 192 days (mean) to 52 days. Suicide of alcohol dependent and poly-drug-abusing patients today almost exclusively takes place during treatment on an open station and among patients being in treatment on a voluntary basis. Suicide attempts in the anamnesis are extraordinarily rare in alcohol dependent suiciders.

AB Suicide is a significant form of unnatural death and must be differentiated as such from other violent manners of death (homicide, accident), but also from unexpected deaths due to natural causes. The distinction is made on the basis of a careful collection and correct interpretation of post-mortem forensic findings on the one hand, the general background of the case and the criminal investigation at the scene on the other. For competent assessment by the post-mortem medical examiner and/or forensic pathologist, a thorough knowledge of the numerous methods of committing suicide and their pathomorphological correlates is indispensable. This not only includes the constellation of findings and injury patterns typical of suicide, but also unusual manifestations. Highly conspicuous are complex suicides, in which several methods are applied simultaneously, or one after the other, as well as joint suicides and homicide-suicides involving several persons. Certain settings also deserve special attention. Moreover, simulated or dissimulated suicide is a possibility that must always be borne in mind in forensic practice.

AB About 10,000 persons die by suicide in Germany each year and 90 % of these persons suffer from a mental disorder at the time of suicide. In theoretical models on the development of suicidal behavior the importance of psychosocial variables, such as hopelessness, attentional fixation, social isolation, perceived burdensomeness and reduced fear of death and dying is stressed. In the course of crisis intervention, a sorrow risk assessment has to take place and it needs a relationship-oriented, ambivalence-friendly debate on suicidal intentions, before deciding on the correct treatment setting. This article provides a description of the nomenclature of suicidal phenomena as well as an epidemiology of suicides, suicide attempts and suicidal ideation, refers to the etiology of suicidal behavior and points out central principles of risk assessment and crisis intervention in dealing with suicidal patients.

ID PATIENT
AB Objective: In a first part we describe the situation of suicide survivors after the suicide of a family member in USA and Germany by reviewing the literature. In a second part we try to elucidate typical patterns of reactions and coping of relatives. Methods: On the basis of either own experience or from supervision cases, we try to elaborate reaction types of relatives of inpatients who committed suicide. Results: Relatives as suicide survivors show reactions from shock, disbelief, grief, guilt, self-doubt, anger and relief to accusation and threat of lawsuit toward therapists. An attempt is made to subsummarize these reactions in three preliminary categories. Conclusions: Generally, relatives should be offered the opportunity of more than one common talk with the health care professionals. Postvention is preventive work, that alms at avoiding that the suicide survivors becomes a patient himself.

AB Background: Urban-rural disparities in suicide mortality have received considerable attention. Varying conceptualizations of urbanity may contribute to the conflicting findings. This ecological study on Germany assessed how and to what extent urban-rural suicide associations are affected by 14 different urban-rural indicators.
   Methods: Indicators were based on continuous or k-means classified population data, land-use data, planning typologies, or represented population-based accessibility indicators. Agreements between indicators were tested with correlation analyses. Spatial Bayesian Poisson regressions were estimated to examine urban-rural suicide associations while adjusting for risk and protective factors.
   Results: Urban-rural differences in suicide rates per 100,000 persons were found irrespective of the indicator. Strong and significant correlation was observed between different urban-rural indicators. Although the effect sign consistently referred to a reduced risk in urban areas, statistical significance was not universally confirmed by all regressions. Goodness-of-fit statistics suggested that the population potential score performs best, and that population density is the second best indicator of urbanicity. Numerical indicators are favored over classified ones. Regional planning typologies are not supported.
   Conclusions: The strength of suicide urban-rural associations varies with respect to the applied indicator of urbanicity. Future studies that put urban-rural inequalities central are recommended to apply either unclassified population potentials or population density indicators, but sensitivity analyses are advised.

AB In Germany suicide ranks as the second and in the USA as the third leading cause of death in adolescents. Risk factors for suicide are impulsive and self-injurious behavior, depression, conduct disorder, and child abuse. Arround 5-10% of patients with borderline personality disorder commit suicide. Dialectical-behavioral therapy (DBT) was developed by Marsha Linehan specifically for the outpatient treatment of chronically parasuicidal patients who were diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. The modified version of DBT for adolescents (DBT-A) was adapted for an outpatient treatment setting in Germany by our group. In a pilot study 12 adolescents were treated and the follow-up evaluated. Initial promising results of this open trial are presented.

AB Background: Ethical questions at the end of life are at the centre of scientific and public debates. Up to the present there is scarcity of empirical data regarding physicians' end-of-life practices in Germany.
   Methods: Cross-sectional study among a random sample of German physicians by means of the questionnaire of the EURELD Consortium with additional questions on experiences and attitudes regarding physician assisted suicide.
   Results: 734 physicians from five state chambers of physicians responded (response rate 36.9%). 403 physicians reported about end-of-life practices regarding adult patients. Alleviation of symptoms took place in 86.7% of cases and in 50.7% medical treatment had been withheld. In three cases death was the consequence of a drug which was provided or administered by respondents. 20.7% of respondents had been requested to perform physician-assisted suicide (PAS). 41.7% of participants could not imagine participating in PAS, whereas 40.2% could imagine this under certain circumstances. A prohibition of PAS by professional law war rejected by 33.7%, 25.0% support such a ban and 41.4% were undecided.
   Conclusion: Physicians in Germany perform a broad spectrum of end-of-life practices. The empirical findings can serve as a starting point for the reflection about an appropriate normative framework for physicians' end-of-life practices.

AB Children and adolescents who had attempted suicide once are at higher risk for further suicide attempts. In order to better identify those likely to make a further suicide attempt, they were compared at the time of their first suicide attempt with those who had only attempted suicide once.
   The details of all children and adolescents who had attempted suicide and been treated as inpatients or outpatients in the University Hospital in Gottingen, Germany, over a 10-year period were collected by file-analysis. Sociodemographic characteristics, stresses that preceded the suicide attempts and the chosen methods of attempted suicide were ascertained.
   55 male and 116 female subjects had attempted suicide once, 77 male and 79 female subjects had attempted suicide more than once. Those with repeated suicide attempts were younger at the time of their first suicide attempt at 14 years and eight months, than those who did not make a repeat attempt, at 15 years and 7 months. Male repeaters more often experienced conflicts with their parents. Female repeaters were suffering more from emotional or chronic physical diseases and more often drank alcohol in connection with their first suicide attempt.
   Paediatricians, who are often the first to be confronted with suicide attempts by young people, should work towards providing psychotherapeutic support especially for children and younger adolescents with the particular stresses described.

AB Objectives: The aim of the study was to examine whether personality, i.e. temperament and character influence suicide attempts in bipolar patients.
   Methods: Bipolar patients were recruited from lithium dispensaries. Temperament and character inventory (TCI) was administered to 100 euthymic bipolar patients and 100 controls.
   Results: Age of onset was significantly lower in patients with suicide attempts in the total bipolar group (I and II) and bipolar I patients compared with patients without suicide attempts. Bipolar (I and II) and bipolar I patients with suicide attempts were significantly higher in harm avoidance (HA) and reward dependence compared with patients without suicide attempts. Patients (I and II) with suicide attempts had significantly more anticipatory worry, fatigability and asthenia than patients without suicide attempts. Bipolar I patients with suicide attempts had significantly more fatigability and asthenia and were more dependent than patients without suicide attempts. HA was lowest in patients with no suicide attempts and no family history of suicide, higher in patients with family history of suicide or patients with suicide attempts, and significantly highest in patients with suicide attempts and family history of suicide. Patients with suicide attempts and family history of suicide had more anticipatory worry, fatigability and asthenia. Bipolar disorder was significantly correlated to HA and suicide attempts to HA and PS. Family history of suicide and gender were significantly correlated to suicide attempts.
   Conclusions: Age of onset, HA, PS, gender and family history of suicide had a moderate to very strong effect on suicide attempts in bipolar patients.

AB Introduction: There is an ongoing debate about a possibly enhanced risk of suicidal behaviour in some psychiatric patients due to psychopharmacotherapy. Our retrospective study aimed at analyzing the psychopharmacotherapy of 133 inpatient suicides and 133 controls by a matched pair design.
   Methods: We analyzed all suicides (n=133) reported in the AGATE study from 1991 to 2008. Besides evaluation of sociodemographic variables and suicide methods, we compared psychopharmacotherapy of suicides with schizophrenia (n=59) and affective disorders (n=59) to that of a matched control group.
   Results: Most suicides (n=102, 76.7%) were judged not to be related to psychopharmacotherapy. In general, more psychopharmacological drugs were prescribed for suicides than for controls. Schizophrenic suicides received more low potency FGAs than their controls. More suicides with affective disorders than controls were treated with NASSAs, SNRIs, and high or low potency FGAs. In contrast to their controls, none of the suicides with affective disorders received lithium. NASSAs, SNRIs, and high or low potency FGAs predicted suicide in regression analysis for inpatients with affective disorders.
   Discussion: Differences in psychopharmacotherapy might mainly result from a recognized risk of suicide or a more severe degree of illness. However, the underrepresentation of lithium in the suicide groups is noticeable.

AB Beyond its prophylactic efficacy lithium has demonstrated possibly specific antisuicidal effects. Lithium significantly reduces the high excess mortality of patients with affective disorders. Appropriate lithium prophylaxis prevents ca. 250 suicides per year in Germany although lithium salts are prescribed within the National Health Scheme at low frequency (0.06 % of the population). Rational treatment strategies most likely would demand for about 10 times higher prescription rates. Guidelines and algorithms for selecting an appropriate prophylactic strategy in affective disorders should take into consideration the suicide risk of an individual patient.

AB Objective: The choice of the suicide method is influenced by the individual's sex, age, cultural value system and the method's availability. Therefore, we studied the chosen method in relation to the investigated motive, age and sex. Method: The study included all residents of Middle Franconia, dying from suicide due to death certificate and police investigations. 2062 suicides were included. Data was categorized by method and underlying reason. Results: Women preferred self-poisoning and men predominantly chose hanging with the distribution changing with regard to the underlying motive, especially in suicide due to family distress and lovesickness. The association between method and underlying reason of suicide was highly significant (chi(2)-test, chi(2) = 268.5, p < 0.0001), in male (chi(2) = 166.7, p < 0.0001) and in female subjects (chi(2) = 132.7, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, there were differences regarding the suicide method concerning the age. Conclusions: Certain motives tended to be associated with some suicide methods, so that the means to commit suicide should be further taken into account in preventive as well as in therapeutic measures.

AB Aircraft assisted suicides were studied in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Finland during 1956-2012 by means of literature search and accident case analysis. According to our study the frequency varied slightly between the studies. Overall, the new estimate of aircraft assisted suicides in the United States in a 20-yr period (1993-2012) is 0.33% (95% Cl 0.21-0.49) (24/7244). In the detailed accident case analysis, it was found that in five out of the eight cases from the United States, someone knew of prior suicidal ideation before the aircraft assisted fatality. The caveats of standard medico-legal autopsy and accident investigation methods in investigation of suspected aircraft assisted suicides are discussed. It is suggested that a psychological autopsy should be performed in all such cases. Also the social context and possibilities of the prevention of aviation-related suicides were analyzed. In addition, some recent aircraft assisted suicides carried out using commercial aircraft during scheduled services and causing many casualties are discussed.

AB The German suicide screening instrument SIRAS was trialled for 3 months in the Berlin remand prison. Of the 605 completed screening forms, about 14 % of the subjects had a positive screening and were presented to psychological or medical staff. The preliminary results of the follow-up showed clear differences in drug prescription between the high-risk and non-high-risk subjects. In summary, we can say that the introduction of the screening instrument resulted in numerous changes within the prison system, but prison staff was reluctant to accept and implement the screening instrument.

AB Injection drug users (IDUs) entering an urban low-threshold opiate detoxification unit in Munich, Germany, between 1991 and 1997 were asked for lifetime suicide attempts and administered a questionnaire, including sociodemographic, IDU-related, and drug user treatment related variables. Among 1,049 participants, 20% had ever tried to commit suicide. In the logistic regression, female gender, older age, drug user treatment experience, lack of drug user counseling, and emergency treatment were associated with attempted suicide. Regular screening for suicidal behavior in IDUs should be undertaken with a special focus to mention risk factors. The study's limitations are noted. This study was partially sponsored by the German Ministry of Health.

AB Even if the freedom to suicide is part of our human existence, about 90% of all suicides occur in the context of psychiatric disorders and thus in states of limited power of judgment. Depressive disorders represent the most frequent cause for suicides. Thus, optimization of medical care for depressive patients is one of the most promising strategies to prevent suicides. In the context of the 'Nuremberg Alliance Against Depression' it came to an obvious reduction of suicidal acts compared to a baseline year and compared to the control region of Wurzburg. The reduction could be reached by a cooperation with GPs, multipliers such as teachers, priests, geriatric caregivers and the media, through intensive public relations work and through support of self help activities. This approach is carried forward within the Germany-wide 'Alliance Against Depression' and within the 'European Alliance Against Depression' ( EAAD) which is funded by the European Commission. In the last part of the article the suicide- preventive, but also the possible suicide-inducing effect of antidepressants is discussed.

AB 'Undetermined' (UnD) and accidental deaths (AccD) are explored as possible sources of 'under-reported-suicides' (URS) in 20 Western countries.
   WHO mortality rates per million of AccD, UnD and suicides analysed. UnD:suicides ratios of < 1:5 calculated as likely URS versus ratios > 1:10 unlikely URS and all correlated by sex and age.
   Male URS likely in 7 countries and in 11 for females. URS in AccD likely in 5 countries for both sexes only UnD and suicide rates the elderly (75+) significantly correlated.
   Strong indication of URS in the UK, Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany with likely URS in AccD in Greece, Portugal, Switzerland and USA. These findings have important implications, indicating that, with the exception of France and Japan, official reported suicide rates contain a degree of under-reporting, and especially for women yet it is essential to have accurate suicide data to ensure adequate service provision.

AB In 1936 Stefan Lux, a Jew born in Vienna, and naturalized in Czchoslovakia, shot himself during a session of the League of Nations in Geneva. The situation would become much more dire for German Jews in the coming years, and few sensed that anything akin to the Holocaust was in store. Lux believed he had timed his suicide precisely to bring attention to, and counteract, the problem of "statelessness" that was on the agenda of the League. Lux also feared that the defences Jews had utilized before 1933 to ward off antisemitism were no longer viable, as they were under assault by the entirety of the arts and cultural apparatus in Germany. This case illustrates both the prescience and limits of Lux's carefully orchestrated suicide.

AB This paper presents three different models of the legal regulation of assisted suicide in European countries. First, the current legal regime governing assisted suicide in the Netherlands is described where both euthanasia and assisted suicide have been legalised. This section also includes some empirical data on euthanasia and assisted-suicide practices in the Netherlands, as well as a comparison with the current legal legislation in Belgium and Luxembourg. Next, Switzerland is presented as a country where euthanasia is punishable by law but assisted suicide is legally allowed, provided it is not carried out with selfish motives. This section also focuses on the assisted-suicide related case law of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights. Last, the current legal situation regarding assisted suicide in Austria and Germany is described. While the Austrian Penal Code explicitly prohibits assisted suicide, assistance with suicide is not specifically regulated by the German Penal Code. However, medical doctors are not allowed to assist suicides according to the professional codes of conduct drawn up by the German medical associations under the supervision of the health authorities.

Particular problems are the assessment of the risk of suicide as well as legal issues. This article describes the prevalence and relevance of suicidal ideation in emergency services and provides help for the risk assessment. Additionally, the principles of crisis intervention and therapy are presented. Although each patient has to be treated individually, basic patterns of attitude and behaviour have to be trained so that the staff are able to apply them in a concrete situation.

AB The study of websites displaying methods of both physical self-harm and suicide has become an important aspect of deliberate self-injury and suicide research. However, little is known about contextual factors related to entering such sites. Using data from 3,567 respondents aged 15-30 in the US, UK, Germany, and Finland, we found that experiences of victimization are associated with entering pro-self-harm sites and pro-suicide sites. Also, the victimization context had relevance, as online victimization was particularly related to pro-self-harm behavior. The findings suggest a need to organize more specific online support for the victims of violence and online aggression.

AB Background and objective: Little representative data of the epidemiology of attempted suicide exists in Germany. In this study the frequency of parasuicidal drug intoxication, the distribution of age and gender, as well as the kind and origin of used drugs were evaluated. Furthermore the knowledge about used drugs and possible adverse effects of a previously given medication were analysed.
   Patients and methods: Over a period of 2 years (January 1998-December 1999) 155 patients (41 males, 114 females, average age 40.5 years) with drug intoxication by attempted suicide were recruited at the University Hospital of Dresden, Germany, for further retrospective analysis.
   Results: 74% of these patients were women. Sedatives and hypnotics were most frequently used for parasuicide (44%), followed by analgesics (18%) and antidepressants (12%). Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-agonists were the most commonly used drugs (32%). Moreover, 80% of all drugs used had been prescribed by physicians. Approximately half of the patients were well-informed about drugs taken. In 43 (47%) of 92 patients with long-term medication an adverse effect was considered as a possible cause of the attempted suicide.
   Conclusion: Our data underline the importance of attempted suicide in view of the frequency of their use, the need of hospitalization, the required intensive care and possible relapses. Because the majority of drugs used were prescribed by physicians, before giving any medication to their possible suicidal use should be considered.

AB Previous research has shown for the most part positive correlations between intelligence and suicide prevalence on the national level. However, this study found proxies for regional intelligence in Australia (international average domain scores from the PISA 2000 study) to be significantly negatively correlated with the total, male, and female suicide rates of the different administrative divisions of Australia, and this finding was independent of regional wealth. A research synthesis of the current results and those from similar studies of other countries (positive correlations for Austria, Belarus, The British Isles, Denmark, and The Netherlands; inconclusive findings for France, Germany, and the USA) was conducted. This synthesis of research findings showed that positive ecological correlations of intelligence with suicide rate were more likely observed for nations with higher suicide rates and poorer general living conditions, whereas there was no relation with national IQ.

AB The available literature on the risk of suicides related to the Holocaust (1939-1945) and its aftermath differs in its time periods, in the countries investigated, and in the robustness of its sources. Reliable information seems to indicate that the risk of suicide for Jews in Nazi Germany and Austria during the pre-war period (1933-1939) was elevated, while information on suicide during the internment in the concentration camps is fraught with problems. The latter derives from the Nazis' decision to hide the statistics on the inmates' causes of death, and from the prevailing life conditions that impeded separation between self-inflicted death and murder. Reliable studies conducted in Israel among refugees who entered pre-state Israel, 1939-1945, and post-World War II survivors reaching Israel (1948 on), show a mixed picture: suicide rates among the former were higher than comparison groups, while the latter group shows evidence of resilience.

AB The number of deaths from carbon monoxide intoxication by burning barbecue charcoal has increased in recent years particularly in Asia and even in Germany the number of cases has risen. A total of nine deaths were documented at the institute of Legal Medicine in Hamburg in the period from September 2009 to October 2010. It can be assumed that seven cases were suicide, one case might have been accidental and one case is unclear. Of the decedents seven were male. Cherry red lividity as an indication for carbon monoxide intoxication was not found in all cases. In this context the post-mortem examination as well as the scene investigation should be performed very carefully because principally it is possible for a suicide to be overlooked as well as simulated. The determination of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) should be performed regularly. Furthermore forensic autopsy can provide information as to possible third party involvement.

AB Background: Suicide accounts for over 58,000 deaths in Europe per annum, where suicide attempts are estimated to be 20 times higher. Males have been found to have a disproportionately lower rate of suicide attempts and an excessively higher rate of suicides compared to females. The gender difference in suicide intent is postulated to contribute towards this gender imbalance. The aim of this study is to explore gender differences in suicide intent in a cross-national study of suicide attempts. The secondary aims are to investigate the gender differences in suicide attempt across age and country.
   Methods: Data on suicide attempts (acquired from the EU-funded OSPI-Europe project) was obtained from eight regions in Germany, Hungary, Ireland and Portugal. Suicide intent data was categorized into 'Non-habitual Deliberate Self-Harm' (DSH), 'Parasuicidal Pause' (SP), 'Parasuicidal Gesture' (SG), and 'Serious Suicide Attempt' (SSA), applying the Feuerlein scale. Gender differences in intent were explored for significance by using X-2-tests, odds ratios, and regression analyses.
   Results: Suicide intent data from 5212 participants was included in the analysis. A significant association between suicide intent and gender was found, where 'Serious Suicide Attempts' (SSA) were rated significantly more frequently in males than females (p < .001). There was a statistically significant gender difference in intent and age groups (p < .001) and between countries (p < .001). Furthermore, within the most utilised method, intentional drug overdose, 'Serious Suicide Attempt' (SSA) was rated significantly more often for males than females (p < .005).
   Conclusions: Considering the differences in suicidal intent between males and females highlighted by the current study, gender targeted prevention and intervention strategies would be recommended.

AB The suicide-related mortality among patients with affective disorders is approximately 30 times higher, and overall mortality 2 to 3 times higher, than suicide-related mortality in the general population. Lithium has demonstrated possibly specific antisuicidal effects apart from its prophylactic efficacy: it significantly reduces the high excess mortality of patients with affective disorders, To date, suicide-prevention effects have not been shown for antidepressant or anticonvulsant long-term treatment. Clozapine appears to reduce the suicide rate in schizophrenia patients. Against this background, guidelines and algorithms for selecting an appropriate prophylactic strategy for affective disorders should consider the presence of suicidality in patient history. Appropriate lithium prophylaxis prevents approximately 250 suicides yearly in Germany, although lithium salts are infrequently prescribed within the National Health Scheme (specifically, to 0,06% of the population). Rational treatment strategies most likely would demand that prescription rates be about 10 times higher. (Can J Psychiatry 2003;48:433-439)

AB Assisting suicide is legal in Switzerland if it is offered without selfish motive to a person with decision-making capacity. Although the Swiss model' for suicide assistance has been extensively described in the literature, the formally and informally protected liberties and claims of assistors and recipients of suicide assistance in Switzerland are incompletely captured in the literature. In this article, we describe the package of rights involved in the Swiss model' using the framework of Hohfeldian rights as modified by Wenar. After outlining this framework, we dissect the rights involved in suicide assistance in Switzerland, and compare it with the situation in England and Germany. Based on this approach, we conclude that in Switzerland, claim rights exist for those requesting suicide assistance, and for those who are considering providing such assistance, even though no entitlements exist toward suicide assistance. We then describe the implementation of the Swiss model' and difficulties arising within it. Clarifying these issues is important to understand the Swiss situation, to evaluate what features of it may or may not be worth correcting or emulating, and to understand how it can impact requests for suicide assistance in other countries due to suicide tourism'. It is also important to understand exactly what sets Switzerland apart from other countries with different legislations regarding suicide assistance.

AB When compared to German rates, train suicides in the Netherlands have made up a larger proportion of the total number of suicides. This study examines whether this difference is attributable to railway parameters, familiarity with rail transport, or population density.
   Dutch and German train suicide rates from 2000 to 2007 were compared by means of Poisson regression analyses. Train suicide rate ratios were calculated and related to the railway parameters or population density in a Poisson regression model. The Dutch-German general suicide rate ratio was 0.72. In contrast, the train suicide rate in the Netherlands exceeded the German rate by 1.23. In the Poisson regression analyses, where suicide rate was related to railway density or passenger traffic intensity, the Dutch-German train suicide rate ratios became 1.49 and 1.20 respectively. When related to train traffic intensity or population density, however, rate ratios turned into 0.74 and 0.59 respectively. Train traffic intensity contributes to train suicide frequency. Population density also contributes, whereas railway density and familiarity with rail transport do not. In a cross-national comparison the availability hypothesis regarding the number of trains passing was confirmed, which leads to the recommendation of limiting access to the railway tracks.

AB Although suicides in Germany are on the decrease, for the care-providing physician a suicidal patient must always be considered an emergency. An elevated risk is to be seen above all in patients with psychological/mental problems, in particular those suffering from depression, but also those experiencing a crisis associated with ageing, physical illnesses or intolerable social situations. A range of factors may influence suicidal behavior, such as the specific situation of the patient or the loss of protective factors. When his/her coping strategies or outside help then fails, a triggering event may prompt suicide. As a rule, the suicide-endangered patient goes through three stages - a period of weighing up, ambivalence and decision-taking. For the care-providing physician it is of particular importance to recognize the ambivalence stage in good time,for it is here that the patient gives expression to thoughts of suicide and the physician has an opportunity to intervene. Major preventive measures are the build-up of a doctor-patient relationship and a readiness to ,,talk things through". Further crisis management includes, for example, the use of psychopharmaceuticals or the initiation of psychotherapy.

AB Suicide is a global public health problem. Media impact on suicide is well confirmed and there are several recommendations on how media should and should not report on suicide to minimize the risk of copycat behavior. Those media guidelines have been developed to improve responsible reporting on suicide (RRS). Although such guidelines are used in several countries, we lack empirical evidence on their causal effect on actual journalistic news writing. We conducted an experiment with journalism students (N=78) in Germany in which we tested whether exposure to awareness material promoting RRS influences news writing. As a supplement to the widely used text-based material, we tested the impact of a video in which a suicide expert presents the guidelines. A video was used as a supplement to text partly due to its potential benefit for prevention efforts over the Internet. We chose a low-budget production process allowing easy reproduction in different countries by local suicide experts. In the experiment, participants were either exposed to written, audio-visual, or no awareness material. Afterwards, participants read numerous facts of an ostensible suicide event and were asked to write a factual suicide news story based on these facts. Analyses indicate that awareness material exposure helped to improve RRS with the awareness video showing the strongest effects. We recommend that suicide prevention should use instructive awareness videos about RRS complementary to text-based awareness material.

DT Article
DE Chronobiological factors; population based study; senescence; suicide
ID TIME PATTERNS; LIFE EVENTS; AGE; SEASONALITY; GENDER; DEATH
AB Background and aims: Suicide in later life stages is of growing concern as the life expectancy of Western populations is rising. Therefore, a population-based study concerning elderly suicide was undertaken. Methods: The study included 1008 suicides in Middle Franconia (Bavaria/Germany) between 2004 and 2007. Data was analyzed regarding gender, method chosen, initiating motive and chronobiological factors at the time of death. Results: Higher rates of suicides were observed in the population at risk over 65 years old, in both sexes (age-adjusted suicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants for men: 42.52; 95% CI 8.64-37.47; for women: 8.64; 95% CI 6.81-10.96). There were significant differences regarding the method chosen (chi(2)=21.3; df=6; p=0.002) and the underlying motive, "mental/physical illness", was the predominant stressor (chi(2)=73.0; df=6; p<0.001). Conclusions: Suicide in the elderly population differs significantly from that in younger people. Understanding of this phenomenon must be further elucidated, since suicide is difficult to prevent, and its risk is expected to increase still further among the elderly, (Aging Clin Exp Res 2009; 21: 470-474) (C) 2009, Editrice Kurtis

AB Background: A substantial proportion of therapists experience the loss of a patient to suicide at some point during their professional life. Aims: To assess (1) the impact of a patient's suicide on therapists distress and well-being over time, (2) which factors contribute to the reaction, and (3) which subgroup might need special interventions in the aftermath of suicide. Methods: A 63-item questionnaire was sent to all 185 Psychiatric Clinics at General Hospitals in Germany. The emotional reaction of therapists to patient's suicide was measured immediately, after 2 weeks, and after 6 months. Results: Three out of ten therapists suffer from severe distress after a patients' suicide. The item "overall distress" immediately after the suicide predicts emotional reactions and changes in behavior. The emotional responses immediately after the suicide explained 43.5% of the variance of total distress in a regression analysis. Limitations: The retrospective nature of the study is its primary limitation. Conclusions: Our data suggest that identifying the severely distressed subgroup could be done using a visual analog scale for overall distress. As a consequence, more specific and intensified help could be provided to these professionals.

AB Objectives: III Germany suicide ranks as the second leading cause of death in adolescents. Risk factors for suicide are impulsive and self-injurious behaviour, depression, and conduct disorder. The main hypothesis Of our study is that Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) for adolescents is an effective method of treatment for these Patients.
   Methods: DBT was developed by Marsha Linehan specifically for the outpatient treatment of chronically parasuicidal female patients with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. Miller & Rathus modified DBT for use with adolescents (DBT-A), and our group adapted the DBT-A for use in an outpatient treatment setting in Germany. In a pre-post comparison, the efficacy of treatment was measured using standardized instruments (SCL-90-R, CBCL, YSR, ILK, CGI, etc.).
   Results: In a pilot study of 12 adolesents, we found effect sizes between 1.1 and 2.9. During treatment selfinjurious behaviour declined significantly. Prior to entering therapy, 8 of the 12 patients had attempted SUicide at least once. During treatment according to DBT-A there Were 110 suicide attempts.
   Conclusions: These reslts are so promising that we ire now planning a randomized, multi-centre StUdy.

ID SEX-DIFFERENCES; MORTALITY; DEPRESSION; MANAGEMENT; BEHAVIOR
AB In Germany, the number of suicides and suicide attempts (n = 9,616) exceeds the number of traffic deaths (n = 4,152) by far. It is unknown how many suicide attempts are treated in trauma centres. Due to a lack of registered suicide attempts in Germany, no data exist about injury patterns, mortality or duration of treatment.
   We prospectively analysed data collected on emergency room patients from the Trauma Registry of the German Trauma Society (TR-DGU) between 1993 and 2009. All patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 9, age a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 18 years and a documented suicide attempt were included in the study. The main target points were epidemiological data, cause of injury and injury patterns, ISS, gender distribution, mortality, duration of treatment and patients' psychiatric medical history.
   Of 42,248 patients of the TR-DGU, 1,894 were included in the study; 274 patients were a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 65 years old. The most common method was jumping from a height among the group of female patients, whereas the use of firearms predominated in the male group. The average ISS was 31 points in all patient groups. The mortality was highest in patients aged a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 65 years. Psychiatric disorders were found predominantly in women.
   Of all severely injured patients in trauma centres, 5% suffered their injuries as a consequence of a suicidal attempt. In women who survived initially, jumping from a height was the most frequently chosen method. In elderly men the use of firearms dominated. The significant increase of mortality in elderly patients, preexisting depressive conditions and the expected increase in the number of these patients as a consequence of the changed age pyramid should lead to more intensive recognition and treatment of this disease and possibly improved suicide prevention.

AB Background: After the railway suicide of the German national goalkeeper Robert Enke in 2009, a significant increase of railway suicides was observed nationally. This study analyses whether this incident also triggered copycat effects in other European countries. Additionally, media coverage proxied by Google Trends and long-term changes taking into account general changes in suicide rates and kilometres driven by trains were examined.
   Methods: The numbers of railway suicides before and after Enke's suicide were analysed for short and long-term periods (2 weeks and 2 years Post event) across five European countries. Incidence ratios and resulting percentage changes were computed.
   Results: Similar to Germany, there were significant short and long-term effects for the combined data of the four other countries (increase of 93.9%; p =0.004 and 16.7%; p =0.003). There was no indication that long-term effects arc a mere reflection of an overall increase in suicide frequencies or due to increased numbers of kilometres driven by trains. Analyses on country level revealed heterogeneous results.
   Limitations: Due to incomplete data, analyses regarding age and gender were not performed. Media coverage was only proxied by a Google Trends analysis. The study includes a small sample of European countries.
   Conclusions: Enke's suicide in 2009 was followed by increasing train suicide numbers in Europe. Although this incident may have reinforced an existing European trend of growing railway suicides, an international copycat effect and/or an increased overall awareness about this particular suicide method appears to be one likely explanation for the changes.

ID MOTOR-VEHICLE CRASHES
AB Objectives. This study determined the effects of social changes in East Germany since 1989 on patterns of injury mortality.
   Methods. Death certificate data regarding injuries from 1980 through 1995 and police data regarding traffic injuries in East Germany from 1980 through 1998 were compared with similar data from West Germany.
   Results. The number of motor vehicle-related injuries and deaths in East Germany increased dramatically between 1989 and 1991, whereas those in West Germany declined slightly. The increased mortality in the more rural East has especially involved young men driving automobiles on rural roads and has persisted since reunification of East and West Germany. Falls, other accidents, and suicides have shown no such effect. Homicide among East German men has increased but remains uncommon.
   Conclusions. Recent social changes in East Germany, including increased access to motor vehicles and decreased restrictions on personal freedom, have been associated with increased motor vehicle crashes and mortality, especially among young men and on rural roads.

AB Objective. Our study aims to determine the frequency and distribution of suicide attempts according to the patients' characteristics and type of suicide attempt as well as the method of treatment proposed by the consultation-liaison service in a general hospital. Methods. This retrospective naturalistic study covers a 1-year period (2012), during which 51 suicide attempters were hospitalised in the Charite Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Germany. The following data were analysed: method of suicide, account of prior psychiatric history and medication, as well as the acute psychiatric diagnosis and treatment - including pharmacotherapy. Results. Most of the patients were diagnosed with a psychiatric illness. Major depressive disorder was the most frequent diagnosis in consultation. Treatment recommendations more oft en entailed further psychiatric treatment than medication. In the cases where medication was indeed given, benzodiazepines were the most frequently prescribed. Conclusions. Most of the suicide attempters needed further therapy in psychiatric hospitals. A specialised pharmacotherapy (antidepressants, mood stabilisers) was rarely recommended by the psychiatric consultation service. The psychiatric consultation and therapy recommendations are important in guiding future acute treatment procedures.

AB ""Dying with a smile on our lips " - Fascination in suicide in "Steglitz Pupil Trial" and public discourse in Weimar Republic". Using example of a 1920's sensational trail, the article tries to spot the interest and fascination in suicide in Weimar Germany. Starting with the way of dealing with one's own premature death, it furthermore deals with contemporary patterns of explanation for the phenomenon of suicide and its importance as a social problem. Approaching the topic by a single case makes it possible to make the general suicide-discourse concrete and to illustrate its significance and power. It is the main interest of the article then to shed light on the question why the youths of the concrete case dealt with their own premature death and with which intention and, secondly, in which way and for which reason (political) press pursued a certain interest in making the topic a central one in public discourse of the Weimar time.

AB Aircraft-assisted pilot suicide is a rare but serious phenomenon. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in pilot aircraft-assisted suicide risks, i.e., a copycat effect, in the U.S. and Germany after the Germanwings 2015 incident in the French Alps. Aircraft-assisted pilot suicides were searched in the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident investigation database and in the German Bundestelle fur Flugunfalluntersuchung (BFU) Reports of Investigation database five years before and two years after the deliberate crash of the Germanwings flight into the French Alps in 2015. The relative risk (RR) of the aircraft-assisted pilot suicides was calculated. Two years after the incident, three out of 454 (0.66%) fatal incidents were aircraft-assisted suicides compared with six out of 1292 (0.46%) in the prior five years in the NTSB database. There were no aircraft-assisted pilot suicides in the German database during the two years after or five years prior to the Germanwings crash. The relative aircraft-assisted pilot suicide risk for the U.S. was 1.4 (95% CI 0.3-4.2) which was not statistically significant. Six of the pilots who died by suicide had told someone of their suicidal intentions. We consider changes in the rate to be within a normal variation. Responsible media coverage of aircraft incidents is important due to the large amount of publicity that these events attract.

   AUTOPSY; BALANCE
AB From each case of suicide and drug-related death autopsied in the Institute of Forensic Medicine, Munich during the years 2001-2005, a toxicological investigation on anti-depressants (AD) was performed. In 180 suicides and 72 narcotic drug death cases, ADs were detected: 4 different classic tricyclic anti-depressants (TCAs), 6 other non-selective monoamine re-uptake inhibitors (NSMRIs), 5 selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and 3 other ADs. The suicides were grouped further according to the type of suicide (violent or non-violent). The prescription frequency of the ADs in Germany, expressed as the defined daily dosages (DDDs), during the investigated years served for comparison. There were serious differences in the frequency of different ADs regarding to the manner of suicide. In cases associated with doxepin and trimipramine, non-violent suicides were distinctly over-represented, as in cases in which the drug itself was responsible for the death as in cases of non-violent suicides in other manners. In contrast, in cases with citalopram or opipramol, violent forms of suicides were significantly over-represented. For amitriptyline, the ratio was approximately balanced. For the remainder of the ADs, the case numbers were too low for a valid evaluation. The different frequency distributions of the ADs, associated with violent and non-violent suicides may be explained by their different pharmacological active profiles and the different lethality of overdoses of the different ADs. There was no indication at all for a special suicidal problem of SSRIs in juveniles. Amongst 1,127 suicides within 5 years, in an area with approximately 5 million people, the youngest suicide victim with SSRIs was 28 years old. In drug death cases, citalopram was obviously over-represented.

TI Railway suicide in England and Wales 2000-2013: a time-trends analysis
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Suicide; Railways; England and Wales; Epidemiology; Train
ID PREVENTION; CORONERS; VERDICTS; GERMANY; INQUEST
AB Background: In 2010, the "Tackling Suicide on the Railways" programme was launched as a joint initiative among Network Rail, the Samaritans and other key organisations such as the British Transport Police and train operators to achieve a 20 % reduction in railway suicides from 2010 to 2015 in Great Britain. We report the most recent age and sex specific trends in railway suicide in England and Wales from 2000 to 2013 and examine whether the initiative's target reduction in railway suicides is likely to be achieved.
   Methods: Population data and suicide mortality data (all methods combined and railway) for England and Wales were obtained from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and used to calculate age and gender specific rates for deaths registered from 2000 to 2013. Data on railway suicides were also obtained from the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB) and compared with ONS data. We used joinpoint regression to identify changes in suicide trends across the study period.
   Results: The railway was used in 4.1 % of all suicides in England and Wales (RSSB data were similar to ONS data for most years). Suicides in all persons from all causes decreased from 2000 to 2007, with small increases from 2008 until 2013; this rise was entirely due to an increase in male suicides. Railway suicide rates increased over the entire study period; the proportion of railway suicides in all persons increased from 3.5 to 4.9 % during the study period. This trend was also mainly driven by increases in male suicides as female railway suicide rates remained steady over time. The highest age specific railway suicide rates were observed in middle aged men and women. Although there was no conclusive evidence of an increase in ONS railway suicides, RSSB data showed a statistically significant increase in railway suicides in males from 2009 onwards.
   Conclusion: The continued rise in male railway suicide in England and Wales is concerning, particularly due to the high economic costs and psychological trauma associated with these deaths. The initiative's target of a 20 % reduction in railway suicide is unlikely to be achieved.

AB "Suicidal tendencies in everyday-life discourse: Popular interpretations of suicide in the 20th century". Starting with gender specific suicide rates, this essay analyzes popular interpretations of suicide in the 20th century in german-speaking countries. Under the term suicidal tendencies, all thoughts, notices, attempts and committed suicides are summarized. In a first step it will be shown that suicide was for both men and women a topic of autobiographical writing. They used the German term "Selbstmord" in a neutral way without judging the deed morally. After this the insignificance of religion for populate interpretations of suicide will be demonstrated. The next chapter analyzes the scope of popular explications of suicidal tendencies. Focusing on "Social relations" popular explanations resembled psychoanalytic ones. That was not the case for pathologizing medico-psychiatric explanations, that did not enter everyday-life discourse. Instead, these explanations followed a polythetic and polysemic logic that will be analyzed in the third step with a methodologically extended discourse analysis. Finally, genderspecific explanations will be presented. Popular interpretations endowed meaning for the surviving to comprehend the suicide as legitimated means to cope with life and crisis management. The essay is based on 155 unpublished, so called popular autobiographies from Germany (without GDR), Austria and Switzerland. They were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively.

AB The recent economic recession has led to increases in suicide, but whether US state unemployment insurance programs ameliorate this association has not been examined. Exploiting US state variations in the generosity of benefit programs between 1968 and 2008, we tested the hypothesis that more generous unemployment benefit programs reduce the impact of economic downturns on suicide. Using state linear fixed-effect models, we found a negative additive interaction between unemployment rates and benefits among the US working-age (20-64 years) population (beta = -0.57, 95% confidence interval: -0.86, -0.27; P < 0.001). The finding of a negative additive interaction was robust across multiple model specifications. Our results suggest that the impact of unemployment rates on suicide is offset by the presence of generous state unemployment benefit programs, though estimated effects are small in magnitude.

AB Background: Several studies investigated the relationship between mental disorders and suicidal ideation. However, little is known about physical illnesses being the major trigger for committed suicides. It is necessary to understand these risk factors to be able to meet the needs of patients in a palliative care setting.
   Methods: Suicide, medical and police notes were retrospectively analysed from all autopsies conducted in 2009-11 at the University of Munich, Germany. Documented reasons for suicide were classified into a "physical disease" (PD) or "mental disease" (MD) group and compared with respect to their sociodemographic characteristics and autopsy outcomes.
   Results: Of all 1069 cases, 18.9 % gave a PD as reason for committing suicide (MD, 32.7 %). Those indicating PD were older than MD (68.8 vs. 48.7 years; p < 0.001) with more men being in this group (72.8 % vs. 59.1 %; p=0.002). In PD, 30.7 % suffered from cancer, 28.7 % from chronic pain and 12.4 % from lung disease. 38.8 % of MD and 12.4 % of PD had previous suicide attempts.
   Conclusions: In palliative care, it is necessary to screen patients on a regular basis for suicidal ideation, especially those with previous suicide attempts.

AB Self-immolation constitutes a rare form of suicide in developed countries, though it accounts for unique injury characteristics in the burn intensive care unit. The aim of this study was to present the epidemiological and clinical features of patients burned during a suicidal attempt seen in a North Rhine-Westphalia burn intensive care unit (BICU). To address this aim, we undertook a 21-year retrospective study involving patients with thermal injuries admitted to the largest burn unit in Germany. A total of 125 suicide-related burn victims were identified in the study period (9.4%). Comparing the self-immolation group with the rest burn patient cohort, suicide victims were more likely to be single and to act under the influence of alcohol. The suicidal group had a larger extent of burns, higher incidence of inhalation injury, required more surgical procedures, catecholamines, blood transfusions, and a longer BICU stay. Their clinical course was complicated by prolonged intubation period, higher rate of multiple drug-resistant bacteria acquisition and sepsis, leading to a higher mortality rate. Although the proportion of self-immolation victims among all burned patients is not high, the markedly higher severity of their burns and their poorer quality of outcomes makes them an important clinical subgroup for further study.

AB This paper discusses physician-assisted suicide (PAS) and voluntary active euthanasia (VAE), supplies a short history and argues in favour of permitting both once rigid criteria have been set and the cases retro-reviewed. I suggest that among these criteria should be that VAE should only be permitted with one more necessary criterion: that VAE should only be allowed when physician assisted suicide is not a possible option. If the patient is able to ingest and absorb the medication there is no reason why VAE should be permitted. A brief history of VAE and PAS is given and some of the arguments which have been given are analyzed. The Principle of the Double Effect is briefly discussed and why, in my opinion, it is not a valid principle is briefly discussed.

AB Objective: The present study addressed potential harms of a negative working environment for employed subjects. The main aim was to evaluate if adverse working conditions and job strain are related to an increase in suicide mortality.
   Methods: The study population consisted of 6817 participants drawn from the MONICA/KORA Augsburg, Germany, surveys conducted in 1984-1995, being employed at baseline examination and followed up on average for 12.6 years. Adverse working conditions were assessed by an instrument of 16 items about chronobiological, physical and psychosocial conditions at the workplace, job strain was assessed as defined by Karasek. Suicide risks were estimated by Cox regression adjusted for suicide-related risk factors.
   Results: A number of 28 suicide cases were observed within follow-up. High levels of adversity in chronobiological/physical working conditions significantly increased the risk for suicide mortality (HR 3.28, 95% CI 1.43-7.54) compared to low/intermediate levels in a model adjusted for age, sex and survey (p value 0.005). Additional adjustment for living alone, low educational level, smoking, high alcohol consumption, obesity and depressed mood attenuated this effect (HR 2.73) but significance remained (p value 0.022). Adverse psychosocial working conditions and job strain, in contrast, had no impact on subsequent suicide mortality risk (p values > 0.200).
   Conclusions: A negative working environment concerning chronobiological or physical conditions at the workplace had an unfavourable impact on suicide mortality risk, even after controlling for relevant suicide-related risk factors. Employer interventions aimed to improve workplace conditions might be considered as a suitable means to prevent suicides among employees. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: There are an estimated one million completed suicides per year worldwide. As a response to increasing concern about suicide within Europe, the EUROSAVE (European Review of Suicide and Violence Epidemiology) study was undertaken to examine recent trends in the epidemiology of suicide and self-inflicted injury mortality in the European Union (EU). Methods: Suicide and self-inflicted injury mortality data for the 15 EU countries for the years,1984-1998 were obtained from the World Health Organisation (WHO), the European Statistical Office of the European Commission (EUROSTAT) and national statistical agencies. Data were also obtained for a second group of deaths classified as 'undetermined' or 'other violence'. Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated and examined for trends over time. Results: Finland had the highest suicide rate, while Greece had the lowest for the latest available year (1997). Age-standardized suicide rates tended to be lowest in the Mediterranean countries. Significant downward linear time trends in suicide,mortality were observed in most countries, although rates varied markedly between countries. Both Ireland and Spain displayed significant upward linear trends in suicide mortality. Portugal had the highest rate of undetermined deaths-both in 1984 and 1998 while Greece had the lowest in both 1984 and 1997. Five countries (including Ireland and Spain) showed significant downward trends in deaths due to undetermined causes whereas Belgium and Germany showed borderline significant upward linear trends in deaths due to undetermined causes. Conclusions: Although suicide rates in most countries seem to be decreasing, the validity of the data is uncertain. Misclassification may contribute to the geographical and temporal variation in suicide rates in some EU countries but it does not explain the phenomenon. More detailed research comparing suicide-recording procedures and practices across the EU is required. In the absence of adequate EU wide data on suicide epidemiology, effective prevention of this distressing phenomenon is likely to remain elusive.

TI Driven into Suicide by the East German Regime? Reflections on the
   Persistence of a Misleading Perception
SO CENTRAL EUROPEAN HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
ID MORTALITY; RATES
AB The assumption that the communist dictatorship in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) drove many people to suicide has persisted for decades, and it is still evident in academic and public discourse. Yet, high suicide rates in eastern Germany, which can be traced back to the nineteenth century, cannot be a result of a particular political system. Be it monarchy, democracy, fascism, or socialism, the frequency of suicide there did not change significantly. In fact, the share of politically motivated suicides in the GDR amounts to only 1-2 percent of the total. Political, economic, or sociocultural factors did not have a significant impact on suicide rates. An analysis of two subsets of GDR society that were more likely to be affected by repression-prisoners and army recruits-further corroborates this: there is no evidence of a higher suicide rate in either case. Complimentary to a quantitative approach "from above," a qualitative analysis "from below" not only underlines the limited importance of repression, but also points to a regional pattern of behavior linked to cultural influences and to the role of religion-specifically, to Protestantism. Several factors nevertheless fostered the persistence of an overly politicized interpretation of suicide in the GDR: the bereaved in the East, the media in the West, and a few victims of suicide themselves blamed the regime and downplayed important individual and pathological aspects. Moreover, state and party officials in the GDR unintentionally reinforced the politicization of suicide by imposing a taboo on the subject, which only fueled the flames of speculation about its root causes.

AB Suicide rate follows a seasonal pattern that is related to rising air temperature and global radiation. These findings are reproducible within different climatic regions. Numerous studies have attempted to explain this peak in relation to weather. However, many of these studies did not use meteorological data representative of the site of the suicide or attempted suicide, resulting in limitations of the findings. Previous studies also suffered from limitations in the methods of data analysis. The current study examined the relationship between weather, i.e., solar radiation, air temperature, and the rate of suicides and suicidality in the area of Mittelfranken, Germany, using regional meteorological data. Statistical risk estimation revealed associations between higher global radiation and air temperatures on the day of and day before suicide acts. The results could be of interest for general suicide prevention strategies. Future studies should examine additional possible factors of influence and concentrate on a strict standardized study design. The aim is to obtain reproducible data of the seasonal influences on suicide behavior, allowing for the comparison of data from different meteorological regions and patient subgroups.

AB Background: Whereas non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicide attempts (SA) are rather common among adolescents, the description of risk factors has often failed to take migration into perspective. Our study aimed to describe immigration status in adolescents with regards to their lifetime history of NSSI and SA.
   Methods: We carried out a population based study in a school community of ninth-graders (N = 452, mean age 14.85, SD 0.58) in southern Germany. Data were collected via adolescent self report on sociodemographic variables and on NSSI and SA using the Self Harm Behavior Questionnaire.
   Results: Adolescents born outside Germany showed an elevated rate of a lifetime history of NSSI and SA. When compared to German adolescents without a (family) history of migration (NSSI 19.16%, SA 3.24%), adolescents who were born in another country had an elevated risk for NSSI (42.86%, OR 3.36) and SA (17.86%, OR 6.78), which was higher than the risk of adolescents who had at least one parent who had emigrated from another country (NSSI 30.08%, OR 2.46 and SA 8.94%, OR 4.45).
   Conclusion: Our findings should inform intervention services and prevention programs for NSSI and suicidality in youth. Adopting such programs to include culturally sensible modules could improve the outcome in ethnically diverse adolescents.

AB Background: No recent cross-country examinations for youth suicide trends and methods for Europe were found.
   Aim: The aim of the study is to specify differences in suicide rates, trends and methods used among 15-24 years olds by gender across 15 European countries.
   Method: Data for 14,738 suicide cases in the age group 15-24 in 2000-2004/5 were obtained and analysed.
   Results: Suicide rates ranged 5.5-35.1 for males and 1.3-8.5 for females. Statistically significant decline since 2000 was observed in Germany, Scotland, Spain, and England for males and in Ireland for females. Hanging was most frequently used for both genders, followed by jumping and use of a moving object for males and jumping and poisoning by drugs for females. Male Suicides had a higher risk than females of using firearms and hanging and lower risk of poisoning by drugs and jumping. There were large differences between single Countries.
   Limitations: The limitations of the study are the small numbers of specific suicide methods in some countries as well as the recategorisation of ICD-9 codes into ICD-10 in England, Ireland and Portugal. Further, the use of suicides (X60-X84) without events of undetermined deaths (Y10-Y34) continues to be problematic considering the possibility of "hidden suicides".
   Conclusions: The present Study shows that suicide rates among young males are decreasing since 2000 in several European countries. Analysis of suicide methods confirms that there is a very high proportion of hanging in youths, which is extremely difficult to restrict. However, besides hanging there are also high rates of preventable suicide methods and reducing the availability of means should be one of the goals of suicide prevention.

AB The weight of human brains is subject of numerous scientific research studies particularly in anatomy, pathology, and forensic medicine. Just a few investigations deal with a possible correlation between psychiatric disorders, especially suicidality, and brain weight. The results are contradictory.
   This study aims to find out if postmortem brain weight is higher in suicide victims considering the discrepancies of previous studies.
   In a retrospective study, the weight of brains obtained by autopsies performed in the Institute of Legal Medicine in Frankfurt, Germany, was evaluated. Data of 99 suicide cases (64 males, 35 females) were compared with those obtained from similar number cases of sudden death in a matched pair analysis. In each case, body weight, height, and body mass index were also taken into account.
   No significant differences in brain weight were found in suicide victims compared to those of the control group.
   The brain weight depends on various parameters such as gender, age, body height, and weight. The selection criteria for suicide cases as well as for the corresponding control population are essential in evaluating the brain weight in suicide.

AB Background: As a basis for preventive strategies to reduce subway suicides, an investigation was undertaken to determine if there was a distinct pattern of subway suicidal behaviour. Methods: Data were taken from the Municipal Munich Subway System case registry (southern Germany) for all suicidal incidents on the track: purposely inflicted; date, time and location of incident, sex of victim, outcome. The analysis covered a 20 year observation period between 1980 and 1999, for which the Munich Municipal Office for Statistics also provided data of all deaths due to suicides within the city area of Munich. Suicide mortality was classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth revision (codes E950-E959). Results: A total of 306 incidents were documented with an annual mean of 16.5 cases. Case fatality was 66% (n=202). It was highest in winter and in higher aged groups. No significant time trend for incidences was observed. Median age of suicide attempters was 38 years. Most incidences (24.2%) were recorded for persons aged 20-29 years. The male: female ratio was 1.15 : 1. The peak time of day for incidences in women was during the late morning hours while significantly more men committed subway suicides during evening hours (p=0.001). No consistent seasonal variation was observed. Conclusions: In comparison to average suicide attempters, subjects committing subway suicides are markedly younger and they follow to a lesser extent established seasonal or circadian time patterns. More women are involved in subway suicides than would be expected. However, similarities to reports on behavioural patterns of subway suicides in other communities are striking.

AB Suicide is globally recognized as one of the leading causes of death and a major issue for the public health sector. Considering the importance of suicide, this study attempts to correlate decreased platelet serotonin levels with increased suicide risk in bipolar I disorder (BPD I), while also evaluating other risk factors. All patients admitted to the "Prof. Dr. Alexandru Obregia" Clinical Hospital of Psychiatry in Bucharest, Romania, between the June 1st, 2015 and February 16th, 2016 were asked to participate in this study. Those between 18 and 65 years of age, who agreed to participate and whose diagnoses of BPD I were confirmed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview were included in the study, leading to a number of 75 patients. Suicide risk was assessed using the SAD PERSONS Scale to quantify current suicide risk factors. Platelet serotonin levels were determined using the IVD ELISA system (LDN GmbH, Germany) on platelet rich plasma per manufacturer protocol. The scores received from applying the SAD PERSONS Scale were shown to be inversely proportional to platelet serotonin levels, and those patients with bipolar disorder classified as showing medium-high suicide risk, had significantly lower platelet serotonin concentrations. In further studies, with a larger sample size, and other improvements further discussed in this article, it may be possible to demonstrate the need to test platelet serotonin levels as part of the biological model of suicide in bipolar disorder.

ID WERTHER; IMPLEMENTATION; HEALTH; IMPACT
AB Responsible reporting on suicide (RRS) is a cornerstone of suicide prevention. Scholars have developed media guidelines facilitating RRS, but there are barriers to accepting and implementing these suggestions, alongside obstacles for journalists' comprehensive adherence to them. For example, journalists could perceive media guidelines as a threat to their autonomy or to the freedom of the press. However, there is scant evidence on how journalists actually evaluate RRS media guidelines, leaving it unclear as to how journalists perceive them and how willing they are to adhere to them. The present study addresses this research gap and explores potential barriers to guideline adherence using 30 qualitative, semi-structured interviews with journalists in Germany. Journalists expected that their freedom of speech would remain untouched, which mostly referred to the non-restrictive tone of the guidelines, to persuasive, evidence-based explanations, and to clear reporting examples. Practical implications for increasing journalists' adherence to media guidelines are discussed.

AB In the context of our investigation, we found information on 432 (76%) of the 569 Jewish dermatologists in Germany. There is evidence that 57 (10%) of the Jewish dermatologists were murdered in concentration camps, 61 (10.7%) died a natural death, 13 (2%) committed suicide, and 25 (4%) survived the Third Reich in Germany. After 1933, 276 (49%) Jewish dermatologists were able to leave Germany; the United States of America was the main destination and 107 (or 41%) emigrated there. A total of 34 (13%) Jewish dermatologists emigrated from Germany to Palestine and 16 to Latin America. Regarding emigration to other European countries, 20 of the Jewish dermatologists from Germany went to Great Britain (including Walter Freudenthal, 1893-1952, and Ernst Sklarz, 1894-1975), and 24 emigrated to other European countries, such as France (Rudolf Mayer, 1895-1962), Sweden (Carl Lennhoff, 1883-1963), and the Netherlands (Otto Schlein, 1895-1944).

AB Background: Diaspora migration flows from the former Soviet Union to Western Europe and Israel have increased since the late 1980s. Risk factors responsible for the East-West mortality gap and post-migration factors may lead to higher mortality from external causes of death like suicide amongst such Diaspora immigrants. We investigated whether ethnic German immigrants from the former Soviet Union had increased mortality from external causes compared to native Germans. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 34 393 adults, so-called Aussiedler who arrived in Germany's largest federal state between 1990 and 2001. We ascertained vital status and causes of death from registry data. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated using the native German population as comparison. Multivariate effects were assessed using Poisson regression. Results: 1 657 members (4.8%) died, 88 from external causes. Overall SMR was 1.29 (95% confidence intervals 1.05-1.61). Males had a 39% higher mortality from all external causes and accidents, and a 30% higher mortality from suicide than German males. Females had slightly higher mortality from accidents but comparable mortality from all external causes. Aussiedler aged < 65 years had rate ratios above one for external causes and accidents in multivariate models. SMRs for suicide and all external causes decreased with length of stay. Conclusion: While ethnic German immigrants have a mortality disadvantage compared to the NRW population, it is on a much lower scale than expected if they were representative of their source populations in former Soviet Union countries.

TI Sex- and age-specific trends in mortality from suicide and undetermined
   death in Germany 1991-2002
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID ENGLAND; RATES; WALES
AB Background: Over the last decade, significant downward linear time trends in suicide mortality were observed in most Western countries. To date, it is not established whether those favourable time trends developed homogeneously for sex and age groups and how they were affected by the number of undetermined deaths.
   Methods: Data on suicide mortality and undetermined death from 1991 to 2002 in Germany were obtained from the German Federal Statistical Office. For each year, the age-standardised suicide rate (SR), undetermined death rate ( UDR) and total rate (SR+UDR) was calculated by direct standardisation separately for men and women. Time trends were analyzed by Poisson regression estimating the average annual percentage change (AAPC) of the rates for sex and four age groups ( 15 - 24, 25 - 44, 45 - 74, >= 75 years).
   Results: A significant decline of the SR was observed in all age groups but was less pronounced among the younger ages, particularly among men aged 15 - 24 years ( AAPC - 0.7%, p = 0.041). The SR in the oldest male age group (= 75 years) declined much stronger ( AAPC - 3.5%, p < 0.001). In women, the AAPC of the SR ranged from - 1.7% to - 4.6%. The average annual percentage changes in the age groups 25 - 74 years did not differ substantially for SR and SR+UDR. In contrast, due to an increase of undetermined deaths for subjects = 75 years, time trends in this age group were affected by the number of undetermined deaths, especially in women.
   Conclusion: Observing downward trends in suicide mortality with lower declines for younger subjects, prevention strategies should focus in particular on younger subjects.

LA German
DT Article
ID ASSISTED SUICIDE; PALLIATIVE CARE; PHYSICIANS
AB In critically ill patients, intensive care medical procedures allow diseases to be cured or controlled that were considered incurable many years ago. For patients with terminal heart failure or heart disease with other severe comorbidities (cancer, stroke), the questions whether the deactivation of defibrillators is appropriate or must be regarded as active euthanasia may arise.
   Notable cases from the author's hospital are analyzed. The literature on the topic euthanasia and basic literature regarding defibrillator therapy are discussed.
   It is undisputed that patients as part of their self-determination have the right to renounce treatment. Active euthanasia and the thereby deliberate induction of death is prohibited by law in Germany and will be prosecuted. Passive euthanasia is the omission or reduction of possibly life-prolonging treatment measures. Passive euthanasia requires the patient's consent and is legally and ethically permissible. Indirect euthanasia takes into account acceleration of death as a side effect of a medication. Unpunishable assisted suicide ("assisted suicide") is the mere assistance of self-controlled and self-determined death. Assisted suicide is fundamentally not a criminal offense in Germany. Deactivation of a defibrillator is a treatment discontinuation, which is only permitted in accordance with the wishes of the patient. It is not a question of passive or active euthanasia. Involvement of a local ethics committee and/or legal consultation is certainly useful and sometimes also allows previously unrecognized questions to be answered.

On the basis of own clinical experience and relevant study results, closed and open wards are compared with respect to the extent of aggression and coercive measures, the risks of absconding and suicide. Compared to open wards, closed wards are unlikely to reduce the risk of absconding, do not result in adecreased suicide rate and do not result in areduction of aggressive behavior. In contrast, coercive measures seem to be practiced more frequently in closed wards. Therefore, the regular practice of accommodation in closed wards should be revised.

AB This contribution aims to place the debate on euthanasia in Germany, including assisted suicide as well as current and possible future regulations, within an overall European perspective. It outlines the main statements of the CPCE's aid to orientation "A Time to Live and a Time to Die" from 2011 regarding said topic, and names basic biblical, theological, as well as individual-, personal-, and socio-ethical aspects. This article also comments on the German parliamentary bill concerning the regulation of physician-assisted suicide as brought up for discussion by Gian Domenico Borasio, Ralf J. Jox, Jochen Taupitz, and Urban Wiesing.

AB Background. This study examined the prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), suicide attempts, suicide threats and suicidal ideation in a German school sample and compared the rates with a similar sample of adolescents from the midwestern USA by using cross-nationally validated assessment tools.
   Method. Data were provided from 665 adolescents (mean age 14.8 years, S.D. = 0.66, range 14-17 years) in a school setting. Students completed the Self-Harm Behavior Questionnaire (SHBQ), the Ottawa Self-Injury Inventory (OSI) and a German version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D).
   Results. A quarter of the participants (25.6%) endorsed at least one act of NSSI in their life, and 9.5% of those students answered that they had hurt themselves repetitively (more than four times). Forty-three (6.5%) of the students reported a history of a suicide attempt. No statistically significant differences were observed between the German and US samples in terms of self-injury or suicidal behaviors.
   Conclusions. By using the same validated assessment tools, no differences were found in the prevalence and characteristics of self-injury and suicidal behaviors between adolescents from Germany and the USA. Thus, it seems that NSSI has to be understood as worldwide phenomenon, at least in Western cultures.

ID MEDIA; BEHAVIOR; CELEBRITY; RATES
AB Background: The railway suicide of Robert Enke, an internationally respected German football goal keeper, sent shockwaves throughout the world of football. We analyzed its impact on the frequency of subsequent railway suicide acts (RS).
   Methods: Two analytic approaches were performed applying German Railway Event database Safety (EDS) data: first, an inter-year approach comparing the incidence of RS during a predefined "index period" with identical time windows in 2006 to 2008; second, an intra-year approach comparing the number of RS 28 days before and after the incidence. To analyze a possible "compensatory deficit", the number of RS in the subsequent first quarter of 2010 was compared with the identical time windows in the preceding three years. Incidence ratios with 95% confidence intervals were estimated by Poisson regression. Findings were controlled for temperature.
   Findings: Compared to the preceding three years, the incidence ratio (IR) of the number of RS in the index period increased by 1.81 (1.48-2.21; p<0.001), leading to an overall percentage change of 81% (48-121%; p<0.001). Comparing the number of suicides 28 days before and after the incidence revealed an even more pronounced increase of IR (2.2; 1.6-3.0). No modifications of these associations were observed by daytime, by location of the suicide and fatality. No compensatory deficit occurred in the post-acute period.
   Interpretation: The substantial increase of RS in the aftermath of the footballer's suicide death brought about copycat behavior in an unforeseen amount, even though the media reporting was largely sensitive and preventive measures were taken. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Women of Turkish descent in Germany show higher rates of suicidal behavior compared to their host populations and men of Turkish descent. This indicates a demand for a better understanding of suicidality in this group. Nine focus groups (N = 61) were conducted to assess explanatory models including patterns of distress, perceived causes, course/consequences of and reactions towards a suicidal crisis, help-seeking behavior, and potential intervention and prevention strategies. All participants were of Turkish descent living in Berlin, Germany. The focus groups included two with professionals such as psychiatrists or psychotherapists, two with Community Mothers, three with women from the community (ages: 18 -34, 35 -49, 50+), and of three suicide attempters (ages: 18 -33, 38 -66). Data were analyzed using the methodology of thematic analysis. Results show that suicide-related behaviors, attitudes, and help-seeking behavior have gender and culture-specific characteristics. Two central themes were identified: the impact of family and community and the impact of German society. Participants stated that they believe that family and community pressures as well as discrimination and lack of acceptance cause social isolation. Fear of stigmatization and dishonoring themselves or their family, as well as shame and self-stigma decrease the likelihood of reaching out for help. Recommended strategies are community and family interventions, promotion of integration and social inclusion, awareness campaigns to destigmatize suicidality and the use of mental health services, empowerment of women, as well as the improvement of cultural sensitivity and competency of services.

AB The current paper seeks to systematize the discussion on the causes of the changes in Eastern European countries' suicide mortality during the last 15 years by analyzing the changes in relation to some common causes: alcohol consumption, economic changes, "general pathogenic social stress", political changes and social disorganization. It is found that the development in suicide has varied between in different countries, and that the same causes cannot apply to all of them. However, the relation between suicide mortality and social processes is obvious. A model consisting of general stress, democratization, alcohol consumption and social disorganization (with a period-dependent effect) predicted fairly accurately the percentual changes in the suicide rates in 16 out of the 28 Eastern Bloc countries in 1984-89 and 1989-94, while it failed to do so for Albania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and the Caucasian and Central Asian newly independent states. The data are subject to many potential sources of error: the small number of units and the large multicollinearity between the independent variables may bias results. Nevertheless, the results indicate that the changes in Eastern European suicide mortality, both its decreases and increases, may be explained with the same set of variables. However, more than one factor is needed, and the multicollinearity will continue to pose a problem.

SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR EVANGELISCHE ETHIK
LA German
DT Article
AB The author, former Minister of Justice in Germany, focuses on problems arising in the codification of ethical decisions concerning assistance in suicide, as it occurs in the Netherlands. He appreciates the precautions taken in Netherland's law to prevent abuse of the legalization of certain kinds of euthanasia. He states that the declared intention of a dying person to end his or her life is to be respected. Compassion and sympathy which finally lead to aiding the moribund person in suicide might be understandable although strictly forbidden. This ends up in a conflict which can not be subject to legal statutes but has to be a matter of a very serious decision of conscience. Thus, aid in suicide can not be allowed by law in general. The author claims that the focus on everyone's own responsible decision is a genuine position of Protestant ethics.

AB The current article deals with the ethics and practice of physician-assisted suicide (PAS) and dying. The debate about PAS must take the important legal and ethical context of medical acts at the end of life into consideration, and cannot be examined independently from physicians' duties with respect to care for the terminally ill and dying. The discussion in Germany about active euthanasia, limiting medical intervention at the end of life, patient autonomy, advanced directives, and PAS is not fundamentally different in content and arguments from discussions led in other European countries and the United States. This must be emphasized, since it is occasionally claimed that in Germany a thorough discussion could not be held with the same openness as in other countries due to Germany's recent history. Still, it is worthwhile to portray the debate, which has been held intensively both among experts and the German public, from the German perspective. In general, it can be stated that in Germany debates about questions of medical ethics and bioethics are taking place with relatively large participation of an interested public, as shown, for instance, by the intense recent discussions about the legalisation of advanced directives on June 18 2009, the generation and use of embryonic stem cells in research or the highly difficult challenges for the prioritizing and rationing of scarce resources within the German health care system. Hence, the current article provides some insights into central medical and legal documents and the controversial public debate on the regulation of end-of-life medical care. In conclusion, euthanasia and PAS as practices of direct medical killing or medically assisted killing of vulnerable persons as "due care" is to be strictly rejected. Instead, we propose a more holistically-oriented palliative concept of a compassionate and virtuous doctor-cared dying that is embedded in an ethics of care.

AB Living conditions in Nazi concentration camps were harsh and inhumane, leading many prisoners to commit suicide. Sachsenhausen (Oranienburg, Germany) was a concentration camp that operated from 1936 to 1945. More than 200,000 people were detained there under Nazi rule. This study analyzes deaths classified as suicides by inmates in this camp, classified as homosexuals, both according to the surviving Nazi files. This collective was especially repressed by the Nazi authorities. Data was collected from the archives of Sachsenhausen Memorial and the International Tracing Service in Bad Arolsen. Original death certificates and autopsy reports were reviewed. Until the end of World War II, there are 14 death certificates which state "suicide" as cause of death of prisoners classified as homosexuals, all of them men aged between 23 and 59 years and of various religions and social strata. Based on a population of 1,200 prisoners classified as homosexuals, this allows us to calculate a suicide rate of 1,167/100,000 (over the period of eight years) for this population, a rate 10 times higher than for global inmates (111/100,000). However, our study has several limitations: not all suicides are registered; some murders were covered-up as suicides; most documents were lost during the war or destroyed by the Nazis when leaving the camps and not much data is available from other camps to compare. We conclude that committing suicides in Sachsenhausen was a common practice, although accurate data may be impossible to obtain.

AB Extended suicide (also known as homicide-suicide) is an incident in which the perpetrator kills one or more people against their will and subsequently commits suicide. Victim and offender are often in a close relationship. In the case of a failed suicide, the offender has to anticipate extensive penal consequences (A A 211 ff. of the German criminal code).
   The aim of this study was to analyze homicide-suicide cases that occurred during a 21-year period (1994-2014) and to gain further information about the background of these incidents.
   In a retrospective study, 58 cases of homicide-suicide investigated at the Institute of Legal Medicine, Goethe University in Frankfurt/Main, Germany were analyzed. Information about the incidents was obtained from the autopsy reports and from prosecution investigation files, as far as these were provided in accordance with data protection regulations. A literature survey and a homicide-suicide classification system were conducted and descriptive and statistical data analyses were performed.
   In 58 cases a total of 74 victims were involved in which 93% of the offenders were male and 7% female. Of the victims 76% were female, 20% male and 4% remained unknown. Victims involved 17 children and 66% of the incidents included a spouse or intimate partner relationship. In 71% the crime scene took place in the domestic environment. The main triggering factors of the acts were marriage conflicts and financial problems. In 57% of the cases shooting was the method of choice.
   Due to the severity and consequences of the act, the term homicide-suicide rather than extended suicide should be employed in German linguistic usage because it is a homicide with subsequent suicide. The emphasis should be placed on the development of prevention.

TI Escape Artistry: Elisabeth Bergner and Jewish Disappearance in <i>Der
   traumende Mund</i> (Czinner, 1932)
SO GERMAN STUDIES REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB The late Weimar film Der traumende Mund culminates in the apparent but unconfirmed suicide of its female protagonist, played by Elisabeth Bergner. Bergner, whose background contributed to the film's Jewish reception, and who later claimed to have written the film's screenplay, left Germany and went into exile with director Paul Czinner in 1932. This film and the circumstances of its production and premiere link tragic modes of self-erasure, including the suicides of both many women and many German Jews, to notions of escape, emigration, and reemergence. Its success among Jewish spectators points to its enduring and international appeal.

AB Background: The Internet has facilitated the existence of extreme and pathological communities that share information about ways to complete suicide or to deliberately harm or hurt oneself. This material is user-generated and easily accessible. Aims: The present study analyzed the buffering effect of social belonging to a primary group in the situation of pro-suicide site exposure. Method: Cross-national data were collected from the US, UK, Germany, and Finland in spring 2013 and 2014 from respondents aged 15-30 years (N = 3,567). Data were analyzed by using linear regression separately for women and men for each country. Results: A higher level of belonging to a primary group buffered the negative association of pro-suicide site exposure with mental health, measured as happiness, although the results were not consistent in the subgroups. US male subjects showed a significant buffering effect of the sense of belonging to family while the belonging to friends had a buffering effect among four other subgroups: British female and male subjects and Finnish female and male subjects. Conclusion: The results underline the positive potential of primary groups to shield young people's mental health in the situation of pro-suicide site exposure.

AB Suicide in later life is a global public health problem. The aim of this review was to conduct a systematic analysis of studies with comparison groups that examined the associations between social factors and suicidal behavior (including ideation, non-fatal suicidal behavior, or deaths) among individuals aged 65 and older. Our search identified only 16 articles (across 14 independent samples) that met inclusion criteria. The limited number of studies points to the need for further research. Included studies were conducted in Canada (n = 2), Germany (n = 1), Hong Kong (n = 1), Japan (n = 1), Singapore (n = 1), Sweden (n = 2), Taiwan (n = 1), the U. K. (n = 2), and the U.S. (n = 3). The majority of the social factors examined in this review can be conceptualized as indices of positive social connectedness-the degree of positive involvement with family, friends, and social groups. Findings indicated that at least in industrialized countries, limited social connectedness is associated with suicidal ideation, non-fatal suicidal behavior, and suicide in later life. Primary prevention programs designed to enhance social connections as well as a sense of community could potentially decrease suicide risk, especially among men.

AB The number of people aged 14 and older that use the Internet in Germany has doubled to 35.7 millions (55.3%) since the year 2000. The Internet also more and more expands into the domain of psychiatry and psychotherapy, and is used by psychiatric patients for information, communication and therapeutic purposes. Nevertheless, the infinite possibilities of the World Wide Web are linked with several advantages and disadvantages. Easily accessible information, numerous opportunities for exchange among like-minded people and therapeutic support from online therapies are juxtaposed with such risks as frequently lacking quality and transparency of the available information, possible enhancement of social withdrawal and certain Websites concerning suicide. If the mentioned risks of the Internet rather provoke new problems and trigger suicidality or if the chance of an easily accessible online discussion rather results in mental relief cannot be answered generally.

AB Depressive disorders as well as fatal and non-fatal suicidal behaviour continue to be important mental health issues. Because of the close relation between depression and suicidal behaviour, it is likely that preventive actions improving care and optimising treatment for depressed patients result in a reduction of suicidal acts. This was shown in the Nuremberg Alliance against Depression, a two-year four-level community based intervention program associated with a 24% reduction of suicidal acts (completed and attempted suicides combined) compared to a baseline year and a control region. Serving as a model project, this approach has up to now been adopted in more than 100 regions in Germany and Europe. Within the suicide prevention project OSPI-Europe, the four-level-approach was optimized and further implemented and evaluated in different European regions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Data were collected in a written survey using the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) as well as questions on attempted suicide and auto-aggressive behaviour. Participants experienced a mean of three traumatic events, with 14 per cent developing a Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) subsequently. In each national sample, more than 50 per cent of the participants were in need of treatment because of psychological symptoms and nearly one-third had attempted suicide.

DT Article
DE history of suicide; gender; medieval history; medieval Iceland; Old
   Norse-Icelandic saga literature; legend of Brynhildr
AB The article examines thirteenth-century Icelandic conceptions of female suicide and ideas about their causes and motives by conducting a case study of a saga figure called Brynhildr, who commits suicide. The story of Brynhildr is told in several medieval Icelandic sources: in the mytho-heroic legendary saga (fbrnaldarsaga)Volsunga saga, Snort Sturluson's Prose Edda and the Poetic Edda. The story of Brynhildr in these sources offers fruitful material for the study of the history of suicide, since the northern version in question differs from the southern version of the Brynhildr legend that was known especially in medieval Germany, in which Brynhildr does not kill herself. In this study, the causes and background factors of B thildr's suicide and her motives for her deed, which are described and mentioned in the sources, represent possibilities for female behavior that were part of the mental toolbox of medieval Icelanders. It is argued that the Icelandic audience believed some women committed suicide to protect or restore their honor, or to take revenge, and that such an act required determination. capability to make rational choices, and sense of responsibility. The act could also be seen as a manifestation of power and authority: the woman decided herself when her life would end. However, Brynhildr's death represents only one possible type of female suicide, and not all were expected to be the same. Committing such a preconceived self-killing as Brynhildr's required an especially strong will. Most women, who were usually maintained by men, were thought not to possess such might and strength.

There are hints that this population is at risk. The aim of the study is to investigate the epidemiology of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and direct self-injurious behavior in adolescents with a migration background in Germany while taking gender-specific differences into consideration.MethodsA representative study with N=10,638 students (mean age 14.91years, SD=.73).) in the state of Lower Saxony in Germany was conducted. In the 2014-2015 school year, 672 classes were selected by randomly sampling different school types. The participation rate was 84.1%, excluding any classes for which the director refused to provide consent. A total of 49.8% were female adolescents, and 23.3% of the participants had a migration background. Target variables were assessed with items from the Ottawa Self-Injury Inventory, the Self-Harm Behavior Questionnaire and the Self-Harm Inventory, partly adapted.ResultsOf all students, 7.6% had a lifetime history of suicide attempts, and 36.6% answered with a rating of at least rarely when asked to rate the lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation. The 12-month prevalence of direct self-injurious behavior was 17.8%. Adolescents with a migration background showed a significantly higher prevalence of all three constructs (p=.006; p<.001; p=.006). Male students with a migration background reported a significantly higher lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts (4.7% vs. 3.1%) than native males (p=.009). Female students with a migration background reported a significantly higher lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts (15.9% vs. 10.4%) and suicidal ideation (often 12.1% vs. 8.9%) than native female students (p<.001; p=.008).ConclusionOur assessment indicates an elevated risk for suicidal behaviors in adolescents with a migration background. From research on adults, it is known that the dominant motives for suicidal behavior in migrants are associated with their migration history/situation. As suggested by Cramer and Kapusta's (Front Psychol 8:1756, 2017) theoretical model, the Social-Ecological Framework of Theory, Assessment, and Prevention, there is a need for culturally sensitive preventions that take into account the specific reasons for suicide attempts in migrants.

AB Background: The temporal relationship between smoking and suicidality is not yet clear. This article examines associations between smoking and suicidality and their temporal ordering of onset.
   Methods: Baseline and four-year follow-up data were used from the Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology (EDSP) study, a prospective longitudinal study of adolescents and young adults in Munich, Germany. We assessed smoking (occasional and regular), nicotine dependence, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts using the standardized Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI).
   Results: Suicide ideation and suicide attempts were strongly associated with occasional and regular smoking and nicotine dependence at baseline (Odds ratios [OR] range from 1.4 to 16.4). In the prospective analyses, prior occasional, regular smoking and nicotine dependence increased the risk for new onset of suicide ideation (OR range from 1.5 to 2.7) and prior regular smoking and nicotine dependence increased also the risk for onset of suicide attempt(s) (OR range between 3.1 and 4.5). Pre-existing suicidality could not be shown to be associated with subsequent smoking or nicotine dependence. Associations remained stable when participants who fulfilled DSM-IV-criteria for major depression were excluded.
   Limitations: The sample is confined to an age cohort of 14 to 24 years. No completed suicides could be observed.
   Conclusions: The presence of associations between prior smoking and subsequent suicidality, in concert with the lack of associations between prior suicidality and subsequent smoking suggests the existence of an independent pathway from smoking to suicidality.

AB Aims: Immigrants are at increased risk of dying from external causes, particularly suicide. This study presents mortality data from a complete follow-up of a cohort of immigrants from the Former Soviet Union to Germany. Number of residential changes after migration and time period between residential change and death are analysed as predictors for suicide and other causes of mortality. Methods: A representative cohort of immigrants (n=34,393) was followed up until 31 December 2002. Residential changes were monitored through city registries. Standardized mortality ratios were calculated for all causes of death and external causes of death (suicides, accidents, other external causes) and deaths attributable to psychoactive substance use. Data on residential change were analysed using Poisson regression to examine differences in external-cause mortality among immigrants who changed residence after immigration. Mortality rates by time since changing residence were calculated, and linear regression analysis was per-formed to model the effect of cause of death on the time interval between residential change and death. Results: Male immigrants had a significantly higher risk of dying from external causes and suicide than Germans, and this increases with frequency of residential changes. Suicide mortality was significantly higher shortly after residential change. Linear regression showed that time to death after residential change was 2.5 times shorter for suicide than for any other cause. Conclusions: High risk of death from external causes and from deaths attributable to substance abuse in immigrants suggests integration problems. Preventive efforts at targeted integration programmes for immigrants, in particular shortly after residential change, are recommended.

TI Euthanasia and assisted suicide: Comparison of legal aspects in
   Switzerland and other countries
SO MEDICINE SCIENCE AND THE LAW
LA English
DT Article
AB The purpose of this paper is to present the legal aspects associated with assisted suicide in Switzerland and compare them with those in other countries. Like euthanasia, assisted suicide is a subject that induces much discussion in many countries. While the law is very liberal in some countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands (where both euthanasia and assisted suicide take place), these practices are very controversial in other countries, such as France, where they remain taboo subjects.
   In the United States of America, the laws concerning assisted suicide can differ greatly from one state to another. For example, in Oregon, assisted suicide is allowed if applied by a medical doctor; in others, this act is illegal. In Canada, it is punishable according to the Criminal Code.
   In Switzerland euthanasia is punishable by law. However, the penal code does not condemn assisted suicide, whether carried out by a medical doctor or another person, provided it is not carried out through selfish motives. The application of these practices has become simplified in recent years and societies for the right to die with dignity based on this principle have come into being (Exit and Dignitas).
   In the French- and German-speaking parts of Switzerland the association Exit assists individuals living in Switzerland with serious progressive and incurable disease in their engagement to end their life. The association Dignitas, in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, also undertakes - in the same circumstances - to assist individuals coming from foreign countries. Dignitas welcomes several such individuals every year, especially from Germany, where a similar approach does not currently exist.

ID PSYCHIATRIC-INPATIENTS; TRANSLATION; INSTRUMENTS; AGREEMENT
AB In comparison to the general population, the suicide rates of psychiatric inpatient populations in Germany and Switzerland are very high. An important preventive contribution to the lowering of the suicide rates in mental health care is to ensure that the risk of suicide of psychiatric inpatients is assessed as accurately as possible. While risk-assessment instruments can serve an important function in determining such risk, very few have been translated to German. Therefore, in the present study, we reported on the German version of Nurses' Global Assessment of Suicide Risk (NGASR) scale. After translating the original instrument into German and pretesting the German version, we tested the inter-rater reliability of the instrument. Twelve video case studies were evaluated by 13 raters with the NGASR scale in a 'laboratory' trial. In each case, the observer's agreement was calculated for the single items, the overall scale, the risk levels, and the sum scores. The statistical data analysis was conducted with kappa and AC1 statistics for dichotomous (items, scale) scales. A high-to-very high observers' agreement (AC1: 0.62-1.00, kappa: 0.00-1.00) was determined for 16 items of the German version of the NGASR scale. We conclude that the German version of the NGASR scale is a reliable instrument for evaluating risk factors for suicide. A reliable application in the clinical practise appears to be enhanced by training in the use of the instrument and the right implementation instructions.

AB The article challenges some normative and evaluative prerequisites and consequences of distinct approaches put forward in the current German debate on (physician-) assisted suicide. First, two alternative types of understanding and using the concept of self-determination (Selbstbestimmung) within this debate are identified, concluding with the result of rejecting one while justifying the other. Second, it is argued in favour of a state preferring a rule of law which secures and supports a relationship-oriented and inclusion-sensitive lifestyle of as many citizens as possible. Against this background, the consequence is drawn to sustain the general prohibition of physician- assisted suicide within the established Professional Code for Physicians in Germany.

AB Background. Until now older adults have not been a target group for surveys regarding their personal attitudes towards euthanasia, although they are closest to chronic illness and death.
   Objective. To determine the attitudes of older adults towards euthanasia and controversial topics in the context of illness, euthanasia and care (e. g. palliative care) on the basis of a representative sample.
   Material and methods. The study was based on a postal survey of a representative random sample of the population aged 65 years and older (n = 3500) from a city in southern Germany using a standardized questionnaire.
   Results. A total of 1068 persons completed the questionnaire (response rate 30.5%). Assisted death was supported by 74.2% of the respondants and assisted suicide by 80.4%. According to multiple logistic regression analysis the support decreased with increasing strength of religious faith and a non-German country of origin. Of the participants 53.3% were worried about being a burden to their family, especially people with a limited state of health. People who shared this concern showed significantly more support for both types of euthanasia. More than 40% feared that people with severe and incurable illnesses would be more likely to be forced into a premature death (slippery slope argument). This concern was associated with a decreasing support of euthanasia.
   Conclusion. The results indicate that the strong approval of the legalization of assisted death and assisted suicide by older people is motivated not only by their desire for a self-determined death but also by fears and concerns. The findings have important implications for counseling, palliative care and treatment.

AB In contrast to many other states in the western hemisphere suicidal behaviour among children and teenagers is not on increasing problem in Germany. Children and teenagers who carried out suicidal attempts predominantly reveal a background of psychotic disorders during adolescence. Suicidal attempts are expressions of disturbed self-esteem experience due to identity and adaptation disorders.
   The adequate treatment of suicidal teenagers requires the precise and differential knowledge of the complex psychodynamic processes. Form of interventions and treatment are not directed only to the underlying disorder but also to the current psychosocial live constellations from which the suicidal attempts emerge. The different concepts of treatment and the various possible obstacles are discussed.

DE Dementia; Unbearable suffering; Physician-assisted suicide; Legal
   principles; Ethical aspects
ID EUTHANASIA; LIFE
AB Physician-assisted suicide in Germany is limited by criminal law and disapproved by professional authorities. A physician who is willing to help a demented patient in terminating his life has to be definitely sure that the disease does not interfere with the patient's capacity for decision-making. In cases of early dementia the reason why assisted suicide will usually be requested is not the actual suffering of the patient but his negative expectations for the future. As long as there are sufficient opportunities for palliative care, the progressive course of the dementia process does not imply a state of unbearable suffering which could justify an assisted suicide. Nevertheless there may be certain circumstances - as for instance the value that an individual attributes to his integrity or to the narrative unity of his life - which might possibly provide an ethical justification for the assistance in life termination. A physician who helps a demented person in performing a suicidal act does not necessarily oppose essential principles of medical ethics. Yet, especially with regard to possible societal consequences of physician-assisted suicide in dementia, the rejecting attitude of medical authorities against that activity must be considered as well founded and legitimate. Deviations from these general guidelines ought to be respected as long as they are limited to exceptional situations and correspond to a thorough consideration of a physician's professional duties. They should remain open to public control, but not be ultimately specified by unequivocal normative regulations.

This trend is driven by deaths from drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related diseases, termed as deaths of despair, and by the subgroup of low-educated individuals. In contrast, average mortality for middle-aged men and women continued to decrease in several other high-income countries including Germany. However, average mortality rates can disguise important differences between subgroups and the phenomenon of increasing mortality rates might also be present for subpopulations in these countries. Hence, we analyze how mortality in midlife is changing for several important demographic subgroups in Germany over the 1990-2015 period with a focus on deaths of despair. Our results show a very clear pattern: We find that mortality rates declined between 1990 and 2015, with no increases in deaths of despair for any of the subgroups. Thus, our findings starkly contrast with those for the US.

   World War II
AB Aims of the study. This explorative study focuses on those pathologists who became victims of the Third Reich by being dismissed, disenfranchised, persecuted, expelled, murdered, or driven to suicide. Accordingly, it examines the question of how many - and which - pathologists were oppressed in the Nazi dictatorship. It also looks at the reasons for this and the effects that repression has had on the lives of those affected - both in the Third Reich and in postwar Germany.
   Material and methods. The study is based on archival source material, which was supplemented by a systematic evaluation of the relevant research literature.
   Results and discussion. In total, the biographies of 89 pathologists could be reconstructed and evaluated. Of these, 67 persons were persecuted for "racial" or anti-Semitic reasons. Until their disenfranchisement, the majority were employed at a university.
   The majority of the examined pathologists fled abroad, with most immigrating to the USA and Great Britain and successfully establishing themselves there professionally. No indications of a return to their homeland could be found in the sample presented here. Reasons included a lack of career options and negative personal experiences in postwar Germany, such as in reparation proceedings. Quite a lot of those who remained in the German Reich died violently, either in concentration camps or by suicide.

AB The current paper seeks to systematize the discussion on the causes of the changes in Eastern European countries' suicide mortality during the last 15 years by analyzing the changes in relation to some common causes: alcohol consumption, economic;changes, "general pathogenic social stress", political changes, and social disorganization. It is found that the developments in suicide have been very different in different countries, and that the same causes cannot apply to all of them. However, the relation between suicide mortality and social processes is obvious. A model consisting of the hypothetical general stress (as indicated by mortality/life expectancy), democratization, alcohol consumption, and social disorganization (with a period-dependent effect) predicted the percentual changes in the suicide rates in 16 out of the 28 Eastern Blee countries in 1984-89 and 1989-94 fairly accurately, while it failed to do this for Albania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and the Caucasian and Central Asian newly independent states. Most interesting were the strong roles played by changes in life expectancy, the causes of which are discussed, and the fact that economic change seemed to lack explanatory power in multiple analyses. The data are subject to many potential sources of error, the small number of units and the large multicollinearity between the independent variables may distort the results. Nevertheless, the results indicate that the changes in Eastern European suicide mortality, both decreases and increases, may be explained with the same set of variables. However, more than one factor is needed, and the multicollinearity will continue to pose problems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Physician-assisted suicide (PAS), which is currently the subject of intense and controversial discussion in medical ethics, is barely discussed in psychiatry, albeit there are already dementia patients in Germany and other European countries who end their own lives with the assistance of physicians.
   Based on the finding that patients who ask for medical assistance in suicide often have in mind the loss of their mental capacity, we submit PAS to an ethical analysis and put it into a broader context of patient autonomy at the end of life.
   In doing so, we point to advance care planning, through which the patient autonomy of the person concerned can be supported as well as respected in later stages of the disease.
   If patients adhere to their autonomous wish for PAS, physicians find themselves in an ethical dilemma. A further tabooing of the topic, however, does not provide a solution; rather, an open societal and professional ethical discussion and regulation are essential.

AB Background: Suicidal ideation has been identified as one of the major predictors of attempted or actual suicide. Routinely screening individuals for endorsing suicidal thoughts could save lives and protect many from severe psychological consequences following the suicide of loved ones. The aim of this study was to validate the German version of the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS) in a sample representative for the Federal Republic of Germany.
   Methods: All 2450 participants completed the first part of the Scale, the BSS-Screen. A risk group of n = 112 individuals (4.6%) with active or passive suicidal ideation was identified and subsequently completed the entire BSS.
   Results: Satisfactory internal reliability (alpha = .97 for the BSS-Screen; alpha = .94 for the entire BSS) and excellent model fit indices for the one-dimensional factorial structure of the BSS-Screen (CFI = .998; TLI = .995; RMSEA = .045 [95% - CI: .030-.061]) were confirmed. Measurement invariance analyses supported strict invariance across gender, age, and depression status. We found correlations with related self-report measures in expected directions comparable to previous studies, indicating satisfactory construct validity.
   Limitations: Our study involved cross sectional data, hence neither predictive validity nor retest-reliability were examined. As only the risk group of n = 112 individuals completed the entire measure, confirmatory factor analyses could not be conducted for the full BSS.
   Conclusion: The German translation of the BSS is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing suicidal ideation in the general population. Using it as a screening device in general and specialized medical care could substantially advance suicide prevention.

AB Objectives: To test the robustness of the findings of previous studies in a large aggregated sample regarding (a) the impact of a patient's suicide on therapist's distress; (b) identify a potential subgroup of therapists needing special postvention; (c) and assess potential differences in overall distress between professional groups and at different levels of care.
   Methods: A questionnaire, characterizing the therapists, their reactions and the patients, had been sent out to 201 psychiatric hospitals in Germany providing different levels of care. Aggregated data from previous studies have been used.
   Results: In 39.6% of all cases, therapists suffer from severe distress after a patients' suicide. The global item "overall distress" can be used as an indicator to identify a subgroup of therapists that might need individualized postvention. No significant difference in overall distress experienced was observed between professional groups and at different levels of care.
   Conclusion: Our data suggest that identifying the severely distressed subgroup could be done using a visual analogue scale for overall distress. As a consequence, more specific, individualized and intensified help could be provided to these professionals, helping them to overcome distress and thereby ensuring delivery of high quality care to the patient.

AB Joseph Goebbels, Reich Propaganda Minister of National Socialist Germany and one of the most powerful Nazi politicians, committed suicide at the end of the Second World War together with his wife, Magda, thus escaping his political responsibilities. Prior to committing suicide, the Goebbels' conspired to murder their six children, and to this end, enlisted the help of the dentist Helmut Kunz. Not until 1959, however, did Kunz stand trial on six counts of aiding and abetting in a homicide. Using extensive court records, this article examines the life of the dentist Helmut Kunz, his function in the Third Reich, and his role in the murder of the Goebbels children.

AB Previous references suggesting a high mortality of propofol addiction in medical personnel were mostly based on surveys of the heads of medical departments or case reports; therefore, a questionnaire was sent to 48 forensic medicine departments in Germany, Austria and Switzerland concerning the number of autopsies carried out between 2002-2112 on medical personnel with the suspicion of abuse of propofol or other analgesics. The response rate was 67%. In 16 out of the 32 responding departments 39 deaths (27 males) were observed with previous connections to anesthesiology, intensive care or emergency departments of which 22 were physicians, 13 nurses, 2 other personnel and 2 were unknown. Propofol was the major cause of death in 33 cases (85%), in 8 cases including 7 with propofol, an unintentional accident was recorded and 29 were determined to be suicide. In 14 cases chronic abuse was denied but actually excluded by toxicological analysis in only 2 cases. In 11 cases involving suicide the question of abuse was not investigated. This survey confirmed previous data about the central role of propofol for the fatal outcome of addiction and suicide of anesthetists and other medical personnel. A dual prevention strategy with low-threshold offers for persons at risk and strategies for early detection is urgently needed including a stricter control of dispensing, improvement in forensic medical documentation and the use of toxicological investigations in every case of suspected abuse.

AB A robust literature on ingroup versus outgroup conflict suggests that perceived discrimination may be an important factor in intergroup aggression. Yet, to date, no studies have tested the hypothesis that the perception of being the victim of anti-Muslim discrimination might be associated with support for anti-Western political violence. We undertook an analysis of two Pew Global Attitudes Surveys: (1) a 2006 data set surveying 1,627 adult Muslim residents of Great Britain, France, Germany, and Spain and (2) a 2007 data surveying 1,050 adult Muslim residents of the United States. Our analyses support the conclusions that younger age and perceived discrimination are both associated with support of suicide bombing in these Muslim diaspora populations. Study 1 found that a bad experience of discrimination increased the odds of justifying suicide bombing among European Muslims by a factor of 3.4. Study 2 found that experienced discrimination was associated with justification of suicide bombing among American Muslims. If further investigations confirm that perceived discrimination is a risk factor for support for political violence, initiatives to reduce discrimination would theoretically reduce the risk of terrorism. We discuss the challenge of breaking the vicious cycle of intergroup prejudice and radicalization.

AB Objective The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of mental disorders among prisoners with a short prison term.
   Methods We investigated 102 participants with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID I and II) and the Symptom Check List (SCL-90).
   Results We found a lifetime-prevalence of mental disorders (axis I) of 83%. 80% of the participants showed at least one personality disorder.
   Conclusions These results indicate that short-term prisoners are a population which is highly troubled in a psychiatric sense and shows a need of treatment in prison.

AB The nursing profession in Germany is facing a public debate on legal and ethical questions concerning euthanasia on request and physician-assisted suicide. However, it seems questionable if the profession itself, individual nurses or the professional associations are prepared to be involved in such a public debate. To understand this hesitation, the present situation is considered in the light of the tradition and history of professional care in Germany. Obedience to medical as well as to religious authorities was long part of nurses' professional identity, but is no longer relevant. The lack of reflection and discussion on how to take a balanced view of ethical and political questions concerning nursing, and the role and responsibility of nurses in end-of-life decisions and situations of caring for dying people are discussed using the situation of nurses in the Netherlands as a comparison.

ID NONSUICIDAL SELF-INJURY
AB In Germany, departments of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry are responsible for the treatment of young people with acute suicidal tendencies. Therefore, it is important to consider means of preventing suicide already during the construction and business operations of these institutions. Approaches to structural suicide prevention can be divided into restrictive and atmospheric-therapeutic measures. The latter includes ways to create an antisuicidal environment and to establish a setting amenable to close support and care by mental-health professionals. Restrictive measures comprise security measures and means of avoiding potential hazards, for example, through life-threatening jumps (e.g., staircases) or intentional strangulation (e.g., employing materials with predetermined breaking points). In addition to security issues, architectural and creative aspects must be incorporated to enable a suicide-preventive atmosphere, that is, satisfying protective needs, creating positive distractions (panoramic views, activities, occupational therapy opportunities), and using positive physiological and natural influences (such as colors and light). Secure access to a pleasant and protected external area as well as exercise spaces is also essential. Architects and construction managers should work closely with the institution's health personnel (e.g., doctors, therapists, and psychiatric nursing staff) during the planning stages for Departments of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in order to come up with solutions that comprise appropriate, practical, and functional requirements and safety-restrictive measures. Thus, an inviting and atmospherically pleasant space can be created that simultaneously provides suicide prevention and protection, where adolescents with psychiatric disorders can be treated by mental-health professionals.

AB The management of gunshot wounds is a rare challenge for trauma surgeons in Germany and Central Europe as a result of the low incidence of this type of trauma. Penetrating injuries occur with an incidence of 5% in Germany. They are caused by gunshots or more commonly by knives or other objects, for example during accidents. Since even the number of patients who are treated at level 1 trauma centres is limited by the low incidence, the objective of this study was to assess the epidemiology and outcome of gunshot and stab wounds in Germany.
   Since 2009, the trauma registry of the German Trauma Society (TraumaRegister DGUA (R)) has been used to assess not only whether a trauma was penetrating but also whether it was caused by a gunshot or a stabbing. On the basis of this registry, we identified relevant cases and defined the observation period. Data were taken from the standard documentation forms that participating German hospitals completed between 2009 and 2011. We did not specify exclusion criteria in order to obtain as comprehensive a picture as possible of the trauma entities investigated in this study. As a result of the high incidence of gunshot wounds to the head and the implications of this type of injury for the entire group, a subgroup of patients without head injuries was analysed.
   From 2009 to 2011, there were 305 patients with gunshot wounds and 871 patients with stab wounds. The high proportion of suicide-related gunshot wounds to the head resulted in a cumulative mortality rate of 39.7%. Stab wounds were associated with a lower mortality rate (6.2%). Every fourth patient with a gunshot or stab wound presented with haemorrhagic shock, which was considerably more frequently seen during the prehospital phase than during the inhospital phase of patient management. Of the patients with gunshot wounds, 26.9% required transfusions. This percentage was three times higher than that for patients with blunt trauma.
   In Germany, gunshot and stab wounds have a low incidence and are mostly caused by violent crime or attempted suicide. Depending on the site of injury, they have a high mortality and are often associated with major haemorrhage. As a result of the low incidence of these types of trauma, further data and analyses are required which can provide the basis for an evaluation of the long-term quality of the management of patients with stab or gunshot wounds.

DE Reading culture; Ethics; Goethe; Chikamatsu Monzaemon; Forbidden books;
   Suicide
AB Texts whose themes are contrary to the social norms and ethical codes of their era, or which disseminate what are seen as unwholesome ideas, have been in many societies prohibited from being published or sold, or even from being read. This paper will examine such cases in Germany and Japan in the 18th century. These texts challenged the ethical norms of their societies, which were based on the authority of the Enlightenment and Christianity and of the Shogunate, respectively. In particular, Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther and Chikamatsu Monzaemon's Sonezaki Shinju, iconic works of the two countries in the 18th century, led to an increase in cases of the social phenomenon of suicide. Criticism of the role these texts played in inspiring these acts and of what was viewed as their unethical contents helped rather than hindered their success, and this demonstrates that the officially-sanctioned ethics of the day and the desire of ordinary readers were in a relationship of mutual tension, and that the differentiation of the two countries' reading cultures from ethical codes was progressing. The study of the widespread social phenomena related to reading books which were seen as illegitimate in Germany and Japan is an important basis for research into the relationship between the reading culture of the 18th century and the ethical codes of the day, specifically as this evolution relates to social modernization.

AB Poison information centers have observed an increasing number of cases of acute carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication.
   Determination of the incidence and mortality, discussion of effects and clinical signs and presentation of treatment recommendations.
   The official statistics as well as remarkable cases reported in the news are analyzed. Basic literature and expert opinions are discussed.
   In 2009 and 2010 fatalities due to CO increased by about 30% in Germany. New types of exposition, such as suicide by charcoal burning were numerous. The assessment of CO poisoning includes the level of consciousness and measurement of CO-hemoglobin (CO-Hb) saturation. A high partial pressure of oxygen is required for treatment. The effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen remains unclear but may be assumed in cases of severe poisoning. Hyperbaric chambers are not continuously available (24/7) throughout Germany.
   A CO poisoning emergency yields new threats and challenges for emergency staff. To ensure the correct diagnosis and to determine the appropriate treatment, a blood sample should be taken immediately. Pulse CO oximeters facilitate the early triage of even larger numbers of patients. Sufficient oxygenation is essential. Severely poisoned patients should be admitted for hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

AB Comparing two public medical affairs which involved disciplinary proceedings and libel actions, one from Bavaria and one from Prussia, this article analyzes the dynamics behind legal conflicts over doctors' professional ethics in Imperial Germany. In both the case of Dr Maurice Hutzler. who committed suicide after conflicts with senior colleagues at the Gisela Children's Hospital and a sentence of the court of honour of the Munich Medical District Society, and the Berlin "patient trade" affair, in which the medical professors Ernst von Leyden, Hermann Senator, Karl Anton Ewald and Carl Posner were accused of having made payments to middlemen for bringing them lucrative private patients, notions of personal and professional honour played a central role. The Munich case highlighted shortcomings of the Bavarian medical court of honour system, which was less developed than its Prussian counterpart. The analysis of the two cases suggests that the ethics of medical practice in early twentieth-century Germany should be viewed as part of a culture of honour.

AB Background: There have been only a few reports illustrating the moderate effectiveness of suicide-preventive interventions in reducing suicidal behavior, and, in most of those studies, the target populations were primarily adults, whereas few focused on adolescents. Essentially, there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and cultural adaptability of suicide-prevention strategies in schools. There is also a lack of information on whether suicide-preventive interventions can, in addition to preventing suicide, reduce risk behaviors and promote healthier ones as well as improve young people's mental health.
   The aim of the SEYLE project, which is funded by the European Union under the Seventh Framework Health Program, is to address these issues by collecting baseline and follow-up data on health and well-being among European adolescents and compiling an epidemiological database; testing, in a randomized controlled trial, three different suicide-preventive interventions; evaluating the outcome of each intervention in comparison with a control group from a multidisciplinary perspective; as well as recommending culturally adjusted models for promoting mental health and preventing suicidal behaviors.
   Methods and design: The study comprises 11,000 adolescents emitted from randomized schools in 11 European countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden serving as the scientific coordinating center. Each country performs three active interventions and one minimal intervention as a control group. The active interventions include gatekeeper training (QPR), awareness training on mental health promotion for adolescents, and screening for at-risk adolescents by health professionals. Structured questionnaires are utilized at baseline, 3- and 12-month follow-ups in order to assess changes.
   Discussion: Although it has been reported that suicide-preventive interventions can be effective in decreasing suicidal behavior, well-documented and randomized studies are lacking. The effects of such interventions in terms of combating unhealthy lifestyles in young people, which often characterize suicidal individuals, have never been reported. We know that unhealthy and risk-taking behaviors are detrimental to individuals' current and future health. It is, therefore, crucial to test well-designed, longitudinal mental health-promoting and suicide-preventive interventions by evaluating the implications of such activities for reducing unhealthy and risk behaviors while concurrently promoting healthy ones.

AB ObjectivesTo report worldwide trends in suicidemortality during a period that covers 7years after the 2008 global crisis.MethodsWe performed a time trend analysis with joinpoint regression.ResultsOver the 2000s, suicide mortality decreased with the largest declines observed in some Eastern European countries. The downward trends were followed by an increase in concomitance with the 2008 global crisis in some countries, including Greece (annual percentage change=+6 in men and +11.8 in women), the Netherlands (+4.2 in men and +4.0 in women), and the UK (+1.6 in men), while the pre-crisis downward trends stopped in Germany, Italy, and Spain. The joinpoint analysis also revealed long-term rises in Brazil (+0.8 since 1990 in men and +1.8 since 1999 in women), Mexico (+1.3 since 1995 in men and +3.6 since 1990 in women), the USA (+1.7 since 2005 in men and +4.2 since 2010 in women), and Australia (+1.8 in men and +3.7 in women, since 2006 in both sexes).ConclusionsDespite downward trendsin several areas of the world, in some countries suicide rates increased since the 2008 global crisis.

AB Due to increasing immigration in Germany the German Mental Health Care System today has to deal in a growing number with the assessment of the level of psychic functioning and the capability of self control in patients of different ethnic origin. For clinicians this is a challenge, since suicidal behaviour in terms of its frequency, meaning, motives and manner is very much dependent on the cultural context in which it occurs. Moreover, the general attitude of an individual towards suicide is embedded in the culture of origin of the immigrant. Until now there has been only little systematic research on the influence of culture on suicidal behaviour. In this review the traditions of suicidal behaviour in different cultures in their religious and historical dimensions will be reflected. The historical and cultural roots of suicidal behaviour will be put in context to a categorization of the different variants of suicide, such as institutionalized suicide versus individualized suicide. Psychodynamic aspects of suicidal ideation will be highlighted in cross-cultural perspective with a distinction between a. the wish to die, b. the wish to kill and c. the wish to be killed. It will be shown that there can be differentiated between accepted and non-accepted suicide. With respect to epidemiology there will be discussed the impact of culture on the suicide rates across cultures. The influence of culture on the psychopathology of suicidal behaviour will be summed up systematically.These aspects are of high relevance for the understanding and assessment of suicidal crisis in immigrants, since the suicidal patient even today- although subconsciously - is influenced by the deep rooted traditions of suicidal behaviour in his culture of origin.

AB Background: Mental health consequences of migration are manifold. Where some migrants experience migration as liberation from life threatening conditions, others suffer from hostility and social descent in the target country. This study investigates deaths due to external causes, suicides, and events of undetermined intent in German repatriates from the Former Soviet Union. The relation between age at migration and suicide mortality is also explored.
   Methods: A cohort of German repatriates who migrated between 1990 and 1999 was followed-up until 2010. Each individual accumulated time at risk, expressed in person years (PY). Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated, supplemented by subgroup analyses for age and calendar year strata, and immigration period. Multivariate Poisson models were used to investigate the influence of age, sex, calendar year, number of moves, and final move distance.
   Results: A total of 6378 German repatriates (3031 men, 3347 women) accumulated 92149 PY. Median age at immigration was 30 years in women and 27 years in men. Women's all-cause mortality was significantly lower (SMR = 0.85 [0.75; 0.97]). Men more often died from external causes (SMR = 1.58 [1.09; 2.231), intentional self-harm (SMR = 1.68 [0.90; 2.881), and events of undetermined intent such as poisoning by drugs (SMR = 8.07 [4.02; 14.44]). External cause mortality was significantly increased after 1995 (SMR = 1.87). In particular, men who migrated when they were 11-20 years old were at strongly increased risk of committing suicide (SMR = 3.84) or dying due to events of undetermined intent (SMR = 14.75).
   Conclusion: The most endangered subgroup is men who migrated at teenage age. Protective factors such as strong family bounds formerly present in the FSU failed in Germany, the higher population density caused intense friction. The changes in the families' ethnical composition from mostly ethnic German members in the early 90s' towards predominantly Russian members around the turn of the millennium complicated integration. Setting-oriented prevention measures should consider the families' migration history, their link to culture and religion, and the different concepts of mental health. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB To examine the pattern and trend of deaths due to external causes among Polish children and adolescents in 1999-2012, and to compare trends in Poland's neighboring countries.
   Death records were obtained from the Central Statistical Office of Poland. External causes mortality rates (MR) with 95 % confidence interval were calculated. The annual percentage change of MR was examined using linear regression. To compare MR with Belarus, Ukraine, Czech Republic and Germany, data from the European Mortality Database were used.
   MR were the highest in the age 15-19 years (33.7/100,000) and among boys (22.7/100,000). Unintentional injuries including transport accidents, drowning, and suicides (especially in children over 10 years old), were the main cause of death in the analyzed groups. Between 1999 and 2012 annual MR for unintentional injuries declined substantially. MR due to injuries and poisoning in Poland were higher compared with Czech Republic and Germany and lower in comparison with Belarus and Ukraine.
   Deaths due to unintentional injuries are still the leading cause of death among Polish children and adolescents. There are differences in death rates between Poland and neighboring countries.

AB Background: Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are serious but not rare conditions in adolescents. However, there are several research and practical suicide-prevention initiatives that discuss the possibility of preventing serious self-harm. Profound knowledge about risk and protective factors is therefore necessary. The aim of this study is a) to clarify the role of parenting behavior and parenting styles in adolescents' suicide attempts and b) to identify other statistically significant and clinically relevant risk and protective factors for suicide attempts in a representative sample of German adolescents.
   Methods: In the years 2007/2008, a representative written survey of N = 44,610 students in the 9th grade of different school types in Germany was conducted. In this survey, the lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts was investigated as well as potential predictors including parenting behavior. A three-step statistical analysis was carried out: I) As basic model, the association between parenting and suicide attempts was explored via binary logistic regression controlled for age and sex. II) The predictive values of 13 additional potential risk/protective factors were analyzed with single binary logistic regression analyses for each predictor alone. Non-significant predictors were excluded in Step III. III) In a multivariate binary logistic regression analysis, all significant predictor variables from Step II and the parenting styles were included after testing for multicollinearity.
   Results: Three parental variables showed a relevant association with suicide attempts in adolescents - (all protective): mother's warmth and father's warmth in childhood and mother's control in adolescence (Step I). In the full model (Step III), Authoritative parenting (protective: OR: .79) and Rejecting-Neglecting parenting (risk: OR: 1.63) were identified as significant predictors (p < .001) for suicidal attempts. Seven further variables were interpreted to be statistically significant and clinically relevant: ADHD, female sex, smoking, Binge Drinking, absenteeism/truancy, migration background, and parental separation events.
   Conclusions: Parenting style does matter. While children of Authoritative parents profit, children of Rejecting-Neglecting parents are put at risk - as we were able to show for suicide attempts in adolescence. Some of the identified risk factors contribute new knowledge and potential areas of intervention for special groups such as migrants or children diagnosed with ADHD.

AB A number of health outcomes were affected by previous financial crises, e. g. suicides, homicides and transport accident mortality. Aim of this study was to analyse the effects of the current financial crisis on selected health outcomes at population level in Europe. Methods: A mixed approach of ecologic and time trend design was applied, including correlation analysis. For eight countries, data on the economic situation (unemployment rate and economic growth) and health indicators (overall mortality, suicide and transport accident mortality) was drawn from EUROSTAT database for 2000-10. Spearman's rank correlation was applied to analyse the influence of social protection on the association between exposure and outcome variables. Results: The financial crisis had no visible effect on overall mortality in any of the eight countries until 2010. Transport accident mortality decreased in all eight countries, in the range of 18% in Portugal to 52% in Slovenia. In contrast, suicide mortality increased in Germany (+5.3%), Portugal (+5.2%), Czech Republic (+7.6%), Slovakia (+22.7%) and Poland (+19.3%). The effect of unemployment on suicide is higher in countries with lower social spending (Spearman's r = -0.83). Discussion: Clear cause-effect relations could not be established owing to the ecological study design and issues concerning data availability. However, there are clear changes in suicide and transport accident mortality after onset of the crisis, and findings are consistent with previous work. As part of this work, a comprehensive framework was developed, which can be applied to analyse health effects of financial crises in more detail.

DT Review
DE Euthanasia; Assisted suicide; Legal liability; Europe
ID OF-LIFE PRACTICES; CHILDREN; TRENDS
AB INTRODUCTION: End-of-life legislation, because of its bioethical, medico-legal, and judicial implications, is heatedly disputed in Europe and throughout the world, engendering a variety of legal end-of-life care options in different countries. We thought it could be interesting to compare the Italian law with current European legislation regulating end-of-life matters.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic search of the Medline, Cochrane Central, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases was conducted using the search words: "euthanasia", "law", "Europe", and "assisted suicide". The search word "euthanasia" was entered singly or in combination with each of the other search terms.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: To date, only three countries in Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) have legalized euthanasia, and four countries (Switzerland, France, Austria, Germany) permit only assisted suicide. Acceptance by the general public of euthanasia and assisted suicide increased in 11 of 13 European countries between 1981 and 2008, in parallel with a decrease in religiosity (except for Italy and Holland) and an increase in secularization. There was also a trend toward a correlation between an increase of the value of self-determination in important life issues and an increase in acceptance of euthanasia.
   CONCLUSIONS: This review shows that end-of-life decisions constitute a challenge for political governance and bioethical deliberation in modern liberal democracies. It appears that in certain situations, euthanasia is perceived more as a means to reduce health care costs rather than an ethical question regarding self-determination.

ID HOMICIDE
AB Although it was predicted that there would be an increase in the use of black powder guns due to their greater ease of procurement with less government control on sales, this does not seem to have been the general experience. To determine the rate of use of black powder handguns in shooting deaths in Berlin, Germany, review of the files of the Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin was conducted over a 10-year period from 1997 to 2006. Out of total 85 gunshot deaths, there were only 3 where black powder handguns were used (3.5%). The cases involved 3 males aged 55, 62, and 63 years, respectively, all of whom had committed suicide with black powder percussion handguns, using 0.45, 0.56, and 0.36 caliber weapons. The source of the guns could not be determined. Wounds were characterized by excessive soot and propellant soiling and tattooing. The low number of fatalities involving black powder guns in a large forensic institution in Berlin, Germany, suggests that limiting access to such weapons would have little effect on total numbers of gunshot deaths. Simple loading mechanisms and reliability appear to be more important features influencing the choice of a handgun, rather than mere availability.

AB This report demonstrates how carbon dioxide (CO2) may be a potent weapon in murder-suicide, where the death scene offers virtually no clues as to the lethal modality and the autopsy findings are nonspecific. Four bodies were discovered in an apartment in midsummer 2012 in Berlin, Germany. The bodies were those of a father (a 69-year-old business consultant), his wife (aged 26-years), and two sons (aged 3 and 6 years, respectively). The police found the wife and two sons lying in their beds and the husband in a supine position on the floor with a plastic bag over his head tied loosely around his neck with a rope. A 500 g single-use CO2 cylinder was standing on the floor. The container was almost empty and according to the label had been sold as a CO2-fertilizer for aquarium plants. Two synthetic inhalation face masks and tubing were also found, which tested positive for the DNA of all four deceased family members. It is hypothesized that the husband placed an inhalation mask over the mouths and noses of his wife and children while they were sleeping. Inhalation of pure CO2 ensured their rapid unconsciousness due to hypercapnia and severe anoxia. The rapid increase in CO2 concentration would render a victim helpless, with no time to wake and defend themselves, or others. The proximate cause of death in all cases was attributed to CO2 intoxication, based on the scene findings, the reconstructed sequence of events, the autopsy, and results of toxicological studies.

AB The current debate about end-of-life decisions in Germany focuses on physician-assisted suicide (PAS). However, there is only limited information available on physicians' attitudes towards euthanasia or PAS, and no data on nurses' attitudes.
   The aim is to explore attitudes of physicians and nurses with a special interest in palliative care and pain medicine using a case-related questionnaire.
   An anonymous questionnaire, consisting of eight questions, was distributed to all participants of a palliative care congress and a pain symposium. The questions focused on two scenarios: (1) a patient with an incurable fatal illness, (2) a patient with an incurable but nonfatal illness. The question was: Should euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (PAS) be allowed. In addition, the participants were asked what they wanted for themselves if they were the patient concerned.
   A total of 317 questionnaires were analyzed; the return rate was 70 %. The general support for euthanasia and PAS was high: 40.5 % supported euthanasia in case of a fatal illness ("definitelyaEuro broken vertical bar aEuroe, "probably should be allowed"), 53.5 % supported PAS. The support decreased in case of a nonfatal illness; however, it increased when the participants were asked about their attitudes if they were the patient concerned. Nurses were more open towards euthanasia and PAS. In physicians the rejection of PAS was directly related to a higher level of qualification in the field of palliative care.
   The fact that nurses had a more positive attitude towards euthanasia and PAS and that all respondents accepted life-ending acts for themselves more than for their patients hints to still existing severe deficits in Germany.

AB Background: While several population-based studies report that pain is independently associated with higher rates of self-destructive behaviour (suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and self-injurious behaviour) in adults, studies in adolescents are rare and limited to specific chronic pain conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the link between self-reported idiopathic pain and the prevalence and frequency of self-injury (SI) and suicide attempts in adolescents.
   Methods: Data from a cross-sectional, school-based sample was derived to assess SI, suicide attempts, recurrent pain symptoms and various areas of emotional and behavioural problems via a self-report booklet including the Youth Self-Report (YSR). Adolescents were assigned to two groups (presence of pain vs. no pain) for analysis. Data from 5,504 students of 116 schools in a region of South Western Germany was available. A series of unadjusted and adjusted multinomial logistic regression models were performed to address the association of pain, SI, and suicide attempts.
   Results: 929 (16.88%) respondents reported recurrent pain in one of three areas of pain symptoms assessed (general pain, headache, and abdominal pain). Adolescents who reported pain also reported greater psychopathological distress on all sub-scales of the YSR. The presence of pain was significantly associated with an increased risk ratio (RR) for SI (1-3 incidences in the past year: RR: 2.96; >3 incidences: RR: 6.04) and suicide attempts (one attempt: RR: 3.63; multiple attempts: RR: 5.4) in unadjusted analysis. Similarly, increased RR was observed when adjusting for sociodemographic variables. While controlling for psychopathology attenuated this association, it remained significant (RRs: 1.4-1.8). Sub-sequent sensitivity analysis revealed different RR by location and frequency of pain symptoms.
   Conclusions: Adolescents with recurrent idiopathic pain are more likely to report previous incidents of SI and suicide attempts. This association is likely mediated by the presence of psychopathological distress as consequence of recurrent idiopathic pain. However, the observed variance in dependent variables is only partially explained by emotional and behavioural problems. Clinicians should be aware of these associations and interview adolescents with recurrent symptoms of pain for the presence of self-harm, past suicide attempts and current suicidal thoughts. Future studies addressing the neurobiology underpinnings of an increased likelihood for self-injurious behaviour and suicide attempts in adolescents with recurrent idiopathic pain are necessary.

AB Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may be associated with the wish to hasten death (WTHD). We aimed to determine the prevalence and stability of WTHD and end-of-life attitudes in ALS patients, identify predictive factors, and explore communication about WTHD. We conducted a prospective questionnaire study among patients and their primary caregivers attending ALS clinics in Germany and Switzerland. We enrolled 66 patients and 62 caregivers. Half of the patients could imagine asking for assisted suicide or euthanasia; 14% expressed a current WTHD at the baseline survey. While 75% were in favour of non-invasive ventilation, only 55% and 27% were in favour of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and invasive ventilation, respectively. These attitudes were stable over 13 months. The WTHD was predicted by depression, anxiety, loneliness, perceiving to be a burden to others, and a low quality of life (all p < 0.05). Lower religiosity predicted whether patients could imagine assisted suicide or euthanasia. Two-thirds of patients had communicated their WTHD to relatives; no-one talked to the physician about it, yet half of them would like to do so. In conclusion, physicians should consider proactively asking for WTHD, and be sensitive towards neglected psychosocial problems and psychiatric comorbidity.

AB A third of the elderly population dies with dementia. This poses major and partly unmet needs on relatives, professional carers and medical specialists. Our review summarizes epidemiological risk factors for the increased mortality in demented patients (age, somatic comorbidity, neuropsychiatric symptoms), current practice (place of death, decision making, complications, medical treatment, course of dying, cause of death, suicide, bereaved relatives), and instruments for the assessment of pain, burden, prognosis and treatment planning in the terminal stage of illness. We describe the current legal situation in Germany and present a brief outline of practical management issues. We also list a number of areas offering leeway for improvement regarding research, training, psycho-education, preparation, diagnosis, treatment and support.

AB Background: Community facilitators (CFs), such as teachers, nurses and social workers, are well placed as gatekeepers for depression and suicidal behavior, but not properly prepared to provide preventive and supportive services. The current study aimed: (1) to improve CFs' attitudes toward depression, knowledge on suicide, and confidence to detect suicidal behavior in four European countries and (2) to identify specific training needs across regions and CF groups.
   Methods: A standardized training program was provided to 1276 CFs in Germany, Hungary, Ireland, and Portugal. Attitudes toward depression, knowledge about suicide, and confidence in identifying suicidal persons were assessed before training, after training, and at three to six months follow-up. Additionally, several participants' characteristics were registered.
   Results: At baseline, CFs showed relatively favorable attitudes toward depression, but limited knowledge on suicide, and little confidence to identify suicidal behavior. Basic skills strongly differed across CF groups and countries. For example, in Germany, carers for the elderly, nurses, teachers, and managers were most in need of training, while in Portugal pharmacists and the clergy appeared to be important target groups. Most importantly, the training program improved the competencies of CF groups across countries and these improvements were sustained after three to six months. CFs with low basic skills benefited most of the training.
   Limitations: The observed training effects could be influenced by other external factors as our results are based upon a pre-post comparison with no control group.
   Conclusions: Gatekeeper trainings in community settings are successful in improving knowledge, reshaping attitudes, and boosting the confidence of gatekeepers. The most effective strategy to achieve the preferred objectives is to target those CF groups that are most in need of training and to tailor the content of the training program to the individual needs of the target group.

AB Unipolar depressive disorders in adolescence are common, lead to serious impairments and are often associated with comorbid disorders and a high risk for suicide. Thus, recognition and early treatment of depressive disorders are important. International and national treatment guidelines show that effective treatment approaches for prevention and acute therapy of depressive disorders are available. Based on current evidence and consensus-based guidelines, such as the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF) S3 treatment guidelines for unipolar depressive disorders in children and adolescents, state of the art diagnostic procedures and treatment recommendations are proposed. Diagnostic procedures and differential diagnoses as well as differential indications and treatment planning are reported in detail. In the treatment section the focus is on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which is currently the best evaluated psychological treatment form for depressive disorders in children and adolescents.

TI Euthanasia: A historical review of meanings, ideas and practices
SO ARCHIVES OF HELLENIC MEDICINE
LA Greek
DT Review
DE Bioethics; End-of-life dilemmas; Euthanasia; Suicide
ID PERSPECTIVES; SUICIDE
AB The word euthanasia first appeared during the Hellenistic era. Greek and Latin writers used it in a sense quite different from the modern usage, referring to the serene death that seals a virtuous life, the heroic death on the battlefield or for the defense of supreme ideals, the death that comes at the right time, and the non-tortuous death. In the 17th century, it was transported into English by Bacon to describe the painless death that is accomplished by the application of medical means of pain relief. In the 18th century, Eugene Voulgaris considered it to be the endurance of death with bravery and placidity. It is only at the end of the 19th century that it acquired the specific meaning with which it is used today, i.e., the active acceleration of death by medical intervention, in patients suffering from incurable, agonizing illnesses. Although not named as such, practices similar to contemporary euthanasia have been testified since antiquity (Kea, Marseilles, Sparta), while the theoretical debate on voluntary suicide in old age, disability or sickness is timeless. The Hippocratic Oath, reflecting Pythagorean beliefs, explicitly forbids euthanasia, either as the administration of a lethal substance by the physician to terminate the patient's life, or as physician-assisted suicide. Plato, Aristotle, the Christian Fathers, and Kant categorically rejected suicide, which, conversely, was supported, under certain conditions, by some of the Stoics and Hume. The demand for euthanasia, in the modern meaning of the word, emerged in the 1870s in the United States of America and England. In Germany, the Nazi regime used the term "euthanasia" euphemistically to name a eugenics program of forced killing of patients suffering from incurable illnesses, and mentally retarded, disabled, psychotic, and even elderly people.

AB The need to regulate physician-assisted suicide (PAS) and organizations offering assisted suicide has been controversially debated in Germany. Before the German parliament voted on various drafts in November 2015, the German Association for Palliative Medicine surveyed its members on their attitudes and experiences regarding PAS.
   Items for the survey were derived from the literature and consented in a focus group. Literature search: 2005-2015 - PubMed: PAS [Title/Abstract] UND survey (all countries), grey literature. We invited 5152 members of the DGP to participate in the online/paper survey. Descriptive quantitative and content analytic qualitative analysis of data using SPSS and MaxQDA.
   We obtained 1811 valid data sets (response rate 36.9%). 33.7% of the participants were male, 43.6% were female, and 0.4% identifed as other. Physicians accounted for 48.5% of the respondents, 17.8% nurses, other professions 14.3%, and about 20% of the data was missing socio-demographic information.
   More than 90% agreed that "wishes for PAS may be ambivalent" and "are rather a wish to end an unbearable situation". Of the 833 participating physicians, 56% refused participating in PAS and 74.2% had been asked to perform PAS. PAS was actually performed by 3%. Of all participating members, 56% approved of a legal ban of organizations offering assisted suicide. More than 60% of all professions agreed that PAS is not a part of palliative care.
   The respondents show a broad spectrum of attitudes, only partly supporting statements of relevant bodies, such as DGP. Because many are confronted with the issue, PAS is relevant to professionals in palliative care.

AB Although in recent years many efforts have been made in suicide prevention, suicidal ideation in prison is still a major problem. The present study is part of a project being carried out in Saxony, Germany on the investigation and prevention of suicide in prisons.
   The aim of this study was to determine whether the duration of imprisonment, personality traits and personality disorders have an influence on the suicidal ideation of prisoners.
   In this study 113 volunteers among prisoners from 6 prisons in Saxony participated in a structured interview and filled out several questionnaires on sociodemographic details, personality using the personality style and disorder inventory (PSSI) and the assessment of DSM-IV personality disorders (ADP-IV) questionnaire as well as attitudes towards suicide using the questionnaire on stressful social experiences (FBS) and the Viennese instrument for suicidality on correctional institutions (VISCI).
   Significant correlations were found between personality traits and personality disorders and suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. A positive correlation was also found between personality disorders and scores in the VISCI. High scores in the PSSI were correlated with all aspects of suicidal ideation; however, length of time spent in prison and total duration of imprisonment appeared to have little impact on suicide parameters and were only correlated with the self-declared current suicidal ideation.
   Although there were some limitations, this study could confirm data in the literature that personality disorders are associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation in prisoners. The lack of association of suicidal thoughts as measured in this study with the total time spent in prison and duration of imprisonment is in contradiction to the results of other studies and warrants further investigation.

AB Background Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for 14-20% of suicides worldwide. Regulation aimed at restricting access to pesticides or banning highly hazardous pesticides is one approach to reducing these deaths. We systematically reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness of pesticide regulation in reducing the incidence of pesticide suicides and overall suicides.
   Methods We did a systematic review of the international evidence. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase for studies published between Jan 1, 1960, and Dec 31, 2016, which investigated the effect of national or regional bans, and sales or import restrictions, on the availability of one or more pesticides and the incidence of suicide in different countries. We excluded other interventions aimed at limiting community access to pesticides. We extracted data from studies presenting pesticide suicide data and overall suicide data from before and after national sales restrictions. Two reviewers independently assessed papers for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We undertook a narrative synthesis of the data in each report, and where data were available for the years before and after a ban, we pooled data for the 3 years before and the 3 years after to obtain a crude estimate of the effect of the ban. This study is registered through PROSPERO, number CRD42017053329.
   Findings We identified 27 studies undertaken in 16 countries-five low-income or middle-income countries (Bangladesh, Colombia, India, Jordan and Sri Lanka), and 11 high-income countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, UK, and USA). Assessments largely focused on national bans of specific pesticides (12 studies of bans in six countries-Jordan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Greece [ Crete], South Korea, and Taiwan) or sales restrictions (eight studies of restrictions in five countries-India, Denmark, Ireland, the UK and the USA). Only five studies used optimum analytical methods. National bans on commonly ingested pesticides in five of the six countries studied, including four studies using optimum analytical methods, were followed by reductions in pesticide suicides and, in three of these countries, falls in overall suicide mortality. Greece was the only country studied that did not show a decrease in pesticide suicide following a ban. There were no high-quality studies of restricting sales to people for occupational uses; four of the seven studies (in three of the five countries studied-India, Denmark, and the USA) showed sales restrictions were followed by decreases in pesticide suicides; one of the two studies investigating trends in overall suicide mortality reported a fall in deaths in Denmark, but there were also decreases in suicide deaths from other methods.
   Interpretation National bans on highly hazardous pesticides, which are commonly ingested in acts of self-poisoning, seem to be effective in reducing pesticide-specific and overall suicide rates. Evidence is less consistent for sales restrictions. A worldwide ban on the use of highly hazardous pesticides is likely to prevent tens of thousands of deaths every year. Copyright (C) The Author(s).

ID EUTHANASIA
AB Whereas changes to the existing legal situation regarding assisted suicide have been a topic of controversial debate in Germany for the last few years, this issue has long been of interest for international film-makers. Since the mid-1980s, the theme of assisted suicide has repeatedly been taken up by cinema, predominantly as central to a relationship drama. A sick person asks somebody close to them for help. Often this somebody is a physician or a nurse, ultimately an obvious way of solving the practical problem of how the assistant is to gain access to a lethal substance. At the same time, this constellation enables a physician or nurse to be forced into a dramatic conflict between professional ethics and a personal obligation towards a loved one.
   Alongside more classic clinical pictures such as terminal cancer, recent films about assisted suicide have featured neurodegenerative diseases and physical disabilities. Another new development is that elderly patients are no longer alone in requesting assistance; films also and increasingly portray young adults. Besides a fear of unbearable pain, more recent films have also increasingly addressed the worry that permanent nursing might be required, as well as the subjectively experienced loss of dignity. The possibilities offered by palliative care hardly play a role in feature films. However, we should not forget, that movies are fictional and orchestrated, or, in other words, they are neither educational nor documental. They neither need nor want to portray reality, although they do wish to draw upon real experiences. They exploit highly emotional and ethically controversial themes to create tensions and stir up emotions in the audience, but ultimately they seek to entertain. Movies about death and dying are always "die-tainment".

AB Worldwide, many people are exposed to biannual time changes. The benefit of Daylight Saving Time (DST) is controversially discussed and its impact on human health is largelyunknown. The present study examines, whether effects of these time changes are seen in a forensic autopsy database. The mortality study is based on autopsy protocols provided by the Institute of Legal Medicine, University Clinic of the Goethe-University Frankfurt/Main, covering a period of 10years (2006-2015). Data regarding mode and cause of death, age, and gender were evaluated for 4weeks around the transition to and from DST in spring and autumn. A significant (p=0.04) elevation in the number of autopsies was observed in the first week following the switch to DST in spring, but no significant changes were noted in autumn. Gender-specific analysis indicated that the autopsy rate of females showed a significant (p=0.01) peak in the first and a decline (p=0.05) in the second week following the switch to DST. Differences in non-natural death cases primarily included traffic accidents and suicides, in natural death cases fatal cardiac diseases like cardiac insufficiency and acute myocardial infarction. The number of suicides was low (p=0.05) before, but high (p=0.07) in the weeks after the introduction of DST. The present evaluation confirmed a potential effect of DST, such as a significant higher autopsy rate in spring during the first week after the introduction to DST. Moreover, a relation between the introduction to DST in spring and an increase in suicide cases was observed.

AB Eighty years ago, preventive detention for dangerous offenders was implemented in the German Penal Code (Section 66). In 2011, about 500 individuals were incarcerated under a preventive detention order in Germany. Through semi-structured clinical interviews and/or collateral file review, the present investigators assessed the sociobiographic, criminological, and clinical characteristics of 58 men for whom preventive detention had been ordered in two German federal states. In addition, risk assessment instruments were administered. The majority of the inmates were sexual offenders. The main mental health problems were antisocial personality disorder (APD), substance abuse/disorder, and paraphilias. Most individuals had a history of poor socialization. Structured clinical judgment as well as actuarial risk assessment instruments identified all inmates as high-risk offenders. Future development of preventive detention in Germany must emphasize treatment interventions. Given the life histories and the mental health problems of the detainees assessed in the present study, the implementation of effective treatment will prove difficult.

AB Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) a widespread neurotropic parasite, has been previously associated with schizophrenia and more recently with suicidal behavior. However, no previous study has examined the association of T. gondii with suicidal behavior in schizophrenia patients. 950 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia by SCID were recruited from the Munich area of Germany. Solid-enzyme immunoassay methods were used to measure IgG plasma antibodies to T. gondii, other neurotropic pathogens and gliadin. Logistic regression models were developed to analyze the association of T. gondii seropositivity or serointensity with history of suicidal behavior. In those younger than the median age of the sample, 38, T. gondii serointensity was associated with history of suicidal behavior (p = 0.02), while in the older patients the relationship was not significant (p = 0.21). Seropositivity was also associated with history of suicide attempt in younger patients, odds ratio 1.59 (95% CI 1.06 to 2.40), p = 0.03. Seropositivity for CMV (p = 0.22), HSV-1 (p = 0.36) and gliadin (p = 0.92) was not related to history of suicide attempt in the entire sample or any age subgroup. T. gondii serology might become, with interaction with vulnerability genes, a candidate biomarker for a subgroup of schizophrenia patients prone to attempting suicide. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB While Nazism is almost universally recognized as a great evil, control of science and medicine by the totalitarian Nazi state might be viewed as increasing efficiency. Scientific methods are applied to semiquantitatively analyze the effects of Nazism on medical progress in gastroenterology to document its pernicious effects, and to honor outstanding gastroenterologists persecuted or murdered by the Nazis. This is a retrospective, quasi-case-controlled study. To disprove the null hypothesis that Nazism was efficient, retarded progress in gastroenterology is demonstrated by (1) enumerating the loss to Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1944 due to violent death, incarceration, or forced exile of key researchers in gastroenterology, defined by authorship of at least one book or 10 articles in peer-reviewed journals or other outstanding scholarship; (2) demonstrating a statistically significantly greater loss in Nazi Germany than in non-Nazi (Weimar German Republic from 1921 to 1932) or anti-Nazi (democratic America from 1933 to 1944) control groups; and (3) demonstrating that each loss was directly due to Nazism (murder, incarceration, or exile due to documented threat of violence/death or revocation of medical license). Sources of error in analyzing events from 70 years ago are described. Nazi Germany and Nazi-occupied Europe gained 0 and lost 53 key gastroenterology researchers, including 32 lost due to forced exile, 11 murdered by the Nazis, 5 lost due to suicide under threat of violence, 3 in hiding from the Gestapo, and 2 for other reasons. Fifty-two of the gastroenterologists were persecuted solely because they were Jewish or of Jewish descent and one because he was a Christian anti-Nazi Polish patriot. Particularly severe losses occurred in endoscopy. The loss in Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1944 was significantly greater than that in non-Nazi Germany and Austria from 1921 to 1932 (53 versus 4; odds ratio = 25.27; 95% CI: 9.01-70.48; P < 0.0001) and was significantly greater than that in anti-Nazi America from 1933 to 1944 (53 versus 0; odds ratio > 104.0; 95% CI: 17.62-608.95; P < 0.0001). Lost physicians in Nazi Germany (with reasons for loss) included Ismar Boas, the father of modern gastroenterology (suicide after medical license revoked); Hans Popper, the father of hepatopathology (fled impending arrest); Rudolph Nissen, the father of antireflux surgery (fled after job dismissal); Rudolph Schindler, the father of semiflexible endoscopy (fled after incarceration); Heinrich Lamm, the first to experimentally demonstrate fiberoptic transmission and the first to suggest its applicability for gastroscopy (fled after medical license revoked); Hermann Strauss, a pioneer in rigid sigmoidoscopy (suicide in a concentration camp); A.A.H. van den Bergh, who discovered the van den Bergh reaction to differentiate indirect from direct bilirubin (died in hiding in Nazi-occupied Holland); and Kurt Isselbacher, subsequently the Chief of Gastroenterology at Harvard Medical School (fled in childhood after a grandfather murdered by Nazis). All four refugee physicians who were reexposed to Nazi domination, after a regime change in their country of refuge, fled again or committed suicide. The Nazi damage to German and Austrian gastroenterology was immense, e.g., 13 of 14 major international discoveries in diagnostic gastroscopy were made by Germans or Austrians before the Third Reich, versus only 1 of 8 subsequently (odds ratio = 91; 95% CI: 3.58-13,877.61; P < 0.001).
   Eighteen (34%) of the persecuted physicians immigrated to America, thereby contriuting to the postwar flourishing of American gastroenterology, particularly gastrointestinal endoscopy. In conclusion, the Third Reich severely retarded and reversed medical progress in gastroenterology in Germany. The inefficiency of Nazism, as herein documented, is attributable to the Nazi commitment of so much human, economic, and social resources to the military to wage wars of aggression, to the secret police (Gestapo) to pursue and exterminate perceived internal enemies, and to the Party to control and regiment civil society. Most inefficient is the incarceration, exile, or murder of Germany's most trained physicians and talented researchers because of religion or race, sociological parameters that are irrelevant to productivity. Intimidation and repression stifle scientific scholarship and creativity. This work disproves the myth of the efficiency of Nazism, and like tyrannies, by the novel application of semiquantitative scientific methodology to assess causality in medical history.

   A previous suicide attempt was reported by 386 (3.6%) adolescents. Compared with non-migrants, first-generation migrants had an elevated prevalence of suicide attempts (odds ratio (OR) 2.08; 95% CI 1.32-3.26; P=0.001 for European migrants and OR 1.86; 95% CI 1.06-3.27; P=0.031 for nonEuropean migrants) and significantly higher levels of peer difficulties. Highest levels of conduct and hyperactivity problems were found among migrants of non-European origin.
   Conclusions
   Appropriate mental health services and school-based supports are required to meet the complex needs of migrant adolescents.

AB Aim: Psychiatry and Sociology have followed separate avenues in Germany since the mid 1970 s. The aim of this work is to investigate their present relationship by means of an analysis of a scientific journal. Method: All original works dealing with social psychiatric subjects and appearing in Psychiatrische Praxis in the years 2002 and 2003 were analysed. Results: Sociologists appear to be a minority among the authors. Questions that are explicitly related to sociological theories were an exception, and sociological authors have hardly been quoted. Conclusion: Social psychiatric research in Germany is still conducted without Sociology. If social psychiatry is to gain in importance as a scientific discipline, closer cooperation with its mother discipline is imperative. As an example, the application of the rational choice theory in psychiatric research is discussed.

AB Some meta-analyses of randomized placebo-controlled trials on antidepressants conclude that there might be an increased risk for suicidal behaviour, especially in children and adolescents but also in adults. Placebo-controlled trials exclude patients with serious suicidality and might therefore underestimate the risk of respective adverse events. The change of suicidal ideation and the prevalence of suicides and non-fatal suicide attempts were therefore analysed in a large naturalistic prospective multicentre study of depressed in-patients. Additionally, specific risk factors for new emergence of suicidal ideation were investigated. The naturalistic prospective study was performed in 12 psychiatric hospitals of the German research network on depression and suicidality (seven psychiatric university hospitals and five district hospitals) in Germany. All patients (n = 1014) were hospitalized and had to meet DSM-fV criteria for major depressive disorder. Six events were defined for the purposes of statistical analysis: 'emergence', 'extended emergence', 'improvement' and 'worsening of suicidal ideation', 'suicide attempts' and 'suicides'. Logistic regression analysis and classification and regression trees (CART) analyses were conducted to determine specific risk factors for new emergence of suicidal ideation. The mean HAMD total score decreased from 24.8 at baseline to 10 after 10 wk. An effect on suicidality was evident by week 2 in the sense of a decrease of the mean HAMD item-3 score. Emergence, worsening and improvement of suicidal ideation occurred in 3.2%, 14.74% and 90.799% of patients, respectively. A total of 10 suicide attempts and two suicides were reported. The rate of suicides (13.44/1000 patient-years) was rather low and comparable to the rate observed in randomized controlled antidepressant trials. Five risk factors for emergence of suicidal ideation were determined with two independent statistical methods: age (with higher risk at age <45 yr), treatment resistance, number of hospitalizations, presence of akathisia and comorbid personality disorder. Age <45 yr as one of five risk factors for the emergence of suicidal ideation is in line with the meta-analysis performed for the recent US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) memorandum; although the naturalistic study design does not permit definite conclusions to be made about certain compounds. The rate of suicides was comparable to that seen in randomized controlled trials, as were the rates of emergence and worsening of suicidal ideation, but more improvement was found. Thus, in-patient treatment in a psychiatric care setting, including daily assessments of suicidality by trained psychiatrists adhering to the rules of good clinical practice (e.g. use of specific co-medications, supportive psychotherapy and continuous medical attendance by nursing staff) might be beneficial.

AB The suicidal attempt is a significant cause for multiple severe injuries in Germany. The aim of the present study was to obtain information regarding injury patterns, clinical treatment, and outcome.
   We analyzed the data of 4,754 patients of the Trauma Registry of the German Trauma Society (1993-2007) with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) a parts per thousand yen9 after a suicidal jump from a height (SUICIDE) and after an accidental fall from a height (ACCIDENT).
   Comparing the data of 3,682 patients with accidental fall versus those with intentional fall/jump (n = 1,072), we found that male patients were predominant in the ACCIDENT group (84.9 vs. 52.2%). The SUICIDE group had more severe injuries (ISS: 31.8 vs. 26.4). The ACCIDENT group suffered more severe head injuries (51.1 vs. 36.6%). Mortality (21.4 vs. 14.2%), length of stay in hospital (29.5 vs. 26.5 days), and costs (a,not sign34,833 vs. a,not sign24,701) were higher in the SUICIDE group.
   Falls from a height are a common cause of injury among severely injured patients. The resulting trauma composes a particular form of blunt trauma with severe and multiple injuries, which depends on the fact of whether the free fall from a height was caused by an accident or as a result of a suicidal attempt. Taking the injury severity into consideration, there is no difference in the prognosis of the patients.

TI Assisted Suicide in Switzerland An Analysis of Death Records From Swiss
   Institutes of Forensic Medicine
SO DEUTSCHES ARZTEBLATT INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: The aim of this research project, part of a program initiated by the Swiss Federal Council, was to trace the development of organized assisted suicide in Switzerland, starting from the very first case in 1985.
   Methods: Retrospective data on 3666 death records from Swiss institutes of forensic medicine for the years 1985 to 2014 were systematically compiled. read into a database, and for the most part quantitatively evaluated.
   Results: Alongside a marked increase in the overall number of assisted suicides since the turn of the century, the number of people traveling to Switzerland from other countries-predominantly Germany-for this purpose has risen steadily. The proportion of women was 60%, and the age at death ranged from 18 to 105 years (median 73). The largest diagnostic category was malignancy overall, neurological disease for those from other countries. The next largest category was age-related functional limitation, e.g., sensory impairment (loss of sight and hearing), the consequences of which were stated in writing as the reason for the wish to die. Following the Swiss Federal Court's promulgation of binding requirements in 2006. the documentation contained in the death records for the subsequent period up to 2014 is much more detailed, but still not uniform or even necessarily complete.
   Conclusion: The number of candidates for organized assisted suicide increased steadily during the study period, but no standard procedures were followed. The question therefore arises of whether further regulation or the introduction of a central registration office to maximize standardation and promote transparency would lead to improved quality assurance.

TI What Are Reasons for the Large Gender Differences in the Lethality of
   Suicidal Acts? An Epidemiological Analysis in Four European Countries
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CASE-FATALITY RATES; DEATHS; MULTICENTER; ALLIANCE; BEHAVIOR; STATES
AB Background
   In Europe, men have lower rates of attempted suicide compared to women and at the same time a higher rate of completed suicides, indicating major gender differences in lethality of suicidal behaviour. The aim of this study was to analyse the extent to which these gender differences in lethality can be explained by factors such as choice of more lethal methods or lethality differences within the same suicide method or age. In addition, we explored gender differences in the intentionality of suicide attempts.
   Methods and Findings
   Methods. Design: Epidemiological study using a combination of self-report and official data. Setting: Mental health care services in four European countries: Germany, Hungary, Ireland, and Portugal. Data basis: Completed suicides derived from official statistics for each country (767 acts, 74.4% male) and assessed suicide attempts excluding habitual intentional self-harm (8,175 acts, 43.2% male).
   Main Outcome Measures and Data Analysis. We collected data on suicidal acts in eight regions of four European countries participating in the EU-funded "OSPI-Europe"-project (www.ospi-europe.com). We calculated method-specific lethality using the number of completed suicides per method * 100 /(number of completed suicides per method + number of attempted suicides per method). We tested gender differences in the distribution of suicidal acts for significance by using the chi(2)-test for two-by-two tables. We assessed the effect sizes with phi coefficients (phi). We identified predictors of lethality with a binary logistic regression analysis. Poisson regression analysis examined the contribution of choice of methods and method-specific lethality to gender differences in the lethality of suicidal acts.
   Findings Main Results
   Suicidal acts (fatal and non-fatal) were 3.4 times more lethal in men than in women (lethality 13.91% (regarding 4106 suicidal acts) versus 4.05% (regarding 4836 suicidal acts)), the difference being significant for the methods hanging, jumping, moving objects, sharp objects and poisoning by substances other than drugs. Median age at time of suicidal behaviour (35-44 years) did not differ between males and females. The overall gender difference in lethality of suicidal behaviour was explained by males choosing more lethal suicide methods (odds ratio (OR) = 2.03; 95% CI = 1.65 to 2.50; p < 0.000001) and additionally, but to a lesser degree, by a higher lethality of suicidal acts for males even within the same method (OR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.32 to 2.02; p = 0.000005). Results of a regression analysis revealed neither age nor country differences were significant predictors for gender differences in the lethality of suicidal acts. The proportion of serious suicide attempts among all non-fatal suicidal acts with known intentionality (NFSAi) was significantly higher in men (57.1%; 1,207 of 2,115 NFSAi) than in women (48.6%; 1,508 of 3,100 NFSAi) (chi(2) = 35.74; p < 0.000001).
   Main limitations of the study
   Due to restrictive data security regulations to ensure anonymity in Ireland, specific ages could not be provided because of the relatively low absolute numbers of suicide in the Irish intervention and control region. Therefore, analyses of the interaction between gender and age could only be conducted for three of the four countries. Attempted suicides were assessed for patients presenting to emergency departments or treated in hospitals. An unknown rate of attempted suicides remained undetected. This may have caused an overestimation of the lethality of certain methods. Moreover, the detection of attempted suicides and the registration of completed suicides might have differed across the four countries. Some suicides might be hidden and misclassified as undetermined deaths.
   Conclusions
   Men more often used highly lethal methods in suicidal behaviour, but there was also a higher method-specific lethality which together explained the large gender differences in the lethality of suicidal acts. Gender differences in the lethality of suicidal acts were fairly consistent across all four European countries examined. Males and females did not differ in age at time of suicidal behaviour. Suicide attempts by males were rated as being more serious independent of the method used, with the exceptions of attempted hanging, suggesting gender differences in intentionality associated with suicidal behaviour. These findings contribute to understanding of the spectrum of reasons for gender differences in the lethality of suicidal behaviour and should inform the development of gender specific strategies for suicide prevention.

AB With costs of approximately 5.8 billion EUR annually, bipolar disorders represent a substantial burden on German society. The costs are mainly due to high indirect costs caused by morbidity-related unemployment, suicide-related losses of productivity, time off from work, and early retirement. Inpatient care, with a considerable average length of stay for patients with bipolar disorders, accounts for two-thirds of direct costs. This paper refers to statistics on use of healthcare services based primarily on the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. Representing a relatively narrow definition of bipolar disorders in comparison with the clinically relevant spectrum, this classification leads to a conservative estimate of the total costs. The significant lag between first acute episode and a correct diagnosis causes a delayed onset of maintenance treatment that leads to increased costs. Increasing public awareness, destigmatizing the disease, and educating physicians are necessary steps to limit the substantial economic burden for society.

AB Objective: Data on the prevalence of depressive disorders in adolescents are scarce. We aimed to examine the administrative prevalence of depressive disorders and related comorbidities in German adolescents. A second objective of was to assess potential regional (East vs. West Germany) differences in depression prevalence. Method: Data of a statutory health insurance company were analysed and outpatients from 12 to 18 years of age with diagnosed depression during a one-year-period (2009) were identified. Results: The population at risk consisted of 140,563 adolescents. Of these, 4,295 (41.2% male; mean age: 15.5 years) had a diagnosis of depression. This equates to a prevalence of 3.1% (females: 3.7%, males: 2.5%). There were no significant differences between East and West Germany. Of all adolescents with depression, 62.5% had at least one comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, with anxiety and emotional disorders (23.7%), somatoform disorders (16.8%), hyperkinetic disorders (16.2%) and posttraumatic stress disorder (10.0%) being most frequently diagnosed. Conclusions: The depression prevalence in this sample was lower than that in studies of clinical samples. There was a marked prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities, especially of internalizing disorders. In adolescents, the risk of depression seems to be comparable in both East and West Germany.

AB Background In Germany the discussion about euthanasia and physician assisted suicide is prevalent in the media. This study will analyse the way German newspapers represent the discussion about the end of life and how they report about palliative medicine. Methods A qualitative data analysis was performed of 433 articles published in the years 2006 and 2007 in different German newspapers. The archives of the selected newspapers were searched for "palliative medicine", "hospice", "patient's autonomy", "patient's will", "euthanasia" and "terminal care". Results Dignity, autonomy, inadequate provision of care and uncertainties were identified as the major topics in the debate about euthanasia. Dignity was used both as an argument for and against legislation of euthanasia. The terminology on euthanasia is not used consistently in Germany. Palliative medicine is described as a possible alternative to euthanasia which should be developed and reimbursed better. Conclusion These findings underline the importance of dignity and autonomy for the public opinion on the end of life. The media show the potential of palliative medicine as an alternative to euthanasia but claim further development of palliative care. The inconsistencies in terminology as well as in the content of end of life decisions have to be clarified to allow an objective discussion. Politicians and the medical profession should know about the public statements and opinions, to react adequately to patient's fears and allowances.

AB Among the many publishing ventures of the "Reichsinstitut fur die Geschichte des neuen Deutschlands," the journal Forschungen zur Judenfrage (1936-1944) has gained most notoriety. In its nine volumes, various aspects of the " Jewish question," ranging from the Jews in antiquity to Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, were dealt with from a strictly National Socialist point of view. The ambitious project proved to be a failure even before the Third Reich collapsed. While some of the journal's contributors managed to pursue their academic careers in post-war West Germany, its founder, Walter Frank, committed suicide in 1945.

AB Objective: Up to now psychotherapeutic treatment naturally is part of treatment strategies of mental hospitals and departments of psychiatry at general hospitals. Actually there is a controversial debate in this issue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the development of the utilization of these hospitals by patients with psychogenic disorders" in the new federal states of eastern Germany. Method: We studied the changes in the utilization in hospitals of psychiatry and psychotherapy in Thuringia 1993 up to 1999 by patients with ICD-9-diagnoses 300-1 and 306-9 and compared these data with these of other clinics in East and West Germany. Result: The utilization of psychotherapy patients increased in all hospitals. The increase in Thuringia was highest, in the other eastern German it was higher as in western clinics. Reasons of admissions for in-patient psychotherapeutic treatment were suicide ideations and attempts, aggression against others and prepsychotic agitation. Conclusions: These results can be seen as a sign of a similar necessity of this care in the eastern as in western population under similar psychosocial conditions.

ID SELF-HARM
AB Despite high suicide rates all over the world, complete decapitation as a consequence of violent suicide methods is exceptionally rare and there is always a potential for confusion with homicide as well as with body dismemberment or mutilation. We analyzed the phenomenology and morphology of 10 cases(six male, four female; individual age 18-60 years) of suicidal complete decapitation that were subjected to medico-legal autopsies at the Institute of Legal Medicine, University of Hamburg, Germany, between 1995 and 2002. All decapitations occurred while the person was alive as proven by signs of vitality. Blood alcohol levels were positive in five cases and ranged between 28 and 202 mg/dl. The applied methods of suicide were running over by a train in eight cases and hanging in two cases. In suicidal hanging resulting in complete decapitation the wound margins were clear-cut with an adjacent sharply demarcated circumferential band-like abrasion zone showing a homogenous width, the latter determined by the thickness of the rope. In decapitations due to railway interference a broad spectrum of pathologic alterations such as the co-existence of irregular, ragged and sharp-edged wound margins, vascular and nervous pathways forming bridges in the depth of the wound and bruising Could be observed. In such cases skin abrasion zones were generally not circumferential and showed a heterogenous width. Concerning hanging-related complete decapitations, our findings are well in line with those of other authors, namely that heavy body weight of the suicidal, fall from a great height and in some cases inelastic and/or thin rope material used for the noose are the determining factors decisive for complete decapitation.

AB Background. The global burden and large diagnostic and therapeutic deficits associated with depressive disorders call for intervention programs. The aim of the Nuremberg Alliance against Depression (NAD) is to establish and to assess the effectiveness of a four-level intervention program for improving the care of patients with depression.
   Method. A 2-year intervention program was performed in Nuremberg (480 000 inhabitants) at four levels: training of family doctors and support through different methods; a public relations campaign informing about depression; cooperation with community facilitators (teachers, priests, local media, etc.); and support for self-help activities as well as for high-risk groups. The effects of the 2-year intervention on the number of suicidal acts (completed suicides plus suicide attempts, main outcome criterion) were evaluated with respect to a 1-year baseline and a control region (Wuerzburg, 270 000 inhabitants).
   Results. Compared to the control region, a reduction in frequency of suicidal acts was observed in Nuremberg during the 2-year intervention (2001 v. 2000: - 19-4 %; p <= 0-082; 2002 v. 2000: - 24 %, p <=, 0-004). Considering suicide attempts only (secondary outcome criterion), the same effect was found (2001 v. 2000: - 18-3 %, p <= 0.023; 2002 v. 2000: - 26-5 %, p < 0.001). The reduction was most noticeable for high-risk methods (e.g. hanging, jumping, shooting). Concerning completed suicides, there were no significant differences compared to the control region.
   Conclusions. The NAD appeared to be effective in reducing suicidality. It provides a concept as well as many methods that are currently being implemented in several other intervention regions in Germany and in other countries.

ID PERIOD
AB The rise to power of the National Socialist (Nazi) party led by Adolf Hitler and the subsequent tumultuous 12 years of their rule in Germany resulted in catastrophes including World War II, the most destructive war ever, and the premeditated and systematic murder of 5 to 6 million European Jews. Despite their notable contributions to the academic excellence that existed in German-speaking countries at that time, Jewish physicians were particularly vulnerable to persecution and death. Between 1933 and 1938, a series of repressive measures eliminated them from the practice of medicine in Germany and other countries. Although some died in concentration camps and others committed suicide, many were able to emigrate from Europe. Dermatology in the United States particularly benefited from the influx of several stellar Jewish dermatologists who were major contributors to the subsequent flowering of academic dermatology in the United States. A number of representative biographies of these immigrants are briefly recounted to illustrate their lasting influence on our specialty.

AB Maternal deaths are rare events in industrial nations due to high quality medical services. These are often unexpected deaths occurring during pregnancy and labor, thus often requiring forensic autopsies. Our analysis will provide an overview of the expected range of causes of death. A retrospective analysis was carried out on all autopsies performed at the Department of Legal Medicine in Hamburg, Germany, over the last 34 years. Autopsies were carried out on 57 cases of maternal death over the 34- year period, i.e. 1 or 2 cases per year. The average age of women was 30 years. Approximately two thirds of deaths occurred during pregnancy. Cardiovascular events accounted for the leading causes of death from natural causes, suicides were the leading causes of non-natural death. Maternal deaths remained consistently rare over the examination period. There was a wide range of causes of death involving natural and non-natural causes.

TI Optimizing Suicide Prevention Programs and Their Implementation in

AB Background: Suicide and non-fatal suicidal behaviour are significant public health issues in Europe requiring effective preventive interventions. However, the evidence for effective preventive strategies is scarce. The protocol of a European research project to develop an optimized evidence based program for suicide prevention is presented.
   Method: The groundwork for this research has been established by a regional community based intervention for suicide prevention that focuses on improving awareness and care for depression performed within the European Alliance Against Depression (EAAD). The EAAD intervention consists of (1) training sessions and practice support for primary care physicians, (2) public relations activities and mass media campaigns, (3) training sessions for community facilitators who serve as gatekeepers for depressed and suicidal persons in the community and treatment and (4) outreach and support for high risk and self-help groups (e.g. helplines). The intervention has been shown to be effective in reducing suicidal behaviour in an earlier study, the Nuremberg Alliance Against Depression. In the context of the current research project described in this paper (OSPI-Europe) the EAAD model is enhanced by other evidence based interventions and implemented simultaneously and in standardised way in four regions in Ireland, Portugal, Hungary and Germany.
   The enhanced intervention will be evaluated using a prospective controlled design with the primary outcomes being composite suicidal acts (fatal and non-fatal), and with intermediate outcomes being the effect of training programs, changes in public attitudes, guideline-consistent media reporting. In addition an analysis of the economic costs and consequences will be undertaken, while a process evaluation will monitor implementation of the interventions within the different regions with varying organisational and healthcare contexts.
   Discussion: This multi-centre research seeks to overcome major challenges of field research in suicide prevention. It pools data from four European regions, considerably increasing the study sample, which will be close to one million. In addition, the study will gather important information concerning the potential to transfer this multilevel program to other health care systems. The results of this research will provide a basis for developing an evidence-based, efficient concept for suicide prevention for EU-member states.

ID PROPHYLAXIS; DEPRESSION; STRATEGIES
AB Although lithium's serendipitous discovery as a medication for depression dates back more than 200 years, the first scientific evidence that it prevents mania and depression arose only in the 1960s. However, at that time there was a lack of knowledge about how to administer and monitor lithium therapy safely and properly. The lithium clinics in Dresden and Berlin were remarkably similar in their beginnings in the late 1960s regarding patient numbers and scientific expertise without being aware of one another due to the Iron Curtain separating Germany into a western and eastern part until 1990. In what were initially lithium-care programs run independently from one another, the lithium clinics embedded in academic settings in Dresden and Berlin represent a milestone in the history of psychopharmacological treatment of affective disorders in Germany and trailblazers for today's lithium therapy. Nowadays, lithium's clinical applications are unquestioned, such as its use in strategies to prevent mood episodes and suicide, and to treat depression. The extensively documented knowledge of lithium treatment is the fruit of more than 50 years of observing disease courses and of studying side effects and influencing factors of lithium prophylaxis. Its safe and proper administrationin determining the correct indication, baseline and follow-up examinations, recommended dosages, monitoring, or the management of side effectsis well established. Subsequently, both national and international guidelines continue recommending lithium as the gold standard in treating patients with unipolar and bipolar disorders.

AB "Amok"/School shootings, better named as accomplished and attempted multiple homicide with uncertain motivation are planned violent acts with extreme feelings of hate and revenge, mostly ending in likewise planned suicide. The young, nearly exclusive male offenders develop personality disorders strengthened by many risk factors and copy cat effects through a broad interest by media. The cases are rare. For Germany it is around one accomplished case p.a. Therefore it is critical for research to generalize the findings of the qualitative analyses. From a criminological point of view the detailed interdisciplinary case-analysis with an attempt of psychological autopsy is the only useful method to gather knowledge about the offenders life and development, personality and traits, the social environment, family and peers, interests, motivations and finally copy cat effects and parallels with other cases. The research is difficult and time-consuming and seems sometimes like a puzzle showing a picture not until years. The findings will facilitate threat assessment and early intervention.

TI War by Other Means: British Information Control and Wolfgang Borchert's
   <i>Draussen vor der Tur</i>
SO COMPARATIVE CRITICAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article focuses on the stage and radio play Draussen vor der Tur (The Man Outside) by Wolfgang Borchert, broadcast in the British zone of occupation for the first time on 13 February 1947. A careful comparison of the stage and radio versions allows us to ascertain the degree to which the changes made by the British radio control officers Hugh Carleton Greene and David Porter were political in nature. The article opens by outlining both the history of the creation of the radio version and Borchert's attitude towards the Public Relations/ Information Services Division of the Control Commission for Germany (PR/ISC) (through the analysis of Borchert's correspondence). The original NWDR (Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk/ Northwest German Broadcasting) typescript of the radio broadcast, complete with handwritten emendations, is then compared with the published version, confirming how the radio play was edited to conform to British broadcast standards for a German audience, as well as the Anglo-American reeducation programme for Germany. Greene and Porter systematically edited out mention of postwar German suicides, overt German suffering, attacks on the German institutions the British considered important in the reconstruction of Germany, and any suggestion that the Allies had engaged in morally dubious acts during or after the war.

AB Homicide against Children - First Impressions of a - Criminological Research Project
   Background: Homicide against children in Germany is of great public and political interest, but an under-researched subject. The ongoing criminological research project - presented here aims at achieving reliable data about characteristics and backgrounds of child homicides as well as the respective criminal proceedings. Methods and Results: Data are derived from all identifiable court files regarding homicide against children aged <6 years within the years 1997-2006 in Germany. The first part of this article describes some results regarding the phenomenology of child homicide in Germany. The preliminary analysis of about half of the cases shows that it is necessary to distinguish different types of homicide in order to conduct sensible analyses. We suggest the following differentiation: neonaticide, abuse, neglect, homicide during acute and severe mental illness, extended suicide, purposeful homicide and other. The different types of homicide are heterogeneous and not without overlap. Discussion: The second part of the article discusses some of the difficulties courts encounter in judging the cases. Those difficulties are due to the fact that not only is it quite often difficult to fully prove the relevant facts, but also because court decisions necessarily involve considerations that are not free of value judgments.

AB Background: Immigration into Europe has reached an all-time high. Provision of coordinated healthcare, especially to refugee women that are at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, is a challenge for receiving health care systems. Methods: We assessed pregnancy rates and associated primary healthcare needs in three refugee cohorts in Northern Germany during the current crisis. Results: Out of n = 2911 refugees, 18.0% were women of reproductive age, and 9.1% of these were pregnant. Pregnancy was associated with a significant, 3.7-fold increase in primary health care utilization. Language barrier and cultural customs impeded healthcare to some refugee pregnant women. The most common complaints were demand for pregnancy checkup without specific symptoms (48.6%), followed by abdominal pain or urinary tract infections (in 11.4% of cases each). In 4.2% of pregnancies, severe complications such as syphilis or suicide attempts occurred. Discussion: We present data on pregnancy rates and pregnancy associated medical need in three current refugee cohorts upon arrival in Germany. Healthcare providers should be particularly aware of the requirements of pregnant migrants and should adapt primary caretaking strategies accordingly.

AB Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in many Western countries. An exploration of factors associated with suicidality may help to understand the mechanisms that lead to suicide. Two samples in Germany (n = 500 and n = 477) were examined via Internet regarding suicidality, depression, alcohol abuse, adverse childhood experiences, and parent-child relationships. A Graphical Markov Model was constructed from the first subsample, testing for main, quadratic and interaction effects. All effects in the model were cross-validated using the second subsample. Depression was found to be a strong predictor of suicidality; alcohol abuse was not a predictor. Both maternal and paternal love also predicted suicidality; the former had an indirect effect via depression and the latter a direct effect. Early experiences with violence showed both a direct and indirect association with suicidality. In addition to depression being a predictor for suicidality, various pathways connect suicidality with early childhood experiences.

The action program.Bondnis gegen Depression e.V.",Alliance against Depression") was established in the framework of the German Research Network on Depression and Suicidality ("Kompetenznetz Depression, Suizidalitdt"). The program tries to improve the (are for depressed patients by parallel intervention on several levels and thereby to prevent suicides. The project has been tested in Nuremberg (a city of 500000 inhabitants in Bavaria) and is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Results of this project have shown a significant reduction of suicidal acts in Nuremberg compared to a control region (Wurzburg). Since 2003 the "Alliance against Depression" has expanded to numerous other regions in Germany. With the establishment of the "European Alliance against Depression" in 2004, the concept has been adopted on European level. 18 partners cooperate within this European project which is funded by the European Commission (Health and Consumer Protection Directorate General).

AB The population-related aspects of injuries in children and adolescents in Germany using data from different sources were compiled and analyzed. In contrast to clinical case studies, our focus was on risk groups, injury mechanisms, and context of injury. Sources of information used for this study included the following: Causes of Death Statistics, Hospital Diagnosis Statistics, Child and Adolescent Health Survey, Injury Database. Data for the period 1998 to 2008 on unintentional injuries, violence, and suicide were assessed by age group and gender and study results on sociodemographic risk factors were included. The analysis revealed that injuries display an age-specific dynamic: infants carry a high risk for fatal domestic injuries as well as for injuries due to violence, whereas in adolescents the majority of injuries result from fatal traffic injuries and from suicide. In addition, social factors were found to be related to specific mechanisms of injury (e.g., scalds) and intention (e.g., violence) only. Migration status has an age-and gender-related influence on injury rates.

AB Background: While suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people in most industrial countries, non-fatal suicidal behaviour is also a very important public health concern among adolescents. The aim of this study was to investigate gender differences in prevalence and emotional and behavioural correlates of suicidal behaviour in a representative school-based sample of adolescents.
   Methods: A cross-sectional design was used to assess suicidal behaviour and various areas of emotional and behavioural problems by using a self-report booklet including the Youth Self-Report. One hundred sixteen schools in a region of Southern Germany agreed to participate. A representative sample of 5,512 ninth-grade students was studied. Mean age was 14.8 years (SD 0.73); 49.8% were female.
   Results: Serious suicidal thoughts were reported by 19.8% of the female students and 10.8% of the females had ever attempted suicide. In the male group, 9.3% had a history of suicidal thoughts and 4.9% had previously attempted suicide. Internalizing emotional and behavioural problems were shown to be higher in the female group (difference of the group means 4.41) while externalizing emotional and behavioural problems slightly predominated in male students (difference of the group means -0.65). However, the total rate of emotional and behavioural problems was significantly higher in the adolescent female group (difference of the group means 4.98). Using logistic regression models with suicidal thoughts or attempted suicide as dependent variables, the pseudo-R-2 of gender alone was only 2.7% or 2.3%, while it was 30% or 23.2% for emotional and behavioural problems measured by the YSR syndrome scales. By adding gender to the emotional and behavioural problems only an additional 0.3% of information could be explained.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that gender differences in non-fatal suicidal behaviour among adolescents can to a large extent be explained by the gender differences in emotional and behavioural problems during this age.

AB National legislation, as well as arguments of experts, in Germany and Israel represent opposite regulatory approaches and positions in bioethical debates concerning end-of-life care. This study analyzes how these positions are mirrored in the attitudes of laypeople and influenced by the religious views and personal experiences of those affected. We qualitatively analyzed eight focus groups in Germany and Israel in which laypeople (religious, secular, affected, and non-affected) were asked to discuss similar scenarios involving the withholding or withdrawing of treatment, physician-assisted suicide, and euthanasia. In both countries, respect for patient autonomy and patients' wishes to die with dignity found broad consent. Laypeople argued in favor of accepting such wishes when they were put down in an advance directive. Laypeople in non-religious groups in both countries argued on the basis of a respect for autonomy for the possibility of euthanasia in severe cases but, at the same time, cautioned against its possible misuse. National contrast was apparent in the moral reasoning of lay respondents concerning the distinction between withholding and withdrawing treatment. The modern religious laypeople in Israel, especially, argued strongly, on the basis of the halakhic tradition, against allowing the withdrawal of treatment in accord with a patient's wish. We conclude by discussing the emergent notion of shared responsibility and views of professional responsibility, which we connect through relevant cultural themes such as religion and national culture.

TI A role for doctors in assisted dying?: An analysis of legal regulations
   and medical professional positions in six European countries
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID PALLIATIVE CARE; SUICIDE; EUTHANASIA; NETHERLANDS; ATTITUDES
AB Objectives: To analyse legislation and medical professional positions concerning the doctor's role in assisted dying in western Europe, and to discuss their implications for doctors.
   Method: This paper is based on country-specific reports by experts from European countries where assisted dying is legalised (Belgium, The Netherlands), or openly practiced (Switzerland), or where it is illegal (Germany, Norway, UK).
   Results: Laws on assisted dying in The Netherlands and Belgium are restricted to doctors. In principle, assisted suicide (but not euthanasia) is not illegal in either Germany or Switzerland, but a doctor's participation in Germany would violate the code of professional medical conduct and might contravene of a doctor's legal duty to save life. The Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill proposed in the UK in 2005 focused on doctors, whereas the Proposal on Assisted Dying of the Norwegian Penal Code Commission minority in 2002 did not.
   Professional medical organisations in all these countries except The Netherlands maintain the position that medical assistance in dying conflicts with the basic role of doctors. However, in Belgium and Switzerland, and for a time in the UK, these organisations dropped their opposition to new legislation. Today, they regard the issue as primarily a matter for society and politics. This "neutral'' stance differs from the official position of the Royal Dutch Medical Association which has played a key role in developing the Dutch practice of euthanasia as a "medical end-of-life decision'' since the 1970s.
   Conclusion: A society moving towards an open approach to assisted dying should carefully identify tasks to assign exclusively to medical doctors, and distinguish those possibly better performed by other professions.

AB Alcohol and nicotine are with us during most of our lifetime. About 4,000 children with fetal alcohol syndrome and another 20,000 children with fetal alcohol effects are born per year in Germany. Alcohol contributes to accidents and suicides especially in young people. It is particularly toxic for the developing brain.
   Germany is among the countries with a high consumption of alcohol and nicotine. Consequently substance-related diseases are highly prevalent. In the group of people aged 65 and older we expect a doubling of alcohol problems within the next 10 years. This will also lead to a sharp increase in alcohol-related dementias. Overall, treatment is effective especially if one considers the chronic relapsing nature of the disorder. Unfortunately, less than 10% of patients really receive specialist care. This segment needs to be expanded especially by psychiatrists and psychotherapists. Different prevention strategies are being applied but there is a reluctance to use a ban or curtail advertising and to raise taxes for a reduction in overall consumption.

DE health; inequality; mortality; homicide; suicide
ID INCOME INEQUALITY; POPULATION HEALTH; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; DETERMINANT;
   TRENDS
AB We investigate whether changes in economic inequality affect mortality in rich countries. To answer this question we use a new source of data on income inequality: tax data on the share of pretax income going to the richest 10% of the population in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US between 1903 and 2003. Although this measure is not a good proxy for inequality within the bottom half of the income distribution, it is a good proxy for changes in the top half of the distribution and for the Gini coefficient. In the absence of country and year fixed effects, the income share of the top decile is negatively related to life expectancy and positively related to infant mortality. However, in our preferred fixed-effects specification these relationships are weak, statistically insignificant, and likely to change their sign. Nor do our data suggest that changes in the income share of the richest 10% affect homicide or suicide rates. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A sample of 2553 children and adolescents in a psychiatry clinic in Germany were assessed using a structured interview inventory that included history of self-injurious behaviour, suicidal intent and socially disruptive and threatening behaviour, and diverse socio-demographic variables (the basis documentation or `Ba-Do'). Birth order was associated with both suicidal and self-injurious behaviour, middle children being most likely to exhibit such behaviour. Females were more than twice as likely to have self-injured than males. Comparisons of birth order groups within gender found no significant differences in suicidal behaviour between birth positions for males, however among females, middle children were much more likely to have attempted suicide. Conversely, there was no difference in self-injurious behaviour among birth positions in females, but among males, middle children were significantly more likely to have self-injured than firstborns, only children or lastborns. The number of siblings in the family was significantly correlated with both suicidal history (r = 0.12, p < 0.001) and self-injurious behaviour (r = 0.10, p < 0.001). The risk of suicidal behaviour was highest for those with four or more siblings.

AB Depression is a very common, severe, socio-economically highly relevant disorder and the main cause for approximately 10,000 suicides in Germany annually. There is capital room for improvement and optimization of the care for depressed patients, as effective and evidence-based treatment options are available. However, they are only used optimally by a minority of the people affected due to huge diagnostic and therapeutic deficits. The "Compentence Network on Depression and Suicidality" provided several evidence-based concepts to improve care for patients affected by depression and to prevent suicidal behaviour. Especially the four-level intervention approach of the Alliances Against Depression has been successfully adapted and implemented by more than 100 regions within Europe and globally as well. The infrastructure of the Competence Network could be efficiently sustained throughout the establishment of the German Depression Foundation and the European Alliance against Depression. Since 2014, all research activities have been extended nationally and internationally by the establishment of a Depression Research Centre with a special focus on various EaEuroMental-Health-projects.

AB Medical principles of pain treatment are generally in line with the judicial principles. To relieve pain is one of the fundamentals of medicine and this has also been acknowledged by the Federal Court in Germany. It is criminal bodily harm, when a physician denies a possible pain treatment. Whereas courts clearly see an obligation to basic and continuing education in pain diagnosis and therapy, pain is still not represented in the German licensing regulations for physicians. Only palliative medicine has been added to the obligatory curriculum. Very similar pain is not mandatory in many clinical disciplines leaving physicians without the needed knowledge to treat pain. The need for interdisciplinary treatment is not yet acknowledged sufficiently, although meanwhile chronic pain is regarded as a bio-psycho-social illness.
   Since 2009 the advance directive is regulated by law. However, still many physicians are unaware that not only the position of the patient but also of the relatives have been strengthened. In 2010 the Federal Court has pronounced a judgment allowing "passive euthanasia" in certain conditions but prohibiting any active handling even in line with the patient's will. This is also in line with the European Human Rights Convention. The judicial unpunished assisted suicide has provoked an ethical discussion within the medical profession. However, what is not illegal is not automatically accepted as ethical handling for physicians. Palliative medicine is at least one alternative in this discussion.

AB Background: Thinking about suicide is an indicator of suicide risk. Suicide rates are higher among doctors than in the population. The main aims of this study are to describe the changes in the lifetime prevalence of suicidal feelings from 2000 to 2010 and the possible predictors of serious suicidal thoughts in 2010 among Norwegian doctors. Differences in lifetime prevalence of suicidal feelings between Norwegian doctors in 2010 and German doctors in 2006 will be also described.
   Methods: Longitudinal and cross-sectional study based on questionnaire data from 2000 and 2010, including approximately 1,600 Norwegian doctors. In Germany, cross-sectional study based on questionnaire data from 2006 among a sample of 3,295 doctors. The main outcome measures were the lifetime prevalence of suicidal feelings (felt life was not worth living, wished own death, had thoughts of taking own life).
   Results: The prevalences in 2000 and 2010 of ever had feelings of life not worth living were 48 (44 to 52) % and 45 (41 to 49) %, of ever wished own death 27 (23 to 30) % and 23 (20 to 26) %, and of ever had thoughts of taking own life 29 (16 to 33) % and 24 (21 to 27) %. Paired t-tests among those who responded both in 2000 and 2010 show significant reductions for felt life not worth living (t = -3.4; p = 0.001), wished own death (t = -3.1; p = 0.002) and had thoughts of taking own life (t = -3.5; p < 0.0001). In 2010, significant predictors of serious suicidal thoughts in a multivariate model were low subjective well-being (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.52-0.90), poor or average self-rated health (2.36; 1.25-4.45) and high psychosocial work stress (1.92; 1.06-3.46), controlled for age, gender, speciality and job satisfaction. Norwegian doctors in 2010 compared with their German counterparts in 2006 reported quite similar prevalences of suicidal feelings.
   Conclusions: Suicidal feelings among Norwegian doctors decreased from 2000 to 2010. Individual and work-related factors may to certain explain these findings. Compared with other professionals in Norway and doctors in Germany, Norwegian doctors showed no higher risk of suicidal thoughts.

AB High unemployment rates entail substantial costs to the working population in terms of reduced subjective well-being. This paper studies the importance of individual economic security, in particular job security, by exploiting sector-specific institutional differences in the exposure to economic shocks. Public servants have stricter dismissal protection and face a lower risk of their organization becoming bankrupt than private sector employees. The empirical results from individual panel data for Germany and repeated cross-sectional data for the United States and Europe show that private sector employees subjective well-being reacts indeed much more sensitive to fluctuations in unemployment rates than public sector employees'.

   Eugenics; Anti-Semitism
AB The first full-time professorship for urology at a German university was established in 1937 and in 1942, a rare teaching qualification (Habilitation) for urology was granted, both at the prestigious Berlin University. At the same time, nearly a third of all physicians who worked in the field of urology were classified as "non-Aryan" according to Nazi race laws and were forced out of their profession and their homeland. Many of them committed suicide or, if they refused to flee, were murdered in concentration camps. German urologists also contributed to compulsory sterilization of men according to the "law for the prevention of hereditarily diseased offspring" between 1934 and 1945.
   Historical sources on the history of urology in Nazi Germany were reviewed and analyzed. These include textbooks and medical journals from the 1930s and 1940s, as well as files from different state and university archives.
   For urologists, the changing political environment in Germany after 1933 offered possibilities to assert their personal and professional interests. Unfortunately, in many cases, moral principles were thrown overboard, and physicians advanced their own careers and the specialty of urology at the expense of their patients and their Jewish colleagues.
   Under national socialism, German urologists backed Nazi health and race policies and in exchange gained further professionalization for their specialty, including university positions and increased independence from surgery. Only in recent years has this chapter of German urology's past become a topic of debate among members of the professional society.

AB Objectives. We examined the relationship between unemployment and mortality in Germany, a coordinated market economy, and the United States, a liberal market economy.
   Methods. We followed 2 working-age cohorts from the German Socioeconomic Panel and the US Panel Study of Income Dynamics from 1984 to 2005. We defined unemployment as unemployed at the time of survey. We used discrete-time survival analysis, adjusting for potential confounders.
   Results. There was an unemployment mortality association among Americans (relative risk [RR] = 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.7, 3.4), but not among Germans (RR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.0, 2.0). In education-stratified models, there was an association among minimum-skilled (RR = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.4, 4.7) and medium-skilled (RR =2.4; 95% CI = 1.5, 3.8) Americans, but not among minimum- and medium-skilled Germans. There was no association among high-skilled Americans, but an association among high-skilled Germans (RR = 3.0; 95% CI = 1.3, 7.0), although this was limited to those educated in East Germany. Minimum- and medium-skilled unemployed Americans had the highest absolute risks of dying.
   Conclusions. The higher risk of dying for minimum- and medium-skilled unemployed Americans, not found among Germans, suggests that the unemployment mortality relationship may be mediated by the institutional and economic environment.

AB Men and health - an overview of new epidemiological data from Germany
   Objectives: In epidemiological investigations men are often considered and used as the healthy control group. This article aims to provide a detailed overview about health in men. Methods: Analyses of the indices of health (life expectancy; mortality; state of health) and health-related behaviour (drinking, smoking, and eating behaviour; use of the health system' services) were performed, using data of the German Health Board (1999) and of an health survey in commission of the state (1998) plus data from our own representative investigations of 1994 and 1996.
   Results: Men, in comparison to women, have a shorter life expectancy as well as a higher mortality rate when suffering from cardiac infarction, lung cancer, traffic accidents, or suicide. In consideration of health-related behaviour, men do smoke and drink more and more frequently than females. in addition, men call on the services of the health system to a lesser extent and deny psychological influences to their health. Effects of age and differences between East and West Germany were obtained.
   Conclusions: The presented data can only be explained by a combination of biological, psychological, and sociological perspectives. According to these results, investigations of health-related data should focus more on the difference between men, on the gender-related role of men in different contexts and on the investigation of the sub-group of healthy men.

AB Purpose Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a group of developmental disabilities related to prenatal alcohol exposure. FASD is a life-long lasting condition with various neurocognitive impairments and deficits in daily-life functioning. Research also indicates that FASD patients have an increased prevalence for substance use, substance related disorders and other psychiatric disorders. In Germany, data on adult FASD patients and their mental health are rare. The purpose of this paper is to describe substance use and comorbid psychiatric disorders (in addition to FASD) and suicide attempts in adult FASD patients. Design/methodology/approach The German version of the structured "Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)" was administered to a convenience sample of patients attending a specialized FASD diagnostic service at a German university hospital to assess psychiatric disorders. Current and lifetime substance use were examined using sections from the German version of the "European Addiction Severity Index (EUROP-ASI-R)" interview. Findings In total, 31 adults with FASD were included. Two patients were diagnosed with a substance related disorder, one for alcohol and one for cannabis. Nearly half of all patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for mild mental retardation, a further 16 per cent fulfilled the criteria for another current comorbid psychiatric disorder. In total, 26 per cent reported at least one suicide attempt. Originality/value Given that the body of research literature on FASD in adulthood is sparse, even a clinical sample of thirty individuals expands knowledge on mental health and substance use in the adult FASD population. The sample was comprehensively assessed using validated structured interviews on mental health, substance use and FASD.

AB The impact of psychiatric emergencies for the care of patients in preclinical emergency medicine, in emergency departments and in psychiatric hospitals has been underestimated for a long time. There is still insufficient knowledge and a need for further research. There are, however, sufficient reasons to assume that annually approximately 500,000 patients with a psychiatric emergency receive treatment from a preclinical emergency physician and another 1.5 million in emergency departments in Germany. Further, approximately 500,000 patients are admitted to psychiatric hospitals as an emergency. The most frequent reasons are intoxication, agitation, aggressiveness and suicidal ideation, posing a threat of self-harm to the patient or to other persons and evoking other life-threatening conditions. Emergency psychiatry also plays a role in collective injuries, such as mass disasters, catastrophes and rampage situations. There is some evidence that the number of psychiatric emergencies is increasing. Reasons are, among others, changes in the services provided for inpatient and outpatient treatment, a reduction in stabilizing psychosocial factors and a general increase in the utilization of emergency healthcare services.

AB The decision to publish the journals Der Schmerz and Narkose und Anaesthesie in 1928 was an important step towards the professionalization of anaesthesiology in Germany. The appearance of both journals, which for economic reasons merged into Schmerz - Narkose - Anaesthesie 1 year later, was initiated and vehemently supported by Jewish physicians. As editors and co-editors they were deeply involved with the editorial tasks of the journals for years from the early beginnings. When the National Socialistic Party took over the government in Germany many of the Jewish colleagues were forced to quit their editorial tasks, were eliminated and replaced by "Arians", they were persecuted and often arrested, forced to emigrate or decided to commit suicide due to inhumane personal circumstances. It is our intention to recall the biography and the terrible fate of the nearly unknown Jewish members of the editorial board of the first German anaesthesia journals. Moreover the biographic sketches promote a continuous discussion about the victims of an inhumane and barbarous ideology.

   RATES; MORTALITY; SMOKING; DEATH; POPULATION; COMPONENTS
AB Over the course of the 20th century the sex differential in life expectancy at birth in the industrialized countries has widened considerably in favour of women. Starting in the early 1970s, the beginning of a reversal in the long-term pattern of this differential has been noted in some high-income countries. This study documents a sustained pattern of narrowing of this measure into the later part of the 1990s for six of the populations that comprise the G7 countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, England and Wales (as representative of the United Kingdom) and USA. For Japan, a persistence of widening sex differences in survival is noted. The sex differences in life expectancy are decomposed over roughly three decades (early 1970s to late 1990s) from the point of view of four major cause-of-death categories: circulatory diseases, cancers, accidents/violence/suicide, and,other' (residual) causes. In the six countries where the sex gap has narrowed, this has resulted primarily from reduced sex differences in circulatory disease mortality, and secondarily from reduced differences in male and female death rates due to accidents, violence and suicide combined. In some of the countries sex differentials in cancer mortality have been converging lately, and this has also contributed to a narrowing of the difference in life expectancy. In Japan, males have been less successful in reducing their survival disadvantage in relation to Japanese women with regard to circulatory disease and cancer; and in the case of accidents/violence/suicide, male death rates increased during the 1990s. These trends explain the divergent pattern of the sex difference in life expectation in Japan as compared with the other G7 nations.

AB Background: Some patients with advanced and progressive diseases express a desire to hasten death.
   Aim: This study evaluated the motivations of patients expressing such a desire in a country with prohibitive legislation on euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide.
   Design: A modified form of Grounded Theory was used.
   Setting/participants: Patients from the departments of palliative medicine in three hospitals in Germany were recruited when they had made a statement or request to hasten death. Participants were interviewed face to face. Recruitment was stopped with 12 participants because of data saturation.
   Results: Thematic analysis revealed three main motivational themes: self-determination, agony, and time. Expectations toward health professionals, attitudes toward death, and secureness related to the end of life were additional main themes emerging from the analysis.
   Conclusions: The desire to hasten death may be used as an extreme coping strategy to maintain control against anticipated agony. Patients expected health professionals to listen to and respect their experiences. Emerging hypotheses included the following: (a) patients try to balance life time and anticipated agony, and the perception of time is distressing in this balancing act; (b) anticipated images of agony and suffering in the dying process occur frequently and are experienced by patients as intrusive; (c) patients expressing a desire to hasten death are in need of more information about the dying process; and (d) patients wanted their caregivers to listen to and respect their wish to hasten death, and they did not expect the caregivers to understand this as an order to actually hasten their death.

AB Aim The present study compares the attitude towards psychotherapy of persons living in Germany with or without Turkish background. In this context, gender-related, disorder-specific and sociodemographic differences in openness towards psychotherapy are taken into account.
   Methods Individuals of Turkish origin (n=129) and individuals without migration background (n=129) were interviewed with the Questionnaire on Attitudes towards Psychotherapeutic Treatment, the Social Support Questionnaire, a short version of the Symptom-Checklist with the subscales anxiety, depression and somatization, and a sociodemographic questionnaire.
   Results The attitude towards psychotherapy is less positive in Turkish migrants than in people without migration background. Females, depressive individuals, persons with high social support, with children and a high level of education are more open towards psychotherapy.
   Discussion The attitude towards psychotherapy is influenced by gender, socio-demographic and disorder-specific factors and in particular by cultural factors.
   Conclusion These results elucidate the need for better information about psychotherapy and the development of intercultural consulting services for migrants in Germany.

AB Background Psychotic-like symptoms are found in a subgroup of borderline patients (BPD). Reported prevalence is heterogeneous (up to 50 % affected). Investigations in Germany have not been conducted so far. Furthermore, the precise phenomenology of the psychotic symptoms and the effects on suicidal behavior and the use of inpatient psychiatric treatment are unclear.
   Objectives The aim of the study was to investigate prevalence rates and phenomenology of psychotic-like symptoms. Associations between the latter and suicidality as well as the use of inpatient psychiatric treatment were examined. Further influencing factors were taking into account.
   Methods Psychotic-like symptoms were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview-I in 95 BPD patients. To investigate the associations between psychotic-like symptoms and suicidality as well as the use of inpatient psychiatric treatment, correlation and regression analyzes were calculated, considering severity of PTSD, BPD and depression.
   Results 36 % of the patients reported alterations of perception and 21 % delusions, both multiform and long lasting. The number of suicide attempts was associated with delusions, alterations of perception and severity of PTSD, BPS, and depression. Only delusions and severity of PTSD explained together 25.8 % of the variance for the prediction of the number of suicide attempts. Age of initial hospitalization showed fewer and number of hospitalizations no associations at all.
   Discussion Psychotic-like symptoms should not be trivialized, which may happen by using terms such as pseudo-hallucinations or transient paranoid ideas, and may be particularly associated with suicidal tendencies complicating the clinical course.

AB Some end-of-life aspects have become a significant political and social issue such as elderly care and euthanasia. But hardly anything is known about how the general public in Germany thinks about death and dying more generally. Therefore, we conducted a representative online survey (N = 997) regarding 21 end-of-life aspects. Differences between subgroups were analyzed by conducting analyses of variance and Tukey honestly significance difference post hoc tests and by performing t tests. The findings revealed that the general public is open to engaging with topics of death, dying, and grief and that death education might even be promoted for children. Most participants appraised dealing with the finitude of life as part of a good life, but few have contemplated death and dying themselves so far. Attitudes and perceptions were related to age, subjective health, religious denomination, and gender. The survey provides useful implications for community palliative care, death education, and communication with dying people.

AB Background: Demoralization is a psychological response that is frequently observed in patients with cancer or advanced diseases. Depression and demoralization syndrome in patients with cancer are closely related to suicidal behavior.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore the factors affecting demoralization of patients with cancer from a depression perspective, to assist with distinguishing patient emotions and provide appropriate intervention as early as possible, thereby enabling patients to receive proper care.
   Methods: A systematic review and metaanalysis was employed in this study. The databases included Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane, PubMedl MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Centre for European Policy Studies, and reference lists of articles. Experts in this field also were contacted. Based on inclusion criteria, 2 investigators selected the research and reviewed each study's quality according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Five correlational studies with 32 subjects were identified.
   Results: The countries of studies included Australia, Germany, Taiwan, and the United States. There was a statistically significant difference in depression between patients with cancer in the high-demoralization group and those of the low-demoralization group (odds ratio = 9.65, 95% CI: 6.99-13.33, Z = 15.002, p < 0.0001). Four studies regarded demoralization and depression as distinguishable.
   Conclusions: The demoralization of patients with cancer was highly correlated with depression. Therefore, the suicide risk of demoralized patients without depression must also be assessed to prevent patients with high suicide risk from being neglected. If medical staff can perceive patient's demoralization issues earlier, they can more effectively prevent patients' depression from occurring, which benefits suicide prevention.

DE Rudolf Kronfeld; Oral pathology; Histopathology; Anti-Semitism; Medical
   emigration; National Socialism
AB The physician Rudolf Kronfeld (1901-1940) is undoubtedly one of the pioneering and most influential representatives of modern histopathology and oral pathology. Already at a young age he became a protagonist of the renowned, internationally leading "Vienna School".
   Kronfeld's outstanding professional significance stands in a peculiar contrast to the research situation to date: His curriculum vitae, but also his family background - and here in particular the fate of his family members in the Third Reich - have received little attention so far.
   Thus, the present study attempts to shed light on Kronfeld's life and work and, in particular, the complex implications of his Jewish background. It is based on archival sources and a systematic re-analysis of the relevant specialist literature.
   The analysis demonstrates that Kronfeld's early emigration was driven in part by the anti-Semitism that was tangible in Vienna in the 1920s. The last years of his life were considerably burdened by a serious illness and by repressive experiences which his Jewish family members and companions underwent after the "Anschluss" of Austria into Nazi Germany. Both essential events presumably contributed significantly to Kronfeld's sudden suicide in 1940, at the height of his professional success.

AB Aggressive and criminal traits have a complex genetic background which interacts with environmental factors. Alcohol intoxication has been related to lower thresholds of aggressive behaviors. In this association study of two independent samples, a number of candidate gene variants (5HT2A T102C, 5-HTTLPR, DRD Ins-141Del, DAT1 VNTR) were related to violent criminal behavior and alcohol-related aggressive traits.
   Treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent individuals (293 patients and 499 controls from Germany, 180 patients and 402 controls from Poland) underwent a Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism interview which gathered information on alcohol-related violence and criminal behaviors, beside alcohol dependence characteristics.
   Patients with a history of violent or non-violent crime were more often male, had an earlier onset of alcoholism, more withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens, and were more likely to have a history of suicide attempts. No significant association between candidate gene variants and criminal behavior was detected. 5HTTLPR variant was related to one characteristic of alcohol-related violence.
   With findings from genome-wide association studies linking aggression-related traits to second messenger systems, further studies are needed to determine the genetic underpinnings of non-alcohol and alcohol-related aggression.

DT Article
AB From the onset, moral statistics were influenced by religious discourse. During the nineteenth century, Adolf Wagner discovered the "One Law" of sociology: Protestants always kill themselves more often than Catholics. Deployed by his colleague, the Baltic nationalist theologian Alexander von Oettingen, it became a moral-statistical plank in the modernity thesis and supported a Prussian master narrative of history. Accordingly, it justified the unification of Germany according to the small German model of a Kulturnation excluding Catholic Austria. This interpretation, in turn, influenced subsequent generations of German sociologists, who described modernity in idealist and spiritual terms. In this, they differed from the more mechanistic and materialist theories of French sociologists, in particular Emile Durkheim.

DE Jewish veterinarians; National Socialism; rehabilitation
AB In 1998 there were only twelve Jewish veterinarians known who practised in Germany between 1918 and 1945. 133 of them have now been found. Most of the Jewish veterinarians had their roots in merchant families and were general practitioners in the countryside. To be "Jewish" did not concern until 1933. Compared with the other medical professionals like human medical professionals (10,9 %), in 1933 the number of Jewish veterinarians was low (1,6 %, whole German Jewish population 0,77 %). Right with the beginning of the National Socialistic rule Jewish veterinarians were exposed to different forms of harassment. Soon after, on April 7 th 1933, with the so-called Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums (BBG; law for the restoration Of civil service), the prosecution took on an official quality. The Reichstierarztekarnmer (Chamber of veterinary service) was very eager to Aryanize the German veterinary service. The BBG made the Jewish veterinarians who worked in public positions lose their jobs with the single exception of those who had the status of a so-called "Frontktimpfer" (a soldier who fought at the frontline during World War 1). Many of the Jewish veterinarians who were still in Germany in November 1938 were arrested after the pogrom of November 9/10(th) and kept in concentration camps and prisons for about one month. The few students of veterinary medicine who already had started their studies in 1933 still could make their exams in Germany, but they did not get a licence. On January 31(st) 1939 all Jewish veterinarians in Germany lost their licence. 55 Jewish vets managed to emigrate in time. Nineteen German Jewish Veterinarians died in concentration camps and ghettos. Two are known to have committed suicide. Until 1997, there was no act of appreciation or rehabilitation of German Jewish veterinarians. In 2003 the degrees of two Jewish veterinarians, Hermann Cussel and Paul Stern, were renewed Posthumously by the Hanover School of Veterinary Medicine, while the President of the school also apologized for any injustice which was done by the school during the time of National Socialism.

AB In Germany, the significant increase of healthcare provision and service use in recent decades has not resulted in a decreasing prevalence of mental disorders.Three explanations for this phenomenon are considered: 1)prevention and the healthcare system are insufficient and ineffective, 2)the success of the healthcare service is masked by growing morbidity due to increasing societal risks, and 3)afundamental shift towards apsychological culture accounts for an increasing perception and treatment of mental disorders and their symptoms at the same time. In order to review these three theoretical approaches, results from population-based health surveys and healthcare research in Germany as well as the international debate are presented and discussed.The present results provide evidence for each of the three explanations: 1)problems with implementation of preventive actions and access to healthcare services are well documented, 2)influences of the multifaceted development of risk factors on the prevalence and disease burden of mental disorders cannot be ruled out, and 3)agrowing mental health literacy implies that problems (in everyday life) are currently more often interpreted and treated psychologically.For the purpose of evaluating changes in the healthcare system, not only should the prevalence of mental disorders be considered, but also incidence (and their potential reduction by preventive measures) as well as indicators of need for treatment (i.e. functional impairment) and mortality (i.e. suicides and reduced life expectancy).

AB Objective: Although the construct of psychic incompetence can prevent severely mentally disturbed persons from being imprisoned in Germany, the prevalence of mentally disordered persons who are detained is high. Data describing the characteristics of mentally disturbed detainees in Germany are scarce. The following study uses data from a psychiatric care institution in a prison to examine the distribution of psychiatric diagnoses in relation to age, nationality and legal status. The distribution of diagnoses is compared to that of the psychiatric department at a Berlin community hospital.
   Method: The data were recorded during each patient's hospital treatment and summarised on the day of discharge. The following variables were assessed: age, length of stay in days, main diagnosis, up to 2 additional diagnoses, frequency of violent or suicidal behaviour, and nationality. Data were collected from January 2010 to February 2011 in the psychiatric department of the Berlin Prison Hospital.
   Results: During a 14-month period, 107 patients were discharged from psychiatric inpatient care and N = 124 completed treatments were observed. Of these patients, 21.5% were pre-trial detainees, and 58% were of German nationality. The mean age was 37.7 years. Non-German patients were younger than German patients. Fifty-five percent of the patients suffered from a psychotic disorder, and 7.5% had a main diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder. Personality disorders were significantly less frequently diagnosed in non-German patients. An additional diagnosis of substance abuse was present in 66% of the patients, and 17.8% of the patients showed suicidal and/or violent behaviour or had to be restrained (immobilisation, isolation, compulsory medication). The frequency of suicide, violence and compulsory measures did not differ significantly between German and non-German patients, between younger and older patients or between remand and sentenced inmates.
   The distribution of psychiatric diagnoses was similar to that of a Berlin community hospital.
   Conclusions: Personality disorders were more frequently diagnosed in German than in non-German patients. The burden of personality disorders among mentally ill prison detainees in Berlin Prison Hospital was not significantly higher than that of a Berlin community hospital. The percentage of non-German patients in the psychiatric department of the Berlin Prison Hospital was more than two times higher than in a psychiatric department of a community hospital. The lower-than-expected rate of suicide attempts among pre-trial detainees may be an indicator of a beneficial effect of the treatment setting in the psychiatric department of Berlin Prison Hospital.

AB In his article with the provocative title "Are Recessions Good for Your Health?", Ruhm (J. Health Econ. 21(4) (2000) 659) has found robust and consistent evidence that the total mortality rate, age-specific mortality rates as well as most specific mortality causes are pro-cyclical. His finding that high unemployment rates are associated with lower mortality and vice versa stands in stark contrast to Brenner's earlier work, who found the opposite effect, possibly after a time lag. Ruhm controls for state-specific effects in a panel of US states over the period 1972-1991, whereas Brenner's work is based on time-series analysis. Extending and improving upon Ruhm's original analysis, we analyse the effect of state unemployment and economic growth rates on mortality in the states of Germany over the period 1980-2000, both in a static and a dynamic econometric model. Controlling for state-specific effects, we find evidence that aggregate mortality rates for all age groups taken together as well as most specific age groups are lower in recessions. The same is true for mortality from cardiovascular diseases, pneumonia and influenza, motor vehicle accidents and suicides, but not for necessarily for other specific mortality causes. In particular, there is never a statistically significant effect on homicides, other external effects and malignant neoplasms. There are also few differences apparent between the effect on male and female mortality. If we do not control for state-specific effects, then we often arrive at the opposite result with higher unemployment being associated with higher mortality. This suggests that a failure to control for time-invariant state-specific effects leads to omitted variable bias, which would erroneously suggest that mortality rates move counter-cyclically. Overall, we can confirm Ruhm's main finding for another country: recessions lower some, but not all, mortality rates in the case of Germany. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Episodic excessive alcohol consumption ("binge drinking") among children and adolescents has become a serious public health problem in Germany and is associated with a variety of risks.
   Methods: Selective literature search of the Ovid Medline database from 1998 to 2008.
   Results: Episodic excessive alcohol consumption is associated not only with somatic complications, but also with traffic accidents and other types of accident, violent behavior, and suicide. The more frequently a child or adolescent drinks to excess, and the younger he or she is, the greater is the risk of developing an alcohol-related disorder (alcohol misuse or dependence syndrome). In the USA, brief motivational interventions have been shown to have a small to medium-sized beneficial effect in reducing further binge drinking and its complications.
   Conclusions: The intervention HaLT ("Stop," also an acronym for Hart am Limit-"near the limit") is performed in a number of regions in Germany. Further types of brief motivating intervention should be developed and evaluated to prevent the development of alcohol-related disorders, where indicated, in children and adolescents that engage in binge drinking.

AB The Relation Between Research and Clinical Practice - A Survey ofDeutsche Gesellschaft fur Gruppenanalyse mid Gruppenpsychotherapie (D3G) Members Perceptions of Psychotherapy Research Bridging the science and practice of group psychotherapy is a constant challenge. In order to achieve a meaningful synthesis of science and practice, scientists must attend to the issues that practitioners identify as important and useful. In 2010, Ogrodnizcuk et al. published a survey of Canadian Group Psychotherapy Association members' perceptions of psychotherapy research. The objective of the survey was to identify research topics and issues that were important to group psychotherapists. The purpose of the present study was to extend this survey to a different country - Germany. The German service delivery model for group psychotherapy is vastly different from the North American model. Most group psychotherapies in Germany are provided in a very well established and funded inpatient health care system, while the majority of group psychotherapies in the US and Canada are offered in outpatient settings, which often are not paid by health insurance (especially in the US). Such differences may have implications for the type of research that therapists regard as important and useful.

AB Objective: Despite of the importance of psychiatric emergencies (PE) requiring treatment at an emergency room (ER) little is known about their frequency and current trends in terms of quantity and quality.
   Methods: A retrospective analysis of all PE treated at the ER of the University Hospital Ulm (Germany) in 2000 and 2010.
   Results: 6% (2000) or 5% (2010) of the ER cases were PE. Despite an increase from 369 to 430 cases (+ 16,5 %) their share decreased because of an even stronger increase of other emergencies (+ 33%). The most frequent PE in 2000 was alcohol intoxication (37,7 %), while it was intoxication with prescribed and/or illicit drugs in 2010 (47,9 %). Patients with alcohol intoxications were significantly younger in 2010 as compared with 2000. Suicide attempts were seen in every fourth PE. They were significantly more frequent in 2010. PEs were generally more frequent in the evening and over the night.
   Conclusion: This study provides first insight into current trends in PE treated at the ER in Germany. Our data provide an empirical starting point for optimizing clinical care, although the study is limited by its retrospective and mono-centric design.

AB Optimised treatment of depression is important to patients and their families and has important health economic implications in Germany. The optimised treatment of depression can best be achieved with multilevel interventions targeting different groups. The,,German Alliance Against Depression" emerged within the framework of the,,German Research Network on Depression and Suicidality" This action-oriented programme aims to improve the care of depressed patients through parallel interventions on four levels. These levels are as follows: 1) co-operation with general practitioners, 2) a public relations campaign, 3) training programmes for community facilitators and 4) interventions with high-risk groups. The programme was tested in Nuremberg. Results were promising with a 24% decrease in suicidal behaviour reported. In the meantime, groups in Germany and abroad declared their interest in adapting the programme. Today, close to 40 German regions have implemented similar multilevel interventions. The European Alliance Against Depression (EAAD) formed and now includes 17 countries. The EAAD was mentioned in the 2005 EU green paper on mental health as an "example for best practice': Improving the care of affected persons requires a systematic research approach. The "Mental Health Research Network" contributes to research related to the optimisation of services for persons with mental disorders.

AB Penetrating gunshot injuries to the head and brain are rare in Germany and the rest of Western Europe. Due to the small number of cases over here no consistent diagnostic and therapeutic standards exist in this respect. Thus these kinds of injuries present a great challenge to the attending physicians. Most of these violations are a result of a suicidal attempt or an accident. Beside violations by firearms also penetrating injuries to the head and brain due to captive bolt devices, as used in slaughtery business for the "humane" killing of animals, occur from time to time. The impact on the head differs from that caused by firearms because no projectile is leaving the barrel and the used bolt, as a fix part of the device, does not remain in the affected tissue. That implies characteristic results within the radiological imaging that might be pathbreaking for the further treatment, because the origin of such a head injury is often unknown during primary care. Consequently the knowledge of these specific findings is central to the radiologist to make the appropriate diagnosis. Based on some clinical examples the trauma-related CT-findings are introduced and a short overview of the relevant literature is also given.

AB An estimated 800 000 suicide deaths occur worldwide. The global suicide rate is 11.4 per 100 000 population; 15.0/100 000 for males and 8.0/100 000 for females. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds. In a collaborative effort to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental health problems among youth across Europe, the European Union 7(th) Framework funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. SEYLE is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to promote mental health and healthy lifestyles, while preventing psychopathology and suicidal behaviours among adolescents. The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD +/- 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged >= 16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged <= 15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called `invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised risk behaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the `invisible' risk group with those in the high-risk group, similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%), subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%), depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32%, respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-injurious behaviours (D-SIB) was 27.6%, with higher rates reported for occasional D-SIB (19.7%) compared to repetitive D-SIB (7.8%). Suicidal ideation was present in approximately one third of the sample (32.3%). More than four percent (4.2%) of the sample reported attempting suicide during their lifetime, with a significantly higher prevalence among girls (5.1% vs. 3.0%, p<0.05). In comparing the effectiveness of the three active SEYLE interventions, based on three specific preventive strategies directed towards teachers and school staff, professionals and pupils in comparison to a control group, the intervention empowering pupils, called the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) showed significant results in preventing new cases of suicide attempts, severe suicidal ideation with plans and depression. More than a 50% reduction of incident cases of suicide attempts (OR: 0.45 [0.24 - 0.85]; p=0.014), and of incident cases of severe suicidal ideation and plans (OR: 0.50 [0.27 - 0.92]; p=0.025), as well as a significant reduction by 30% of incident cases with moderate to severe depression (OR: 0.71 [0.52- 0.97]; p=0.031) was observed.

AB Background Psychiatric emergencies (PE) in preclinical emergency medical services are about 5 - 10 % of all emergencies and represent often a source of difficulties in handling for the non-psychiatric professional helpers that deal with them. Studies informing about quantitative and qualitative changes of PEs in preclinical emergency medicine in Germany are scarce.
   Methods Therefore, we conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of PE in a preclinical emergency medical service based on the protocols of the emergency ambulance of the Section for Emergency Medicine at the University Hospital Ulm comparing the years 2000 and 2010.
   Results We observed a significant increase of PEs from 8.8 % in the year 2000 (n = 285, from a total of n = 3227) to 10.3 % in 2010 (n = 454, from a total of n = 4425). In both years intoxications were the most common PE [2000: n = 116 (44.4 %); 2010: n = 171 (37.7 %)], followed by suicide-related behavior [2000: n = 59 (22.6 %); 2010: n = 78 (17.2 %)] and acute anxiety disorders [2000: n = 37 (13 %); 2010: n = 105 (23.1 %)]. The mentioned three conditions accounted for about 80 % of all PE. Most frequently PE occurred at the weekend and with the highest density in the evening and at night (18 - 24 h) in both years. Patients with PE were predominantly men, but the rate of women causing PE increased between 2000 and 2010.
   Discussion/Conclusion This study provides preliminary data on current trends in PEs in preclinical emergency medicine in Germany and has implications for improving the medical care provided.

AB BackgroundWorldwide, approximately 800,000 persons die by suicide every year; with rates of suicide attempts estimated to be much higher. Suicidal persons often suffer from a mental disorder but stigma, lack of available and suitable support, and insufficient information on mental health limit help seeking. The use of internet-based applications can help individuals inform themselves about mental disorders, assess the extent of their own concerns, find local treatment options, and prepare for contact with health care professionals. This project aims to develop and evaluate e-mental health interventions to improve knowledge about suicidality and to reduce stigmatization of those affected. In developing these interventions, a representative telephone survey was conducted to detect knowledge gaps and stigmatizing attitudes in the general population.MethodsFirst, a national representative telephone survey with N=2000 participants in Germany was conducted. Second, e-mental health interventions are developed to address knowledge gaps and public stigma detected in the survey. These comprise an evidence-based health information package about suicidality, information on regional support services, a self-administered depression testincluding suicidalityand an interactive online intervention including personal stories. The development is based on a trialogical exchange of experience between persons affected by suicidality, relatives of affected persons, and clinical experts. Australian researchers who developed an e-mental health intervention for individuals affected by rural suicide were invited to a workshop in order to contribute their knowledge and expertise. Third, the online intervention will be evaluated by a mixed methods design.DiscussionFrom representative telephone survey data, content can be developed to address specific attitudes and knowledge via the e-mental health interventions. These interventions will be easily accessed and provide an opportunity to reach people who tend not to seek professional services, prefer to inform themselves in advance and/or wish to remain anonymous. Evaluation of the online intervention will provide information on any changes in participants' self-stigma and perceived-stigma of suicidality, and any increase in participants' knowledge on suicidality or self-efficacy expectations.Trial registrationGerman Clinical Trial Register DRKS00015071 on August 6, 2018.

AB The 'European Alliance Against Depression' community-based intervention approach simultaneously targets depression and suicidal behaviour by a multifaceted community based intervention and has been implemented in more than 115 regions worldwide. The two main aims of the European Union funded project "Optimizing Suicide Prevention Programmes and Their Implementation in Europe" were to optimise this approach and to evaluate its implementation and impact. This paper reports on the primary outcome of the intervention (the number of completed and attempted suicides combined as 'suicidal acts') and on results concerning process evaluation analysis. Interventions were implemented in four European cities in Germany, Hungary, Portugal and Ireland, with matched control sites. The intervention comprised activities with predefined minimal intensity at four levels: training of primary care providers, a public awareness campaign, training of community facilitators, support for patients and their relatives. Changes in frequency of suicidal acts with respect to a one-year baseline in the four intervention regions were compared to those in the four control regions (chi-square tests). The decrease in suicidal acts compared to baseline in the intervention regions (-58 cases, -3.26%) did not differ significantly (chi(2) = 0.13; p = 0.72) from the decrease in the control regions (-18 cases, -1.40%). However, intervention effects differed between countries (chi(2) = 8.59; p = 0.04), with significant effects on suicidal acts in Portugal (chi(2) = 4.82; p = 0.03). The interviews and observations explored local circumstances in each site throughout the study. Hypothesised mechanisms of action for successful implementation were observed and drivers for 'added-value' were identified: local partnership working and 'in-kind' contributions; an approach which valued existing partnership strengths; and synergies operating across intervention levels. It can be assumed that significant events during the implementation phase had a certain impact on the observed outcomes. However, this impact was, of course, not proven.

AB Background: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) in adolescence has been described as comorbid condition in affective or anxiety disorders, as well as borderline personality disorder (BPD) and is a risk factor for later suicide attempts. Prevalence rates of NSSI decline steeply from adolescence to young adulthood. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, the longitudinal development of adolescent psychiatric patients with NSSI into their young adulthood has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to assess current NSSI and psychological impairment of young adults, who had been in treatment for NSSI in their adolescence.
   Methods: Former patients of the departments of child and adolescent psychiatry and psychotherapy in Ulm and Ravensburg, Germany (N = 52), who presented with NSSI in their adolescence, were recruited (average age: 21.5 years (SD = 2.6)). Data was assessed using questionnaires and structured clinical interviews. Two groups of participants with prevailing NSSI and ceased NSSI were compared concerning their current psychological impairment, history of NSSI, suicide attempts, and BPD diagnosis.
   Results: Around half of all participants had engaged in NSSI within the last year, and around half met diagnostic criteria for BPD. Although there was no significant association between current NSSI and BPD, an earlier age of onset of NSSI and a longer duration of NSSI during adolescence was significantly predictive of adult BPD. Two thirds of participants still met criteria of an axis 1 psychiatric disorder. Suicide attempts were reported by 53.8 % of all participants. Participants with current NSSI were more likely to meet criteria for a current axis 1 disorder, had engaged in NSSI more often in their lifetime, and reported more suicide attempts.
   Conclusions: Reduction of NSSI from adolescence to young adulthood was lower than described in previous community samples. This may be due to the initial high psychiatric impairment of this sample in adolescence. Early onset of NSSI seemed to be a risk factor for a longer duration of NSSI during adolescence but not for NSSI prevailing into adulthood. However, it was a risk factor for adult BPD. Furthermore, the occurrence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors and prevailing NSSI was highly associated.

AB Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is known to improve quality of life and to prolong survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. However, little is known about the circumstances of dying in ventilated ALS patients. In the light of the debate on legalizing euthanasia it is important to provide empirical data about the process of dying in these patients. In a structured interview, 29 family caregivers of deceased ALS patients were asked about their own and the patient's attitude toward physician-assisted suicide (PAS) and euthanasia, circumstances of dying, and the use of palliative medication. Quantitative and qualitative content analysis was performed on the data. Non-recurring suicidal thoughts were reported by five patients. Three patients and seven relatives had thought about PAS. Seventeen caregivers described the patients' death as "peaceful", while choking was reported in six bulbar patients. In final stages of dying, the general practitioner (GP) was involved in the treatment of 10 patients, with palliative medication including sedatives and opiates being administered in eight cases. In conclusion, in contrast to the Netherlands, where 20% of terminal ALS patients die from PAS or euthanasia, only a small minority of our patients seems to have thought about PAS. The legal situation in Germany (where euthanasia is illegal), a bias due to the selection of NIV patients as well as a high percentage of religious patients and those with good levels of social support from family and friends, might account for this. Most of our patients died peacefully at home from carbon dioxide narcosis, but choking was described in some bulbar patients. Thus, palliative care, especially the use of opiates, anxiolytics and sedatives should be optimized, and the involvement of GP should be strongly encouraged, especially in bulbar patients.

AB Objective. - The review aims to identify the extent and nature of research on mental disorders and their care in immigrant populations in three major European countries with high levels of immigration, i.e. Germany, Italy, United Kingdom (UK).
   Method. - Peer-reviewed publications on the subject from the three countries between 1996 and 2004 were analyzed. The research questions addressed, the methods used, and the results obtained were assessed.
   Results. - Thirteen papers reporting empirical studies were found from Germany, four from Italy and 95 front the UK. Studies addressed a range of research questions and most frequently assessed rates of service utilization in different immigrant groups, The most consistent finding is a higher rate of hospital admissions for Afro-Caribbean patients in the UK. Many studies had serious methodological shortcomings with low sample sizes and unspecified inclusion criteria.
   Discussion. - Despite large scale immigration in each of the three studied countries. the numbers of relevant research publications vary greatly with a relatively high level of empirical research in the UK. Possible reasons for this are it generally stronger Culture of mental health service research and a higher number of researchers who are themselves front immigrant backgrounds ill the UK,
   Conclusion. - Overall the evidence base to guide the development of mental health services for immigrant populations appears limited. Future research requires appropriate funding, should be of sufficient methodological quality and may benefit from collaboration across Europe. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Around the world heated debates have broken out on the topic of active euthanasia. Specialists in the field of 'forensic medicine' have taken full part in these discussions. Objective: The present survey from the point of view of forensic medicine begins with a look at current terminology and at the laws pertaining to euthanasia in Germany. These laws are then contrasted with actual practice, including a description of the increasing acceptance of active euthanasia by the German population and its legalization in Holland. The main argument against active euthanasia is that its formal acceptance in law would cause the dam of restraint to burst, culminating in widespread misuse, as already seen in recent serial killings by nurses in hospitals and homes for the elderly around the world. Conclusions: Contrasted to this are the arguments for taking active steps at the end of life, including emotional considerations such as the revulsion against mechanized medicine and the fear of pain and rational arguments such as the necessity to end a 'life unworthy of life', to save medical costs, and obtaining prior consent in 'living wills'. Such considerations have put in jeopardy the moral integrity of the medical profession - and thus the layperson's trust in physicians - around the world. In Germany especially the history of mass killing during the Nazi era constitutes a fundamental argument against active euthanasia. As a consequence, in Germany active euthanasia will not receive legal sanction, although recommendations on rendering dying more bearable are permitted. Copyright (C) 2000 S.Karger AG,Basel.

AB Gunshot injuries to the head and brain are rare in Germany and the rest of western Europe. With the relatively low number of these injuries here, there are no standard methods of diagnosis and management, and there is some controversy over both. Quite a high proportion of such injuries result from suicide attempts and accidents. The main diagnostic procedure available is computed tomography of the head with contrast medium; in certain cases MRI is indicated. The operative management depends on the extent and prognosis of the injury; a ventricular drain is probably indicated in most cases. Debridement of the bullet's path and removal of the projectile are more controversial. Mortality is extremely high after such injuries; if the victim does survive the prognosis is comparable to that following closed cranial injuries.

AB Queering Medicine addresses the role of medicine and psychology in transgender healthcare against a historically heavily charged relationship between transgender persons and professionals. Improved and adequate professional care for transgender persons will only be succesful when prejudices and traditional convictions about the gender dichotomy will be overcome. It is crucial for a professional and respectful relationship with transgender persons that medicine and psychology learn to accept gender individuality and diversity. This article also describes terminology, and briefly depicts the historical background of transgender medicine. Moreover recommended proceedings for Germany, Austria and Switzerland are described and critically appraised. Also, special attention is paid to the recently released German S3-guideline on ,Gender incongruence, genderdysphoria and trans-health'. Last but not least role and duties of endocrinologists dealing with transgender persons is illuminated.

AB Australia and New Zealand have a long and rich tradition of hospice care and palliative medicine. Hospices were originally founded by Christian nuns. Today, being centrally coordinated, care is founded on evidence-based principles and funding is divided to meet the needs of the people served. Current challenges include the rapidly aging population which suffers from a variety of chronic nonmalignant diseases, the assurance of adequate financing, and the debate on euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. In Germany as in Down Under, a future-oriented uniform strategy is necessary in order to ensure that palliative care-with participation from all palliative medicine and hospice programs-is recognized as an integral part of the healthcare system, is promoted in aged and nursing home care, and is delivered to ethnic minorities in a culturally sensitive.

AB Do institutions of citizenship shape public opinion among Muslims in the West? Pitched debates about the future of multiculturalism give strong theoretical reason to think that institutions would cause cross-national variation in minority opinion. Institutions set rules for national integration and communal recognition and send signals regarding social views of diversity. Testing these theorised links, however, requires two steps. First, careful conceptualisation of citizenship, both in individual and communal dimensions, categorises states' citizenship regimes. Second, unique cross-national polling of Muslim minorities in France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States permits analysis of the relationship between institutions and minority political attitudes. Findings demonstrate strong institutional effects on attitudes. However, these effects vary depending on the question asked. Institutions impact on cross-national variation in opinion regarding national identification and women's place in society. There is no evidence of institutional roots of support for suicide terrorism.

AB We investigated whether motivated reasoning rooted in partisanship affects the attributions individuals make about violent attackers' underlying motives and group memberships. Study 1 demonstrated that on the day of the Brexit referendum pro-leavers (vs. pro-remainers) attributed an exculpatory (i.e., mental health) versus condemnatory (i.e., terrorism) motive to the killing of a pro-remain politician. Study 2 demonstrated that pro-immigration (vs. anti-immigration) perceivers in Germany ascribed a mental health (vs. terrorism) motive to a suicide attack by a Syrian refugee, predicting lower endorsement of punitiveness against his group (i.e., refugees) as a whole. Study 3 experimentally manipulated target motives, showing that Americans distanced a politically motivated (vs. mentally ill) violent individual from their in-group and assigned him harsher punishment-patterns most pronounced among high-group identifiers.

AB Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) usually starts in adolescence. International studies report prevalence rates between 3 and 37% (for Germany between 15 and 26%) in adolescents. From a neurobiological perspective, there is evidence that primarily the serotonergic system is involved in the origin and maintenance of this behaviour. NSSI is often used by adolescents to influence aversive affective states, but sometimes serves other functions as well, such as self-punishment or anti-dissociation. To date there are many assessment instruments, some of which are available in a German translation. Regarding psychotherapeutic interventions there is evidence for a good efficacy of dialectical behavioral therapy for adolescents (DBT-A). There is little evidence for psychopharmacological interventions in childhood and adolescence; thus treatment should focus on psychotherapeutic interventions.

AB Background: Public attitudes toward depression and help-seeking behaviour are important factors influencing depressed people to obtain professional help and adequate treatment. OSPI-Europe is a multi-level suicide prevention programme including a public awareness campaign. It was implemented in four regions of four European countries (Germany, Hungary, Ireland and Portugal). This paper reports the results of the evaluation of the campaign, including its visibility and effects of the campaign on stigma associated with depression and help seeking behaviour.
   Methods: A representative general population survey (N = 4004) including measures on personal stigma, perceived stigma, openness to help, perceived value of help, and socio-demographic variables was conducted in the four intervention and four control regions in a cross-sectional pre-post design.
   Results: The public awareness campaign was considerably more visible in Germany and Portugal compared to Ireland and Hungary. Visibility was further affected by age and years of schooling. Personal stigma, perceived stigma and openness toward professional help varied significantly across the four countries. Respondents in the intervention regions showed significantly less personal depression stigma than respondents in the control regions after the campaign. Respondents of the intervention region who were aware of the campaign reported more openness toward seeking professional help than respondents who were unaware of it.
   Conclusion: The OSPI-Europe awareness campaign was visible and produced some positive results. At the same time, it proved to be difficult to show strong, measurable and unambiguous effects, which is in line with previous studies. Public awareness campaigns as conducted within OSPI-Europe can contribute to improved attitudes and knowledge about depression in the general public and produce synergistic effects, in particular when the dissemination of awareness campaign materials is simultaneously reinforced by other intervention levels of a multi-level intervention programme.
   Limitations: The survey was cross-sectional and based on self-report, so no causal inferences could be drawn.

AB In view of the increasing importance of palliative medicine and end-of-life care of neurological patients, a survey from the American Academy of Neurology was translated in a validated fashion and sent to all medical directors of neurological departments in Germany. The topics of the survey comprised - based on clinical scenarios - the withdrawal, or withholding of life-sustaining measures, physician-assisted suicide (PAS) and euthanasia, advance directives and healthcare proxies, principles of palliative care, and ethical and legal questions in end-of-life care. Of 411 directors of departments, 152 participated in the survey. Almost all respondents support a patient's right to refuse life-sustaining treatment. Thirty-two percent think it is illegal to administer analgesics in dose's that risk respiratory depression. Forty-five percent believe that treating terminal dyspnea with morphine is the same as euthanasia. Despite the fact that 88% of the respondents regard advance directives as helpful, only an average of 4% of their patients have completed one. About one third of. the respondents have been confronted with a request by patients for PAS or euthanasia. Thirty-five percent believe that PAS should be made explicitly legal for terminally ill patients. Forty-six percent of the respondents believe that their training in end-of-life care was insufficient, and 91% express interest in education programs on palliative care.

AB ObjectiveCross-sectional studies frequently find higher age associated with negative attitudes towards persons with mental illness. We explore whether attitudes worsen over the life span, or follow a cohort pattern.
   MethodUsing data from three identical population surveys in Germany from 1990, 2001 and 2011 (combined sample n=7835), we performed age-period-cohort analyses determining the association of age, time period and birth-cohort with social distance from a person with either depression (n=3910) or schizophrenia (n=3925), using linear and nonlinear partial least squares regression models.
   ResultsSocial distance increases with age, independent from cohort and period effects, cumulating to an increase of 2.4 (schizophrenia) and 2.3 (depression) on the 28 point social distance scale over the life span (youngest to oldest participant). We found a cohort effect in depression, but not schizophrenia, with decreasing social distance until 1970 and a slight increase in younger cohorts. Period effects were visible particularly in schizophrenia, with growing social distance over time.
   ConclusionConsidering demographic change and the vulnerability of older persons to severe outcomes of mental illness such as suicide, the observed increase of negative attitudes over the life span seems highly relevant. We discuss the role of conservatism and preferences for agreeable social contacts in older age.

AB This sociodemographic study focuses on the disenfranchisement, expulsion and persecution of pathologists in the Third Reich - a group that has, until now, received little systematic attention in scholarly research. The paper attempts to determine the number of pathologists who suffered persecution, the characteristics they shared, and the effects the repression had on their lives - both in the period from 1933 to 1945 and in the post-war period.
   The study is based on primary sources from numerous archives as well as on a systematic re-analysis of published secondary literature on the history of Nazi medicine. A total of 89 disenfranchised pathologists were identified and have been included. The vast majority of these pathologists (90%) were persecuted due to their Jewish ancestry or their relation to Jews. A good two-thirds of these pathologists were employed at a university until their disenfranchisement.
   For two-thirds of these pathologists (n = 62; 70%), documentation of emigration was found. Twenty-four pathologists remained in their home country; of these, five died in concentration camps and two others committed suicide.
   The preferred country for direct immigration was the United States (n = 19), followed by Great Britain (n = 13). Most of these pathologists were able to establish themselves professionally in their destination country, and little inclination to return to Germany after 1945 was shown. The reasons for this were a lack of career options in their home country, the lack of a welcoming culture among colleagues and universities, and the stigmatizing experiences of individual pathologists had during academic appointments and reparations proceedings in Germany. However, especially in recent decades and in part posthumously, these pathologists are being granted honorary, intangible recognition in Germany and Austria. Even though this recognition can no longer provide tangible reparations, it is nevertheless a sign of a gradual change in consciousness.

AB Background: This paper summarizes the current state of research into the role of German neurology during National Socialism (NS) on the basis of extensive secondary literature and key original sources. Summary: As early as 1933, many neurologists and neuroscientists who had been branded as `non-Aryan' and/or politically persecuted had to leave Germany, were driven to suicide or killed in concentration camps. Two years later, the regulatory merger with the Psychiatrists' Association caused the cautious attempts of the institutionally hampered discipline for autonomy to end in complete failure. At the same time, the implementation of racial-hygienic and eugenic paradigms led to a wider definition of `hereditary epilepsy' and an increase in sterilizations of patients suffering from epilepsy. Neurological research institutions, such as the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin-Buch, became involved in the `euthanasia' program between 1939 and 1945, insofar as they dissected the brains of murdered patients under the guise of `accompanying research' and, in this way, produced neurological findings. Key Messages: The Nazi state and German neurology provided each other with `resources' at many levels. After 1945, the professional community showed very little interest in this legacy of neurology in the NS. It was only several generations later that the subject could be approached in an unbiased manner, allowing for comprehensive research projects. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Background In Germany, intoxications cause the bulk of emergencies in children, to be prevented or attenuated by preventive measures. Therefore, knowledge about intoxications is essential for pediatricians. The present work provides general and epidemiologic data about intoxications and most frequent categories and single toxicants.
   Methods Data of intoxications in children and adolescents from 6 German poison centers (2012-2016 and 2002-2016) were retrospectively analyzed. Categorical data are given as meanstandard deviation, most frequent toxicants as a score.
   Results Calls, especially from non-professionals, increased since 2002. Two third of intoxications occurred in small and pre-school children, more frequently in boys (50%) than girls (44%), in adolescents girls predominated (>60%).<14 years intoxications occur mainly at home, day care or school (>95%), in adolescents suicide attempts and abuse come to the fore (13%). 90% of the cases are asymptomatic or mild, with increasing symptoms at higher ages (adolescents 13% vs. small children 1%). Intoxications with drugs are predominantly in adolescents, surfactant containing cleaning agents and cosmetics, sanitary cleaner, tobacco, glow lights and solute descaler in children.
   Discussion and Conclusions Increasing incoming calls from professionals and non-professionals point out the importance of the poison centers. Although intoxications in children and adolescents mainly proceed without or mild symptoms, the relevance of preventive measures especially for children<7 should not be underestimated.

TI Profound long-term effects of Nazism on patient care in gastroenterology
SO ISRAEL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL
LA English
DT Editorial Material
DE Holocaust; antisemitism; gastroenterology; medical history; medical
   ethics
AB It is common knowledge that in addition to the slaughter of millions of innocent civilians, Nazism caused direct damage to patient care by euthanasia of the handicapped, gruesome human experimentation, and ethnic cleansing of German medical schools. In gastroenterology, 53 prominent academicians living in Nazi-occupied Europe were persecuted by the Nazis. Prior studies analyzed this persecution as it related to gastroenterologists rather than to patient care. This study reports, however, that Nazi persecution led to a delay of more than one generation in the clinical application of major inventions by these gastroenterologists. These included flexible fiberoptic endoscopy, which was delayed from 1930 to 1957. Fiberoptic transmission was invented by Heinrich Lamm in 1930. Lamm was exiled from Nazi Germany in 1936, and this technique was clinically applied to endoscopy by Hirschowitz only in 1957. Another innovation was fecal occult blood testing for early colon cancer detection, which was devised by Ismar Boas before 1938. Boas committed suicide under Nazi oppression in 1938 and this modality was clinically applied by Greegor only in 1967. The acceptance of refugees from Nazi Germany or Austria into America or into the future State of Israel helped mitigate some of this damage. For example, eight eminent academic gastroenterologists who fled Nazi-occupied countries to then mandatory Palestine made major contributions to the development of academic gastroenterology in the soon-to-be established State of Israel.

AB This paper reports on the preliminary results of a research project (supported by the Oesterreichische Nationalbank) about Austrian economists under the Nazi regime from 1938 to 1945. The biographies of nearly 200 economists were collected who had close relations to Austria and who were affected in some way or another by the politics of the Third Reich: some as perpetrators, followers or opportunists, others as victims who were persecuted, forced to emigrate or who even lost their lives. To illustrate the diverse fate of Austrian economists after the Anschluss, a brief account is given of three economists who belonged to different economic "schools" and who were affected by the Nazi regime in very different ways: Friedrich Gottl-Ottlilienfeld, an NS party member and adherent of the German Historical School; Friedrich Otto Hertz, a sociologist and economist, who was forced into emigration twice; and Karl Schlesinger, a banker with remarkable theoretical contributions to economics who committed suicide on the day the German Wehrmacht invaded Austria.

   scene
AB Geberth in 2006 stated that "staging is a conscious criminal action on the part of an offender to thwart an investigation." In the present paper two crime scenes staged by handling digital evidence are reported. The first case involves a 50-year-old woman who had been living with the offender for three years before he murdered her at the end of their relationship. He staged the scene as a sex-related crime committed by an unknown perpetrator. The second case concerns a young woman who was found dead in Southern Italy in January 2004 with a gunshot on the forehead. The boyfriend, responsible for the murder, had staged the crime scene as a suicide. Three years earlier in Germany, he had also murdered the victim's mother. In both cases, the correlation of physical and digital forensic evidence was crucial in the definition of the manner of death. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The incidence of coercive measures varies considerably between different countries, from hospital to hospital and even within hospitals between different teams. In the absence of any controlled trials no clear recommendations can be made on the benefits or harmful effects of coercive measures and containment strategies. In a current observational study in 350.000 cases, suicides and absconding behaviour seemed not to differ between psychiatric hospitals with and without locked units in Germany. Several smaller studies indicate that the implementation of an open door policy leads to less coercive measures.
   In this paper, we discuss possible mechanisms how an open door policy might influence the use of coercive measures. Determining factors are discussed: overcrowding, concentration of severely ill patients on locked units, length of stay, therapeutic setting, milieu, staff rotation, staff attitudes, treatment atmosphere and emotional responsiveness in nursing staff.

AB Respiratory failure is the leading cause of death after organophosphorus poisoning. Cardiac complications are rare, serious and little known to clinicians. The authors present a case of a 74-year-old man with refractory cardiogenic shock after taking 200 mL of 80% dichlorvos for a suicide attempt. This study represents the first reported cardiogenic shock resulting from organophosphorus poisoning in the literature, clarifying its hemodynamic features with invasive hemodynamic monitoring (PiCCO; Pulsion Medical Systems AG, Munich, Germany). Additional levosimendan infusion was commenced after insufficient conventional therapies, resulting in an increase in cardiac power index by 236% and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance by 69% after 24 hours of continuous infusion. Despite the immense hemodynamic improvement after levosimendan treatment, the patient died of multiple organ failure 6 days after admission. The authors also discussed the inotropic and vasodilatory effects of levosimendan in this clinical scenario.

AB The clinical use of bupropion as an aid for smoking cessation has raised some concern in clinicians and public opinion. Clinical and postmarketing surveillance studies indicate a favourable side effect profile, but spontaneous reports of suspected adverse reactions to medical authorities indicate adverse neuropsychiatric events to be more frequent than previously thought. Except for the risk of seizures, adverse neuropsychiatric events have not been examined systematically. Insomnia has been reported quite frequently. In the placebo-controlled trials, depression scores were unaffected by bupropion treatment. Suspected adverse events reported to medical authorities in the UK or Germany indicate depression to be the most common psychiatric disorder associated with bupropion treatment. Switch to mania or hypomania is very rare, as are psychosis or organic mental disorders. Suicide attempts associated with bupropion use have been reported as possible adverse events. This topic warrants further attention.

AB Objective: The hypothesis of a lunar influence on human abnormal behavior is still widespread, although research has led to conflicting findings. Therefore, a population-based study to assess the influence of lunar phases on violent crimes was conducted.
   Methods: The study included all serious crimes of battery (aggravated assaults) committed in Middle Franconia (Bavaria, Germany) between 1999 and 2005 (n = 23 142). Data were analyzed regarding lunar phase, sex, and place of crime scene (outdoor vs indoor).
   Results: No significant associations between full, absent, and the moon's interphases and serious crimes of battery could be detected. Furthermore, a Fourier analysis was conducted that failed to produce an association between violence and the moon's phases.
   Discussion: Several possible explanations for the presented results are discussed including biological and social mechanisms.
   Conclusions: The present study fails to find a significant association between lunar phases and crimes of battery. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background A regulatory signal suggested that sertindole was associated with a 10-fold increased risk of death. This observational study aimed to identify deaths and their causes in patients treated with sertindole.
   Methods Sertindole-treated patients in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Hungary, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom were identified and their vital status ascertained. Eventual cause of death and patient and treatment characteristics were ascertained. A nested case-control study compared on-treatment cardiac or unexplained deaths with randomly selected survivors matched on age and gender for potential risk factors.
   Results Eight thousand six hundred eight patients were identified as having initiated treatment with sertindole, for a total 3819 person-years exposure. Thirty-five had died since (all-cause mortality rate 0.92 per 100 person-years exposed). Of these, 15 (43%) had been previously reported to the regulatory authorities. Eight deaths were suicides, of which 2 (25%) had been previously reported; 11 were cardiac deaths, of which 8 (73%) had been reported. On average, patients who died because of cardiac disorders were older, and patients who committed suicide were younger than the other patients who died. The nested case-control study revealed that patients receiving sertindole were at a higher risk of premature cardiac or unexplained death if they had hypertension or other cardiovascular disorders associated with diabetes or metabolic disorder.
   Conclusion Overall and cardiovascular death rates were similar or lower than those observed in premarketing clinical trials. There was a very high reporting rate of all-cause and cardiovascular deaths that could have contributed to the regulatory alert. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID PARASUICIDE; MULTICENTER
AB Background: Injuries of the head and neck with suicidal intention might create serious situations that require rapid and interdisciplinary treatment.
   Methods and Patients: Twenty-seven patients with suicidal head and neck injuries were treated at the Department of otorhino-laryngology, head and neck surgery, University of Wurzburg/Germany, between 1991 and 2002. The medical histories were analyzed retrospectively.
   Results: Twenty-three of them were male, 4 female. Mean age at time of attempted suicidal was 48 years (18-90). One patient was already treated for a psychiatric disorder. None of the patients had a suicidal attempt in the history. Nine patients suffered from a pharynx or larynx trauma after strangulation. Four out of seven patients with cutting or stabbing injuries showed a perforation of the upper air-ways. Nine patients had gunshot traumas, one of them with perforation of the pharynx. Thirteen patients underwent immediate endoscopy under general anaesthesia followed by a neck exploration in 3 patients. Six patients received a temporary tracheotomy. All patients were considered suicidal for the duration of stay in the ENT-department resulting in a permanent supervision. All patients were transferred to a psychiatric unit as soon as possible for further treatment. A statistically significant accumulation was observed during the last third of a year. Over the period of 11 years, suicidal injuries of the head and neck tend to occur more frequently.
   Conclusions: The presented study emphasizes the need of immediate surgical and intensive care treatment of patients with head and neck injuries due to suicide attempts as well as an adequate psychiatric supervision during as well as after the surgical treatment.

AB IMPORTANCE Suicidal behavior is a leading cause of death among adolescents and young adults. In light of the ideation-to-action framework, the delineation of frequency and temporal characteristics of such behavior during this developmental period is crucial.
   OBJECTIVES To provide lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates of suicidal behavior, including ideation, plan, and attempt, in adolescents and young adults of the general population, and to provide information about age at onset, temporal characteristics of suicidal behavior, including duration (number of years between onset and last occurrence) and frequency (number of episodes), and transition patterns across suicidal behaviors.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cross-sectional epidemiological study was conducted in a random community sample of 1180 adolescents and young adults aged 14 to 21 years assessed in 2015 to 2016 in Dresden, Germany. Data analysis was performed from October 2018 to March 2019.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Lifetime and 12-month suicidal behavior (ideation, plan, and attempt) were assessed with a standardized diagnostic interview (Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview) by trained clinical interviewers. The onset, frequency, and duration of suicidal behavior were assessed by questionnaire.
   RESULTS Of the 1180 participants (495 male [weighted percentage, 51.7%]; mean [SD] age, 17.9 [2.3] years), 130 participants (10.7%; 95% CI, 9.0%-12.8%), 65 participants (5.0%; 95% CI, 3.9%-6.5%), and 41 participants (3.4%; 95% CI, 2.4%-4.7%) reported lifetime suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt, respectively. Any lifetime suicidal behavior was reported by 138 participants (11.5%; 95% CI, 9.7%-13.7%). Age-specific cumulative incidence estimates indicated an increase in suicidal behavior during adolescence, starting at age 10 years (<1%), increasing slightly until the age of 12 years (2.2%), and then increasing sharply thereafter until age 20 years (13.5%). There were different patterns among female and male participants for ideation, plan, and attempt, with an overall higher incidence among female participants for ideation (hazard ratio, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.02-2.22; P = .04), for plan (hazard ratio, 3.31; 95% CI, 1.72-6.36; P < .001), and, among those older than 14 years, for attempt (hazard ratio, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.11-8.49; P = .03). Of those with suicidal ideation, 66.0% reported persistent or recurrent ideation over more than 1 year with 75.0% reporting more than 1 episode. Of the participants with lifetime suicidal ideation, 47.0% reported a suicide plan and 23.9% reported a suicide attempt. The transition to suicide plan or attempt occurred mainly in the year of onset of suicidal ideation or plan; of those who transitioned, 74.9% transitioned from ideation to plan, 71.2% transitioned from ideation to attempt, and 85.4% transitioned from plan to attempt in the same year.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE There is an urgent public health need for timely identification of suicidal behavior in adolescents and young adults to terminate persistent or recurrent suicidal tendencies and to interrupt the ideation-to-action transition.

AB The Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network (SFBN) is an international, multisite network investigating the characteristics and course of bipolar disorder. Methods (history, ratings and longitudinal follow-up) are standardized and equally applied in all 7 centres. This article describes demographics and illness characteristics of the first 152 German patients enrolled in them SFBN as well as the results of 2.5 years of follow-up. Patients in Germany were usually enrolled after hospitalisation. More than 72% of the study population suffered from bipolar I disorder and 25% from bipolar 11 disorder. The mean +/- SD age of the study participants was 42.08 +/- 13.5 years, and the mean SD age of onset 24.44 +/- 10.9 years. More than 40% of the sample reported a rapid-cycling course in history, and even more a cycle acceleration overtime. 37% attempted suicide at least once. 36% had an additional Axis I disorder, with alcohol abuse being the most common one, followed by anxiety disorders. During the follow-up period, only 27% remained stable, 56% had a recurrence, 12.8% perceived subsyndromal symptoms despite treatment and regular visits. 27% suffered from a rapid-cycling course during the follow-up period. Recurrences were significantly associated with bipolar I disorder, an additional comorbid Axis I disorder, rapid cycling in history, a higher number of mood stabilizers and the long-term use of typical antipsychotics. Rapid cycling during follow-up was only associated with a rapidcycling course in history, a higher number of mood stabilizers and at least one suicide attempt in history. Copyright (c) 2003 S.

TI More illness in offspring of bipolar patients from the US compared to

AB Background: Evidence suggests that patients with bipolar disorder from the United States have an earlier age of onset and a more difficult course of illness than those from Germany and the Netherlands. These characteristics were related to a greater family burden of psychiatric illness and the experience of more psychosocial adversity in childhood. We hypothesized that this greater illness burden would extend to the offspring of the US patients.
   Methods: 968 outpatients (average age 41) with bipolar illness gave informed consent for participation in a treatment outcome network and filled out a detailed questionnaire about their illness and family history of illness, including whether their offspring had a diagnosis of depression, bipolar disorder, alcohol or substance abuse, suicide attempt or "other" illness. Of those with children, 356 were from the US and 132 were from Europe.
   Results: Compared to the Europeans, offspring of patients from the US had significantly (p < 0.001) more depression, bipolar disorder, drug abuse, and "other" illnesses. The number of illnesses in the offspring was related to the bipolar parent being from the US, having had childhood adversity, more than 20 prior episodes, and more parental psychiatric illness.
   Conclusions: While the findings are limited by their basis on self report, the distribution of the percentages in the US offspring are similar to those of Axelson et al. (2015) who used direct interviews. The higher burden of illness in the offspring and their in direct progenitors from the US compared to Europe warrant new attempts at better treatment and prevention. (c) 2016 The Authors.

AB Impulsive aggression belongs to the key features of borderline personality disorder (BPD). In the development of BPD, serious life events are known to play a major role. Acute and chronic stress has been suggested to inhibit hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) synthesis and to mediate neural plasticity in response to adverse social experiences. Recently it has been reported that the frequency of violent suicide attempts is higher in adult suicide attempters reporting severe childhood sexual abuse and carrying the Val(66)Val genotype of the BDNF Val(66)Met polymorphism. In this study we analysed modulating effects of BDNF Val(66)Met polymorphism on the effects of physical maltreatment, rape and childhood sexual abuse on impulsive aggression. One hundred and fifty-nine BPD patients from Germany and of Caucasian descent were included. Impulsive aggression was assessed by the Buss-Durkee-Hostility Inventory (BDHI). Childhood sexual abuse accounted for 23.6% of the variance of BDHI sum score. Childhood sexual abuse decreased BDHI sum score in BDNF Val/Val carriers but not in Met carriers. In contrast to previous findings this study analysing a specific gene x environment interaction in BPD patients suggests a decreasing effect of childhood sexual abuse on impulsive aggression in BPD patients, particularly in BDNF Val/Val carriers. The interrelations between serious life events, impulsive aggression and the BDNF Val(66)Met polymorphism as well as their implication for BPD are far from understood and require further investigations.

AB Background: Patients with bipolar disorder from the US have more early-onset illness and a greater familial loading for psychiatric problems than those from the Netherlands or Germany (abbreviated here as Europe). We hypothesized that these regional differences in illness burden would extend to the patients siblings.
   Methods: Outpatients with bipolar disorder gave consent for participation in a treatment outcome network and for filling out detailed questionnaires. This included a family history of unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, suicide attempt, alcohol abuse/dependence, drug abuse/dependence, and "other" illness elicited for the patients' grandparents, parents, spouses, offspring, and siblings. Problems in the siblings were examined as a function of parental and grandparental problems and the patients' adverse illness characteristics or poor prognosis factors (PPFs).
   Results: Each problem in the siblings was significantly (p < 0.001) more prevalent in those from the US than in those from Europe. In the US, problems in the parents and grandparents were almost uniformly associated with the same problems in the siblings, and sibling problems were related to the number of PPFs observed in the patients.
   Limitations: Family history was based on patient report.
   Conclusions: Increased familial loading for psychiatric problems extends through 4 generations of patients with bipolar disorder from the US compared to Europe, and appears to "breed true" into the siblings of the patients. In addition to early onset, a variety of PPFs are associated with the burden of psychiatric problems in the patients' siblings and offspring. Greater attention to the multigenerational prevalence of illness in patients from the US is indicated.

AB Objectives: In this 6-month open-label extension (OLE) of NCT01491035 (a 14-day, open-label, pharmacokinetic/safety lead-in study), the long-term safety and tolerability of vortioxetine (5-20mg/day) were investigated in children and adolescents with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of depressive or anxiety disorder in the United States or Germany. The study also was designed to provide data to inform dose selection and titration in future pediatric studies with vortioxetine. Methods: Safety evaluations included spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs), the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), and the Pediatric Adverse Events Rating Scale (PAERS; clinician administered). Clinical effectiveness was determined by Clinical Global Impressions. Comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was permitted, including concomitant use of stimulant medication (US sites only). Results: Of the 47 patients who completed the lead-in period, 41 continued into the OLE. Most patients (n=39 [95%]) continued their previous dose regimen. Twenty-one patients (51%) withdrew during the OLE; the most common primary reasons were administrative [n=8], AEs [n=4], and lack of efficacy [n=3]. Thirty-five patients (85%) had 1 AE, 86% of which were mild or moderate in severity. Five patients (12%) reported a severe AE, none of which was considered related to study medication. The most common AEs (10%) were headache (27%), nausea (20%), dysmenorrhea (females; 19%), and vomiting (15%), with no relationship between AE intensity and age or dose. Five patients reported instances of suicidal ideation during the OLE, one of whom also reported this during the lead-in period. Two patients had nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior; one had a nonfatal suicide attempt. Throughout the study, there was a decrease over time in the incidence and intensity of AEs collected using the PAERS. Effectiveness assessment indicated a trend toward improvement based on numeric results. Conclusion: This OLE confirms the findings from the lead-in study, which concluded that a dosing strategy of 5-20mg/day is safe, well tolerated, and suitable for future clinical studies of vortioxetine in pediatric patients.

AB Objectives: We examined the attitude towards the importance of medical psychotherapy among physicians working in a hospital. We focused on their opinion about the general role of medical psychotherapy within the health care system as well as on their opinion about the importance of medical psychotherapy in different clinical situations.
   Method: 105 physicians with various clinical specialties were interviewed using a questionnaire designed for this purpose.
   Results: From the point of view of the interviewed physicians, medical psychotherapy plays an important role. Especially medical psychotherapists are considered to be competent in cases of life-threatening situations resulting from mental disorders (such as suicide, anorexia nervosa), in psychopharmacological treatment as well as in cases of medically unexplained physical symptoms. Furthermore, medical competence in psychotherapy is requested wherever there is close connection to physical illness (such as stressful events in medical contexts).
   Conclusions: Especially in times of increasing specialization of physicians there is a need for medical psychotherapy in inpatient health care and clinical consultation.

AB Background: The herbicide BASTA(R) (AgrEvo, Germany), containing glufosinate ammonium (20%) and an anionic surfactant, polyoxyethylene alkylether sulfate (33%), is widely used. In acute oral BASTA poisoning, patients develop a variety of clinical signs, including disturbed consciousness, convulsions, and apnea. These effects are suspected to be due to the effects of glufosinate on the central nervous system. Case Report: A 60-year-old man ingested 500 mL of BASTA herbicide in a suicide attempt. He developed not only unconsciousness, respiratory distress, and convulsions but also an increase in urine output (7885 mL/d), elevated serum sodium (167 mEq/L), elevated plasma osmolality (332 mOsm/kg), and a decrease in both urine osmolality (200 mOsm/kg) and urine specific gravity (1.003), which suggested the development of diabetes insipidus. The plasma level of antidiuretic hormone remained within the normal range (1.3 pg/mL), despite high plasma osmolality. The administration of desmopressin was successful in normalizing urine volume, specific gravity, and osmolality. Serum sodium corrected gradually within 48 hours. The possible mechanisms causing the diabetes insipidus are discussed.

AB The current knowledge of data on the frequency of psychiatric diagnosis and treatment in emergency medicine is diverse. The purpose of this study was to extend the knowledge of pre-clinical data especially in an urban region like the Ruhrgebiet, Germany. We analyzed all of the emergency protocols (DIVI 98 Version N-4.0+n-4) of the City Essen in 2007. A total of 14,526 records (85.9 %) could be analyzed. The frequency of psychiatric diagnosis was close to 6.5 %. Intoxication, attempted suicide and a state of arousal were the most common psychiatric emergencies. The result of this study is not very different to others. But there seems to be a local exception. The group of patients with severe intoxication was hospitalized mainly at hospitals with internal medical care units and not at purely psychiatric hospitals. The use of psychopharmacotherapy in an emergency pre-hospital setting is still very rare.

AB Background. Despite improvements in rescue, medical care and rehabilitation, the life expectancy of patients suffering from traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) remains limited. The causes are for this are manifold.
   Objective. Analysis of the etiology, life expectancy and the causes of death in patients with TSCI.
   Methods. A total of 190 patients with TSCI were evaluated. Inclusion criteria were an age at the time of injury of 16-60 years old. Further criteria to be met were the absence of life-limiting comorbid conditions and a minimum survival time of 1 year after the occurrence of injury. Data collection was made during inpatient and outpatient treatment and stored in a database. Every death notice induced extensive investigation into the circumstances of death.
   Results. Spinal cord injury occurred at an average age of 33.8 years. The most common causes were falls (48.4%), followed by road traffic accidents (35.8%). Swimming accidents, most notably diving into shallow water, made up 4.2% of the causes. The average life expectancy of paraplegic patients was 30.8 years and tetraplegic patients only reached an average survival time of 19.6 years. The leading cause of death in tetraplegic patients was pneumonia (33.0%), followed by cardiovascular disease (18.0%), suicide and malignant tumors (11.0% each). Paraplegic patients died primarily due to cardiovascular disease (35.6%), followed by malignant tumors (20.0%) and pneumonia (16.7%). In both tetraplegic and paraplegic groups, no significant differences between complete and incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) regarding the life expectancy was observed (tetraplegic patients 19.3/20.2 years, paraplegic patients 30.6/32.9 years, respectively). The life expectancy of tetraplegic individuals in Germany varies depending on their relevant health insurance cover between 16.4 and 23.8 years.
   Conclusion. In spite of considerable improvements in rescue and emergency services as well as treatment modalities, the life expectancy of patients suffering from TSCI remains limited. Especially patients with high level lesions resulting in tetraplegia, die prematurely due to pneumonia. The longer a patient survives SCI and the lower the level of lesion, the more likely a cause of death related to age-associated diseases becomes. Suicide is very common in tetraplegic patients with incomplete SCI. The extent of health insurance coverage has a considerable influence regarding life expectancy of tetraplegic patients in Germany.

AB This study is the first to explore the twin influences of online propaganda and news media on Islamists. We conducted 44 in-depth interviews with cognitively and behaviorally radicalized Islamist prisoners in Austria as well as former Islamists in Germany and Austria. We found that online propaganda and news media had interdependent influences on Islamists' rejections of non-Muslims and Western politics, as well as on their willingness to use violence and commit suicide. Cognitively radicalized individuals were influenced by propaganda that blamed non-Muslims for opposing Islam; this was reinforced by online mainstream news reports of right-wing populism and extremism that propagandists selectively distributed via social media. Among behaviorally radicalized individuals, exposure to propaganda and news reports depicting Muslim war victims contributed to the radicalized individuals' willingness to use violence. Moreover, propaganda and media reports that extensively personalized perpetrators of violence strengthened radicalized individuals' motivations to imitate the use of violence.

DE Benjamin; Institute of Social Research; Adorno; Horkheimer; Brecht
AB Walter Benjamin (1892-1940) and Gerhard Scholem (1897-1982) were bound by a deep friendship, intertwined since 1912 and continuing until 1940, when Benjamin committed suicide in Port Bou, terrified of being handed over to the Nazis. The two intellectuals, both of Jewish faith, made different existential choices: Benjamin remained in Germany until the racial persecution of the Nazi regime forced him to roam around Europe, while Scholem settled in Palestine and worked at the University of Jerusalem, where he could devote himself to the study of Jewish mysticism.
   The essay concerns the correspondence between the two scholars, particularly on Zionism, the proximity of Benjamin to the communism, the relationship with the scholars of the Institute of Social Research directed by Max Horkheimer and with Bertolt Brecht. On the background of the correspondence is clearly visible Benjamin's attempt not to give up his intellectual research and friendship, even though he was forced to look for marginal and peripheral places where he could survive in a Europe by then handed over to Hitler's wars.

AB PurposeSo far, only little is known about antidepressant off-label use in pediatric patients. This is the first study examining the prevalence and the risks of off-label antidepressant prescriptions in minors over time in Germany and analyzing patterns regarding age, sex, drug class, and type of off-label use.
   MethodsWe used claims data of about two million individuals (<18y) to calculate the share of off-label antidepressant prescriptions for the years 2004 to 2011, stratified by age, sex, and drug class. Off-label prescriptions were analyzed regarding underlying diagnoses, the prescribing doctor's specialty, and the type of off-label use. Incidence rates of adverse events were calculated for off- and on-label use, and the risk of suicidal events associated with off- or on-label use was examined in a nested case-control study.
   ResultsThe prevalence of off-label prescriptions decreased from 58.0% to 40.9%. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were more frequently prescribed off-label than tricyclic antidepressants (37.7% vs 17.5% in 2011). The most common type of off-label use was off-label use by age, followed by off-label use by indication, and off-label use by contraindication. Adverse events were rare with no significant differences between on- and off-label use.
   ConclusionsAlthough off-label antidepressant use in minors decreased over time, it is still common. However, this rather indicates a lack of approved drugs for the treatment of depression in this population than inappropriate medical treatment. This is supported by the fact that off-label use was not associated with a higher risk of adverse events than on-label use.

AB Refugee immigration to European countries including the Federal Republic of Germany has increased rapidly over the last few years; however, little information on refugee morbidity and mortality in Europe is available.
   This study, conducted at the Department of Forensic Medicine of the Charit, - University Medicine in Berlin, and the Federal Institute of Forensic and Social Medicine Berlin, involved a prospective analysis of autopsy data from 38 refugee fatalities during a 30-month period.
   Between January 2015 and June 2017, a total of 38 autopsies were carried out on refugees aged between 0 and 78 years old, 32 of which were male and 6 female. In 66% of the cases an unnatural manner of death was recorded, of which the leading causes were accidents (32%), followed by suicides (24%), homicides (24%) and 16% were due to drug intoxication. Of the accidental deaths, falls from a height and drowning were most common. Natural manners of death made up less than one third of fatalities, whereby cardiovascular diseases were predominant and one individual died from an infectious disease.
   Refugees represent a heterogeneous population group. Considering the extraordinary and diverse burdens imposed on refugees by virtue of their predicament, numerous factors can lead to adverse impacts on their physical and mental health. Further studies will be necessary to generate sufficient data about the morbidity and mortality of refugees in Germany for the development and application of customized preventive measures.

AB ObjectiveWe previously found that compared with Europe more parents of the USA patients were positive for a mood disorder, and that this was associated with early onset bipolar disorder. Here we examine family history of psychiatric illness in more detail across several generations.MethodsA total of 968 outpatients (average age 41) with bipolar disorder from four sites in the USA and three in the Netherlands and Germany (abbreviated as Europe) gave informed consent and provided detailed demographic and family history information on a patient questionnaire. Family history of psychiatric illness (bipolar disorder, unipolar depression, suicide attempt, alcohol abuse, substance abuse, and other illness) was collected for each parent, four grandparents, siblings, and children.ResultsParents of the probands with bipolar disorder from the USA compared with Europe had a significantly higher incidence of both unipolar and bipolar mood disorders, as well as each of the other psychiatric conditions listed above. With a few exceptions, this burden of psychiatric disorders was also significantly greater in the grandparents, siblings, and children of the USA versus European patients.ConclusionThe increased complexity of psychiatric illness and its occurrence over several generations in the families of patients with bipolar disorder from the USA versus Europe could be contributing to the higher incidence of childhood onsets and greater virulence of illness in the USA compared with Europe. These data are convergent with others suggesting increased both genetic and environmental risk in the USA, but require replication in epidemiologically-derived populations with data based on interviews of the family members.

AB Background: Little is known about the practice of palliative sedation (PS) in Germany. This paper presents an analysis of sedation-related data obtained from the German standardized core documentation system (HOPE) for palliative care patients.
   Methods: HOPE was complemented by an optional module on ethical decision making (EDM) which was pretested in 2004, data was collected in 2005-6 during the annual 3-month census. Data was analyzed descriptively from palliative care units (PCU - representative) and inpatient hospice (H - non-representative control group). Chi(2) test was used to test for differences between the reported data per item and year within one kind of setting (significance level p <= 0.05). Free-text entries were categorized inductively.
   Results: Datasets were obtained for 1,944 patients (P) with EDM. PS was performed in 13.0/11.8% (2005/2006) P in palliative care units (PCU) and 25.5/22.9% in hospices (H). Main reasons for PS in PCU were dyspnea, pain, fear or anxiety, in H reasons were inconsistent, high prevalence of psychosocial reasons. Most PS in PCU and about half of the PS in H were intermittent. Sedated P were younger than non-sedated. Only 7 P received PS after asking for euthanasia. The most used medication was midazolam.
   Conclusions: This study reveals a first insight into the use and practice of PS in German PCU and H. For a more detailed systematic survey into the course of decision-making and procedures, a new complementary optional module on PS is being developed by the HOPE group.

TI DGPPN recommendations on quality indicators for schizophrenia
SO NERVENARZT

DT Article
DE Quality indicators; Psychiatry; Schizophrenia; DGPPN; Mental disorders
ID MENTAL-HEALTH-CARE; INPATIENT TREATMENT; ASSURANCE
AB In Germany, several quality indicators have been proposed for the measurement of quality of mental healthcare. Some of these quality indicators have been tested in feasibility studies. The German Association for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (DGPPN) established the "Task Force Quality Indicators (QI)" that, based on previous experience in the development and pilot testing of indicators, considered the further development and practical realization of QI for schizophrenia.
   The aim was to select a set of QI for schizophrenia that can also be applied to other diagnoses or used in generic measurements. Another goal was to focus on high feasibility of indicators.
   In a multistage selection process, the DGPPN Task Force selected QI that focus on essential quality aspects from an inventory of 161 existing QI developed by national and international research groups. Indicators were adapted in consultation with the "trialogic forum" of the DGPPN.
   The DGPPN proposes the following ten indicators for quality measurement in mental healthcare for schizophrenia: QI1 Long-term treatment/Monitoring of side effects, QI2 Seclusion and restraint, QI3 Number of suicides, QI4 Psychoeducational-oriented intervention for significant others, QI5 Timely beginning of outpatient treatment after discharge from inpatient treatment, QI6 Aggression management - inpatient treatment, QI7 Diagnostic procedures/Physical examination, QI8 Antipsychotic polypharmacy, QI9 Rehabilitation/Vocational rehabilitation, QI10 Diagnostic procedures/Psychosocial functioning.
   Most of our proposed QI have to be measured by means of additional data documentation. Based on prior experience in the pilot testing of QI, the DGPPN estimates that the additional efforts in data documentation would be manageable, but have to be refinanced. The indicators will be tested in feasibility studies in different mental healthcare hospitals in Germany.

TI Common Causes of Poisoning: Etiology, Diagnosis and Treatment

LA English
DT Article
ID DOSE ACTIVATED-CHARCOAL; POSITION PAPER; DRUGS; CONSUMPTION; TOXICOLOGY;
   TOXICITY; ETHYLENE; METHANOL; THERAPY; GLYCOL
AB Background: In 2011, German hospitals treated approximately 205 000 patients suffering from acute poisoning. Change is seen over time both in the types of poisoning that occur and in the indications for specific treatment.
   Methods: This article is based on a selective review of the literature, with special attention to the health reports of the German federal government, the annual reports of the GIZ-Nord Poisons Center (the poison information center for the four northwestern states of Germany, i.e. Bremen, Hamburg, Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein), and the recommendations of international medical associations.
   Results: From 1996 to 2011, the GIZ-Nord Poisons Center answered more than 450 000 inquiries, most of which involved exposures to medical drugs, chemicals, plants, foods, or cosmetics. Poisoning was clinically manifest in only a fraction of these cases. Ethanol intoxication is the commonest type of acute poisoning and suicide by medical drug overdose is the commonest type of suicide by poisoning. Death from acute poisoning is most commonly the result of either smoke inhalation or illegal drug use. Severe poisoning is only rarely due to the ingestion of chemicals (particularly detergents and cleaning products), cosmetics, or plant matter. Medical procedures that are intended to reduce the absorption of a poison or enhance its elimination are now only rarely indicated. Antidotes (e. g., atropine, 4-dimethylaminophenol, naloxone, toluidine blue) are available for only a few kinds of poisoning. Randomized clinical trials of treatment have been carried out for only a few substances.
   Conclusion: Most exposures to poisons can be treated with general emergency care and, if necessary, with symptomatic intensive-care measures. Poison information centers help ensure that cases of poisoning are dealt with efficiently. The data they collect are a useful aid to toxicological assessment and can serve as a point of departure for research projects.

ID SUICIDE
AB Background This paper reports the findings of an analytical comparison of several macro indicators collected routinely from institutional sources in Europe. Methods We carried out a review of macro indicators capable of providing a synthetic description of mental health status and the availability of psychiatric care in European countries. These were collected routinely from sources such as WHO, OECD, EUROSTAT, and IMS. The evaluation of temporal trends in each nation permits subsequent comparisons between countries. Results In all European countries, a decreased trend of suicides was observed in the period 1980 - 2000, with the exception of Ireland and ( partially) of Spain. In Ireland, the increased trend was particularly strong, with a high risk in young and adult males. Portugal and Greece had respectively the highest and the lowest rates of undetermined causes of death. Most countries that were high consumers of alcohol in the initial period of observation had a rate above the national mean until 1980, after which consumption decreased. Most nations that were low consumers in 1960 had rates below the mean until 1980, when the rates progressively increased. However, a general decrease of alcohol-related deaths was apparent in all countries. Mortality associated with mental disorder increased, most clearly during the mid 1980s. The number of psychiatrists per 100,000 inhabitants ranged from 3.6 in Spain to 17.5 in Finland; of child psychiatrists, from 0.9 in Germany to 5.1 in Portugal. Psychiatric beds ranged from 0.4 per 1,000 inhabitants in Italy and Spain to 1.3 in Ireland. Nine countries showed a trend towards a reduction in psychiatric beds, whilst in a further five countries no change was observed. Rates of long-stay patients varied from 9.5 in the UK to 84 in Belgium, with a generally decreasing trend. The use of outpatient facilities differed markedly between countries, although there was a general increase over time. Official data were scarce in relation to the sale of psychotropic drugs. IMS data indicated increasing consumption in all European countries for antidepressant and antipsychotic medication. Conclusions The official data resources available for European countries seem to indicate some discrepancies, probably relating to methods of recording. Better co-ordination in the collection of data about mental health status in the European Union and an improvement of the quality in available services is needed.

DT Article
DE Psychiatric emergency situation; Psychopharmacology; Suicide attempt;

ID MEDICAL CLEARANCE; ROOM; ANXIETY; VISITS
AB Background. Psychiatric emergency situations (PES) are frequent in emergency departments (EDs). There are, however, only few investigations that focus on the prevalence of these patients or on diagnostic and therapeutic standards. These PESs in EDs should be treated according to standards comparable to medically disabled patients. Thus it is necessary to learn more about the diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities in EDs, about the procedures and the decision-making process whether these patients are transferred to further outpatient or inpatient treatment.
   Materials and methods. A survey was conducted in EDs throughout Germany and 1,073 were contacted and asked to participate. The questionnaire consisted of questions concerning the size of the ED and of the hospital (e.g. number of patients and physicians), the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, the diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities, standard procedures for dealing with PES and the method of care in six typical case reports.
   Results. A total of 74 EDs participated (76% interdisciplinary EDs) with an average of 22,827 +/- 12,303 patients per year in the ED. Psychiatry as a medical discipline was integrated into 10 EDs (14%) and psychiatric competence could be activated in 84% of EDs. Participating EDs reported prevalence rates of 15% mentally disordered patients and 9% of patients who required psychiatric diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Of the patients 2% presented after suicide attempts and 3% were considered to be aggressive. Approximately 50% of all PESs were related to substance abuse disorders. An average of 2.5 +/- 4.2 (range 0-25)members of the medical and nursing staff were injured during a 1-year period by violent patients. Legal actions against the will of patients were initiated in 81% of EDs. Standardized diagnostic screening instruments or self-rating questionnaires were used in only four EDs. As standard procedures for the diagnostic work-up of psychiatric patients (medical clearance) physical examination, measurement of heart rate and blood pressure and conducting of some laboratory tests (glucose, blood cell count, electrolytes and renal function) were named. Diazepam (91%), lorazepam (88%) and haloperidol (87%) were considered to be indispensable psychopharmacological agents in the ED.
   Conclusions. In the majority of participating EDs, diagnostic standards for PES were known but were not routinely applied. It has to be assumed that many psychiatric disorders, in particular suicide attempts and suicidal ideation are not discovered. In many EDs psychiatric knowledge was available but a psychiatric consultation was only rarely requested. Physicians in the ED report a high degree of legal uncertainty with psychiatric patients. The use of screening instruments is recommended.

AB Objectives Patients with advanced disease sometimes express a wish to hasten death (WTHD). In 2012, we published a systematic review and meta-ethnography of qualitative studies examining the experience and meaning of this phenomenon. Since then, new studies eligible for inclusion have been reported, including in Europe, a region not previously featured, and specifically in countries with different legal frameworks for euthanasia and assisted suicide. The aim of the present study was to update our previous review by including new research and to conduct a new analysis of available data on this topic.
   Setting Eligible studies originated from Australia, Canada, China, Germany, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Thailand and USA.
   Participants Studies of patients with life-threatening conditions that had expressed the WTHD.
   Design The search strategy combined subject terms with free-text searching of PubMed MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL and PsycInfo. The qualitative synthesis followed the methodology described by Noblit and Hare, using the 'adding to and revising the original' model for updating a meta-ethnography, proposed by France et al. Quality assessment was done using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist.
   Results 14 studies involving 255 participants with life-threatening illnesses were identified. Five themes emerged from the analysis: suffering (overarching theme), reasons for and meanings and functions of the WTHD and the experience of a timeline towards dying and death. In the context of advanced disease, the WTHD emerges as a reaction to physical, psychological, social and existential suffering, all of which impacts on the patient's sense of self, of dignity and meaning in life.
   Conclusions The WTHD can hold different meanings for each individual-serving functions other than to communicate a genuine wish to die. Understanding the reasons for, and meanings and functions of, the WTHD is crucial for drawing up and implementing care plans to meet the needs of individual patients.

AB Background: Precise knowledge of the epidemiology of suicidality provides necessary information for designing prevention programs. The aims of the present study were to investigate the prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideas and attempts in the general population of Europe.
   Methods: The European Study on the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMED) is a cross-sectional household survey carried out in a probability representative sample of non-institutionalised adults (aged 18 years or older) of six European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain). The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0) was administered to 21,425 individuals.
   Results: Lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation was 7.8% and of suicidal attempts 1.3%. Being women, younger and divorced or widowed were associated with a higher prevalence of suicide ideation and attempts. Psychiatric diagnoses were strongly related to suicidality. Among them, major depressive episode (Rate ratio 2.9 for lifetime ideas and 4.8 for lifetime attempts), dysthymia (RR 2.0 and 1.6), GAD (RR 1.8 and 2.3 for lifetime), PTSD (RR 1.9 and 2.0) and alcohol dependence (RR 1.7 and 2.5) were the most important. Population attributable risks for lifetime suicidal attempt was 28% for major depression.
   Limitations: Information about suicidal ideas and attempts was self reported, psychiatric diagnoses were made using fully structured lay interviews rather than clinician-administered interviews.
   Conclusions: In spite of meaningful country variation in prevalence, risk factors for suicidality are consistent in the European countries. Population prevention programmes should focus on early diagnosis and treatment of major depression and alcohol abuse and in those individuals with recent appearance of suicidal ideas.

AB Aim There has been an ongoing debate about a legalisation of active euthanasia (AE) in Germany. Palliative care education in German medical schools seeks to foster and cultivate a negative attitude toward AE, but little is known about its effectiveness in this respect. The aim of this study was to assess attitudes toward AE among students with and without palliative medicine tuition (PMT).
   Methods The link to an anonymised online questionnaire was sent out to 1,092 third, fifth and sixth year medical students (YMS) in August -November 2006 at two German universities: university one (U1) with compulsory and additional optional PMT and university two (U2) without any PMT. Thirteen questions addressed active, passive or indirect euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (statistic: mean +/- SD (range), Wilcoxon, Whitney U Test, significance p<0.05).
   Results Response rate was 17.5%; 59.2% of the questionnaires were returned from U1 and 40.8% from U2; 28.3% of the students were male. Whereas 50% of third YMS at U1 and 36.7% at U2 favoured a legalisation of AE, this was true for 22.4% sixth YMS at U1 and 35.7% at U2. At U1, the number of students who would want to make use of AE for themselves decreased considerably (70%-44.9%) but less at U2; main reasons were 'unbearable suffering' and 'circumstances that lack dignity'. Of all students, 21.1% at U1 and 37.2% at U2 could imagine to perform AE in patients, even though 72.6% at U1 and 78.2% at U2 think its legalisation would promote misuse.
   Conclusions The high proportion of pro-AE attitudes gives reason to reconsider both 'standard' and palliative medicine tuition for medical students.

AB Aims To evaluate the safety and tolerability of duloxetine during routine clinical care in women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in Germany, and in particular, to identify previously unrecognized safety issues as uncommon adverse reactions, and the influence of confounding factors present in clinical practice on the safety profile of duloxetine. Methods Office-based urologists, gynaecologists and primary care physicians were asked to document women newly started on treatment for moderate to severe symptoms of SUI. Six thousand eight hundred and fifty-four patients from urologist/gynaecologist practices and 5879 primary care patients were assessed. In a two-armed, observational study with parallel 12week (urologists and gynaecologists) or 24week (primary care physicians) design, patients were treated with duloxetine or other conservative treatment. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of adverse events (AEs). Results Baseline characteristics differed slightly between patient groups and studies. Duloxetine doses in most patients were lower than recommended. Overall, AE frequency with duloxetine was lower than in controlled studies (15.9% (95% CI 14.9, 16.9) and 9.1% (95% CI 8.2, 10.0) in the 12and 24week treatment groups, respectively), but exhibited a similar qualitative spectrum. In the logistic regression models, the following factors were associated with greater AE risk: investigator specialization (gynaecologist vs. urologist and primary care physician), initial duloxetine dose (80 vs. 20mgday1) and use of any concomitant medication. Within the 24week study, a positive screen for depressive disorder was surprisingly common, but no case of attempted suicide was reported in either study. Conclusions Our results from German clinical practice show that women with SUI were often treated with duloxetine doses lower than recommended. This was associated with a low incidence of AEs. Suicide attempts were not reported.

AB Background: Doxylamine (DA) is widely available in pharmacies without prescription and can be used in suicidal intention because of its sedative and anticholinergic properties. Research of literature shows that only a few publications deal with post-mortem evidence of DA and its interpretation during toxicological examination.
   Material and methods: In this study, all cases with a positive detection of DA during toxicological analyses with high-performance liquid chromatography in the time period 2000 to 2010 at the Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences in Berlin, Germany were retrospectively analysed and interpreted, taking into account police investigations, autopsy results and toxicological analyses.
   Results: In total, 22 cases with DA intoxications were discovered (male = 16/female = 6, age-at-death range 17 to 90 years). Maximum blood concentration was measured at 77.5 mu g/mL Cause of death was due to DA intoxication in eight suicide cases; seven of those were combined intoxications (DA and other substances, particularly diphenhydramine). During the evaluated time period no monointoxications with DA were discovered.
   Conclusion: Benchmarks published in past literature are meant as orientation during evaluation of post-mortem DA evidence. These should not be used as absolute values and need to be interpreted individually in each case. Post-mortem redistribution needs to be considered as a main factor in alteration of DA concentration measurement. Furthermore, proof of DA ingestion found in gastric content should only be interpreted quantitatively due to unreliable calculation of the ingested amount. In conclusion, a variety of factors, such as the time period between time of death and the time of the first toxicological analysis, the condition of the body and the findings at autopsy, must also be critically considered.

AB At the moment, no recent study about plant exposures in Germany and in the federal states the Poisons Information Centre (PIC) Erfurt is serving is available. To get new information about important characteristics of plant exposures like the development of frequency, plants, age groups involved, circumstances of exposure, and symptom severity, we conducted a retrospective study including all human plant exposures reported to the PIC Erfurt over a 10-year period from the beginning of 2001 to the end of 2010. In total, 13001 plant exposures were registered. While the absolute number of plant exposures discontinuously increased from 1110 in 2001 to 1467 in 2009, and decreased to 1157 in 2010, their relative frequency to all human exposures fell from 9.2% in 2001 to 5.9% in 2010. Age groups: children 87.5% (toddler 60.0%); adults 11.3% (middle-aged adults 5.2%). Gender: female 39.0% and male 41.2%. Circumstances: accidental 91.6%, unknown 4.6%, abuse 2.9%, suicide 0.9%. Severity of symptoms: none to slight 85.5%, moderate 1.7%, unknown 12.7%, severe 0.1% (in total 9, one 4-year-old girl, involved plant genera: Aconitum, Arum, Chelidonium, Datura, Brugmansia, Dieffenbachia, Ricinus, 2 Taxus), fatal 0.03% (in total 4, involved plant genera: 2 Aconitum, 2 Taxus). In comparison to all human exposures, the relative frequency of severe symptoms in accidental and intentional plant exposures by abuse was significantly lower but as high by suicide. The significant higher involvement of children resulted mainly in none or mild symptoms. Severe symptoms could mostly be observed in adults in intentional plant exposures or when poisonous plants were mistaken for eatable. Because some plant exposures resulted in severe symptoms and even death, their dangerousness should not be trivialised.

AB Objective To investigate the prevalence and psychosocial correlates of suicidal behaviour in a representative sample of children and adolescents in Germany. Methods Suicidal behaviour was assessed in the BELLA study in a sample of 2,863 families with children aged 7-17 using the corresponding questions from the child behavior check list and the youth self report. Self-reported as well as parent-reported measures of overall mental health problems, anxiety, depression, aggressive and delinquent behaviour, attention deficit-/hyperactivity as well as health-related quality of life were also administered. Results Self-mutilation and/or suicidal attempts within the last six months were reported by 2.9% of the adolescents 11-17 years of age. Suicidal thoughts were reported by 3.8% of the same group of adolescents. The prevalence rates reported by the parents were 1.4% for self-mutilation and/or suicidal attempts and 2.2% for suicidal thoughts. The prevalence of parent-reported self-mutilation/suicidal attempts in children below 11 years of age was very low. Youth reporting suicidal behaviour were older than youth not reporting suicidal behaviour. Children and adolescents exhibiting suicidal behaviour reported significantly more general mental health problems, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and hyperactivity as well as lower health-related quality of life. Conclusions There is a strong connection between suicidal behaviour and emotional and behavioural problems, especially with symptoms of depression, anxiety and hyperactivity. The association observed between attention deficit-/hyperactivity and suicidal behaviour requires further investigation. The differences in the extent of reported suicidal behaviour in adolescents between the self-and parent-ratings and the degree of confidentiality in the collection of the data are subjects for future research.

AB The influence of legal offences on the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is a common discussion. A population of imprisoned delinquents diagnosed with ASPD was compared to delinquents without ASPD concerning sociodemographic, criminological and clinical characteristics to determine if ASPD can differentiate delinquents apart from committing legal offences.
   A total of 36 violent offenders with diagnosed ASPD and 29 violent offenders without ASPD were recruited in the prison of Straubing (Germany); 28 control subjects without previous convictions were recruited in the German population. All subjects were examined with the SKID-I and SKID-II, GAF, BIS-11, EPI and K-FAF.
   Violent offenders with ASPD differ from violent offenders without ASPD concerning the following parameters: high values of impulsivity, aggression, irritability, neuroticism and extraversion; low levels of psychosocial functioning, cumulative aEurobroken home" indicators and antisocial behaviour before the age of 11 (aEuroearly starters").
   Some features are suitable for the discrimination between offenders with or without ADPD, but our results indicate that samples are better distinguished by a dimensional approach, oriented toward their degree of characteristics.

AB It was hypothesized that intrinsic religiousness helps to cope with increased salience of terrorism. Intrinsically religious and non-religious participants were told that it is highly probable or highly improbable, respectively, that terrorist attacks will occur in Germany. High probability of terrorism only negatively affected the mood of nonreligious participants but not of intrinsically religious participants (Study 1). Using as a realistic context Of investigation the terrorist suicide bombings in Istanbul, the authors replicated this finding and shed some light on the underlying psychological processes (Study 2): On the day of the terrorist attacks (high salience of terrorism), nonreligious participants experienced less positive emotions and less self-efficacy than did intrinsically religious participants. Two months later (low salience of terrorism), no differences were found between nonreligious and intrinsically religious participants with regard to mood and self-efficacy. Mediational analyses suggested that the mood effects were associated with differences in the reported sense of self-efficacy.

AB Background: Legal provisions in The Netherlands and Belgium currently allow physicians to actively end a patient's life at his or her request under certain conditions. The term that is used for this is "euthanasia." Discussion: The same term, "euthanasia," was used in Germany during the Nazi regime for a program of cleansing the "German nation" in which untold thousands of persons were denied human empathy or medical care and were thereby condemned to death. The medical profession played a leading role in the planning, administration, and supervision of this "euthanasia" program, with a large proportion of German physicians proactively shirking all moral responsibility and ultimately paving the way for the Holocaust. Conclusion: The term "euthanasia" was so abused during the Nazi regime as a camouflage word for murder of selected subpopulations with the willing participation of physicians, we believe that, regardless of the benevolent goals of current euthanasia practices, for historical reasons the term "euthanasia" must not be used with regards to current end-of-life care.

AB The article is written with the death of German philosopher Robert Spaemann in mind and is a kind of philosophical obituary summing up some of the results of the philosopher's life relating to his position as a citizen. In Germany, his philosophy was attributed to the so-called Ritter School, although his views were strongly influenced by H.-G. Gadamer, whom he followed while working at the University of Heidelberg. Many of his works were created at the intersection of ethics and political philosophy. Here, one of his favorite themes was human dignity, which was primarily related to the fact that man belongs to the human race and this determines the basic values of existence. Hence, his attitude towards the value of life itself and his negative attitude towards suicide as a conscious withdrawal from life or euthanasia are found. In recent years, before his death, he had been engaged in philosophical analysis and the criticism of the new system of European values which was detached from the peculiarities of national, primarily religious, values. In this regard, he criticized political power for not relying on moral principles.

AB Longevity and changes in family status are leading to a growing number of men living alone in later life. They are often considered an at risk group in terms of deprivation, suicide and mental health problems, a perspective that has informed community services. This paper reports on a study that set out to get a better understanding of this historically new group, particularly in light of significant structural and cultural changes to later life and ageing. The study used interviews with stakeholders and biographical interviews with older men living alone in Frankfurt/Main, a city with a particularly high rate of men over 65 in single occupancy households. The analysis suggests that service providers were interested in encouraging men to recognise and act on their needs, an approach informed by empowerment as well as active ageing strategies. The analysis from the biographical data shows that living alone was a learning process and involved the ability for men to care for themselves as well as others. Learning to live alone enabled them to maintain an identity as an independent individual.

AB In contrast to the mortality dynamics of the former socialist economies of Europe during their transition era, few studies have examined mortality changes in China since the start of its socialist economic reforms. This article examines mortality trends of Shanghai permanent residents during the transition from planned socialism to state capitalism. The previously steady improvement in life expectancy slowed down between 1992 and 1996. Mortality among young working-age men (ages 20-44) increased, largely due to rising cardiovascular disease and injuries. Transportation deaths increased but not mortality from suicide or liver disease. These unfavourable mortality patterns are linked to reform-associated institutional changes such as weaker social protection, increased unemployment, psychological stress, unsafe transport and hazardous environments. However, the unfavourable effects were moderate and transient due to gradualist reform strategies and strong institutions combined with rapid economic growth. The lessons learned from the Shanghai experience may be useful for other socialist countries wishing to shift to a market economy.

AB Among risk factors for suicide, suicidal ideation (SID) is of paramount importance. This study sought to determine sex- and age-related SID point prevalence rates in the general population. A population-based survey of 3154 subjects, 35 to 84 years, conducted in 2004/05 in southern Germany, identified 170 subjects (5.4%; 95% CI 4.6-6.2) suffering from SID within the last 14 days. Age-adjusted short-term period prevalence in women (6.0%, 95% CI 4.9-7.2) was higher than in men (4.0%, 95% CI 3.1-5.1). Among 10-year age groups, sex-related differences were only significant in middle-aged subjects (55-64 years). Prevalence increased significantly with age, leading to a prevalence of > 10% in the oldest age group (75-84 years). The population-based approach demonstrates a substantial proportion of subjects suffering from SID, particularly in older age groups. (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz (1868-1931) was a European statistician. His scientific work covered theoretical economics, stochastics, mathematical statistics and radiology; today, we would call him a cross-disciplinary scientist. With his clear views on mathematical principles with their applications in these fields, he stood in conflict with the mainstream economic schools in Germany at the dawn of the 20th century. He had many prominent students (Gumbel, Leontief and Freudenberg among them), and he carved out the path of modern statistical thinking. He was a true European intellectual with a career path from St. Petersburg via Gottingen to Stra ss burg and finally the Berliner Universitat, now Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin. He is known for the precise calibration of insurance claims applying theat that time hardly knownPoisson distribution to Prussian horse kick and child suicide data. He proposed a simple solution to the Marxian transformation problem and wrote numerous articles and books on the mathematical treatment of statistical (including radiological physical) data. In this article, we sketch his life and work and point out the prominent role that he has in today's statistical thinking.

AB Background: End-of-life decision making constitutes a major challenge for bioethical deliberation and political governance in modern democracies: On the one hand, it touches upon fundamental convictions about life, death, and the human condition. On the other, it is deeply rooted in religious traditions and historical experiences and thus shows great socio-cultural diversity. The bioethical discussion of such cultural issues oscillates between liberal individualism and cultural stereotyping. Our paper confronts the bioethical expert discourse with public moral attitudes.
   Methods: The paper is based on a qualitative study comprising 12 focus group discussions with religious and secular persons in the USA, Germany, and Israel (n = 82). Considering the respective socio-political and legal frameworks, the thematic analysis focuses on moral attitudes towards end-of-life decision making and explores the complex interplay between individual preferences, culture, and religion.
   Results: Our findings draw attention to the variety and complexity of cultural and religious aspects of end-of-life decision making. Although there is local consensus that goes beyond radical individualism, positions are not neatly matched with national cultures or religious denominations. Instead, the relevance of the specific situatedness of religious beliefs and cultural communities becomes visible: Their status and role in individual situations, for example, as consensual or conflicting on the level of personal perspectives, family relationships, or broader social contexts, e.g., as a majority or minority culture within a political system.
   Conclusions: As the group discussions indicate, there are no clear-cut positions anchored in "nationality," "culture," or "religion." Instead, attitudes are personally decided on as part of a negotiated context representing the political, social and existential situatedness of the individual. Therefore, more complex theoretical and practical approaches to cultural diversity have to be developed.

AB The growing use of lithium (Li) in industrial and energetic applications and the inability to completely recycle the alkali metal will most likely increase anthropogenic emissions and environmental concentrations in the future. Although non-essential to plants, Li+ is an important ultra-trace element in the animal and human diet and is also used in the treatment of e.g. mental disorders. Most of the lithium is consumed with the drinking water and vegetables, but concentrations in foodstuffs vary with the geochemistry of the element. In order to identify potential risks and to avoid an overmedication due to consumption of Li rich or Li contaminated foods it is advisable to identify background levels and to derive recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs) for the element. Although Germany does not possess large amounts of primary or secondary resources of lithium, geochemical investigations (mineral and ground waters and soils) in this country confirm a wide variation of environmental concentrations with generally higher levels in the southwest. Despite the large number of soil and water data, only very few data exist on lithium concentrations in plants and its phytotoxicity. Within the scope of present study common,grassland plant species were sampled in regions of SW-Germany with reportedly high geogenic levels of Li. The data are discussed with regard to literature surveys and existing reference values. Since lithium has phytotoxic effects a greenhouse experiment was performed with different Li salts (Lid 1 and Li2CO3) and plant species (maize, bean and buckWheat) to derive dose-response relationships for the endpoint shoot growth. While corn growth was not reduced significantly by soil concentrations of 118 ppm, EC50 values in buckwheat were 47 and 16 ppm for lithium derived from LiCl and Li2CO3, respectively.

AB Background: Worldwide, prevalence rates of adolescent non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) range between 13 and 45%. In Germany, lifetime prevalence of NSSI is around 25% in non-clinical samples, and the one-year prevalence for repetitive NSSI is 4%. NSSI is present in the context of several axis I and II disorders (for example, affective disorders or borderline personality disorder); however, preliminary evidence suggests that it would be justified to consider NSSI as its own diagnostic category. Despite the large impact of this behavior, there is still a lack of evidence-based, specific, and effective manualized treatment approaches for adolescents with NSSI.
   Methods/Design: The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effectiveness of a new cognitive-behavioral treatment manual for self-harming adolescents - the 'Cutting-Down-Programme' (CDP). A total of 80 adolescents aged between 12 and 17 years from a region in Southern Germany who have engaged in repetitive NSSI (>= 5 incidents) in the last 6 months will be randomized into a treatment group (CDP) or a control group that will receive treatment as usual (TAU). The adolescents will be assessed by means of structured interviews and questionnaires at three time points (before treatment, directly after treatment and six months after treatment). Primary outcome criterion is a significant reduction (or remission) in the frequency of NSSI. Secondary outcome criteria are depressivity as well as general well-being and self-worth. Additionally, comorbid psychiatric disorders and childhood adversity will be evaluated as predictors of therapeutic outcome.
   Discussion: Recently, a pilot study in the United Kingdom showed significant reductions in self-harming behavior, depressive symptoms and trait anxiety. This is the first RCT to test the effectiveness of a short-term psychotherapeutic intervention in outpatients engaging in NSSI.

AB Accidental non-autoerotic cases of hanging in adults are uncommon in the absence of mechanical fixation. Examples are strangulation by the victims' own clothing after becoming entangled in an elevated fixed point of suspension as well as falling into an open noose, into the fork of a tree branch, onto a tightened rope (e.g. clothes line) or onto the edge of a piece of furniture. In the present case a 75-year-old woman was found dead in the cellar with her body hanging in a noose. There was no evidence of suicidal tendencies. The circumstances on site, the case history and the autopsy findings were indicative of an accident. In the cellar many ropes and hoses which formed open nooses were found hanging from an iron bar and had been there for a long period of time. It is presumed that the woman's head became accidentally entangled in one of the nooses when she bent down to pick potatoes out of a net. On turning away she could have been pulled back by the noose and fallen down which caused the noose to tighten due to her body weight. In this position it was virtually impossible for the woman to rescue herself.

AB Patient organizations are increasingly involved in national and international bioethical debates and health policy deliberations. In order to examine how and to what extent cultural factors and organizational contexts influence the positions of patient organizations, this study compares the positions of German and Israeli patient organizations (POs) on issues related to end-of-life medical care. We draw on a qualitative pilot study of thirteen POs, using as a unit of analysis pairs comprised of one German PO and one Israeli PO that were matched on the basis of organizational category. Bioethical positions that emanated from the interviews concerned advance directives-general views, recent legal framework, and formalization; as well as active and passive euthanasia, withholding and withdrawing of treatment, and physician-assisted suicide. In addition to the unifying, within-country impact of cultural factors, we found that constituency-based organizations and partner organizations in both countries often share common views, whereas disease-based support organizations have very heterogeneous positions. We conclude by discussing how organizational contexts provide a source of uniformity as well as diversity in the positions of POs.

AB The article synthetically presents the actions of the military, the Internal Security Corps and the security apparatus against the underground after the of Operation Vistula. It aims to show the attempts to destroy the remainder of the UPA and OUN forces and the ensuing results. The displacements of the remaining Ukrainian population from the province of Lublin are also discussed, Even before the end of Operation Vistula, two operational groups were formed, numbering about 10,000 soldiers in total. Their task was facilitated by the demobilisation of partisans carried out in the autumn of 1947 by the command of the Ukrainian underground in Poland. The majority returned to Ukraine to continue fighting, while some tried to get through to the American zone of occupation in Germany. The actions of the military and the Internal Security Corps did not yield significant results. The biggest success was tracking down and surrounding the bunker in which the national OUN commander Jaro slaw Staruch "Stiah" was hiding, who later committed suicide. In November 1947, when the demobilisation of Ukrainian partisans was discovered, the operational groups were disbanded; combating the last Ukrainian partisans was entrusted to the local units of militia and the Internal Security Corps.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury as autonomous diagnosis - implications for research and clinic of the DSM-5 proposal to establish the diagnosis of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury in adolescents
   In both classificatory systems DSM-IV and ICD-10 self-injury is a symptom of borderline personality disorder (BPD). But it has been shown empirically that self-injury can also occur independent of BPD, for example, as a component of depressive states or even in adolescents without classifiable psychopathology. The scientific discussion about future diagnostic criteria recently led to a proposal to include Non-Suicidal Self-Injury as an independent disorder in the upcoming DSM-5 classification system. Based on recent epidemiological studies of adolescents in Germany, one may assume that approximately 4% of all youths in middle to late adolescence would fulfill the prevalence criterion (criterion A) of the proposed DSM-5 disorder (that is, at least five self-injury incidents within the previous 12 months). A precise classification of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury based on empirical research is needed to further the research, treatment, and prevention of this diagnosis.

AB Background: Suicidal ideation is a common phenomenon in the elderly. The purpose of this report is to reveal the influence of psychosocial risk factors and psychiatric disorders on the wish to die in the elderly.
   Method: We compared the data of 54 persons (age 70+) who said that they wished to die with 462 persons without death wishes according to several psychosocial risk factors, physical health and psychiatric diagnoses. The data come from the Berlin Aging Study, an interdisciplinary assessment of an epidemiological random sample of 516 citizens in Germany.
   Results: Using a MANOVA and logistic regression analysis the data indicated that the wish to be dead, even in these very old persons, was mostly associated with the occurrence of a major depression, self rated higher depressivity, higher age, female gender, and negative life conditions such as living in a nursing home.
   Conclusion: The results of this study support that the wish to be dead in the very old is very likely to be associated with the occurrence of a psychiatric disorder, especially major depression and the higher probability of negative life conditions. Thus, we emphasize the requirement of psychiatric assessment as well as treatment of those older people who want to die.

AB In his novelistic cycle Kette, the Jewish author Georg Hermann recounts the life and fate of his alter ego Fritz Eisner Both are successful writers, members of the educated citizenry and distinguished men about town in the Berlin of the early 20th century. In the third volume of the cycle, November achtzehn, Eisner observes the post-war revolution of November 1918. Although he sympathizes with the rebellious soldiers, Eisner does not take part in the following action. On the contrary, he is overburdened with his private troubles: in the late evening, his girlfriend tries to commit suicide, and so they oversleep and miss the outbreak of the revolution in the morning. The next day, however they walk around a Berlin made anew after a long night. But soon it is quite clear that even this awakening has not given their urban way of life a new chance in history. And in the second half of the Kette, we arc, consistently forced to watch the chain of fate descend, leading to the melancholic insight of the last volume: that the time of the (Jewish) bourgeoisie in Germany is up - in spite of the revolution in November achtzehn.

AB A college freshman reports a sexual assault and is met with harassment and insensitive investigative practices leading to her suicide. Former grade school students, now grown, come forward to report childhood abuse perpetrated by clergy, coaches, and teachers-first in trickles and then in waves, exposing multiple perpetrators with decades of unfettered access to victims. Members of the armed services elect to stay quiet about sexual harassment and assault during their military service or risk their careers by speaking up. A Jewish academic struggles to find a name for the systematic destruction of his people in Nazi Germany during the Holocaust. These seemingly disparate experiences have in common trusted and powerful institutions (schools, churches, military, government) acting in ways that visit harm upon those dependent on them for safety and wellbeing. This is institutional betrayal. The purpose of this article is to describe psychological research that examines the role of institutions in traumatic experiences and psychological distress following these experiences. We demonstrate the ways in which institutional betrayal has been left unseen by both the individuals being betrayed as well as the field of psychology and introduce means by which to identify and address this betrayal.

AB In 1962 the Frankfurt Attorney General Dr. Fritz Bauer, who became known worldwide through the Auschwitz Trials, charged the ex-director of the psychiatric and neurological clinic of the University of Wurzburg, Prof. Dr. Werner Heyde, in his bill of indictment with murder in at least 100,000 cases. The trial planned for February 1964 was awaited with great interest by the media. However, it never took place, because Heyde, who went under the pseudonym Dr. Fritz Sawade in the postwar period, committed suicide shortly beforehand. In the years 1940/1941 Heyde was head assessor and medical director of the so-called Action T4 and, therefore, one of the main perpetrators of the mass murder of sick and disabled people known under the euphemism of euthanasia. Long before his involvement in the mass murder programme, Heyde already contributed to the disastrous development in Germany with a positive psychiatric expert opinion on Theodor Eicke, who later became the Inspector of Concentration Camps (KZ) and head of the SS Death's Head Units. Furthermore, Heyde became an instructor of KZ physicians. This article focuses on Heyde's successful career at the University of Wurzburg from 1926-1945, taking sources that confirm Heyde's homosexual propensities into account, suggesting arecurrent conflictual influence on his life.

AB ObjectivesTo investigate the prevalence and associated psychosocial factors of occasional and repetitive direct self-injurious behavior (D-SIB), such as self-cutting, -burning, -biting, -hitting, and skin damage by other methods, in representative adolescent samples from 11 European countries.
   MethodsCross-sectional assessment of adolescents was performed within the European Union funded project, Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE), which was conducted in 11 European countries. The representative sample comprised 12,068 adolescents (F/M: 6,717/5,351; mean age: 14.90.89) recruited from randomly selected schools. Frequency of D-SIB was assessed by a modified 6-item questionnaire based on previously used versions of the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI). In addition, a broad range of demographic, social, and psychological factors was assessed.
   ResultsOverall lifetime prevalence of D-SIB was 27.6%; 19.7% reported occasional D-SIB and 7.8% repetitive D-SIB. Lifetime prevalence ranged from 17.1% to 38.6% across countries. Estonia, France, Germany, and Israel had the highest lifetime rates of D-SIB, while students from Hungary, Ireland, and Italy reported low rates. Suicidality as well as anxiety and depressive symptoms had the highest odds ratios for both occasional and repetitive D-SIB. There was a strong association of D-SIB with both psychopathology and risk-behaviors, including family related neglect and peer-related rejection/victimization. Associations between psychosocial variables and D-SIB were strongly influenced by both gender and country. Only a minor proportion of the adolescents who reported D-SIB ever received medical treatment.
   ConclusionThese results suggest high lifetime prevalence of D-SIB in European adolescents. Prevalence as well as psychosocial correlates seems to be significantly influenced by both gender and country. These results support the need for a multidimensional approach to better understand the development of SIB and facilitate culturally adapted prevention/intervention.

AB Although morbidity and mortality of acute poisoning are increased in elderly compared to younger patients, little has been published on this topics in the last years (Medline search). To investigate the influence of age on the clinical course of acute poisoning with different toxic agents, a longitudinal retrospective study at the Toxicological Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the 2nd Department of Internal Medicine (Klinikum Niirnberg, Germany) was performed.
   A total of 5883 patients treated at our toxicological ICU were enrolled into the study, including all patients of the years 1982, 1992, and 1997. These three years were selected to investigate possible time-dependent changes of intoxication characteristics and quality of therapy at our ICU over a time span of 15 years.
   For each patient the following data were obtained from a standardized toxicological record: age, gender, toxic agents responsible for acute poisoning, and length of stay at the toxicological ICU. For a subgroup of 3740 patients, the cause of acute poisoning and the clinical outcome was also recorded.
   As compared with younger patients, mean length of stay at the ICU, indicating a more serious course of acute poisoning, was prolonged in elderly and, i.e., in very old patients (p < 0.001). However, this prolongation of time at the ICU was only observed in elderly patients poisoned with drugs or with mixed poisoning including drugs, while mean length of stay was not prolonged in elderly patients poisoned with alcohol, with illegal drugs, chemicals, animal/plant poison, or other toxic agents.
   Patients with the highest risk of dying in the ICU after acute poisoning were elderly patients attempting suicide with drugs. Mortality in 3740 patients with acute poisoning was 0.24%, while it was 2.17% in the 184 patients being 65 years old or older. Thus, mortality was 9-fold higher in the elderly.
   Mean length of stay at the ICU decreased significantly from 1982 to 1992 and to 1997 (p < 0.001) indicating an improvement of the therapeutical ICU management of acute poisoning and/or less dangerous toxic agents (i.e. less barbiturates). The age-dependent increase of the length of stay at the ICU until very old age (> 80 years) was most pronounced in 1982 and also declined markedly until 1997.
   Age, suicide attempt, and ingestion of (multiple) drugs seem to be risk factors for a higher mortality and a prolonged stay in the ICU after acute poisoning. Although in general the clinical course after poisoning has more complications and an impaired prognosis in old age, each category of toxic agents (drugs, alcohol, chemicals, etc.) has its own special "risk profile" for elderly patients. However, due to advances in modern ICU medicine the general prognosis of acute poisoning is good in old and even in oldest old patients.

AB Process and outcome quality of inpatient treatment of depression in Germany was described in a multicenter study of 10 hospitals in North-Rhine Westphalia, Baden-Wurttemberg and Bavaria. The treatment of more than 2000 depressive patients was assessed by quality indicators and outcome was compared between the hospitals (benchmarking). Results show great variance in length of stay between the hospitals. While in one hospital patients with depressive episodes were discharged after 36.8 days (average), the average length of stay in another hospital was 64.3 days. Furthermore the study revealed that hospitals differ strongly regarding their case-mix. Using stepwise multiple regression analyses potential confounding variables (sociodemographics, history of previous treatment, severity of depression) were identified and their influence on length of stay was calculated. After cross validation the regression analyses model explained 7% of the variance and included 5 predictors. Length of stay is prolonged by patients with a recurrent depressive disorder, by patients with impairment of social functioning and by severity of the depression. Length of stay is reduced if the indication of inpatient treatment was crisis intervention and if there was a previous suicide attempt. It was shown that differences in patient case-mix only account for a small percentage of hospital differences in length of stay. Method, effort and benefit of the regression analyses approach are discussed.

AB Although one of the main aims of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) for borderline personality disorder (BPD) is to increase the retention rates, premature termination rates for DBT inpatient programs were found to be over 30%. The aim of the study was to identify the reasons for, and to analyze, patient characteristics that are associated with premature termination. We studied 541 inpatients with BPD, who were consecutively admitted for an open-door 3-month DBT inpatient treatment in Berlin, Germany. All participants completed several self-rating measures and participated in clinical interviews. Fourteen percent, who did not complete the full 84 days of assigned treatment, were expelled, mainly due to treatment-disturbing behaviors, or substance abuse or possession. Nearly 19% dropped out of treatment, mostly due to lack of motivation, arguments with others, and poor tolerance of emotional distress. Using non-parametric conditional inference trees, expulsion was associated with anorexia nervosa and alcohol abuse, whereas more than 9 suicide attempts, antisocial personality disorders, and more than 86 weeks in a psychiatric hospital were risk factors for dropout. We discussed measures and interventions that might lead to an adaptation of DBT inpatient programs. Future research should examine the symptom course and utilization of health-care services of non-completers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To assess the-occurrence and frequency of bipolar at-risk symptoms in a large sample of previously undiagnosed students using the new screening tool Bochumer Screeningbogen Bipolar (BSB). 2329 students of the Ruhr University Bochum, Germany completed online demographic data as well as various self-rating questionnaires (BSB; Hypomania Checklist 32; Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale; Beck Depression Inventory). Within the student cohort (64.4% female, mean age 24.3 years) every fifth student currently suffered from moderate to severe depressive symptoms; every sixth student had already thought about suicide and every other student reported a history of mood swings. The most frequently reported depressive symptoms included physical exhaustion, depressed mood, and tiredness. The most frequently reported (hypo)manic symptoms included physical agitation, feeling extremely energetic, and lack of concentration. The BSB showed good convergent validity with other established questionnaires capturing depressive or (hypo)manic symptoms, as well as a stable administration of underlying constructs. The BSB correlated significantly with the already established applied questionnaires. The predictive power of the BSB regarding the development of bipolar disorder cannot be correctly quantified at present. The further purpose of this exploratory web-based study should be to examine the validity of the presented measures in a longitudinal design.

AB The neurotransmitter serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] controls a broad range of biological functions that are disturbed in affective disorder. In the brain, 5-HT production is controlled by tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2). In order to assess the possible contribution of TPH2 genetic variability to the aetiology of bipolar affective disorder (BPAD), we systematically investigated common and rare genetic variation in the TPH2 gene through a sequential sequencing and SNP-based genotyping approach. Our study sample comprised two cohorts of BPAD from Germany and Russia, totalling 883 patients and 1300 controls. SNPs located in a haplotype block covering the 5' region of the gene as well as a rare, non-synonymous SNP, resulting in a Pro206Ser substitution, showed significant association with bipolar disorder. The odds ratio for the minor allele in the pooled sample was 1.5 (95% CI 1.2-1.9) for rs11178997 (in the 5'-associated haplotype block) and 4.8 (95% CI 1.6-14.8) for rs17110563 encoding the Pro206Ser substitution. Examination of the functional effects of TPH2 Pro206Ser provided evidence for a reduced thermal stability and solubility of the mutated enzyme, suggesting reduced 5-HT production in the brain as a pathophysiological mechanism in BPAD.

AB Within the field of veterinary medicine the gender distribution has changed, since most graduates are now females. Studies show that female veterinarians represent a vulnerable group for stress and stress-related illnesses. The goal of the study was to identify typical profiles of stress management strategies and to clarify if vets are well-equipped to cope with occupational stressors. Within a cross-sectional design 78 female veterinarians from Austria and Germany were surveyed using a self-report test-battery assessing twenty different coping styles. Statistical analysis included one sample t-tests and Cohen's d as a concurrent effect size measure. The results showed that female veterinarians are significantly more likely to use negative coping styles for their stress e.g., rumination (t(74) = 6.733, p = < 0.001, d = 0.726) or escapism (t(72) = 2.173, p = 0.033, d = 0.281) when compared to the norm population. Amongst other studies these findings contribute to a systematic diagnosis which is necessary for the development and implementation of standardized stress management interventions for the veterinary education and training e.g., courses for improving communication and stress management skills and regular supervision or intervision (exchange with professional peers). Due to existing stigmatization concerning mental health, low-barrier counseling services should be provided for veterinarians who already feel stressed.

AB Background and purpose: Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant hereditary neurodegenerative disease with multiplication of GAG triplet in the short arm of chromosome 4, manifested by motor symptoms, cognitive dysfunction progressing to dementia, and various types of neuropsychiatric disorders. The diagnosis of HD is confirmed by a genetic test, which may also be carried out presymptomatically.
   Material and methods: We studied differences in psychiatric examination and psychometric measures among the 52 people at risk of HD, who were recommended to postpone or to continue in the predictive protocol. In addition to the psychiatric examination, we administered the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ-A), the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90), and quality of life questionnaire (MANSA).
   Results: People at risk of HD with the recommended test postponement showed lower rate of neuroticism and EPQ-A lie score, higher values on the phobia and the so-called 'positive symptom distress index' in SCL-90 and lower quality of life than people at risk of HD with the recommendation to continue.
   Condusions: Our results indicate that the formalized testing does not bring significant information whereas the clinical psychiatric examination remains the main decisive factor in the recommendation to perform a predictive genetic test. The motivation of applicants is considered as the most important factor in the decision-making proces.

ID RIOTS
AB About twenty young people travelled from a small German former mining settlement named Dinslaken-Lohberg to become fighters with al-Nusra and ISIS. They drew particular attention, with media reports about "members" of what they termed the "Lohberg Brigade" killed in the fighting, or in air strikes by the anti-ISIS coalition, or in spectacular suicide attacks claiming many victims. Drawing on that case, the article explores how neighborhood can effect the emergence and persistence of radicalisation to jihadi neo-Salafism. The author presents a series of local elements that interfere with one another to strengthen each others persistence and effects and thus promote the emergence and persistence of the radicalisation phenomenon at hand.The interference of elements is not an automatic but a social process, enacted by neighbors telling stories of conspiracy, of discrimination and recounting experiences of spirituality, heroism, masculinity, and femaleness. It is performed by neighbors setting, crossing and avoiding symbolic boundaries. And finally it is played by neighbors simply following their routines. The author shows how explaining space-related radicalisation processes means more than adding up spatial factors. His approach rejects the idea of isolating a single social fact - such as local structures, events, processes or social actors that existed, occurred or acted prior to the emergence of radicals in their neighbourhood - as definite cause for radicalisation.

AB Background: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a frequent and clinically relevant phenomenon in adolescence. Within Europe, Germany has one of the highest prevalence rates in youth with lifetime prevalence ranging between 25 and 35%. However, treatment guidelines for NSSI are not yet available.
   Methods: Consensus based clinical guidelines were created by a working group consisting of members of eleven medical, psychological or psychotherapeutic professional national associations, and two members of patient self-help and prevention groups. The guidelines were developed in consecutive expert meetings and literature searches and agreed on in a final consensus conference.
   Results: Given that evidence on both the psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological treatment of NSSI is limited, a consensus based approach was chosen. The consensus indicated that due to the accumulating evidence on the efficacy of psychotherapeutic approaches, core elements of psychotherapy should be provided in treatment of NSSI. A specific psychopharmacological therapy of NSSI cannot be recommended. In addition, the guidelines provide recommendations for surgical intervention of NSSI.
   Conclusions: In accordance with the heterogeneous level of evidence, recommendations for the clinical management of NSSI in adolescence were made during a consensus conference after reviewing available literature. There is still a lack of knowledge on prevention as well as clinical interventions, which needs to be addressed by further clinically relevant studies.

AB Depression, Deliberate Self-Harm and Suicidal Behaviour in Adolescents Engaging in Risky and Pathological Internet Use
   To investigate associations between risky and pathologic internet use with depression, deliberate self-harm and suicidal behaviour among a representative sample of German adolescents. A total of 1,435 students (48 % boys, 52 % girls) from the area of Heidelberg/Germany were recruited during the SEYLE study, a European school-based intervention study and completed an assessment of different questionnaires, including the Young Diagnostic Questionnaire for the assessment of risky and pathological internet use, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Deliberate Self Harm Inventory, and the Paykel Suicide Scale. 80.7 % of the students reported regular, 14.5 % risky, and 4.8 % pathological internet use. The risky and the pathological internet users showed significant higher rates of depression, deliberate self-harm and suicidal behaviour compared to students with regular internet use. Remarkably, there were no significant differences of levels of depression and suicidal behaviour between risky and pathological users. These results suggest that not only pathologic internet use but also risky internet use is associated with symptoms of depression, self-harm and suicidal behaviour. Therefore, more attention should be paid to adolescents with risky internet use for the early recognition of depression, self-harm and suicidality in adolescence.

Scholars, however, have not given him the credit he deserves. Von Voss was involved in two intended pistol attacks; one planned by the resistance group within the staff of field marshall Erich von Witzleben in Saint Germain at the beginning of 1941, the other thought up by the officers around Henning von Tresckow, who was a good friend of his, in March 1943. He tried to win the commanders-in-chief for the resistance on several occasions, but without success. As he was one of the conspirators of July 20th, 1944, and as he was aware of the Gestapo's methods of investigation, he committed suicide on October 8th, 1944. This study is based in particular on the unpublished letters that von Voss wrote to his wife, Gisela, nee von Stulpnagel. It was possible to both reconstruct the circumstances of his military career in the famous IR 9 up to lieutenant colonel, and to show how his doubts and criticism of the regime developed, which made him become a member of the resistance against Hitler. The letters reflect his political, religious and ethical beliefs, which motivated his actions against the regime and the dictator himself.

AB The incidence of terrorist attacks is increasing worldwide, and they have also become a permanent threat in European cities. Due to its complexity, terrorist attack trauma places high demands on the strategy of surgical treatment. The combination of various mechanisms, explosions and gunshot injuries, with the characteristic pressure (blast) damage and a high proportion of penetrating trauma with simultaneous burns are characteristic features. Unlike in military conflicts, injuries to people of all ages and without ballistic body protection (body armor) are to be expected. The mechanism of the attack and its local conditions are of relevance for the assessment of the situation and the expected injury patterns. Thus, suicide attacks result in several times higher numbers of fatalities and casualties. Explosions on free ground lead to different types of injury than those in closed or semi-enclosed spaces. The treatment principles of the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLSA (R)) are based on the intrahospital care of casualties as well as damage control strategies with trigger factors. In order to prepare and educate clinics and surgeons in Germany for such scenarios, various course formats of the professional societies, the German Society for General and Visceral Surgery (DGAV) and the German Society for Trauma Surgery (DGU) have now been established.

AB Background: Running amok is considered a rare but dangerous act of violence which has been investigated predominantly on a case by case basis. German-wide data on amok cases covering the decades 1980-1989 and 1991-2000 were used to perform the first epidemiological study world-wide on the stability of socio-demographic, criminological and psychiatric variables of amok behaviour. Methods: A content analysis study on nationwide press reports of amok cases included a total of 104 subjects who were identified by combined homicidal-suicidal acts of violence and fulfilled structured criteria originally defined according to former Malayan amok events. Results: Amok cases in both decades were comparable except for the significant increase of weapon use, especially of firearms. Total prevalence showed a tendency to decline from 1:5.5 million to 1:8.5 million men per year, females were involved in rare single cases only. The male offenders showed a bimodal age distribution with a mean of 35 years. They were professionally well qualified, but had a 5-7fold higher risk of unemployment than the normal population. Motives and reasons for running amok were serious but not unusual, they varied widely and addressed all areas of daily life. Most offenders were characterized by abnormal personality patterns such as passive, aggressive, impulsive and paranoid and were in possession of firearms and previously convicted. Psychiatric diseases such as psychosis, paranoia, depression or personality disorders were present in more than 50% of cases; further 20% were intoxicated. The presence of psychiatric disorders influenced patterns of violent behaviour in individual subjects. Victims were predominantly unknown to the offenders. Close to one third of the amok runners committed suicide or were killed by legal authorities. Conclusion: Amok represents a temporarily stable syndrome of extreme violent behaviour even in modern industrialized societies. Subjects exhibit a complex combination of serious causative motives, social burden and psychiatric diseases which do not explain common causes of amok rather than the origin of amok behaviour in individual cases. Amok joins the wide spectrum of human homicidal-suicidal acts which show similarities in many aspects.

AB Background. Depressive disorders represent a major public health concern, regarding their high frequency and their important cost. Depression impair the quality of life more than any other disease, sometimes leading to suicidal ideas or behavior. Indeed, 50% of patients with severe major depression commit suicide. Numerous studies showed that depressive disorders are frequently not recognised, and regularly untreated. In France, where at least 3 millions of inhabitants are concerned, 38% of depressed patients are not using any health system. When they are asking for care, the majority of depressed patients visit their general practitioner (51%), whereas less than 10% visit a psychiatrist. Even when the diagnostic is correct, the treatment prescribed is not systematically relevant. The treatment is, for example, frequently proposed for a too short period, and sometimes the prescribed product does not have proven antidepressive efficacy. Furthermore, as incorrect informations are frequently given to patients, and as there is a general biased judgement about psychotropic drugs in the general population, the compliance is usually poor for antidepressive treatment Therefore, only a small minority of depressed patients benefits from an adequate care. Public health information methodological asperts. To improve this situation, delivering simple and clear-cut recommendations cannot be considered as sufficiently effective, and public health interventions are required. Different programs improving the recognition of depressive disorders have already been tested in some countries with encouraging results. These programs are based on information campaigns given to the public, and the training of general practitioners about the management of depressive disorders. The << Defeat Depression >> campaign in Great-Britain and the << National Depression Screening Day >> in the United-States of America may represent informative examples. Restricting these programs to general practitioners only is frequently criticized, as this may reduce efficacy. A multilevel approach is crucial for the success of action programmes against depression, because synergistic effects can be expected. In Germany, the << Nurnberger Bundnis gegen Depression >> project was based on four levels, and effectively reduced the suicide rate. These levels of action included << cooperation with GPs >>, such as training sessions based on video, and presence of a phone hotline, << public relations activities >> << training sessions for multipliers >>, such as priests, social workers and media, and << special offers for high risk groups and self-help activities >>. In France, such a program is clearly required.

AB Lithium and with restrictions, carbamazepine, valproic acid, lamotrigine, olanzapine, aripiprazole and quetiapine, are approved in Germany for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Lithium is the only drug that (I) proved to be effective for the prevention of depressive as well as manic episodes in state-of-the-art studies without an enriched design and that (II) is approved for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorders without restrictions. It (III) is also the only drug which is recommended for maintenance treatment by the current German S3 guidelines on bipolar disorders with the highest degree of recommendation (A) and (IV) is the only drug with a well proven suicide preventive effect. Hence, lithium is the mood stabilizer of first choice. No patient should be deprived of lithium without a specific reason. Side effects and risks are manageable if both the physician and the patient are well informed. Detailed and practical information on a safe use of lithium can be found in the S3 guidelines on bipolar disorders. For patients who do not respond sufficiently to lithium, have contraindications or non-tolerable side effects, other mood stabilizers should be used. Restrictions in their respective approval as well as specific side effects and risks have to be taken into account. Because maintenance treatment is a long-term treatment, particular concern should be paid to drugs with the potential risk of a metabolic syndrome, particularly atypical antipsychotics.

AB Between 1983 and 2003, 40 accidental autoerotic fatalities have been investigated. in the Institute of Legal Medicine in Hamburg. Only 50% (n = 20) were autopsied (13 legal autopsies, 6 for scientific purposes and I for an insurance company). All the victims were males, aged between 13 and 79 years (among them five children and adolescents, the deceased mainly between 20 and 40 years). The paraphiliacs utilized a great range of devices and props as fetishism, sexual aids or pain-stimulating agents, like intimate feminine garments, ropes, chains, bondages, locks, pornographic magazines, condoms, rubber items, and chemical anaesthetics. The cause of death was strangulation in 20 cases (17 x hanging, 3 x ligature strangulation), I I x suffocation (8 x under plastic bags, 3 x with face-masks, 2 x thoracic compression, I x positional asphyxia, and I x cocaine intoxication). Five cases without autopsy remained unclear because of missing morphological and toxicological findings; it could not be differentiated between asphyxiation/intoxication/natural disease, although the scene characteristics seemed to be typical for autoerotic deaths. It is emphasized that the findings at the scene, the morphological and toxicological examination of the dead body (full autopsy as prerequisite) by experienced investigators and the personal history of the deceased have to be evaluated very carefully and intensely to reconstruct the accidental fatal autoerotic course accurately and undoubtedly (to exclude the possibility of sexual homicide, neglected killing, or suicide).

AB We have carried out a bibliometric study about the international scientific publications on clozapine. We have used the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, and we applied bibliometric indicators of production, as Price's Law on the increase of scientific literature. We also calculated the participation index (PI) of the different countries. The bibliometric data have also been correlated with some social and health data from the 12 most productive countries in biomedicine and health sciences. In addition, 5607 original documents dealing with clozapine, published between 1970 and 2013, were downloaded. Our results state non-fulfilment of Price's Law, with scientific production on clozapine showing linear growth (r = 0.8691, vs. r = 0.8478 after exponential adjustment). Seven of the 12 journals with the highest numbers of publications on clozapine have an Impact Factor > 2. Among the countries generating clozapine research, the most prominent is the USA (PI = 24.32), followed by the UK (PI = 6.27) and Germany (PI = 5.40). The differences among countries on clozapine research are significantly related to economic variables linked to research. The scientific interest in clozapine remains remarkable, although after the application of bibliometric indicators of production, a saturation point is evident in the growth of scientific literature on this topic.

AB Background. Poisonings with rodenticides containing hydrogen phosphide-releasing compounds may lead to deleterious organ dysfunction and death. Since data of hydrogen phosphide poisonings is limited to case reports/series, this study was intended to elucidate hydrogen phosphide poisonings based on a 20-year data collection. Methods. Explorative data analysis of the Poison Center Mainz database looking for route of exposure, symptoms, and severity using the Poisoning Severity Score. Results. From 1983-2003, 188 hydrogen phosphide poisonings were reported. Sixty-five percent of these were unintentional residential, 28% attempts to commit suicide (intentional), 5% occupational, and 2% undetermined. In the majority of intentional poisonings the poison was ingested, whereas in unintentional poisoning of adults inhalation exposure dominated, caused by inappropriate self-protection from the released hydrogen phosphide gas during usage. Frequently observed symptoms in unintentional poisonings were nausea, vomiting, pain, coughing, and dizziness with no further worsening of symptoms. In intentional poisonings frequent symptoms were vomiting, somnolence, seizures, coma, and shock with two initially fatal poisonings. Follow-up on these cases showed a significant worsening of symptoms and a two-fold increase in fatal poisonings. Conclusion. Route of exposure, severity of symptoms, and the necessary treatment differs substantially between unintentional and intentional poisonings. In this study, two initially symptomatic intentional poisonings were later reported fatal. Careful monitoring is recommended in symptomatic intentional poisonings.

AB Introduction: Around one-third of adolescents in Germany report a lifetime history of suicide ideation. School staff (e.g., teachers or school social workers) can serve as gatekeepers to identify adolescents at risk and transfer them to appropriate mental health professionals. The aim of this study was to evaluate a gatekeeper training for school staff.
   Methods: A total of N = 603 school social workers, school psychologists, and teachers participated in one of 33 1.5-day workshops. Knowledge, attitudes, confidence in skills, and perceived knowledge were assessed at pre and post workshops and at 6-month follow-up (FU). Behavioral changes were assessed via self-report at FU.
   Results: Knowledge, perceived knowledge, and confidence in own skills concerning suicidality increased significantly from pre- to post-assessment and was still significantly increased at 6-month FU. Attitudes toward suicidal adolescents were neutral to positive before the workshop and remained un-changed at FU. Overall, participants were very satisfied with the workshop. Although participants stated to be motivated to make behavioral changes at 6-month FU, they reported obstacles such as lack of resources and support from school administration.
   Discussion: This 1.5-day gatekeeper workshop was effective in enhancing knowledge and confidence in school staff regarding suicidality. Future workshops would benefit from ongoing supervision and inclusion of school administration in order to facilitate long-term changes on a behavioral level.

TI Is there a right not to know one's sex? The ethics of 'gender
   verification' in women's sports competition
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID INTERSEX
AB The paper discusses the current medical practice of 'gender verification' in sports from an ethical point of view. It takes the recent public discussion about 800 m runner Caster Semenya as a starting point. At the World Championships in Athletics 2009 in Berlin, Germany, Semenya was challenged by competitors as being a so called 'sex impostor'. A medical examination to verify her sex ensued. The author analyses whether athletes like Semenya could claim a right not to know that is generally acknowledged in human genetics and enforced by international and national genetic privacy laws. The relevance of this right for genetic diagnosis in sports is discussed. To this end, the interests of the athlete concerned and of third parties are balanced according to the expected benefits and harms. Harm is documented in a number of cases and includes unjustified disqualification, severe sex and gender identity crisis, demeaning reactions, social isolation, depression and suicide. Benefits are dubious as most cases of intersex are considered irrelevant for sports competition. It has to be concluded that the benefits to be gained from 'gender verification' in sports via genetic testing do not outweigh the grave individual disadvantages. The current practice of athletic associations to largely ignore the right of competitors not to know does not comply with prevailing ethical provisions on the protection of sensitive personal data. Therefore, genetic 'gender verification' in sports should be abolished.

AB Introduction Intentional life-ending acts (LA) includingeuthanasia and termination of life without explicit request are illegal in Germany and have not been extensively studied. In a pilot study, unreported LA administered by physicians and nurses in German health care were explored.
   Methods All hospitals and nursing homes registered in 2015 (n = 13 393) were contacted via mail or e-mail and physician and nursing staff were asked to complete an anonymous online-survey or the identical attached paper-pencil questionnaire. 4629 participants, including physicians (n = 356), nurses (n = 3121) und geriatric nurses (n = 1152) from a predominant in-patient working area responded to questions about LA at their workplace, requests for euthanasia and performance of LA.
   Results 2.25 - 4.01 % (172 participants) of all physicians and nurses indicated to have heard of euthanasia at their workplace in the last 12 months and 1.42 - 3.39 % (77 participants) indicated to have performed LA themselves. LA was more frequently administered by male participants, physicians and on intensive care units. More than one third of all participants who had administered LA (38.10 - 41.67 %) were never asked for it.
   Discussion This pilot study indicates that beside legal forms of passive and indirect euthanasia, illegal intentional life-ending acts are administered by physicians and nurses in all health-care areas under investigation.

AB Gunshot wounds are rare in Germany and are mostly the result of suicide attempts or improper handling of weapons. The resulting injuries involve extensive tissue damage and complications which are thus unique and require a differentiated approach. As trauma centers may be confronted with gunshot wounds at any time, treatment principles must be understood and regularly reevaluated.
   Due to Bundeswehr operations abroad and the treatment of patients from other crisis regions a total of 85 gunshot wounds in 64 patients were treated between 2005 and 2011. In the majority of cases the lower extremities were affected and we were able to carry out treatment to preserve the extremities. In this article we report on our experiences and the results of treatment of gunshot wounds to the lower extremities.
   This part of the article deals with the epidemiology and pathophysiology of gunshot wounds to the lower extremities. By means of an evaluation of microbiological findings in a subgroup of patients involved in a civil war (n = 10), the problem of multidrug resistant pathogen contamination, colonization and infection is discussed. In addition to a description of initial and emergency treatment of gunshot wounds, measures required for further treatment and decontamination are presented. Finally, the results are discussed with reference to the literature in this field.

AB Most individuals with a lifetime history of pathological gambling (PGs) overcome their gambling problems without formal help. Little is known about factors associated with recovery in gamblers without treatment. The aim of this study was to examine associations of psychiatric comorbidity and social conditions with remission among untreated PGs. Two recruitment channels (population-based and self-referred) were used to obtain a nation-wide sample from Germany. The sample included 118 PGs with no prior experience of help-seeking for gambling problems who received a clinical interview to assess psychiatric comorbidity, severity of disorder, social pressure, social support, and life satisfaction. Of the 118 PGs, 46.6% were recovered. Compared to current PGs, recovered PGs were older and had suffered from significantly more adverse consequences prior to recovery (OR: 1.18, CI: 1.04-1.33, p = .008). Additionally, they had experienced less social support (OR: 0.97, CI: 0.94-1.00, p = .027). No differences in terms of the number of DSM-IV criteria, financial loss, gambling intensity, and duration were found. Moreover, psychiatric disorders did not differ between groups. Untreated recovery from gambling may be independent of the severity of PG and psychiatric comorbidity. Social support might have an attenuating effect on the consequences of PG and therefore might reduce the perceived need for change.

TI Accidental firearm fatalities - Forensic and preventive implications
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEGAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE firearms; fatalities; accident
ID HUNTING ACCIDENT; INJURIES; DEATHS; CHILDREN
AB Out of a total of 624 consecutive gunshot autopsies from Munster and Hamburg, Germany, 32 cases (5.1%) were accidental. The accidents were self-inflicted in 3 cases while another person fired the gun in the remaining 29 cases. More than half of the victims were younger than 25 years and 75% were male. A single gunshot injury was present in all cases and the head was struck in 47% but a detailed analysis of the entrance wound sites did not show any preferential anatomical sites. A surprising finding was the presence of five contact or near contact gunshots (16%). The reasons for these and most other accidents were extreme carelessness when handling a firearm, the involvement of children or adolescents or a foolish behaviour with a gun intended to impress others. Gun-cleaning accidents occurred rarely and there were no major technical defects of the weapons. Preventive measures should concentrate on strict inaccessibility of guns to children and on increased educational efforts to subgroups at risk such as hunters and members of the armed forces. A single non-contact gunshot injury from a long-barrelled firearm can be considered typical for an accident but the great variety and the possible presence of "disguised" suicides and homicides requires a careful forensic investigation including inspection of the scene and reconstruction of the events. It is recommended that a case should always be considered to be non-accidental in the beginning of an investigation.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to analyse whether the SF-36 questionnaire is a useful tool to evaluate the treatment outcome of a drug detoxification program. Methods: A pre-post assessment of consecutive referrals to a drug detoxification program of a psychiatric state hospital in north-western Germany was conducted. Seventy-nine males and twenty-one females with a diagnosis of multiple substance use were included. MOS short form 36 (SF-36) was used upon admission and discharge to assess changes in self-perceived health status. Severity scales from the addiction severity interview (ASI) were used to rate severity of illness by a physician at program entry. Results: Patients with severe comorbidity ( hepatitis B, depression, attempted suicide) reported significant worse health states, compared to those without. Positive correlations between physician rated addiction severity and patients' self-perceived health status were observed, most strongly for mental health status. For the 48 patients with 2 assessments significant improvements during the treatment period were observed on SF-36 subscales 'general health' and 'physical functioning'. Patients with severe physical and/or mental problems upon admission had more benefits from treatment than patients without. Conclusions: SF-36 questionnaire is a useful instrument to monitor the health status and to evaluate treatment effects in drug addicts.

ID OVERDOSE
AB Background and objective: Because of the paucity of information on the epidemiology of acute poisoning requiring intensive medical care, all such patients treated on the medical intensive care unit of the university hospital in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, between January 1993 and December 1999, were retrospectively evaluated.
   Patients and methods: Of the total of 6211 patients, 147 (80 women, 67 men, mean age 41 years, 2.3%) were treated for acute intoxication in the intensive care unit.
   Results: Reasons for admission to the intensive care unit were the need for ventilator treatment or intensive monitoring of vital functions. 52% of the patients (n = 76) had attempted suicide, most of them using anti-depressive drugs (n = 19), paracetamol (n = 16), or benzodiazepines (n = 9). Two patients (2.6%) died. 48% of the patients (n = 71) were admitted because of accidental poisoning. Leading toxic agents in this group were heroin (n = 19), alcohol (n = 18) and digitalis (n = 12). 11 patients had taken herbicides, animal poisons or chemicals used at work or for house cleaning. In this cohort, three Lv. drug abusers (4.2%) had died. Depending on the agents used, a variety of treatments (charcoal, antidots, extracorporal therapy) were undertaken.
   Conclusion: Due to excellent care in the prehospital phase and in the emergency room the number of patients requiring treatment on the intensive care unit was rather low. The mortality was in the range of other reports.

DE neurotoxicity; pyrethroid; organophosphate; pesticide
AB The same classes of pesticides are used all over the world, but conditions of use vary widely, and public perceptions of risk vary more widely still. Within Western Europe pesticide residues in commercially traded foodstuffs are subject to international standards and are closely monitored. Hence risks to consumers from such foods are negligible. The major hazards are poisoning associated with high acute/chronic operator exposures due to occasional pesticide misuse, in addition pesticides provide a convenient means of attempting suicide in agricultural areas.
   In contrast, public perception of risks from pesticides centres on low level exposures, and is heightened by several factors. These are: poisonings associated with pesticide misuse; the indirect nature of the benefit to the consumer (cf. medicines or public health uses); and commercially motivated marketing of pesticide-free produce. In press reports pyrethroid insecticides have been linked to "Multiple Chemical Sensitivity" in Germany, and organophosphates to "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome" in the UK. A number of pressure groups are actively campaigning to ban all uses of organophosphorus pesticides.
   Unfortunately evaluation of the real risks of pesticide exposure is rendered less certain by the lack of any very useful retrospective exposure measures with which biological effects of uncertain aetiology might be correlated. This means that although we can be sure that pesticides pose no gross threat to health in the general population, subtle effects on more highly exposed sub-populations are, as yet, more difficult to rule out.

AB Inspired by Richard Hofstadter's pioneering studies on conspiracy theory as a tool of historiographical investigation, the purpose of this study is to examine the specific case of the intellectual and professional life of Giovanni Preziosi and the use made by him of conspiracy as an argument and a weapon of political confrontation.
   The analysis focuses on the years 1913-1915, a very intense period in Italian politics with the debate over the War, and its purpose is to investigate Giovanni Preziosi's contribution to the interventionist cause. Focusing on the global threat of pan-Germanism and denouncing its Italian accomplices, especially the Giolittian neutralists, the future publisher of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion exposed the enormous political and commercial power of Banca Commerciale Italiana, as well as the dangers of excessive tolerance of the German elements in Italy, ascribing everything to a conspiracy to enslave Italy to Germany's will. Divided into economic, military and political variants, the idea of the pan-German plan served as a response to the neutralists' arguments and for authorities who were considered accomplices of German imperialism to invoke more nationalist war measures.
   With his periodical La Vita Italiana, Preziosi anticipated many of the anti-Semitic ideas of the Fascist period, becoming a characteristic voice on the interventionist front. He was to adhere to these ideas concerning the occult forces of the world until his suicide in 1945.

AB Introduction: The aim of this study is to measure the prevalence of suicidal ideation and thoughts of death in elementary school children in a European survey and to determine the associated socio-demographic and clinical factors.
   Methods: Data refer to children aged 6-12 (N=7062) from Italy, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Germany, and the Netherlands randomly selected in primary schools. Suicidal thoughts and death ideation were measured using a computerized pictorial diagnostic tool from the Dominic Interactive (DI) completed by the children. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was administrated to teachers and parents along with a socio-demographic questionnaire.
   Results: Suicidal ideation was present in 16.96% of the sample (from 9.9 in Italy to 26.84 in Germany), death thoughts by 21.93% (from 7.71% in Italy to 32.78 in Germany). Sl and DT were more frequent in single-parent families and large families. Externalizing disorders were strongly correlated with Sl and DT after controlling for other factors and this was true for internalizing disorders only when reported by the children.
   Conclusion: Recognizing suicidal ideation in young children may be recommended as part of preventive strategies such as screening in the context of the presence of any mental health problems whether externalizing or internalizing. (C) 2015 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

AB We studied the urinary excretion of the different arsenic species in urine samples from a young man who tried to commit suicide by ingesting about 0.6 g arsenic trioxide. He received immediate therapy with dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid (DMPS) after his delivery into the hospital. We assessed urinary arsenite (inorganic trivalent arsenic), arsenate (inorganic pentavalent arsenic), pentavalent dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and pentavalent monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) in urine with ion-exchange chromatography and on-line hydride-technique atomic absorption spectrometry. The predominant amount of the excreted arsenic was unchanged trivalent inorganic arsenic (37.4%), followed by pentavalent inorganic arsenic (2.6%), MMA (2.1%), DMA (0.2%) and one unidentified arsenic species (0.7%, if calculated as DMA). In the first urine voiding in the clinic, the total arsenic concentration was 215 mg/l, which fell 1000-fold after 8 days of DMPS therapy. A most striking finding was the almost complete inhibition of the second methylation step in arsenic metabolism. As mechanisms for the reduced methylation efficiency, the saturation of the enzymatic process of arsenic methylation, the high dosage of antidote DMPS, which might inhibit the activity of the methyl transferases, and analytical reasons are discussed. The high dosage of DMPS is the most likely explanation. The patient left the hospital after a 12-day treatment with antidote.

AB Scope Lithium is an important trace element in human nutrition and medicine. Mineral and medicinal waters may represent a significant source of dietary lithium intake. Methods and results The lithium concentration of 360 German mineral and 21 medicinal waters is determined. Based on a systematic screening, three different mineral waters exhibiting low (1.7 mu g L-1), medium (171 mu g L-1), and high lithium (1724 mu g L-1) concentrations are chosen for an acute bioavailability study in male healthy volunteers. In Germany, a north-east to south-west gradient of analyzed lithium concentrations is observed in the 381 tested waters. The lithium concentration in the water is significantly correlated with its sodium (r = 0. 810), potassium (r = 0.716), and magnesium (r = 0.361), but not with its calcium concentration. In a randomized cross-over trial, volunteers (n = 3x10 each) drink 1.5 L of the respective mineral waters, and lithium concentrations in serum and urine are monitored over 24 h. Consumption of the mineral waters with a medium and high lithium content results in a dose-dependent response in serum lithium concentrations and total urinary lithium excretion. Conclusion Lithium-rich mineral and medicinal waters may be an important and highly bioavailable lithium source for human consumption.

AB Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important cause of preventable deaths. The goal of this study was to provide data on epidemiology of TBI in Austria.
   Data on all hospital discharges, outpatients, and extra- as well as in-hospital deaths due to TBI were collected from various sources for the years 2009-2011. Population data (number of male/female people per age-group, population of Austrian cities, towns, and villages) for 2009-2011 were collected from the national statistical office. Incidence, case fatality rate(s) (CFR), and mortality rate(s) (MR) were calculated for the whole population and for age groups.
   Incidence (303/100,000/year), CFR (3.6 %), and MR (11/100,000/year) of TBI in Austria are comparable with those from other European countries. We found a high rate of geriatric TBI. The ratio between male and female cases was 1.4:1 for all cases, and was 2.2:1 for fatal cases. The most common mechanism was falls; traffic accidents accounted for only 7 % of the cases. Males died more frequently from traffic accidents and suicides, and females died more frequently from falls. CFRs and MRs increased with increasing age. CFRs were higher in patients from less populated areas, and MRs were lower in cases who lived closer to hospitals that admitted TBI.
   The high rate of geriatric TBI warrants better prevention of falls in this age group.

AB Objectives Comorbidity is a common feature of mental disorders. However, needs assessment surveys focus largely on individual disorders rather than on comorbidity even though the latter is more important for predicting suicidal thoughts and behaviors. In the current report, we take a step beyond this conventional approach by presenting data on the prevalence and correlates (sociodemographic factors, college-related factors, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors) of the main multivariate profiles of common comorbid Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV disorders among students participating in the first phase of the World Health Organization World Mental Health International College Student initiative. Method A web-based mental health survey was administered to first year students in 19 colleges across eight countries (Australia, Belgium, Germany, Mexico, Northern Ireland, South Africa, Spain, United States; 45.5% pooled response rate) to screen for seven common DSM-IV mental disorders: major depression, mania/hypomania, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, alcohol use disorder, and drug use disorder. We focus on the 14,348 respondents who provided complete data; 38.4% screened positive for at least one 12-month disorder. Results Multivariate disorder profiles were detected using latent class analysis (LCA). The least common class (C1; 1.9% of students) was made up of students with high comorbidity (four or more disorders, the majority including mania/hypomania). The remaining 12-month cases had profiles of internalizing-externalizing comorbidity (C2; 5.8%), internalizing comorbidity (C3; 14.6%), and pure disorders (C4; 16.1%). The 1.9% of students in C1 had much higher prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors than other students. Specifically, 15.4% of students in C1 made a suicide attempt in the 12 months before the survey compared with 1.3-2.6% of students with disorders in C2-4, 0.2% of students with lifetime disorders but no 12-month disorders (C5), and 0.1% of students with no lifetime disorders (C6). Conclusions In line with prior research, comorbid mental disorders were common; however, sociodemographic correlates of LCA profiles were modest. The high level of comorbidity underscores the need to develop and test transdiagnostic approaches for treatment in college students.

AB Autopsies conducted at the university Institutes of Legal Medicine in Berlin, Germany in the time period from 1997 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed for the frequency and phenomenology of fatal infant and juvenile cases of falls from low and great heights and compared with previous studies. The 16,211 autopsy protocols analyzed included 22 cases of fatal infant and juvenile (age between 0 and 17 years) falls from a great height. The average age of the deceased was 4.9 years with a median age of 25.5 months and 68 % of the victims were male. In 77 % of cases death was caused by accidental falls while 3 cases were due to suicide, 1 case was due to neonaticide and 1 other case was due to a psychiatric disorder. The main cause of death was traumatic brain and cranial injuries (59 %) followed by multiple trauma (32 %). The most common injuries involved the skull. The distance of fall varied between 7 and 34 m with an average height of 13 m. In cases of multiple trauma the average height of fall was 18 m. In small children skeletal injuries of the extremities were less common. Climbing or stepping aids used to overcome vertical barriers played a significant role in 75 % of accidental falls of infants aged between 2 and 4 years. The accidental falls occurred mainly around noon or the early evening during the spring and summer months.

AB Various Studies show a high prevalence of mental disorders among homeless people. So far most of these Studies deal solely with single men, mainly affected by homelessness. Few data exist for women, children, adolescents and whole families that are more and more affected by poverty and homelessness. This study, conducted in Innsbruck/Austria, determined the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among homeless adolescents. The adolescents were recruited in a counselling centre and homeless shelter specifically founded for homeless youth. Mental disorders were diagnosed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SKID-I). 40 adolescents and Young adults ranging from 14-23 years (mean 17,9 years) were included in the study. The results show that 58% of the homeless adolescents were exposed to continuous violence in their families and that violence was a major reason for them to leave home. The overall prevalence of diagnosed psychiatric disorders was 80% in the whole sample; the leading disorder was substance abuse/dependence (65%), followed by mood disorders (42,5%), anxiety disorders (17,5%) and eating disorders (17,5%). 57,5% of the adolescents had a history of self-harm and 25% reported at least one suicide attempt. Duration of homelessness had the greatest influence oil the prevalence of mental disorders. Longer duration of homelessness was associated with a higher risk of psychiatric disorder or self-harm. These results demonstrate the Urgent need for early psychosocial and psychiatric help for homeless adolescents.

TI Contemplating Medicine During the Third Reich: Scaffolding Professional
   Identity Formation for Medical Students
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB Problem
   The moral failures of physicians and the medical establishment in Germany and Austria during the Third Reich challenge medicine and medical education in a way few other events do. They compel medical educators to ensure that lessons learned from contemplating medicine during the Third Reich be integrated into current and future physicians' professional identities. Most health professions education programs, however, have not adopted this study domain in their curricula.
   Approach
   The authors describe a new curriculum module-" The Holocaust and Medicine"-and its implementation in October 2013 at Bar-Ilan University Faculty of Medicine in the Galilee, Safed, Israel, as a requirement for all medical students (starting with the class of 2017). This innovative module integrates historical facts, guided reflection, flipped classroom pedagogy, and program evaluation efforts. It spans 20 months of the preclinical curriculum, embedded within a doctoring course and a medical humanities longitudinal course and integrated within the clinical sciences blocks.
   Outcomes
   The evaluation approach will seek to measure changes in learners' knowledge and attitudes, capture their experience with the module, and assess the module's contribution to their identities as future healers.
   Next Steps
   This module aims to sensitize learners to medicine's fundamental dilemmas (e.g., prejudice, assisted reproduction and suicide, physicians in war), ideally enhancing critical reflection on the potential danger of "slippery slopes." The authors propose that contemplation of medicine after the Holocaust and the implications for contemporary practice should be an integral component of health professions education to promote humanistic, ethically responsible practice.

AB Objectives: To elicit types and frequencies of end - of - life practices by physician members of the German Society for Palliative Medicine. To analyse associations between characteristics of physicians and patients and end - of - life practices with intended hastening of death.
   Design: Cross - sectional postal survey.
   Main outcome measures: Types and frequencies of end - of - life practices with foreseeable or intended hastening of patients' death. Association between end - of - life practices with hastening of death and predefined characteristics of physicians and patients.
   Results: Nine hundred and one physicians participated in the study (response rate: 55.8%). There was alleviation of symptoms in 78.1% and limitation of medical treatment with possible life shortening in 69.1% of cases. In 10 cases medication had been administered by the physician (N = 9) or the patient (N = 1) with the intention to hasten death. Patients' best interest and avoidance of possible harm to the patient were reported as reasons for non - involvement of competent patients in decision making. Physicians with added qualification in palliative medicine significantly less frequently reported end - of - life practices with intended hastening of death (p = 0.003).
   Conclusion: Physician members of the German Society for Palliative Medicine perform a broad spectrum of end - of - life practices including intended hastening of death. The findings on patients' non - involvement in decision making warrant further empirical - ethical analysis.

AB Introduction: Industrial countries are experiencing substantial increases in cancer prevalence. While advanced cancer therapies resulted in prolonged survival most neoplasms still are incurable. Especially advanced stages of cancer are often accompanied by severe pain and other disabling symptoms. Sufficient pain and symptom control is needed to maintain a decent quality of life for cancer patients. However, expert palliative care for patients suffering from cancer pain is still insufficient. These deficits have encouraged pro-euthanasia pressure groups demanding legitimation of physician-assisted-suicide in Germany. Acting under the guise of promoting patient's autonomy these groups are gaining additional momentum from similar legislation recently passed in the Netherlands. Methods: Hospice movement and specialists in palliative medicine reject euthanasia as unethical and instead push for the global development of palliative care services. To address these issues the project SUPPORT was established in the Southern part of Lower-Saxony in 1996 with approval by the local ethics committee and sponsored by the German Ministry of Health. A palliative-care-team (PCT) of nurses and physicians with expert knowledge in palliative medicine supports patients after discharge from hospital by providing state-of-the-art palliative care at home. The PCT is available as a 24/7 standby service and can be called on demand by general practitioners, members of outpatient nursing services as well as by patients and their relatives. By cooperating with the PCT these professional and lay caregivers improve their knowledge and skills regarding pain and symptom control for terminally ill patients. Results: During almost 4 years of practical work more than 50 % of the patients enrolled in the project died at home compared to about 20% under regular conditions. These data point out quite impressively that due to the PCT-interventions recurrent hospitalisations in a majority of cancer pain patients can be avoided when expert knowledge and help is available at home for patients, their relatives and caregivers whenever needed. Conclusion: When sufficiently supported at home by palliative experts the number of patients dying at home is reasonably higher than the rate observed under regular conditions. This would also comply with the wishes of most patients who prefer to die in the privacy of their own home. The project data suggest that the concept of SUPPORT should be capable to improve the current state of palliative medicine in other areas of Germany as well.

AB Background: Scientific evidence for a male-typed depression ("male depression") is still limited, but mainly supports this concept with respect to single externalizing symptoms or symptom clusters. In particular, studies on non-clinical populations including males and females are lacking. The present study aims at assessing general well-being, the risk and the symptoms of male depression dependent on biological sex and gender-role orientation on instrumental (masculine) and expressive (feminine) personality traits in an unselected Community sample of males and females.
   Methods: Students (518 males, 500 females) of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Germany, were asked to participate in a "stress study" and complete the following self-report questionnaires: the WHO-5 Well-being Index [Bech, P., 1998. Quality of Life in the Psychiatric Patient. Mosby-Wolfe, London], the Gotland Scale for Male Depression [Walinder, J., Rutz, W,, 2001. Male depression and suicide. International Clinical Psychopharmacology 16 (suppl 2), 21-24] and the German Extended Personal Attribute Questionnaire [Runge, T.E., Frey, D., Gollwitzer, P.M., et al., 1981. Masculine (instrumental) and feminine (expressive) traits. A comparison between students in the United States and West Germany. Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology 12, 142-162].
   Results: General well-being of the students was significantly lower Compared to population norms. Contrary to expectations, female students had a greater risk of male depression than male students (28.9% vs. 22.4%; p<0.05). Overall, prototypic depressive symptoms as well as externalizing symptoms were more pronounced in females. In the subgroup of those at risk for male depression, biological sex and kind of symptoms were unrelated. Principal component analyses revealed a similar symptom structure for males and females. Low scores on masculinity/instrumentality significantly predicted higher risk of male depression, independent of biological sex. Limitations: The Study sample is not representative to the general population. Self-reports Of the participants were not validated by a clinical evaluation.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that male depression might also be highly prevalent in females, at least in University students. This can be explained by a growing social acceptance of aggression in women, by a greater exposure to chronic stressors and by a more pronounced stress sensitivity. Particularly female students need special attention and support. Externalizing symptoms should be routinely assessed when diagnosing depression in men and women. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB The global financial crisis, which started in 2008 in the USA, influenced most of the European countries, and in particular Greece, with serious socio-economic and political consequences. The Greek Government, faced with the risk of bankruptcy, was forced to accept financial, signing memoranda that imposed austerity, reductions in expenditure and structural reforms in all sectors. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the austerity policies in the health systems of Greece and other countries that applied budgetary stability programs, and to present the most significant health-care reforms that were instituted from 2010 onwards. A literature search was conducted of the economic indicators of the last 10 years in the international databases of WHO, OECD Health Statistics, Eurostat, the European Core Health Indicators and the statistical service of Cyprus. During the economic crisis the health level of the Greek population was documented to be at a satisfactory level, comparable with the other countries that experienced austerity, and even with Germany, a country with large expenditures on health, which did not experience economic crisis. Despite reduction in health expenditure and increasing unemployment, improvement of most health indicators was observed, with the exception of overall mortality and suicide. Major reforms implemented after 2010 in the Greek health system include restructuring of primary health care services, e-prescribing and the free access of all (including the uninsured) to the Greek National Health Service. Although many health indicators of the Greek population show improvement over this period, it is important to review the data and redefine the priorities in the field of health care at regular intervals, and in population subgroups.

AB Background: Paramedics, arriving on emergency cases first, have to make end-of-life decisions almost on a daily basis. Faith shapes attitudes toward the meaning and worth of life itself and therefore influences decision-making. Objective: The objective of this study was to detect whether or not religious and spiritual beliefs influence paramedics in their workday life concerning end-of-life decisions, and whether it is legally possible for them to act according to their conscience. Methods and Design: This is a literature review of prior surveys on the topic using five key words and questionnaire-based investigation using a self-administered online survey instrument. Settings/Participants: Paramedics all over Germany were given the opportunity to participate in this online questionnaire-based study. Measurements: Two databases were searched for prior studies for literature review. Participants were asked about their religiosity, how it affects their work, especially in end-of-life situations, how experienced they are, and whether or not they have any legal latitude to withhold resuscitation. Results: A total of 429 paramedics answered the questionnaire. Religious paramedics would rather hospitalize a patient holding an advance directive than leave him/her at home (P = 0.036) and think death is less a part of life than the nonreligious (P = 0.001). Otherwise, the Spearman's rho correlation was statistically insignificant for all tests regarding resuscitation. Conclusions: The paramedic's religiosity is not the prime factor in his/her decision-making regarding resuscitation.

AB Background and aims: Individuals with high level of negative mental health often tend to use the social platform Facebook to escape from daily stress. They are at risk to develop an emotional bond to Facebook linked to a need to stay permanently online. The current work investigated addictive use of Facebook and its conceptual framework in clinical context. Methods: In a longitudinal study design, duration of daily use of Facebook, addictive Facebook use, depressiveness, insomnia, and positive mental health (PMH) were assessed in a sample of 349 inpatients [M-age (SDage) = 50.13 (9.41)] of a psychosomatic rehabilitation clinic in Germany over a period of on average 6 weeks. Results: Regression analyses revealed that duration of daily Facebook use at the first measurement time point (T1) served as significant positive predictor of addictive Facebook use at the second measurement time point (T2). Addictive Facebook use (T1) significantly positively predicted depressiveness and insomnia (T2). Its prediction of PMH (T2) was significantly negative. Mediation analyses showed that PMH (T1) partially mediated the association between addictive Facebook use (T1) and depressiveness (T2), and fully mediated the relationship between addictive Facebook use (T1) and insomnia (T2). Discussion and conclusions: Current longitudinal results indicate that addictive Facebook use might negatively impact the recovery process of inpatients. Thus, it might be relevant to assess and consider addictive Facebook use in the clinical context. Therapeutic interventions are suggested to focus on the enhancement of inpatients' PMH level, which may buffer the negative effect of problematic Facebook use.

DT Article
DE Rommel; Desert Fox; Wehrmacht; war film; Basil Liddell Hart
ID FILMS; 1950S; WAR
AB This piece examines the British reception of the biography of German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel by the British author Brigadier Desmond Young, upon which was based the Twentieth Century-Fox movie The Desert Fox (Hathaway, 1951), British newspaper reviewers showed a love-hate relationship towards the memory of the late Wehrmacht Field Marshal. For some, such as former opponent Claude Auchinleck and military historian Basil Liddell Hart, Rommel was a talented field commander and resistance martyr, tangled up in the 20 July 1944 conspiracy against Hitler, for which he had been forced to commit suicide; for others, Such as Hugh Trevor-Roper and Richard Crossman, he was an unthinking collaborator who had betrayed the Fuhrer only when the war had turned against the army. The author argues that the book and film set the precedent for the cultural rehabilitation of the Wehrmacht on screen, not only in English-speaking countries, but in West Germany too. Moreover, Anglo-American military histories and films tended to depoliticize and remilitarize the Wehrmacht even more than West German productions. Other films considered include The Battle of the River Plate (Powell and Pressburger, 1956), III Met by Moonlight (Powell and Pressburger, 1957) and Ice Cold in Alex (Thompson, 1958). The author argues that the postwar 'clean hands' myth-making surrounding the Wehrmacht was performed not only by the West German film industry but by a transnational cultural division of labour which suited the needs of the Western alliance during Cold War rearmament and West German reintegration into the international community.

AB Background: Alcohol-related aggression and violence are a widespread cause of personal suffering with high socio-economic costs. In 2011, nearly one in three violent acts in Germany was committed under the influence of alcohol (31.8%). The link between alcohol consumption and aggression is promoted by various interacting factors.
   Methods: In this review, based on a selective search for pertinent literature in PubMed, we analyze and summarize information from original articles, reviews, and book chapters about alcohol and aggression and discuss the neurobiological basis of aggressive behavior.
   Results: Aggression is promoted both by the cognitive deficits arising in connection with acute or chronic alcohol use and by prior experience of violence in particular situations where alcohol was drunk. Only a minority of persons who drink alcohol become aggressive. On the other hand, alcohol abuse and dependence together constitute the second most commonly diagnosed cause of suicide (15-43%). Current research indicates that the individual tendency toward alcohol-induced aggression depends not just on neuro biological factors, but also on personal expectations of the effects of alcohol, on prior experience of violent conflicts, and on the environmental conditions of early childhood, especially social exclusion and discrimination. Gene-environment interactions affecting the serotonergic and other neurotransmitter systems play an important role. Potential (but not yet adequately validated) therapeutic approaches involve reinforcing cognitive processes or pharmacologically modulating serotonergic neurotransmission (and other target processes).
   Conclusion: Alcohol-related aggression has manifold social and neurobiological causes. Specific treatments must be tested in controlled trials.

AB Background - Migration during the 1990s has been high and has been characterised by new migrations. Migration has been a key force in the demographic changes of the European population. Due to the different condition of migration in Europe, variables related to mental health of migrants are: motivation for migration, living conditions in the home and in the host country.
   Aims - To give an overview on (i) prevalence of mental disorders; suicide; alcohol and drug abuse; (ii) access to mental health and psychosocial care facilities of migrants in the European region, and (iii) utilisation of health and psychosocial institution of these migrants.
   Methods - Non-system review of the literature concerning mental health disorders of migrants and their access to and their consumption of health care and psychosocial services in Europe.
   Results - It is impossible to consider "migrants" as a homogeneous group concerning the risk for mental illness. The literature showed (i) mental health differs between migrant groups, (ii) access to psychosocial care facilities is influenced by the legal frame of the host country: (iii) mental health and consumption of care facilities is shaped by migrants used patterns of help-seeking and by the legal frame of the host country.
   Conclusion - Data on migrant's mental health is scarce. Longitudinal studies are needed to describe mental health adjusting for life conditions in Europe to identify those factors which imply an increased risk of psychiatric disorders and influence help seeking for psychosocial care. In many European countries migrants fall outside the existing health and social services, particularly asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants. (C)2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Drug utilization studies have applied different methods to various data types to describe medication use, which hampers comparisons across populations. The aim of this study was to describe the time trends in antidepressant prescribing in the last decade and the variation in the prevalence, calculated in a uniform manner, in seven European electronic healthcare databases.
   Annual prevalence per 10,000 person-years (PYs) was calculated for 2001-2009 in databases from Spain, Germany, Denmark, the United Kingdom (UK), and the Netherlands. Prevalence data were stratified according to age, sex, antidepressant type (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors [SSRIs] or tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs]) and major indications.
   The age- and sex-standardized prevalence was lowest in the two Dutch (391 and 429 users per 10,000 PYs) and highest in the two UK (913 and 936 users per 10,000 PYs) populations in 2008. The prevalence in the Danish, German, and Spanish populations was 637, 618, and 644 users per 10,000 PY respectively. Antidepressants were prescribed most often in 20- to 60-year-olds in the two UK populations compared with the others. SSRIs were prescribed more often than TCAs in all except the German population. In the majority of countries we observed an increasing trend of antidepressant prescribing over time. Two different methods identifying recorded indications yielded different ranges of proportions of patients recorded with the specific indication (15-57 % and 39-69 % for depression respectively).
   Despite applying uniform methods, variations in the prevalence of antidepressant prescribing were obvious in the different populations. Database characteristics and clinical factors may both explain these variations.

AB Background. Psychiatric emergency situations (PES) are common in the physician-based emergency medical system (EMS) in Germany. However, many emergency physicians (EP) feel insecure in assessing the necessity for treatment of these patients. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate whether a short, newly developed questionnaire (Indicator for Psychiatric Pharmacotherapy, IPP) is able to help EPs in deciding for or against pharmacological treatment.
   Patients and methods. The protocols of the EMS at the Saarland University Hospital were prospectively collected over a 1-year period and PESs were identified and analyzed in detail. The 7-item IPP, which focuses on the most relevant psychiatric symptoms, was to be completed for each PES.
   Results. Among all calls for an EP (2,114) 250 (11.8%) were classified as a PES. The most frequent diagnoses were alcoholic intoxication, state of agitation and suicide attempts. Of the IPP questionnaires 193 could be evaluated and in 31.2% of all PESs a specific psychiatric medication was administered. These patients scored significantly higher in the IPP compared to those who did not receive medication (8.0 +/- 3.9 compared to 5.6 +/- 3.2, p < 0.001). The IPP items "anxiety", "agitation/aggression", "mood" and "physical symptoms/disorders" had the highest impact on the administration of psychotherapeutic drugs.
   Discussion. The IPP can be a valuable tool to assess the necessity of pharmacological treatment for patients in PESs. The assessment of the symptom categories "anxiety", "agitation/aggression", "mood" and "physical symptoms/disorders" seems to be sufficient to estimate a need for treatment.

AB Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine whether personality i.e. temperament and character interacts with age of onset in bipolar disorder.
   Methods: Bipolar patients were recruited among in- and outpatients from lithium dispensaries of northern Sweden. Patients were diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder type I and II. Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) was used for measuring personality. TCI was administered to 100 lithium treated bipolar patients and 100 controls.
   Results: Treatment response was significantly lower (p = 0.005) in patients with early onset compared with late onset. Family history (p = 0.013) and suicide attempts (p = 0.001) were also significantly more common in patients with early onset. Further, patients with early onset were significantly higher (p = 0.045) in the temperament factor harm avoidance (HA) than patients with late onset, but the difference was weak. Patients with early onset had more fear of uncertainty (HA2; p = 0.022) and were more shy (HA3; p = 0.030). Bipolar I patients showed similar results as those in the total bipolar group (I and II), with significantly higher HA (p = 0.019, moderate difference), HA2 (p = 0.015) and HA3 (p = 0.043) in patients with early onset compared with late onset. Bipolar II patients showed no differences between early and late age of onset but the groups are small and the results are therefore uncertain.
   Conclusions: Early age of onset in bipolar disorder was correlated to an increase in severity, family history, poorer treatment response and poorer prognosis. Early onset was also correlated to personality.

SO ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID MENTAL-DISORDERS; COMORBIDITY; PHOBIA; PREVALENCE; RELIABILITY; FEARS
AB Background: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) (also known as "social phobia") is frequently comorbid with major depression, and in such cases, almost always precedes it. This has led to interest in SAD as a possible modifier of the risk and/or course of mood disorders.
   Methods: Data come from a prospective, longitudinal epidemiologic study of adolescents and young adults (aged 14-24 years) in Munich, Germany. Respondent diagnoses (N = 2548) at baseline and follow-up (31-50 months later) are considered. The influence of SAD at baseline on the risk, course, and characteristics of depressive disorders tie, major depression or dysthymia) at follow-up is examined.
   Results: The baseline prevalence of SAD was 7.2% (95% confidence interval ICI], 6.1%-8.4%). Social anxiety disorder in nondepressed persons at baseline was associated with an increased likelihood (odds ratio [OR] = 3.5; 95% CI, 2.0-6.0) of depressive disorder onset during the follow-up period. Furthermore, comorbid SAD and depressive disorder at baseline was associated with a worse prognosis (compared with depressive disorder without comorbid SAD at baseline). This is exemplified by the greater likelihood of depressive disorder persistence or recurrence (OR= 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2-4.6) and attempted suicide (OR = 6.1; 95% CI, 1.2-32.2).
   Conclusions: Social anxiety disorder during adolescence or young adulthood is an important predictor of subsequent depressive disorders. Moreover, the presence of comorbid SAD in adolescents who are already depressed is associated with a more malignant course and character of subsequent depressive illness. These findings may inform targeted intervention efforts.

AB Background: We wanted to examine how the acceptance of euthanasia among the general public in Western Europe has changed in the last decades, and we wanted to look for possible explanations. Methods: We analysed data from the European Values Surveys, held in 1981, 1990, and 1999-2000 in 12 West European countries. In each country, representative samples of the general public were interviewed using the same structured questionnaire in all countries. Euthanasia was explained in the questionnaires as 'terminating the life of the incurably sick'. Results: A total of 46 199 respondents participated in the surveys. A significant increase in acceptance of euthanasia could be observed in all countries except (West) Germany. While the average increase in euthanasia acceptance was 22%, the increase was particularly obvious in Belgium, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. Although changes in several characteristics of respondents, such as decrease in religious beliefs, rising belief in the right to self-determination, and (to a lesser extent) rise in levels of education, were associated with growing acceptance of euthanasia, they could only partly explain the increase of euthanasia acceptance over the years. Conclusions: An increase of euthanasia acceptance among the general public took place over the last two decades in almost all West European countries, possibly indicating a growing support for personal autonomy regarding medical end-of-life decisions. If this trend continues, it is likely to increase the public and political debate about the (legal) regulation of euthanasia under certain conditions of careful medical practice in several West European countries.

TI THE CALCULUS OF SHAREHOLDERS' CONSENT: A CONSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS THEORY
   OF CORPORATE CHARTER AMENDMENT RULES
SO UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
LA English
DT Article

   EXCHANGES; BEHAVIOR; COSTS; ESSAY
AB The charter of a corporation is the "constitution" agreed to by all its members. The charter, however, is not a "suicide pact," it can be amended according to the charter amendment rules in corporate law when circumstances change. These charter amendment rules vary significantly across jurisdictions. In Delaware, shareholders can amend the charter with a simple majority vote of shares. The amendment must be initiated by the board of directors and decisions to amend the charter are made usually by a supermajority vote of shares. Board approval is not necessary in the United Kingdom, Germany, or France. Within a given jurisdiction, the rules governing the amendment of different provisions are also very different. This Article makes the first attempt to employ the constitutional economic theory developed by Buchanan and Tullock to explain different charter amendment rules. It identifies a fundamental tradeoff between the needs of adaptation and commitment. If charter amendment rules are too procedurally burdensome, they may harm the adaptation of corporate charters. If they do not impose meaningful regulation on charter amendment, minority shareholders cannot be sure that corporate insiders or controlling shareholders would not amend the charter in the midstream to harm shareholders' interests. Different states may choose different charter amendment rules to achieve a balance between adaptation and commitment. The choice between different charter amendment rules made by different states can be explained by several factors, including institutional investors and judicial capacity. This theory sheds new light on a series of issues in the corporate law literature, including the explanation for mandatory rules and appraisal rights in corporate law, the debate of increasing shareholder power in the United States, and why law, rather than contract, is important in corporate governance.

DE Vindex; Nero; Roman Empire; rebellion; revolt; 68 AD
AB The article discusses the rebellion led by Caius Iulius Vindex (the governor of the Roman province of Gaul) against emperor Nero. Vindex, who was disheartened with the policy of the princeps, wanted Nero's place on the Roman throne to be taken by a person worthy of being a proper successor to Caesar and Augustus. This was the main reason for his revolt, which began in the middle of March 68 AD. Vindex's insurgence was largely supported by the Gauls and the governor of the province of Hispania Tarraconensis, i.e. Servius Sulpicius Galba. However, his troops were crushed by the joint contingent from Upper and Lower Germany under the command of L. Verginius Rufus in the battle of Vesontio, which took place between the end of April and the middle of May 68 AD (the exact date cannot be established). As a result, C. Iulius Vindex committed suicide. Nevertheless, the anti-emperor movement started by Vindex grew stronger, and eventually Nero, abandoned by everyone, took his own life on June 9, and Vindex's former ally, Galba, became the new emperor. The principal goal of the rebellion, i.e. replacing Nero with a new ruler of a better character was ultimately achieved, albeit after Vindex's tragic death. These events were also a prelude to "the long year" (annus longus) or the so called "the year of the four emperors". After his death, the leader of the anti-Nero revolt was honored by the new emperor Galba with a public funeral. Until the times of the late antiquity, the person of Caius Iulius Vindex had embodied in Roman collective memory an indomitable freedom defender (adsertor libertatis), who desired the good of the Roman Empire and the entire gens humana.

AB BackgroundParacetamol overdoses cause severe liver damage; therefore, the German Drug Prescription Act was revised in 2009 to limit the over the counter availability of paracetamol in pharmacies to 10g per pack without amedical prescription.ObjectiveData from two sources in northern Germany concerning paracetamol poisoning were evaluated. Special attention was paid to the change of prescription regulations and possible effects on paracetamol cases.Material and methodsData from the Department of Legal Medicine Hamburg (from 2007-2017) and the GIZ Nord Poison Center (from 2008-2017) were analyzed with respect to the development of case numbers over the time periods in question, poisoning severity, measured serum concentrations, patients' medical history and factors, such as age, gender and cause of poisoning.ResultsNo overall reduction in the number of paracetamol poisoning cases was noted in the Department of Legal Medicine Hamburg, even after the legislation change in 2009. The number of inquiries at the GIZ Nord Poison Center declined mostly for minor poisoning by 24% from 2010 to 2014. Severe poisoning remained nearly unchanged. Half of the patients in both collectives were younger than 21years old. In adolescents and adult patients approximately 75% stated having overdosed on purpose. Young patients ingested the drug while unsupervised or were given wrong dosages by caregivers. Due to the short half-life of paracetamol, the analytical detection of paracetamol can be negative if blood is taken more than 15-18h after ingestion.ConclusionThe results show that paracetamol poisoning is still amajor issue and the legislation changes did not have arelevant impact. It is necessary to further evaluate the possibility of stricter laws concerning availability of paracetamol.

AB Objectives: Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA) exist ubiquitously in our environment. More than 6000 plants, about 3% of the world's flowering plants, are known to synthesize PA. As a consequence, many herbal ingredients, including St. John's wort (SJW), are contaminated with PA that can possess acute and subchronic toxic effects as well as mutagenic and genotoxic properties. Therefore, the possible benefits of SJW as an herbal remedy against depression need to be weighed against the possible risks of unwanted PA intake. Methods: We searched the literature regarding the current knowledge on PA and evaluated the evidence on the antidepressant effects of quantified SJW extract based on a Cochrane Review and the current practice guidelines on depression. Risks are depicted in form of a risk ladder and benefits in form of an icon array. Results: Evidence from clinical studies indicates that quantified SJW extract is an effective treatment option for mild to moderate depression with fewer side effects than conventional antidepressants. Health statistics from different countries do not quantify cases of death caused by PA intake. However, deaths due to suicide, often triggered by depression, are common (11 in 1000 in Germany in 2015) and rank between fatalities due to liver diseases (16 in 1000) and household accidents (10 in 1000). Conclusions: Quantified SJW extract is a safe and effective treatment option, and its potential of treating depression outweighs the (hypothetical) risk of unwanted PA intake.

AB Objective: To evaluate the efficiency of a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD).
   Design: Placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial in 22 patients with genetically confirmed SCA3/MJD. Study phases of 6 months were separated by a washout period of 4 weeks. Dosages were a combination of trimethoprim, 160 mg, and sulfamethoxazole, 800 mg, twice daily for 2 weeks, followed by a combination of trimethoprim, 80 mg, and sulfamethoxazole, 400 mg, twice daily for 5.5 months.
   Setting: Outpatient department of the Neurological Clinic, Ruhr-University, Bochum, Germany.
   Main Outcome Measures: Ataxia ranking scale, self-assessment score, static posturography, and results of motor performance testing. Effects on the visual system were studied using the achromatic Vision Contrast Test System and the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test for color discrimination. Physical and mental health were documented using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. Subgroup analyses assessed the influence of age, sex, age at onset, duration of the disease, phenotype, and CAG repeat length on test performance.
   Results: Twenty of 22 patients completed the study. Dropouts were due to a rash (placebo phase) and an attempted suicide in a family conflict. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy had no significant effect in SCA3/MJD patients in the short-term analysis (2 weeks) or in the long-term interval (6 months).
   Conclusions: In contrast to previous reports that studied smaller groups of patients, treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not improve the diverse and complex movement disorders caused by SCA3/MJD. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had no effect on the visual system and cannot be recommended as a continuous treatment for SCA3/MJD patients.

AB Background: In 2003, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) warned against the treatment of childhood depression with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) due to increased risk of suicide. This study examined the effect of this warning on the prevalence of anti-depressants in Irish children and compared age and gender trends and international comparisons of prescription rates.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study of the Irish Health Service Executive (HSE) pharmacy claims database for the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme for dispensed medication. Data were obtained for 2002-2011 for those aged = 15 years. Prevalence of anti-depressants per 1000 eligible population, along with 95 % confidence intervals, were calculated. A negative binomial regression analysis was used to investigate trends and compare rates across years, sex and age groups (0-4, 5-11, 12-15 years). International prescribing data were retrieved from the literature.
   Results: The prevalence of anti-depressants decreased from 4.74/1000 population (95 % CI: 4.47-5.01) in 2002 to 2.61/1000 population (95 % CI: 2.43-2.80) in 2008. SSRI rates decreased from 2002 to 2008. Prescription rates for contra-indicated SSRIs paroxetine, sertraline and citralopram decreased significantly from 2002 to 2005, and, apart from paroxetine, only small fluctuations were seen from 2005 onwards. Fluoxetine was the most frequently prescribed anti-depressant and rates increased between 2002 and 2011. Anti-depressant rates were higher for younger boys and older girls. The Irish prevalence was lower than the US, similar to the U.K. and higher than Germany and Denmark.
   Conclusions: The direction and timing of these trends suggest that medical practitioners followed the IMB advice.

DE rigor mortis; livores; vita minima; benzodiazepine; intoxication
AB In the past years an ongoing controversial debate exists in Germany, regarding quality of the coroner's inquest and declaration of death by physicians.
   We report the case of a 90-year old female, who was found after an unknown time following a suicide attempt with benzodiazepine. The examination of the patient showed livores (mortis?) on the left forearm and left lower leg. Moreover, rigor (mortis?) of the left arm was apparent which prevented arm flexion and extension.
   The hypothermic patient with insufficient respiration was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Chest compressions were not performed, because central pulses were (hardly) palpable and a sinus bradycardia 45/min (AV-block 2 degrees and sole premature ventricular complexes) was present. After placement of an intravenous line (17 G, external jugular vein) the hemodynamic situation was stabilized with intermittent boli of epinephrine and with sodium bicarbonate. With improved circulation livores and rigor disappeared.
   In the present case a minimal central circulation was noted, which could be stabilized, despite the presence of certain signs of death (livores and rigor mortis). Considering the finding of an abrogated peripheral perfusion (livores), we postulate a centripetal collapse of glycogen and ATP supply in the patients left arm (rigor), which was restored after resuscitation and reperfusion. Thus, it appears that livores and rigor are not sensitive enough to exclude a vita minima, in particular in hypothermic patients with intoxications. Consequently a careful ABC-check should be performed even in the presence of apparently certain signs of death, to avoid underdiagnosing a vita minima. Additional ECG-monitoring is required to reduce the rate of false positive declarations of death. To what extent basic life support by paramedics should commence when rigor and livores are present until physician DNR order, deserves further discussion.

ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; ATTITUDES; DEFINITIONS
AB Background and objective: Despite eager public interest there have been few significant studies about the views of the German population on active euthanisia. it was our purpose to investigate, before undertaking a representative enquiry about this controversial and ethically sensitive topic, to what extent public opinion and the underlying norms, values and preferences can be adequately obtained by standardized data collection.
   Cohort and methods: An Interdisciplinary project: group established a standardized written Form of enquiry for measuring public opinion about active euthanasia. The test was per formed on an anonymized random sample of 110 persons living in North Germany. The questionnaires consisted of ten hypothetical cases, 11 potentially relevant viewpoints on likely decisions and eight frequently expressed arguments used in the debate for and against euthanasia.
   Results: The reply rate to the questionnaire was 89% (n = 98; 37 men and 59 women, average age 39.5 [21-81] years). Agreement with active euthanasia in the various case examples ranged, according to context, from 85 to 93%, Active euthanasia was accepted by a clear majority, if preconditions of a voluntary decision by a ment ally sound person and incurable, terminal disease (cancer) are cumulatively fulfilled. Otherwise It was rejected by most respondents. To a clear majority, active euthanasia implied both the chance that suffering would bit shortened, but also the danger of misuse. Among the persons questioned those with professional experience of euthanasia were clearly more sceptical about active euthanasia than those without such experience.
   Conclusions: The standardized written questionnaire made it possible to obtain a differentiated picture of public opinion on active euthanasia. However, these data represent only a moment in the dynamic process of a norm being established within a society and must on no account be used as legitimizing active euthanasia by plebiscite.

TI Silicone castings on cartilage as tool mark-scientific "fingerprints"

DT Article
DE Tool mark; Human cartilage; Bone; Stick injury; Impression
ID VALIDATION
AB Not infrequently, suicides or homicides are carried out by a sharp or semi-sharp tool through puncture, cut or slash injuries. Such tools have individual features through manufacturing and use that can leave individual-specific marks, especially during penetration of cartilage tissue, so that an unambiguous "injury-tool" assignment can be made.
   Since April 2012, in cooperation with the Department of Tool Marks of the Office of Criminal Investigation North Rhine-Westphalia (LKA NRW), Germany, tool marks in cartilage after puncture or cut injuries are secured by AccuTransA (R) casting material at the Institute of Legal Medicine Cologne. Together with the weapon in question, these casts are sent to the LKA NRW for a comparative tool-mark examination.
   Ten death cases have been included so far in the current project. In one third of the cases, the potential implements used in the crime could be clearly identified as the cause of the injury. The remaining studies provided inconclusive results. There were no false results.
   The casting of marks in human cartilage and possibly bones, for example by AccuTransA (R) casting material, and the tool-mark examination provide an easy-to-use method for exclusion or identification of the potential implements used in the crime as cause of an injury. In the absence of an alleged murder weapon, these analyses could help investigators make statements about the tool used. The cooperation between the LKA NRW and the Institute of Legal Medicine avoids the transport of body tissue because the casts on the injured cartilage are already taken on the autopsy table. The comparative tool-mark examinations are then carried out in the laboratory of LKA and rated by experts.

AB Diphenhydramine (DPH), an H1-antihistamine, is identified during postmortem toxicological analyses on a relatively rare but still regular basis. This study examines suicidal intoxications with DPH by analyzing blood and gastric content concentration levels. Twenty cases of DPH intoxications within a 10-year period (2000-2010) were discovered by screening the autopsy records of the Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences (ILMFS) in Berlin, Germany. In four cases, DPH levels were lower than 1 mu g/mL and hence were not considered likely to be responsible for causing death. In 11 cases, DPH played a role in the fatal episode, and five of these cases were monointoxications. Considering that more than 8,000 autopsies were performed by the ILMFS within the time period under examination, there is only one monointoxication case every 2 years, which makes it a rare occurrence. In two of these intoxications, DPH was only measured in toxic but not "lethal" concentrations in blood, with a concentration of 5 mu g/mL being generally used as the cut off between categories according to forensic literature. This raises the question as to whether a strict boundary for a "lethal" blood concentration, as suggested in some literature, can be set and applied in any of these cases. This study shows that an individual interpretation of each case is of utmost importance for correct classification. A thorough toxicological analysis of peripheral venous blood and gastric content, as well as a detailed work-up of the death circumstances, are the basis of an exact interpretation of intoxications with DPH.

AB The establishment of the exact time and cause of death plays an important role in criminal investigation and criminal law. In violent deaths, where a suspicion that a criminal offence has been committed arises, investigation often focuses on a specific suspect on the basis of a clearly established time and cause of death, or on the examination of other important circumstances surrounding the death in order to close the circle of alleged suspects. An exact post-mortem diagnosis of the time and cause of death requires multidisciplinary cooperation between the police, who establish relevant circumstances surrounding the death, and a physician, who performs a post-mortem examination of the body. This is why the present paper considers post-mortem diagnostics both as part of criminal differential diagnosis and as part of medical post-mortem diagnostics. The competent and quality performance of post-mortem diagnostics is in many ways affected by organisational and cognitive factors.
   This study presents an analysis of legal arrangements governing the work of post-mortem examination services in Germany, Austria, Croatia and Slovenia, and identifies good and bad practices on the basis of professional opinions expressed by experts working in the field of criminal investigation and forensic medicine in comparable countries. Results and findings represent a useful basis for the formulation of a proposal for a new model of post-mortem examination service presented in the last section of this paper. The proposed model provides a basis for achieving qualitative progress in the field of post-mortem diagnostics not only in Slovenia but also in other countries of continental Europe.

DT Article
DE Assisted dying; Legal regulations; Palliative care; Act to Improve
   Hospice and Palliative Care; Specialized home palliative care service
AB In December 2015 two different laws were adopted. Both are of importance for palliative care. One of the laws criminalizes commercial, "business-like" assisted suicide (A A 217 German Criminal Code), the other one aims to improve hospice and palliative care in Germany. Through the latter far-reaching changes in Social Code Books V and XI, as well as of the Hospital Finance Act have been made. This new Act to Improve Hospice and Palliative Care (HPG) focuses, amongst others, on: (a) Better funding of hospice services, by raising the minimum grant for patients in inpatient hospices paid per day by the health insurance funds by about 28.5%, and for outpatient hospice services by about 18%; (b) further development of general outpatient nursing and medical palliative care, and the networking of different service providers; (c) introduction of an arbitration procedure for service provider agreements to be concluded between the health insurance funds and the teams providing specialized home palliative care (SAPV); (d) the right to individual advice and support by the health insurance funds; (e) care homes may offer their residents advance care planning programs to be funded by the statutory health insurers; (f) palliative care units in hospitals can be remunerated outside the DRG system by per diem rates; (g) separate funding and criteria for multi-professional palliative care services within a hospital.
   While little concrete impact on hospice and palliative care can be expected following the new A A 217 German Criminal Code, the HPG provides a good basis to improve care. For this purpose, however, which complementary and more concrete agreements are made to put the new legal regulations into practice will be crucial.

AB The dramatic change in the political climate in the United States after the victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential elections sparked a heated debate in the intellectual circles about the nature, historical foundations and the future of the American democracy. The discussion centers on the topic of a "suicide of democracy", with the collapse of the Weimar Republic in Germany being its classic example, and the prospects for the Weimar scenario in the United States.
   From the Political Science viewpoint, the content of this discussion is of interest in at least three respects. First, it captures the truly significant changes in the American political system, indicating qualitative, if not irreversible, shifts. Second, it poses a methodological problem of measuring the degree of deformation of the democratic institutions. Third, it allows one to look at the United States in a comparative perspective, drawing on the experience of other countries.
   The article analyzes why the image of Weimar America is relevant for the political agenda of the United States, considers various interpretations of the meaning of the current changes, contours and basic parameters of the erosion of democracy and the system of separation of powers, polar assessments of the phenomenon of trumpism, as well as the ideas about the possibility of overcoming the political contradictions faced by one of the oldest democracies in the world. In the conclusion, the author examines the question of the Weimar paradigm of the collapse of democracies and demonstrates the extent to which the above discussed problems are specific to the United States, and to which extent they reflect global trends and can be integrated into the general theory of stability of democratic regimes.

AB Autopsies can give valuable information about the cause of death, and represent an important tool for obtaining valid cause of death statistics. In particular, they may shed light on the circumstances of death in ambiguous and criminal cases. To address the need for information on current autopsy practices, forensic autopsy rates in two counties in Central Norway over the period 2007-2009 were assessed. To investigate toxicological findings that could possibly remain undisclosed without the performance of an autopsy, the impact of alcohol and drugs in forensic autopsy cases from this material was evaluated.
   The total forensic autopsy rate in this material was 3%. The forensic autopsy rates were low for natural deaths (1%), accidental falls (12%) and the heterogeneous category "other accidents'' (21%), relatively high for accidental poisonings (84%), and less than adequate for road traffic accidents (57%). For suicides the forensic autopsy rate was 63%, and for recognized homicides 100%. The total forensic autopsy rate was higher for men than for women (5% vs. 2%), and decreased with age, being 38% in the age group <30 years, 23% in the age group 30-59 years, and 1% in the age group >59 years. Despite that Norwegian legislation and regulations regarding forensic autopsy requests are national, the forensic autopsy rates were generally lower in the county of Nord-Trondelag than in Sor-Trondelag, with most striking differences in suicide deaths (11% vs. 91%) and road traffic accidents (46% vs. 67%). This illustrates how autopsy rates, and possibly cause of death registries, might be susceptible to the influence of regional variations in law enforcement, with possible consequences for the quality and validity of cause of death statistics.
   Of the forensic autopsy cases where toxicological analysis was performed (361 of 364 cases) a total of 71% had positive toxicology results; 12% were positive for alcohol only, 44% were positive for drugs only, and 15% were positive for both alcohol and drugs. The toxicology results suggest that alcohol and drugs are important factors in sudden unexpected deaths, and that a thorough and comprehensive toxicological analysis is called for when investigating these deaths. Mean BAC in alcohol positive forensic autopsy cases was 1.7% (median 1.6%, range 0.29-4.1%). The average number of substances detected in toxicology positive cases was 2.6 (median 2, range 1-10). The by far most frequently detected classes of substances were (1) benzodiazepines, (2) opioids and (3) alcohol. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It is considered empirically proven that forensic commitment hospital units fulfil their legal task, namely of improving the condition of patients to such an extent that they no longer pose a threat to the general public. The recidivism rate for forensic commitment patients is significantly lower than for offenders who serve prison sentences. This finding has also been corroborated for Hamburg. Forensic psychiatric treatment even delivers the desired results in a metropolitan region with an accumulation of problematic and complex disorder patterns. Entries for slightly less than one third (32.9%) of the discharged patients were subsequently recorded in Germany's Central Criminal Register (BZR). The recidivism rate for severe acts of violence was gratifyingly low (9.6% for serious recidivism cases, 8.2% for pertinent recidivism cases) with long catamnesis periods (mean 10 years and 8 months follow-up), Overall, it can be stated that for the most part documented recidivism cases were less severe than the initial offences. According to the available statistics, discharges in accordance with 67 b of the German Criminal Code (StGB), where treatment in a forensic commitment hospital is suspended for an operational probationary period, in connection with schizoaffective disorders and addiction problems result in an elevated risk of recidivism. A criminal history is an important criminal prognostic factor, as current studies also concluded. These patients featured more frequently in the BZR, showed recidivism that was more serious and accordingly experienced harsher penalties. In many respects, patients whose convictions were suspended in accordance with 67 b of the German Criminal Code represent a special risk group. In these cases recidivism occurs more frequently and earlier and takes forms that are more serious. According to the results of other published study data, they also fare significantly worse with respect to premature death, suicide and rehospitalization. These aspects should be factored into future decisions reached by the sentencing courts. In forensic outpatient aftercare particular attention must be paid to the early onset of delinquency and renewed detention, to schizoaffective patients with addiction problems and to the category of patients discharged in accordance with 67b of the StGB. It is also of significance if unscheduled hearings are required during the period of supervision and if probation officers and/or therapists (must) contact the court. These are often the first indications of growing destabilization (including risk-related behavior, such as compliance problems relating to medication, consumption of alcohol or other psychotropic substances, social difficulties and the disruption of contacts with parole officers and designated therapists) that often triggers an increased risk of criminally relevant misconduct.

AB BackgroundAcute psychiatric wards in Germany are often locked due to the assumption that opening could endanger patients and society. On the contrary, some findings suggest that aversive events such as absconding and attempted suicides do not occur more often on wards with an open-door policy. However, these data are probably biased with regard to differing patient populations on open and locked wards. To our best knowledge, the present study is the first prospective controlled study with a quasi-experimental design dealing with this issue.MethodsThis study investigates whether indicators of an open-door policy, as measured by a priori determined outcomes, can be improved by a defined complex intervention on two intervention wards in two psychiatric hospitals, compared to two control wards with otherwise very similar conditions. Both hospitals contain two wards identical in structure and patient admittance policies, so that a similar study protocol can be followed with similar patient populations. Both hospitals have a defined catchment area and receive voluntary and involuntary admissions. In a baseline phase, wards will be opened facultatively (i.e., if it seems possible to staff). In the following intervention period, one ward per hospital will establish an enhanced open-door policy by applying additional strategic and personnel support. As a control group, the control ward will continue to be opened facultatively. After one year, control wards will be opened according to the open-door policy as well. Interventions will include the continuous identification of patients at risk as well as the development of individual care concepts and additional staffing. For this purpose, nursing and medical staff will be methodically supported on an ongoing basis by study staff.Outcomes variables will be the percentage of door opening on each ward between 8a.m. and 8p.m., the percentage of all treatment days with the door opened and the number of involuntary treatment days with open doors. Data on frequencies of aggressive incidents, absconding, police searches, and seclusion or restraint will be used as control variables. Additional costs will be calculated.DiscussionTreating mentally ill patients on locked wards is a highly relevant and critically discussed topic. In particular, it is controversially discussed whether changes in door policy can be established without increasing risks to patients and others. This study aims to gain robust data on this issue, going beyond beliefs and questionable retrospective observational studies.Trial registrationOur trial Open Doors By Fair Means is retrospectively registered with DRKS (DRKS00015154) on Sept. 10th 2018 and displayed on the public web site.

In Germany, for example, prisoners are 48 to 69 times more likely to be infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) than the general population, and 7 to 12 times more likely to be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The prevalence of mental illnesses is also markedly higher in the incarcerated than in the general population.
   Methods: This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective search in two databases (PubMed and Google Scholar) for any of the terms "health care," "primary health care," "mental health care"; "infectious disease," "opioid maintenance treatment," and "severe mental disorder" in conjunction with "prison," "jail," "detention," and "incarceration."
   Results: Among prisoners in German prisons, approximately 20% consume heroin, 20-50% suffer from alcohol dependency and abuse, and 70-85% smoke. The prevalence of tuberculosis in German prisons in 2002 was 0.1%. The provision of needles to incarcerated persons has a preventive effect on infection with hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and HIV, yet programs of this type have been discontinued in most penal facilities. In a systematic review, psychotic disorders were found in 3.6% (95% confidence interval [Cl]: [3.1; 4.2]) of male inmates and 3.9% [95% Cl: 2.7; 5.0] of female inmates. 25% of incarcerated persons suffer from attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Persons recently released from prison have an above average mortality, largely due to drug intoxication.
   Conclusion: An analysis of medical prescribing data reveals deficiencies in the provision of HCV treatment to all affected persons and in the provision of substitution treatment to persons with opiate dependency. In view of the known risks associated with imprisonment, greater emphasis should be placed on the provision of treatment for infectious diseases, substance dependencies, and mental illness, both in prison and in outpatient care after release.

AB In many European countries, the last decade has been marked by an increasing debate about the acceptability and regulation'of euthanasia and other end-of-life decisions in medical practice. Growing public sensibility to a 'right to die' for terminally ill patients has been one of the main constituents of these debates. Within this context. we sought to describe and compare acceptance of euthanasia among the general public in 33 European countries. We used the European Values Study data of 1999-2000 with a total of 41 125 respondents (63% response rate) in 33 European countries. The main outcome measure concerned the acceptance of euthanasia (defined as 'terminating the life of the incurably sick', rated on a scale from I to 10).
   Results showed that the acceptance of euthanasia tended to be high in some Countries (e.g. the Netherlands, Denmark, France, Sweden), while a markedly low acceptance was found in others (e.g. Romania. Malta and Turkey). A multivariate ordinal regression showed that weaker religious belief was the most important factor associated with a higher acceptance: however, there were also socio-demographic differences: younger cohorts. people from non-manual social classes, and people with a higher educational level tended to have a higher acceptance of euthanasia. While religious belief. sociodemographic factors, and also moral values (i.e. the belief in the right to self-determination) could largely explain the differences between countries, our findings suggest that perceptions regarding euthanasia are probably also influenced by national traditions and history (e.g. Germany). Thus, we demonstrated clear cross-national differences with regard to the acceptance of euthanasia, which can serve as an important basis for further debate and research in the specific countries.

AB Objective: Given that a cohort effect is rarely mentioned as one of the possible contributors to the increased incidence of childhood-onset bipolar disorder in the United States, we reexamined evidence for the phenomenon within our outpatient Bipolar Collaborative Network.
   Methods: 968 outpatients (mean age, 41 years) with DSM bipolar disorder from 1995 to 2002 from 4 sites in the United States and 3 in the Netherlands and Germany (abbreviated as Europe) gave informed consent and provided detailed demographic, illness, and family history information on a patient questionnaire. Family history of bipolar disorder, depression, suicide attempt, alcohol abuse, substance abuse, and "other" illness was collected for each parent and the 4 grandparents. Age at onset and family history of illness burden were then assessed as a function of the age of the patient at network entry.
   Results: Data for patients aged 35 years or older (n = 613) were included in the first analysis. Compared to older patients, those who were younger when they entered the network had an earlier age at onset of their bipolar disorder (r = 0.33, P < .001). Similarly, the youngest patients at entry (representing the most recent cohorts) had parents and grandparents with more psychiatric illness than patients born in earlier cohorts (n = 968).
   Conclusions: These preliminary data, taken with the substantial literature, suggest a cohort effect for earlier age at onset of bipolar disorder and greater burden of psychiatric disorders in 2 generations of direct progenitors of our patients. The resulting likely increase in severity of bipolar illness in future generations based on this earlier age at onset and increased familial loading, particularly in the United States, deserves focused clinical and public health attention and attempts at amelioration.

AB In 2017 the inauguration of the Mungsten Bridge, a most ambitious, wide-span bridge from 19th century Germany, dated back 120 years. For that reason, a designation of the bridge as a UNESCO World heritage site as part of a conglomerate together with four other European bridges, the Maria Pia Bridge and the Dom Luiz I Bridge in Porto/Portugal, the Viaduct of Garabit in France and the Ponte Michele in Northern Italy, is currently prepared. The five bridges were designed and built between 1875 and 1897, and they are all similar in terms of the technological and political ambition they were projected with. The Mungsten Bridge, at that time named "Kaiser-Wilhelm-Bridge", included numerous innovative technical features concerning the design, the material as well as the applied construction methods and until today, the bridge is attributed with various legends. One of these legends deals with an engineer, who committed suicide because of false calculations or construction details, which he had contributed to the project. As Anton v. Rieppel is believed to be the only creator and designer of the "Mungsten Bridge", there was never a reason for doubting his predominance. Recently found historical sources however, name in fact another person who was supposed to be involved in the Mungsten Bridge project and could be another protagonist. Before working for the company, responsible for the design and construction of the Mungsten Bridge, he was a known engineer in 19th century steel bridge design with a large engineering expertise among eight wide span bridges over River Rhine. He died in a natural way, shortly after completion of the bridge in 1897. These facts and the situation, that he was consistently concealed in the context of the Mungsten Bridge, point at special circumstances, which lead to the complete obliteration of his lifework in professional public.

AB Severe life-threatening injuries in Western Europe are mostly caused by blunt trauma. However, penetrating trauma might be more common in urban regions, but their characteristics have not been fully elucidated.
   Retrospective analysis of data from patients admitted to our urban university level I trauma center between 2008 and 2013 with suspicion of severe multiple injuries. Collection of data was performed prospectively using a PC-supported online documentation program including epidemiological, clinical and outcome parameters.
   Out of 2095 trauma room patients admitted over the 6-year time period 194 (9.3 %) suffered from penetrating trauma. The mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 12.3 +/- 14.1 points. In 62.4 % (n = 121) the penetrating injuries were caused by interpersonal violence or attempted suicide, 98 of these by stabbing and 23 by firearms. We observed a widespread injury pattern where mainly head, thorax and abdomen were afflicted. Subgroup analysis for self-inflicted injuries showed higher ISS (19.8 +/- 21.8 points) than for blunt trauma (15.5 +/- 14.6 points). In 82.5 % of all penetrating trauma a surgical treatment was performed, 43.8 % of the patients received intensive care unit treatment with mean duration of 7.4 +/- 9.3 days. Immediate emergency surgical treatment had to be performed in 8.0 vs. 2.3 % in blunt trauma (p < 0.001). Infectious complications of the penetrating wounds were observed in 7.8 %.
   Specific characteristics of penetrating trauma in urban regions can be identified. Compared to nationwide data, penetrating trauma was more frequent in our collective (9.3 vs. 5.0 %), which may be due to higher crime rates in urban areas. Especially, self-inflicted penetrating trauma often results in most severe injuries.

AB Background. The purpose of the study was to determine factors that influence the decision of the next living relative of a deceased for consent on cornea donation.
   Methods. The interviews with the relatives of 94 potential cornea donors of the Eye Bank of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universistat, Munich were analysed. The influence of sociological factors on the frequency of obtained consent was investigated.
   Results. During a 3-month-period, 77 relatives of 94 possible donors were asked for consent to cornea donation and 56 consents (73%) and 21 refusals (27%) were obtained. In 17 (18%) of the cases the relatives could not be reached. Analysis showed a higher consent rate for donors with a university degree (82%) versus those without (71%). Consent was more often obtained for donors who were divorced (88%) than from those who were single (62%). Children of full age (83%) consented more frequently to cornea donation than husbands and wives (78%) or the parents of the deceased (60%). Examination of the postal codes of the residential area indicated more frequent refusals for donors from the rural (54% consent rate) than the urban Munich population (77% consent rate). The situation was the opposite for the residential area of the consenting relative where there was a higher willingness to donate in cases of suicide (93%) in contrast to other causes such as nat and traffic accidents (71%).
   Conclusion. Socio-economic factors such as education, marital status, residential area and situational factors such as the cause of death, play an important role on the willingness to consent to donate. This study can improve the understanding of the donor family's decision making and as such help the physician asking for consent and improve information to the public which may increase the number of cornea donors in Germany.

AB The specific impact of weather factors on psychiatric disorders has been investigated only in few studies with inconsistent results. We hypothesized that meteorological conditions influence the number of cases presenting in a psychiatric emergency room as a measure of mental health conditions. We analyzed the number of patients consulting the emergency room (ER) of a psychiatric hospital in Berlin, Germany, between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2014. A total of N = 22,672 cases were treated in the ER over the study period. Meteorological data were obtained from a publicly available data base. Due to collinearity among the meteorological variables, we performed a principal component (PC) analysis. Association of PCs with the daily number of patients was analyzed with autoregressive integrated moving average model. Delayed effects were investigated using Granger causal modeling. Daily number of patients in the ER was significantly higher in spring and summer compared to fall and winter (p < 0.001). Three PCs explained 76.8% percent of the variance with PC1 loading mostly on temperature, PC2 on cloudiness and low pressure, and PC3 on windiness. PC1 and PC2 showed strong association with number of patients in the emergency room (p < 0.010) indicating higher patient numbers on warmer and on cloudy days. Further, PC1, PC2, and PC3 predicted the number of patients presenting in the emergency room for up to 7 days (p < 0.050). A secondary analysis revealed that the effect of temperature on number of patients was mostly due to lower patient numbers on cold days. Although replication of our findings is required, our results suggest that weather influences the number of psychiatric patients consulting the emergency room. In particular, our data indicate lower patient numbers during very cold temperatures.

AB Context: Human personality is characterized by substantial heritability but few functional gene variants have been identified. Although rodent data suggest that the neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (NOS-I) modifies diverse behaviors including aggression, this has not been translated to human studies.
   Objectives: To investigate the functionality of an NOS1 promoter repeat length variation (NOS1 Ex1f variable number tandem repeat [VNTR]) and to test whether it is associated with phenotypes relevant to impulsivity.
   Design: Molecular biological studies assessed the cellular consequences of NOS1 Ex1f VNTR; association studies were conducted to investigate the impact of this genetic variant on impulsivity; imaging genetics was applied to determine whether the polymorphism is functional on a neurobiological level.
   Setting: Three psychiatric university clinics in Germany.
   Participants: More than 3200 subjects were included in the association study: 1954 controls, 403 patients with personality disorder, 383 patients with adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 151 with familial ADHD, 189 suicide attempters, and 182 criminal offenders.
   Main Outcome Measures: For the association studies, the major outcome criteria were phenotypes relevant to impulsivity, namely, the dimensional phenotype conscientiousness and the categorical phenotypes adult ADHD, aggression, and cluster B personality disorder.
   Results: A novel functional promoter polymorphism in NOS1 was associated with traits related to impulsivity, including hyperactive and aggressive behaviors. Specifically, the short repeat variant was more frequent in adult ADHD, cluster B personality disorder, and autoaggressive and heteroaggressive behavior. This short variant came along with decreased transcriptional activity of the NOS1 exon 1f promoter and alterations in the neuronal transcriptome including RGS4 and GRIN1. On a systems level, it was associated with hypoactivation of the anterior cingulate cortex, which is involved in the processing of emotion and reward in behavioral control.
   Conclusion: These findings implicate deficits in neuronal signaling via nitric oxide in moderation of prefrontal circuits underlying impulsivity-related behavior in humans.

AB Objective: People feeling severely affected by multiple sclerosis (MS) comprise a heterogeneous group, and this heterogeneity leads to very distinct needs and makes planning for needs difficult. To provide optimal care, it is important to identify specific needs in specific subgroups. Our objective was to identify the specific palliative care (PC) needs of patients who felt severely affected by the disease by analyzing their feeling (1) more or (2) less severely affected and their possible differences in expressed care needs.
   Method: A self-report questionnaire with 25 needs categories including 7 categories pertaining to carewas applied to patients who felt severely affected by MS. An additional single question identified patients feeling more (>= 7, median-split) and less (<7) severely affected. Differences were analyzed by chi-squared and Mann-Whitney U tests. The sample (N = 573) was composed of respondents who replied to an invitation by the German Multiple Sclerosis Society to participate in a survey on unmet needs of severely affected patients.
   Results: Of 573 patients (median age 51), 358 (62.48%) felt more severely affected. Compared to patients feeling less severely affected, they found the stress on their next of kin to be higher (p < 0.001), were in greater need of home visitation (p < 0.001), did not have permanent neurologists (p = 0.016), and felt that they visited them too rarely (p < 0.0001). They also needed more emotional support from their nursing care service (p = 0.006).
   Significance of results: A self-rating scale can identify two groups of patients with different care needs. These data may help shaping patient-centered support structures. Palliative care, with its multidisciplinary approach, might be one further option to meet the specific needs of patients and their relatives.

AB A tribute to Italian physiologists of Jewish descent evicted during the persecution ordered by the Fascist Regime in 1938. Adv Physiol Educ 31: 123-128, 2007; doi:10.1152/advan.00059.2006. - The present report commemorates the persecution of five renown Italian physiologists of Jewish descent that lost their chairs in medical schools because of the anti-semitic policies of the fascist regime. In 1938, Mussolini promulgated the Racial Laws, officially with the aim of safeguarding the purity of the Italian race in conquered African colonies. However, their true intent was to persecute the Italian Jewish community in agreement with the policy of Nazi Germany. In accordance with the Racial Laws, all non-Aryans were banished from professional activities and were evicted from public, social, and academic life. As a result, 98 full professors in Italian universities were removed from their academic positions. In medical schools, physiology, more than other discipline, lost the most prominent faculty members. Of the 17 full Professors of Human Physiology, five were of Jewish descent, and all were evicted: they were Camillo Artom from Palermo, Mario Camis from Bologna, Carlo Foa from Milan, Amedeo Herlitzka from Turin, and Ugo Lombroso from Genoa. All were talented and famous scientists who were forced to leave Italy and take refuge in foreign countries. At the end of World War II, Camis, Foa`, Herlitzka, and Lombroso returned to Italy and resumed their previous academic positions, whereas Artom remained in the United States. Unfortunately, Camis died later that year. During the postwar period, some of the fascists responsible for the Jewish persecution were killed or committed suicide while the survivors were imprisoned and prosecuted. However, all were soon released and resumed their former positions.

AB Objective: College entrance may be a strategically well-placed "point of capture" for detecting late adolescents with suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). However, a clear epidemiological picture of STB among incoming college students is lacking. We present the first cross-national data on prevalence as well as socio-demographic and college-related correlates for STB among first-year college students.
   Method: Web-based self-report surveys were obtained from 13,984 first-year students (response rate 45.5%) across 19 colleges in 8 countries (Australia, Belgium, Germany, Mexico, Northern Ireland, South Africa, Spain, and the United States).
   Results: Lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts was 32.7%, 17.5%, and 4.3%, respectively. The 12-month prevalence was 17.2%, 8.8%, and 1.0%, respectively. About three-fourths of STB cases had onset before the age of 16 years (Q3 = 15.8), with persistence figures in the range of 41% to 53%. About one-half (53.4%) of lifetime ideators transitioned to a suicide plan; 22.1% of lifetime planners transitioned to an attempt. Attempts among lifetime ideators without plan were less frequent (3.1%). Significant correlates of lifetime STB were cross-nationally consistent and generally modest in effect size (median adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.7). Nonheterosexual orientation (aOR range 3.3-7.9) and heterosexual orientation with some same-sex attraction (aOR range 1.9-2.3) were the strongest correlates of STB, and of transitioning from ideation to plans and/or attempts (aOR range 1.6-6.1).
   Conclusion: The distribution of STB in first-year students is widespread, and relatively independent of socio-demographic risk profile. Multivariate risk algorithms based on a high number of risk factors are indicated to efficiently link high-risk status with effective preventive interventions.

DT Article
DE gender-specific health reporting; publical medical service; public
   health planning; nursing; health care; prevention
AB Population prognoses predict a far over-proportional increase in the number of male seniors, entailing substantial implications for the planning of health supply and care, as well as various possibilities to intervene preventively by specific risk avoidance or boosting health responsibility. In the future men's health and male-specific health reporting will become eminently important. A gender-specific life table analysis for the years 1998-2002 shows which causes of death are more responsible for loss of life expectancy of men compared to women in both the Bodenseekreis and Baden-Wurttemberg. Baden-Wuttemberg and the Bodenseekreis are regions with a well above-average life expectancy compared to other regions in Germany. The average life expectancy in Baden-Wurttemberg in the year 2000 amounted to 82 years (Bodenseekreis: 82.2) in women, and 76.4 years (Bodenseekreis: 77.3) in men. Among the main causes for the 5.6 year difference in life expectancy are cardiovascular diseases, cancer illnesses, traffic accidents and suicide. These groups of causes of death explain the major part of the difference in average life expectancy. An analysis of death risks specific to age and gender shows some Promising approaches for health promotion and prevention based on identification of critical phases of life. In this case, special attention should be paid to infancy, as examinations made within the scope of enrolment at schools identify considerable differences in the prevalence of various disturbances. However, early adulthood and old age also prove to be important periods concerning men-specific interventions. The presented results show first possible starting points which, however, should above all make a contribution to the establishment of the topic of men's health as a focus on gender-specific health reporting, health promotion and prevention. The described target group for health promotion and prevention is, on the one hand, sufficiently large, on the other hand, sufficiently disadvantaged in terms of health to demand more attention in the future.

TI Health policy for the new government
SO JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
LA Korean
DT Editorial Material
DE Health policy; Government; Presidential election
AB The new presidential administration of the Republic of Korea will be launched in February 2013. We hope that the Government effectively administers national affairs as well as health care affairs under the new paradigm. In this paper, I make three proposals for the new administration. First, the new government must overcome the wave of aging, the low birth rate, and low economic growth rate. The aging society increases health care demands, but the low birth rate and low economic growth rate decrease the capability to financially underwrite these demands. Furthermore, Korea faces the unification issue as the mission of the era. The economic burden of unification would be bigger than that faced by Germany. The government must prepare rapidly with a step-by-step plan for this approaching situation. Second, the new administration must solve the top-priority policy problems that are derived not only from the existing problems of the "garbage can model," but also from priority setting with an overall and systematic view. These top-priority health policy problems are the high suicide rate, over-utilization of doctors' visits and length of hospital stay, and high out-of-pocket health care fees. The extreme phenomenon of high out-of-pocket costs affects a high percentage of households with catastrophic medical costs, which is about 3%, the highest level among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. Third, the policy approach of the new administration must be not unilateral, but bilateral: efficiency and equity of policies, support and regulation of policy tool, demand-side and supply-side management of healthcare utilization, and service benefits and monetary benefits of Health Insurance. In the past, the main approach of healthcare policy has depended on regulation, supply-side control, and service benefits. The administration should pursue a balance of left and right approaches, regardless of which political party wins. I hope that the new govemment will overcome these challenges in a turbulent era, solve top-priority problems first, and approach all of this with a new paradigm as new wine must be poured into new wineskins.

AB Background: Anxiety and depression are the most common psychiatric disorders and are the cause of a large and increasing amount of sick-leave in most developed countries. They are also implicated as an increasing mortality risk in community surveys. In this study we addressed, whether sick leave due to anxiety, depression or comorbid anxiety and depression was associated with increased risk of retirement due to permanent disability and increased mortality in a cohort of German workers.
   Methods: 128,001 German workers with statutory health insurance were followed for a mean of 6.4 years. We examined the associations between 1) depression/anxiety-related sick leave managed on an outpatient basis and 2) anxiety/depression-related psychiatric inpatient treatment, and later permanent disability/mortality using Cox proportional hazard regression models (stratified by sex and disorder) adjusted for age, education and job code classification.
   Results: Outpatient-managed depression/anxiety-related sick leave was significantly associated with higher permanent disability (hazard ratio (95% confidence interval)) 1.48 (1.30, 1.69) for depression, 1.25 (1.07, 1.45) for anxiety, 1.91 (1.56, 2.35) for both). Among outpatients, comorbidly ill men (2.59 (1.97,3.41)) were more likely to retire early than women (1.42 (1.04,1.93)). Retirement rates were higher for depressive and comorbidly ill patients who needed inpatient treatment (depression 3.13 (2,51, 3,92), both 3.54 (2.80, 4.48)). Inpatient-treated depression was also associated with elevated mortality (2.50 (1.80, 3.48)). Anxiety (0.53 (0.38, 0.73)) and female outpatients with depression (0.61 (0.38, 0.97)) had reduced mortality compared to controls.
   Conclusions: Depression/anxiety diagnoses increase the risk of early retirement; comorbidity and severity further increase that risk, depression more strikingly than anxiety. Sickness-absence diagnoses of anxiety/depression identified a population at high risk of retiring early due to ill health, suggesting a target group for the development of interventions.

TI The Diagnosis and Treatment of Bipolar Disorder Recommendations From the
   Current S3 Guideline
SO DEUTSCHES ARZTEBLATT INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
ID COMORBIDITY SURVEY REPLICATION; COLLABORATIVE CARE; PREVALENCE
AB Background: Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness, characterized by frequent recurrences and major comorbidities. Its consequences can include suicide.
   Methods: An S3 guideline for the treatment of bipolar disorder was developed on the basis of a systematic literature search, evaluation of the retrieved publications, and a formal consensus-finding procedure. Several thousand publications were screened, and 611 were included in the analysis, including 145 randomized controlled trials (RCT).
   Results: Bipolar disorder should be diagnosed as early as possible. The most extensive evidence is available for pharmacological monotherapy; there is little evidence for combination therapy, which is nonetheless commonly given. The appropriate treatment may include long-term maintenance treatment, if indicated. The treatment of mania should begin with one of the recommended mood stabilizers or antipsychotic drugs; the number needed to treat (NNT) is 3 to 13 for three weeks of treatment with lithium or atypical antipsychotic drugs. The treatment of bipolar depression should begin with quetiapine (NNT = 5 to 7 for eight weeks of treatment), unless the patient is already under mood-stabilizing treatment that can be optimized. Further options in the treatment of bipolar depression are the recommended mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotic drugs, and antidepressants. For maintenance treatment, lithium should be used preferentially (NNT = 14 for 12 months of treatment and 3 for 24 months of treatment), although other mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotic drugs can be given as well. Psychotherapy (in addition to any pharmacological treatment) is recommended with the main goals of long-term stabilization, prevention of new episodes, and management of suicidality. In view of the current mental health care situation in Germany and the findings of studies from other countries, it is clear that there is a need for prompt access to need-based, complex and multimodal care structures. Patients and their families need to be adequately informed and should participate in psychiatric decision-making.
   Conclusion: Better patient care is needed to improve the course of the disease, resulting in better psychosocial function. There is a need for further high-quality clinical trials on topics relevant to routine clinical practice.

AB Purpose: To quantitatively evaluate and compare intraocular lenses (IOLs) with a round or sharp optic edge design for posterior capsule opacification (PCO).
   Study Design: Prospective comparative observational case series.
   Participants/Materials: Photographs from 174 eyes were analyzed for PCO at the Department of Ophthalmology, Ruprecht-Karls-University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.
   Main Outcome Measures: Part 1: 121 eyes of 121 patients were analyzed for quantification of PCO. IOLs evaluated were Corneal ACR6 (n = 21), Alcon Acrysof (n = 20), Allergan AR40 (n = 27), Pharmacia 811 one-piece polymethyl methacrylate (PM MA) IOL (n = 24), and Pharmacia 911 A silicone IOL (n = 29). Mean follow-up was 14.01 +/- 2.81 months; mean patient age was 73.2 +/- 7.3 years. The morphologic PCO formation was evaluated for the entire optic and in the central 3-mm zone. Part 11: In 53 eyes of 46 patients aged 73.4 +/- 10.8 years with an Alcon Acrysof IOL, PCO formation and capsulorrhexis/optic overlapping were analyzed 34.2 +/- 4 months after cataract surgery using EPCO Software.
   Results: Part 1: The PCO values of the entire optic were for Corneal ACR6, 1.93 +/- 0.62; PMMA, 0.64 +/- 0.63; AR40, 0.55 +/- 0.28; Alcon Acrysof, 0.145 +/- 0.27; and 0.161 +/- 0.181 for the Pharmacia 911A IOL (P < 0.01). The PCO values of the central 3-mm zone were for Corneal ACR6, 1.64 +/- 0.96; PMMA, 0.49 +/- 0.39; AR40, 0.22 +/- 0.32; Alcon Acrysof, 0.08 +/- 0.21; and 0.06 +/- 0.11 for the Pharmacia 911A IOL (P < 0.01). Part II: Average overlapping of capsulorrhexis and Acrysof IOL optic was 40.5% +/- 12.4%. There was a significant correlation between PCO values and overlapping (r = -0.69, P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The sharp-edge IOL types (Alcon Acrysof and Pharmacia 911 A silicone IOL) resulted in statistically significantly lower PCO values for analysis of the entire optic area and central 3-mm zone. There was no statistically significant difference in PCO values between the two sharp-edge optic IOLs. An overlapping of capsulorrhexis rim and the anterior IOL optic surface of more than 20% resulted in significantly lower PCO values with the Acrysof IOL.

AB BackgroundNon-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a clinically significant behavior affecting approximately 18% of adolescents and young adults worldwide. The importance of NSSI is supported by its association with a broad spectrum of mental disorders. Despite its high relevance, evidence-based, specific, time-, and cost-effective treatment approaches are scarce. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) seems effective in reducing the frequency of NSSI in adolescents and young adults. However, young people are often reluctant to seek professional help and effective interventions adressing NSSI are not sufficiently available across all regions of Germany. Research indicates that the majority of youth with risk behavior (including NSSI) prefer technology-based interventions. To date, effective interventions for adolescents and young adults with NSSI that are deliverd online are not available.MethodsThe present project aims to develop and evaluate an online intervention for adolescents and young adults with NSSI based on the content of a recently evaluated face-to-face short-term program that includes elements of CBT and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT): The Cutting Down Programme (CDP). The efficacy of the new online CDP intervention will be tested in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which n=700 youths engaging in repetitive NSSI will participate in either an online psychoeducation (n=350) or online CDP (n=350). Within a postline assessment fourmonths after baseline (end of treatment; T1), and follow-up evaluations 12 and 18months after baseline (follow-ups; T2 and T3), NSSI and comorbid symptoms as well as quality of life will be assessed. It is hypothesized that participants receiving online CDP report a greater reduction in the frequency of NSSI within the last threemonths at T2 (primary endpoint) compared to those receiving online psychoeducation. Exploratory analyses will focus on predictors of treatment outcome.DiscussionWe report on the development and evaluation of an online intervention for adolescents and young adults engaging in NSSI based on the CDP. If supported by empirical evidence, an online-based intervention for NSSI might help to overcome the limited availability of adequate interventions for youth.Trial registrationGerman Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00014623.

AB Background: Mental health problems and risk behaviours among young people are of great public health concern. Consequently, within the VII Framework Programme, the European Commission funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in eleven European countries, with Sweden as the coordinating centre, and was designed to identify an effective way to promote mental health and reduce suicidality and risk taking behaviours among adolescents.
   Objective: To describe the methodological and field procedures in the SEYLE RCT among adolescents, as well as to present the main characteristics of the recruited sample.
   Methods: Analyses were conducted to determine: 1) representativeness of study sites compared to respective national data; 2) response rate of schools and pupils, drop-out rates from baseline to 3 and 12 month follow-up, 3) comparability of samples among the four Intervention Arms; 4) properties of the standard scales employed: Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (Z-SAS), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), World Health Organization Well-Being Scale (WHO-5).
   Results: Participants at baseline comprised 12,395 adolescents (M/F: 5,529/6,799; mean age=14.9 +/- 0.9) from Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain. At the 3 and 12 months follow up, participation rates were 87.3% and 79.4%, respectively. Demographic characteristics of participating sites were found to be reasonably representative of their respective national population. Overall response rate of schools was 67.8%. All scales utilised in the study had good to very good internal reliability, as measured by Cronbach's alpha (BDI-II: 0.864; Z-SAS: 0.805; SDQ: 0.740; WHO-5: 0.799).
   Conclusions: SEYLE achieved its objective of recruiting a large representative sample of adolescents within participating European countries. Analysis of SEYLE data will shed light on the effectiveness of important interventions aimed at improving adolescent mental health and well-being, reducing risk-taking and self-destructive behaviour and preventing suicidality.

ID PERSONALITY-DISORDER
AB Ludwig II of Bavaria (Germany) entered the political stage at the age of 18, following the premature death of his father Maximilian II in 1864. At that time, Ludwig was a very handsome, slender young man; he was enthusiastic and had a pronounced taste for fine arts and music, and was admired by the people as a "fairy tale king". However, already during the first years of his reign, he displayed traits that fulfilled the ICD-10 criteria for schizotypal disorder together with a combined cluster B personality disorder. They became even more pronounced over time. Towards the end of his life, Ludwig developed "imperial madness", a typical pattern of behavioural excesses including craving for power, splendour, construction, unrestrained spending, excessive eating and sexual exploitation, revenge with a tendency for cruelty, and an inclination for theatrical and sometimes irrational acts. This complex syndrome is usually manifested in excessively egocentric rulers who have almost unlimited power or, in the case of Ludwig II, an overwhelming desire to possess it. His imperial madness was possibly contributed to by an orbitofrontal brain syndrome. One conjecture is that this condition reflected a neurodegenerative process; another is that a primary deficit, initiated by brain damage following a severe bout of meningitis during Ludwig's babyhood, played a role. In this case, functional compensation by other brain areas may have eventually been counteracted by chronic substance abuse in his thirties. The monarch's life ended tragically when he was 40 by which time he had become adipose and had lost most of his teeth; meanwhile, he was placed under tutelage, dismissed and detained. Before his death by drowning in Lake Starnberg (suicide? attempted escape??), Ludwig apparently killed his psychiatrist, Bernhard von Gudden, who carelessly served as his sole attendant. Yet Ludwig's image as the beautiful fairy tale king is still alive in the hearts of successive generations of Bavarians and in the fascination demonstrated by the masses of tourists from throughout the world who visit (against his formerly declared wishes) his "dream castles".

AB Background: Although there is evidence that individuals who suffer from severe mental disorders are at higher risk for aggressive behavior, only a minority eventually become violent. In 2017, Fazel et al. developed a risk calculator (Oxford Mental Illness and Violence tool, OxMIV) to identify the risk of violent crime in patients with mental disorders. For the first time, we tested the predictive validity of the OxMIV in the department of psychiatry at the prison hospital in Berlin, Germany, and presented findings from our internal validation.
   Materials and Methods: We designed a cohort study with 474 patients aged 16-65 years old who met the inclusion criteria of schizophrenia-spectrum or bipolar disorder and classified the patients into two groups: a violent group with 191 patients and a nonviolent group with 283 patients. Violence was defined as the aggressive behavior of a patient with the necessity of special observation. We obtained all the required information retrospectively through patient files, applied the OxMIV tool on each subject, and compared the results of both groups. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive values were determined. We used logistic regression including variable selection and internal validation to identify relevant predictors of aggressive behavior in our cohort.
   Results: The OxMIV score was significantly higher in the violent group [median 4.21%; Interquartile range (IQR) 8.51%] compared to the nonviolent group (median 1.77%; IQR 2.01%; p < 0.0001). For the risk of violent behavior, using the 5% cutoff for "increased risk," the sensitivity was 44%, and the specificity was 89%, with a positive predictive value of 72% and a negative predictive value of 70%. Applying logistic regression, four items were statistically significant in predicting violent behavior: previous violent crime (adjusted odds ratio 5.29 [95% CI 3.10-9.05], p < 0.0001), previous drug abuse (1.80 [1.08-3.02], p = 0.025), and previous alcohol abuse (1.89 [1.21-2.95], p = 0.005). The item recent antidepressant treatment (0.28 [0.17-0.47]. p < 0.0001) had a statistically significant risk reduction effect.
   Conclusions: In our opinion, the risk assessment tool OxMIV succeeded in predicting violent behavior in imprisoned psychiatric patients. As a result, it may be applicable for identification of patients with special needs in a prison environment and, thus, improving prison safety.

TI Islam in the West: Perceptions and Self-Perceptions of Muslims in Navid
   Kermani's <i>Kurzmitteilung</i>
SO GERMAN LIFE AND LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB This essay analyses Navid Kermani's literary engagement with the interaction between Islam and the West in his novel Kurzmitteilung (2007). Kermani (b. 1967 in Germany of Iranian parents) is a scholar of Islamic Studies as well as a writer; he critically examines how Islam often serves as an object of Western counter-identification. The essay explores how the novel, which is set after the London suicide bomb attacks on 7 July 2005, treats the perceptions and self-perceptions of Muslims at the beginning of the twenty-first century, focusing on its German-Iranian narrator, the event manager Dariusch. My analysis considers Dariusch's ambiguity: he claims a residual cultural identity as an Iranian Muslim, which he contrasts with the identity of Arabs who plant bombs in the West, yet he is not a practising Muslim; he criticises the Western commercialisation of Islam, thereby making his own reverse division between the hypocritical West and misconstrued Islam, but is complicit with this commercialisation in his professional life. Finally, Dariusch dismisses Islam altogether (he turns to Scientology). More broadly, this essay also critically explores the position of Islam in the West and its contribution to Western cultural and religious identification after '9/11' and '7/7'.
   Dieser Aufsatz untersucht Navid Kermanis literarische Auseinandersetzung mit der Wechselbeziehung zwischen dem Islam und dem Westen in seinem Roman Kurzmitteilung (2007). Kermani (1967 als Sohn iranischer Einwanderer in Deutschland geboren) ist sowohl habilitierter Islamwissenschaftler als auch Schriftsteller; er stellt sich kritisch die Frage, wie sich der Westen haufig im Gegensatz zum Islam identifiziert. Der Aufsatz untersucht, wie sich der Roman, der nach den Londoner Bombenanschlagen des 7. Juli 2005 spielt, mit der Wahrnehmung und Selbstwahrnehmung von Muslimen zu Beginn des 21. Jahrhunderts auseinandersetzt. Der Schwerpunkt liegt auf dem deutsch-iranischen Erzahler, dem Eventmanager Dariusch. Meine Analyse beschaftigt sich mit Dariuschs Ambiguitat: Er beansprucht eine in Resten vorhandene kulturelle Identitat als iranischer Muslim, die er der Identitat von Arabern, die Bomben legen, entgegensetzt, aber er ist kein glaubiger Muslim; er kritisiert die westliche Kommerzialisierung des Islam, wobei er seine eigene umgekehrte Trennung zwischen dem heuchlerischen Westen und dem missdeuteten Islam vornimmt, aber er ist an dieser Kommerzialisierung in seinem Beruf beteiligt. Letztendlich lehnt Dariusch den Islam vollig ab (er wendet sich Scientology zu). Dieser Aufsatz setzt sich im weiteren Sinne ebenfalls kritisch mit der Position des Islam im Westen und seinem Beitrag zur westlichen kulturellen und religiosen Identifizierung nach '9/11' und '7/7' auseinander.

AB To determine the prevalence of domestic violence (DV), sequelae, and the expectancies of support/intervention among female patients receiving medical care within an emergency department (ED), a pertinent inquiry was effected. Method: Cross-sectional Survey, using trained female interviewers to confidentially administer standardised questionnaires to female patients of the ED of a university hospital in Berlin, Germany. There were 1557 female patients, 18 to 60 years of age, receiving medical care in a hospital ED during 7 weeks in the Spring/Summer of 2002. Of that initial population, 411 women were excluded, 340 refused participation, with N = 806 (70%) participating in the study. The Survey instrument included questions on different kinds of abuse, sequelae (physical and mental), demographic characteristics and the patients' expectations of support by health professionals. Results: 57% of the victims of at least one episode of DV in their lifetime after the age of 16 claimed health consequences. According to the percentage of nominations the sequelae were: mental (54%), physical (35%), 32% both, head injuries (60%), haematomas/bruises (44%), and fractures (17%), injuries from stabbings, gunshots, or burns (10%), gastrointestinal disorders (23%), headache/migraine (18%), and heart disease (15%). The most frequently reported psychological symptoms were anxiety (32%), depression (13%) and suicide/self-mutilation attempts (5%). 52% of the victimised women, who reported health consequences, had received medical care in lifetime including: 33% surgery, 24% emergency department, and 10% received clinical treatment. In response to a hypothetical question about a future incidence of DV victimisation posed to all respondents, 67% claimed that they would discuss it with their physicians, and only 8% of respondents indicated that they had ever been asked about DV occurrence during any past consultations with a health care professional. Approximately 80% of all respondents favour a routine inquiry for DV to be included as part of the medical history protocol of the ED. Conclusion: The sequelae resulting from DV victimisations of women receiving medical services, suggests the need for intervention(s) within the health care setting. Health professionals must first acknowledge DV as a possible cause of injuries and other health disorders in female patients. Domestic violence screening of female patients within the health care setting can enhance the quality of care for victims. Women's expectations show the acceptability of such interventions.

TI Day-patient treatment after short inpatient care versus continued
   inpatient treatment in adolescents with anorexia nervosa (ANDI): a
   multicentre, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial
SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article

AB Background In-patient treatment (IP) is the treatment setting of choice for moderately-to-severely ill adolescents with anorexia nervosa, but it is costly, and the risks of relapse and readmissions are high. Day patient treatment (DP) is less expensive and might avoid problems of relapse and readmission by easing the transition from hospital to home. We investigated the safety and efficacy of DP after short inpatient care compared with continued IP.
   Methods For this multicentre, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial, we enrolled female patients (aged 11-18 years) with anorexia nervosa from six centres in Germany. Patients were eligible if they had a body-mass index (BMI) below the tenth percentile and it was their first admission to hospital for anorexia nervosa. We used a computer-generated randomisation sequence to randomly assign patients to continued IP or DP after 3 weeks of inpatient care (1:1; stratified for age and BMI at admission). The treatment programme and treatment intensity in both study groups were identical. The primary outcome was the increase in BMI between the time of admission and a 12-month follow-up adjusted for age and duration of illness (non-inferiority margin of 0.75 kg/m(2)). Analysis was done by modified intention to treat. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register, number ISRCTN67783402, and the Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien, number DRKS00000101.
   Findings Between Feb 2, 2007, to April 27, 2010, we screened 660 patients for eligibility, 172 of whom we randomly allocated to treatment:85 to IP and 87 to DP. DP was non-inferior to IP with respect to the primary outcome, BMI at the 12-month follow-up (mean difference 0.46 kg/m(2) in favour of DP (95% CI, -0.11 to 1.02; p(non-inferiority) < 0.0001). The number of treatment-related serious adverse events was similar in both study groups (eight in the IP group, seven in the DP group). Three serious adverse events in the IP group and two in the DP group were related to suicidal ideation; one patient in the DP attempted suicide 3 months after she was discharged.
   Interpretation DP after short inpatient care in adolescent patients with non-chronic anorexia nervosa seems no less effective than IP for weight restoration and maintenance during the first year after admission. Thus, DP might be a safe and less costly alternative to IP. Our results justify the broad implementation of this approach.

TI A post-mortem study of the cause of death and concomitant diseases of

AB Background. There was a clear increase in the influx of refugees in Germany in 2014 and 2015. The majority of them came from countries without regular access to medical care. There are often precarious hygienic conditions during the flight. An above-average prevalence for infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis and blood-borne viral diseases is described for this group of persons. There are no available data on the causes of death and concomitant diseases in this group. In the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the University of Munich autopsies were carried out on a significant number of refugees for the first time.
   Material and methods. The macromorphological findings during the autopsies and the prosecution files were evaluated. Blood and urine samples were analyzed for alcohol and drugs by chromatography and mass spectrometry. Femoral vein blood samples (whole blood) were analyzed for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The formalin-fixed parenchymatous organs were histologically examined and assessed. The statistical evaluation of the obtained data was carried out using SPSS (version 23).
   Results. A total of 20 deceased refugees were autopsied during the investigation period and the average age was 26 years. The main countries of origin were Syria, Afghanistan and Eritrea. In 14 cases an unnatural death was detected, in 2 a natural death and in 4 cases the cause of death remained unclear. The cases of unnatural death were caused by drowning accidents, suicide, traffic accidents, drug abuse and one homicide and the cases of natural death by pneumonia and heart failure. In three cases an infectious or parasitic accompanying disease was diagnosed (tuberculosis or roundworm disease). In 12 of the deceased there were non-infectious concomitant diseases, 6 of which were psychiatric diseases.
   Conclusion. According to our knowledge for the first time a professional overview of autopsies of refugees, their causes of death and existing concomitant diseases can be given. The indications for a medicolegal autopsy of this group are no different from the general German population. Striking was the low average age of the deceased and the leading cause of death in this small study was drowning of non-swimmers during the summer. None of the autopsied refugees had a contagious disease which could be transmitted to third parties. Despite the young age more than half of the cases were caused by internal diseases, which were the cause of death in two cases. No particular danger for infection existed for the personnel involved in the autopsies of the subjects.

AB The correspondence between Helmi Maelo (1898-1978) and Ulo Koit (1925-1996) is deposited in the Helmi and Bernhard Math) collections at the Estonian Cultural History Archives (EKLA, collection 226, m. 17:15 (Maelo to Koit) and EKLA, collection 226, m 24:11 (Koit to Melo)). Their correspondence began in 1956, meaning practically immediately after contacts became possible between Soviet Estonia and the world abroad after the CPSU 20th Congress, which is surprising since the persons involved were not at all so close to each other to restore contact at the first opportunity.
   Helmi Maelo was a nationalist with conservative views who had been active primarily in the field of journalism in the Republic of Estonia, editing several women's and children's periodicals. She had also started her work in fictional literature. She was active in the temperance movement and supported other idealistic undertakings. She had escaped to Germany with her family in 1944 and from there onward to Sweden. She earned a living in Sweden as an office clerk at a publishing house, directing most of her energy to her own literary activity. Maelo has penned over ten novels, a number of stories for young people, several works of memoirs and numerous brochures on temperance and education. It was at her initiative that Mothers' Day started being observed in Estonia beginning in 1923.
   Ulo Koit, who was born in the Republic of Estonia, was evacuated at the age of 16 with his mother to the rear area in the Soviet Union when the war broke out. There he studied at courses for Party employees and began his career as a KGB agent after the war upon returning to Estonia, and later as a confidant while working at the same time as the editor of the Valgamaalane newspaper (1944-1950). He served as deputy chairman of the Estonian SSR Television and Radio Committee (1950-1975). His dead body was found in September of 1996 in the Lielupe River in Latvia and to this day it is not known if it was an accident, suicide or murder. Their correspondence began when Maelo wrote to Koit's mother, whom she knew from the period of Estonian independence. Since the latter had died during the war, her son answered the letter. The correspondence continued until Helmi Maelo's death and later continued to a lesser extent between Ulo Koit and Bernhard Maelo. They exchanged information about cultural events and their personal lives, but also about politics. The correspondence gave Maelo an overview of life in her occupied homeland. Koit, on the other hand, acquired information about the moods and fears of expatriate circles and helped him gain contacts among expatriate Estonians abroad. This could help readers of the publication to understand those barriers that had arisen between Estonians in the homeland and expatriate Estonians abroad during the post-war decades, to see the different ways that contacts were established but also to see the hidden reefs in this intercommunication.

AB Background Previous trials have shown that pridopidine might reduce motor impairment in patients with Huntington's disease. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether higher doses of pridopidine than previously tested reduce motor symptoms in a dose-dependent manner while maintaining acceptable safety and tolerability.
   Methods PRIDE-HD was a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2, dose-ranging study in adults (aged >= 21 years) with Huntington's disease at outpatient clinics in 53 sites across 12 countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA). Eligible patients had clinical onset after age 18 years, 36 or more cytosine-adenine-guanine repeats in the huntingtin gene, motor symptoms (Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score [UHDRS-TMS] >= 25 points), and reduced independence (UHDRS independence score <= 90%). Patients were randomly assigned (1: 1: 1: 1: 1) with centralised interactive-response technology to receive one of four doses of pridopidine (45, 67.5, 90, or 112.5 mg) or placebo orally twice a day for 52 weeks. Randomisation was stratified within centres by neuroleptic drug use. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in the UHDRS-TMS from baseline to 26 weeks, which was assessed in all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment (full analysis set). Participants and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2013-001888-23) and ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT02006472).
   Findings Between Feb 13, 2014, and July 5, 2016, 408 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=82) or pridopidine 45 mg (n=81), 67.5 mg (n=82), 90 mg (n=81), or 112.5 mg (n=82) twice daily for 26 weeks. The full analysis set included 397 patients (81 in the placebo group, 75 in the 45 mg group, 79 in the 67.5 mg group, 81 in the 90 mg group, and 81 in the 112.5 mg group). Pridopidine did not significantly change the UHDRS-TMS at 26 weeks compared with placebo at any dose. The most frequent adverse events across all groups were diarrhoea, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, falls, headache, insomnia, and anxiety. The most common treatment-related adverse events were insomnia, diarrhoea, nausea, and dizziness. Serious adverse events occurred in the pridopidine groups only and were most frequently falls (n=5), suicide attempt (n= 4), suicidal ideation (n=3), head injury (n=3), and aspiration pneumonia (n=3). No new safety or tolerability concerns emerged in this study. One death in the pridopidine 112.5 mg group due to aspiration pneumonia was considered to be possibly related to the study drug.
   Interpretation Pridopidine did not improve the UHDRS-TMS at week 26 compared with placebo and, thus, the results of secondary or tertiary analyses in previous trials were not replicated. A potentially strong placebo effect needs to be ruled out in future studies.

AB Terrorism and insurgence of varying magnitude at the national and international levels have continued to threaten global peace and kept most governments and communities of the world on toes. Terrorism is the use of violence against a civilian population or non-combatant group to compel government or an international organization to act or abstain from doing an act [1], [2]. The 11th September, 2001 (9/11) simultaneous attacks in US on the World Trade Centre in New York, the Pentagon in Virginia and site at Pennsylvania claiming over 3,996 lives and leaving over 6000 others injured and which brought down to rabbles one of the biggest edifices of our time and stirred the whole world out of complacency is a typical act of terrorism. This singular event more than any previous cases of terrorism has put most nations on red alert while similar affronts to human peace and comfort continue to heighten as they last in other parts of the globe[2]. For more than a decade now, terrorism and insurgence have taken the nations of the world by storm. What started as pockets of disaffection and protests reactions at different parts of the world has assumed unimaginable sophistication and startling dimensions. The bombing and sinking of British Palestine Ship at Haifa killing 267 persons on board and Leaving 172 injured in 1940 and the poisoning of bread for prisoners in Camp Stalag 13, Germany in 1946 where 148 persons died and 124 injured [3], are nothing to compare with the 9/11 attack. The hijacking of planes and detonating of bombs by suicide bombers killing themselves and their unsuspecting victims in aircrafts, trains and train platforms, parks and garages, churches, market places, hotels, night clubs, cinema houses and even hospitals and schools where our young go to learn to improve the quality of humanity is an unparalleled dimension of terrorism[3],[2]. The Beslan school hostage in Russia in September 1-3, 2004 where 385 persons died and 783 were injured; the multiple bombing in London, United Kingdom in 2005 where 65 people died and over 700 were injured; Peshawar School attack in Pakistan in December, 2014 where 170 persons died and un-estimated number injured, and the abduction of 300 school girls in Chibok, Nigeria and taken to unknown destination since 2014 as well as the coordinated attack on Paris and St Denis, France in November 13, 2015, killing 130 persons and leaving hundreds injured is not only a clear indication of extreme radicalization of local affairs but an attempt to annihilate the world. As a matter of fact, peace is eluding many nations of the world including Nigeria [4],[5]. Of a truth, peace is eluding the whole world. Peace is when people are able to resolve conflicts without violence and can work together to improve the quality of their lives; when everyone live in safety, without fear or threat of violence and no form of violence is tolerated[6]. If this definition of peace is true then no nation today is at peace with itself thus making the concern in this study more compelling.

AB Background: Although research conducted within the military has assessed the health and mental health problems of military personnel, little information exists about personnel who seek care outside the military. The purpose of this study is to clarify the personal characteristics, mental health diagnoses, and experiences of active duty U.S. military personnel who sought civilian sector services due to unmet needs for care. Materials and Methods: This prospective, multi-method study included 233 clients, based in the United States, Afghanistan, South Korea, and Germany, who obtained care between 2013 and 2016 from a nationwide network of volunteer civilian practitioners. A hotline organized by faith-based and peace organizations received calls from clients and referred them to the network when the clients described unmet needs for physical or mental health services. Intake and follow-up interviews at 2 wk and 2 mo after intake captured demographic characteristics, mental health diagnoses, and reasons for seeking civilian rather than military care. Non-parametric bootstrap regression analyses identified predictors of psychiatric disorders, suicidality, and absence without leave (AWOL). Qualitative analyses of clients' narratives clarified their experiences and reasons for seeking care. The research protocol has been reviewed and approved annually by the Institutional Review Board at the University of New Mexico. Results: Depression (72%), post-traumatic stress disorder (62%), alcohol use disorder (27%), and panic disorder (25%) were the most common diagnoses. Forty-eight percent of clients reported suicidal ideation. Twenty percent were absence without leave. Combat trauma predicted post-traumatic stress disorder (odds ratio [OR] = 8.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.66, 47.12, p = 0.01) and absence without leave (OR = 3.85, 95% CI 1.14, 12.94, p = 0.03). Non-combat trauma predicted panic disorder (OR = 3.64, 95% CI 1.29, 10.23, p = 0.01). Geographical region was associated with generalized anxiety disorder (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49, 0.99, p = 0.05). Significant predictors were not found for major depression, alcohol use disorder, or suicidal ideation. Clients' narrative themes included fear of reprisal for seeking services, mistrust of command, insufficient and unresponsive services, cost as a barrier to care, deception in recruitment, voluntary enlistment remorse, guilt about actual or potential killing of combatants or non-combatant civilians, preexisting mental health disorders, family and household challenges that contributed to distress, and military sexual trauma. Conclusions: Our work clarified substantial unmet needs for services among active duty military personnel, the limitations of programs based in the military sector, and the potential value of civilian sector services that are not linked to military goals. We and our institutional review board opted against using a control group that would create ethical problems stemming from the denial of needed services. For future research, an evaluative strategy that can assess the impact of civilian services and that reconciles ethical concerns with study design remains a challenge. Due to inherent contradictions in the roles of military professionals, especially the double agency that makes professionals responsible to both clients and the military command, the policy alternative of providing services for military personnel in the civilian sector warrants serious consideration, as do preventive strategies such as non-military alternatives to conflict resolution.

AB Background Although subthalamic stimulation is a recognised treatment for motor complications in Parkinson's disease, reports on behavioural outcomes are controversial, which represents a major challenge when counselling candidates for subthalamic stimulation. We aimed to assess changes in behaviour in patients with Parkinson's disease receiving combined treatment with subthalamic stimulation and medical therapy over a 2-year follow-up period as compared with the behavioural evolution under medical therapy alone.
   Methods We did a parallel, open-label study (EARLYSTIM) at 17 surgical centres in France (n=8) and Germany (n=9). We recruited patients with Parkinson's disease who were disabled by early motor complications. Participants were randomly allocated (1: 1) to either medical therapy alone or bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy. The primary outcome was mean change in quality of life from baseline to 2 years. A secondary analysis was also done to assess behavioural outcomes. We used the Ardouin Scale of Behavior in Parkinson's Disease to assess changes in behaviour between baseline and 2-year follow-up. Apathy was also measured using the Starkstein Apathy Scale, and depression was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory. The secondary analysis was done in all patients recruited. We used a generalised estimating equations (GEE) regression model for individual items and mixed model regression for subscores of the Ardouin scale and the apathy and depression scales. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00354133. The primary analysis has been reported elsewhere; this report presents the secondary analysis only.
   Findings Between July, 2006, and November, 2009, 251 participants were recruited, of whom 127 were allocated medical therapy alone and 124 were assigned bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy. At 2-year follow-up, the levodopa-equivalent dose was reduced by 39% (-363.3 mg/day [SE 41.8]) in individuals allocated bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy and was increased by 21% (245.8 mg/day [40.4]) in those assigned medical therapy alone (p<0.0001). Neuropsychiatric fluctuations decreased with bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy during 2-year follow-up (mean change -0.65 points [SE 0.15]) and did not change with medical therapy alone (-0.02 points [0.15]); the between-group difference in change from baseline was significant (p=0.0028). At 2 years, the Ardouin scale subscore for hyperdopaminergic behavioural disorders had decreased with bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy (mean change -1.26 points [SE 0.35]) and had increased with medical therapy alone (1.12 points [0.35]); the between-group difference was significant (p<0.0001). Mean change from baseline at 2 years in the Ardouin scale subscore for hypodopaminergic behavioural disorders, the Starkstein Apathy Scale score, and the Beck Depression Inventory score did not differ between treatment groups. Antidepressants were stopped in 12 patients assigned bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy versus four patients allocated medical therapy alone. Neuroleptics were started in nine patients assigned medical therapy alone versus one patient allocated bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy. During the 2-year follow-up, two individuals assigned bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy and one patient allocated medical therapy alone died by suicide.
   Interpretation In a large cohort with Parkinson's disease and early motor complications, better overall behavioural outcomes were noted with bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy compared with medical therapy alone. The presence of hyperdopaminergic behaviours and neuropsychiatric fluctuations can be judged additional arguments in favour of subthalamic stimulation if surgery is considered for disabling motor complications.

TI Messages from the "Edge of the World": Aksel Valgma's Letters to Artur

DT Article
AB Aksel Valgma was born in Estonia in 1910 and died in Australia in 1966. In 1933 he became a professional journalist. lie worked for several newspapers in Tallinn and, in addition to this, he published humorous stories and children's books. During the Second World War, Valgma fled to Germany and emigrated from there to Sydney - to the "edge of the world", as he himself called his new domicile. He worked at a felt factory, managed a chicken farm, and was editor of the Australian Estonians' weekly Meie Kodu (Our Home).
   While he was working as a journalist in Tallinn, he became acquainted with Artur Adson (1889-1977), a poet, writer and theatre critic, who fled to Sweden from the Soviet occupation. They never met again, yet for a short while their old acquaintance was renewed through correspondence. Artur Adson and Marie Under's collection at the Estonian Cultural History Archives contains thirteen letters written by Valgma to Adson in the period from 3 February 1964 to 25 May 1966. The addressee on the envelopes is Artur Adson, yet in several letters he turns to Adson and his wife, the poetess Marie Under, with news for both of them. Some of the letters are in aerogram format, whereas others are in ordinary envelopes, as they contained photographs and banknotes, which could not be enclosed in the aerogram. The collection of letters is complete, without gaps in content, so it could be assumed that Adson preserved all of Valgma's letters. The last letter by Valgma is dated three months before he committed suicide. Its content suggests that life goes on and the correspondence continues; there is no indication of its being the last letter, which it actually was.
   When Valgma started correspondence with Adson, twenty years had passed since their last meeting. The letters indicate several reasons for renewing their acquaintance. Valgma was looking for contributions to the newspaper and wished it to come from Europe; he had a strong province complex and considered Australia to be a cultureless country. On the other hand, Valgma was looking for someone to whom he could confess the pain he felt from losing his homeland. The first letters focus on reminiscences, the later ones discuss more topics from the present. Valgma suggests collaboration to Adson, hoping that his articles would enhance the prestige of Meie Kodu among the readership and would have a considerable impact on the editor's unstable self-esteem.
   The topic most often discussed by Valgma and Adson is trends in refugee literature. Adson is disturbed by the depictions of intimate life in the works of younger authors, and in his reply Valgma agrees with him, although this topic is not very important for him. Valgma is worried about the writers' divergence from the refugees who constitute the only target group of exile literature. In Valgma's opinion, the interest of the refugees in Estonian-language literature was approaching the critical line. Valgma thinks that exile literature should refrain from "philosophical sophistry" and use, above all, refugees' everyday life as a source of inspiration. During the years of correspondence, Valgma wrote his novel Elu uksiklinnud (The Solitary Birds of Life, Lund 1966), which precisely follows the requirements for exile literature that he had explained to Adson. As Valgma wrote the novel and letters in parallel, they overlap remarkably in terms of sentiments and their general mood, which in places is rather depressive. The book reviews and obituaries dedicated to the author have emphasised the biographical side of the novel.
   In his fourth letter to Adson, Valgma writes that his mother-in-law, Mrs. Moolmann, who stayed in Estonia during the war, has been granted a permit to settle in Australia. The seventh letter evidences that Adson has asked Mrs. Moolmann, through Valgma, to help him find out about the destiny of his former neighbours. The tenth letter reveals an interesting fact: mediation of news from their homeland developed into a correspondence between Moolmann and Under. Together with Adson's letters addressed to Valgma, Under's letters to Moolmann reached Australia. Valgma enclosed his mother-in-law's answers in the envelopes addressed to Adson, and this is how news from Soviet Estonia moved through Australia to Sweden.
   The sub-section "Selected letters" presents complete texts of three letters which provide an insight into the problems that creative intellectuals focused on in their discussions in the first decades of exile. The letters also refer to the reasons that inhibited Estonian refugees' adaptation to life in Australia.
