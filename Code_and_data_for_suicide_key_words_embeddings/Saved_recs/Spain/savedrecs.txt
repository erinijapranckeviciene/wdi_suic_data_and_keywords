DE Bayes theorem; Epidemiology; Demography; Suicide; Spain
AB Objective: To analyse the epidemiology of suicide, and compare its occurrence between the sexes and in various regions in Spain.
   Method: Age-specific analysis and spatiotemporal analysis to analyse death by suicide between 1981 and 2008 in Spain.
   Study design: Ecological study.
   Results: Death by suicide has decreased since the 1990s in Spain, although peaks in suicides correspond with times of economic crisis. Death by suicide was more common among men than among women, although the suicide mortality rate increased over the study period among women aged 35-49 years. Geographical analysis showed that rural populations and areas with historically higher levels of unemployment have higher suicide rates. In contrast, less-populated regions have lower suicide rates.
   Conclusion: Suicides in Spain exhibit a clear geographic pattern and occur at different rates between the genders. The results suggest an increasing number of suicides among women aged 35-49 years over the study period. (C) 2012 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide became the first cause of death between the ages of 15 and 44 in Spain in the year 2013. Moreover, the suicide rate in Spain went up by more than 9 % with respect to the previous year. This increase could be related to the serious economic recession that Spain has been experiencing in recent years. In this sense, there is a lack of evidence to help assess to what extent these suicides have a social cost in terms of losses in human capital. Firstly, this article examines the relationship between the variables related to the economic cycle and the suicide rates in the 17 Spanish regions. Secondly, an estimate is made of the losses in labour productivity owing to these suicides.
   In this article, panel data models are used to consider different variables related to the economic cycle. Demographic variables and the suicide rates for regions across Spain from 2002 to 2013 also come into play. The present and future production costs owing to premature death from suicide are calculated using a human capital model. These costs are valued from the gross salary that an individual no longer receives in the future at the very moment he or she leaves the labour market.
   The results provide a strong indication that a decrease in economic growth and an increase in unemployment negatively affect suicide rates. Due to suicide, 38,038 potential years of working life were lost in 2013. This has an estimated cost of over 565 million euros.
   The economic crisis endured by Spain in recent years has played a role in the higher suicide rates one can observe from the data in official statistics. From a social perspective, suicide is a public health problem with far-reaching consequences.

DE Suicide; Nineteenth century; Spain; Nosology; Etiology
AB This paper analyzes the medicalization process of suicide in Spain during the 19th century. It describes the transition of suicide seen as an act of free will to a model, developed by mental doctors, which considered it a pathological behavior. Against this model, other conservative positions from the fields of Law and Medicine continued to defend the traditional view.
   The initial interest of mental medicine regarding the social aspects of suicide was developed during this period. The social factor that authors considered to be the most influential to suicide was the loss of religious ideas, which was understandable considering that religion was very present in Spanish science and society throughout the century. During the last decades of the 19th century, with the introduction of the degeneration theory in Spain, this behavior was finally included among the "Social Diseases" group

AB This work shows an analysis of the journalistic treatment of four cases of suicide of international celebrities in digital newspapers of three Spanish-speaking countries: Argentina, Spain and Peru. Two of them, Argentina and Peru, regulate the treatment of suicide through their deontological codes. In Spain, none of the deontological codes applied at the national level do so. The chosen cases have been those of Chester Bennington, Robin Williams, Tony Scott and Alexander McQueen. Our goal was to identify the degree of adequacy of the media to self-regulation norms and to the recommendations of health professionals. We did an analysis of journalistic content, deontological codes and international guidelines prepared by health experts. The results reveal the dysfunction in the informative treatment and the deontological norms regarding the international directives.

AB This study analyses the trends, geographical variations, seasonal patterns and methods of mortality due to the combination of suicide and causes of undetermined intent in Spain between 1991 and 2008.
   Age-adjusted suicide rates were calculated. Poisson models were used to estimate rate ratios and annual percentage changes.
   Suicide rates decreased in all age groups with the exception of the 3544 and 4554 age groups. There were important geographic variations in suicide rates. Spring and summer were the seasons with the highest suicide rates. Suicide rates for hanging decreased, although the rates increased in the 3544 age group of males. A significant upward trend in suicide by jumping was observed for males aged 1554 and for females aged 2564. There were almost no differences when the deaths of undetermined intent were excluded.
   Suicide rates decreased in both males and females, although the downward trend was not observed in males and females aged 3544 or in females in the 4554 age group. A significant upward trend in suicide rates for jumping was observed in some age groups. Substantial geographical variations in suicide rates were observed. The highest rates were observed in the warmest months.

AB In this article we examine the evolution of suicide rates in Spain from 1910 to 2011. As something new, we use standardised suicide rates, making them perfectly comparable geographically and in time, as they no longer reflect population structure. Using historical data from a series of socioeconomic variables for all Spain's provinces and applying new techniques for the statistical analysis of panel data, we are able to confirm many of the hypotheses established by Durkheim at the end of the 19th century, especially those related to fertility and marriage rates, age, sex and the aging index. Our findings, however, contradict Durkheim's approach regarding the impact of urbanisation processes and poverty on suicide.

AB Background: The current financial crisis is having a major impact on European economies, especially that of Spain. Past evidence suggests that adverse macro-economic conditions exacerbate mental illness, but evidence from the current crisis is limited. This study analyses the association between the financial crisis and suicide rates in Spain. Methods: An interrupted time-series analysis of national suicides data between 2005 and 2010 was used to establish whether there has been any deviation in the underlying trend in suicide rates associated with the financial crisis. Segmented regression with a seasonally adjusted quasi-Poisson model was used for the analysis. Stratified analyses were performed to establish whether the effect of the crisis on suicides varied by region, sex and age group. Results: The mean monthly suicide rate in Spain during the study period was 0.61 per 100 000 with an underlying trend of a 0.3% decrease per month. We found an 8.0% increase in the suicide rate above this underlying trend since the financial crisis (95% CI: 1.009-1.156; P = 0.03); this was robust to sensitivity analysis. A control analysis showed no change in deaths from accidental falls associated with the crisis. Stratified analyses suggested that the association between the crisis and suicide rates is greatest in the Mediterranean and Northern areas, in males and amongst those of working age. Conclusions: The financial crisis in Spain has been associated with a relative increase in suicides. Males and those of working age may be at particular risk of suicide associated with the crisis and may benefit from targeted interventions.

AB Introduction: The aim of the present work is to determine the association between unemployment and suicide, and to investigate whether this association is affected by changes in the economic cycle or other variables such as age and sex.
   Methods: A time-trend analysis was conducted to study changes in the number of suicides between 1999 and 2013 in Spain. Pearson's correlation coefficients and regression models were used to find the association between unemployment and suicide.
   Results: A significant positive association was found between unemployment and suicide in the pre-crisis period in men. In that period (1999-2007), each 1% annual increase in unemployment was associated with a 6.90% increase in the annual variation of suicide in the total population, and with a 9.04% increase in the annual variation of suicide in working age men.
   Conclusions: The correlation between unemployment and suicide is significant in periods of economic stability, but has weakened during the recent financial crisis. Unemployment and suicide have a complex relationship modulated by age, sex and economic cycle. (C) 2017 SEP y SEPB. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Suicide is a public health problem and it is increasing in Spain. The objective of this study is to analyze the prevalence and risk factors of suicide related outcomes (ideation, plan and attempt) using data from the ESEMeD-Spain project. SUBJECTS AND
   METHOD: This is a face-to-face household survey carried out in a probability representative sample of the adult general population of Spain. 5,473 subjects were interviewed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0), developed by the World Mental Health Survey Initiative.
   RESULTS: Lifetime prevalence of suicide ideation and attempts was 4.4% and 1.5%, respectively. Risk of suicide related outcomes was significantly higher among women (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3-2.7), younger cohorts (OR = 21.3-86), and lower education levels (OR = 5.3-6.4). Having a mental disorder was associated to an increased risk in all diagnostic categories, but especially in major depressive episode (OR = 5.3-6.8). Risk of suicide attempt was higher during the first year since the onset of ideation (OR = 30.2), decreasing thereafter.
   CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of suicide related outcomes is low when compared with other countries. Results identified groups with higher risk (women, young, subjects with a mental disorder, psychiatric comorbidity and recent suicidal ideation) in which suicide prevention could show benefits.

AB Introduction: Suicide is an important public health problem, it represents one of the major causes of unnatural death, and there are many factors that affect the risk of suicidal behaviour. The present study analyzes the temporal and spatial variations of mortality by suicide in Spain and its relationship with gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.
   Material and methods: A retrospective study was performed, in which deaths by suicide, sex and age group in 50 Spanish provinces between 2000 and 2012 were analyzed. The annual trend of suicide mortality was assessed using Kendall's tau-b correlation coefficient. Seasonality and monthly and weekly behaviour were evaluated by performing the ANOVA test and the Bonferroni adjustment. Finally, the relationship between GDP per capita and suicide was studied.
   Results: Between 2000 and 2012, 42,905 adult people died by suicide in Spain. The annual average incidence rate was 95 suicides per million population. The regions located in the south and in the northwest of the country registered the highest per capita mortality rates. There is a decreasing trend in mortality by suicide over the period studied (CC = -.744; P = .0004) in adults over the age of 64, and a seasonal behaviour was identified with summer maximum and autumn minimum values (f = .504; P < .0001). The regions with the highest GDP per capita showed the lowest mortality by suicide (r = -.645; P < .0001) and the relationship is stronger among older age groups.
   Conclusions: Mortality by suicide does not follow a homogenous geographical distribution in Spain. Mortality in men was higher than in women. Over the period of study, there has been a decrease in mortality by suicide in Spain in adults over the age of 64. The seasonal cycle of suicides and the inverse relationship with GDP per capita found in this study, provide information which may be used as a tool for developing prevention and intervention strategies.

AB Suicide is a serious public health problem around the world. Since the nineteenth century, the impact of socio-environmental factors on suicide has attracted much public attention, especially in the context of global climate change. We have performed a retrospective correlation study that analyzes the demographic pattern of suicide in Cantabria, a northern coastland region of Spain. Moreover, we have created a multivariable binomial regression model to study the relationship between suicide and environmental factors (atmospheric pollutants and meteorological variables) among January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2013 in the province. During the 14-year study period, there was a suicide annual incidence of 4.9 cases per 100,000 population in Cantabria. The incidence was highest in adults aged 70-74 years old (11.8 per 100,000 population). The most common method group of suicide was hanging, strangulation and suffocation, accounting for 49.3% of all suicide deaths. When correlating suicide and meteorological variables, a statistically significant association was found with the level of cloudiness (p = 0.007). According to our results, an increase of one eighth of sky cloud-cover correlated to a 7% increase in total deaths by suicide and the association was especially strong during spring.

AB The aim of this study is to assess the knowledge, attitudes and experiences of Spanish nurses in relation to euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. In an online questionnaire completed by 390 nurses from Andalusia, 59.1% adequately identified a euthanasia situation and 64.1% a situation involving physician-assisted suicide. Around 69% were aware that both practices were illegal in Spain, while 21.4% had received requests for euthanasia and a further 7.8% for assisted suicide. A total of 22.6% believed that cases of euthanasia had occurred in Spain and 11.4% believed the same for assisted suicide. There was greater support (70%) for legalisation of euthanasia than for assisted suicide (65%), combined with a greater predisposition towards carrying out euthanasia (54%), if it were to be legalised, than participating in assisted suicide (47.3%). Nurses in Andalusia should be offered more education about issues pertaining to the end of life, and extensive research into this area should be undertaken.

AB Evidence from previous recessions suggests that at times of economic deterioration, suicides increase. Spain has been one of the European countries hardest hit by the financial crisis that started in 2008. The aim of this paper is to examine the impact of the double-dip recession in Spain on the most recent trends in suicide.
   Suicide data from the years 2002-2012 were obtained from the 'Death Statistic according to Cause of Death' of the National Statistics Institute (NSI). Population figures were obtained from the population estimates of the NSI.
   While the suicide rate decreased between 2002 and 2012, the downward trend has reversed twice, in 2008-2009, and in 2012. This rise was particularly pronounced in males, with the rate ratio of 1.12 (95 % CI 1.05-1.20) in 2008 and 1.10 (95 % CI 1.03-1.18) in 2009. Following a decrease in 2010 and 2011, suicides among males have increased again in 2012-with RR of 1.10 (95 % CI 1.03-1.18) compared to 2007, however the difference between 2011 amounted to 14 % rise-the biggest interannual change in a decade. There was a similar but less pronounced pattern in females. Regional data showed variable results.
   These results suggest that the Spanish economic crisis has been associated with suicide rates in 2008, 2009, and 2012. These findings are consistent with the double-dip recession that Spain experienced.

In doing so, we estimate count panel data models considering gender differences taking into account before and during economic crisis periods. A range of aggregate socioeconomic regional-level factors have been considered. Our empirical results show that: (1) a socioeconomic urban-rural suicide differentials exist, (2) there exists a Mediterranean suicide pattern; and (3) unemployment levels have a marked importance during the crisis period. The results of this study may have usefulness for suicide prevention in Spain.

AB Background: The hypothetical relationship between economic recession and the increase in suicides in Spain is subject to various arguments. In addition to the inherent complexity of capturing and explaining the underlining mechanisms that could describe this causal link, different points of contention have been be identified. The period of this association and its possible starting points, the socioeconomic determinants that may explain the variation in suicide rate, and the data sources available are the main focus of controversy. The present study aims to identify the phases of association between different periods of economic recession and suicide rates, and compare the effect of different social determinants of health that have been mentioned in previous studies.
   Methods: We have used interrupted time series analyses to assess the impact of economic recession on national rates of suicide mortality provided by the Spanish Statistical Office (1980-2014). In an attempt to consider the factors that have affected the study of suicide in Spain, different data sources/periods, predictors, and regions in Spain were analysed.
   Results: The analysis revealed a positive and significant relationship between the Great Recession and suicide rates during the second period of economic recession (2011-2014), while appeared to decrease during the first recession period. However, the first decreasing trend was not statistically significant in the global analysis of the evolution of monthly suicide rates for the entire country. Both unemployment and per capita GDP were positively related to suicide trends. Finally, the regional analysis demonstrates a similar pattern in different Spanish areas.
   Conclusion: Although previous studies have mentioned the double-dip in the suicide rate associated with the corresponding period of double recession, our study only identify a positive relationship during the second recession period. These results points out that the major impact of economic problems might have had a delayed effect due to initial protection policies.

AB Introduction: Studies have pointed to rurality as an important factor influencing suicide. Research so far suggests that several sociodemograpic and psychiatric factors might influence urban-rural differences in suicide. Also, their contribution appears to depend on sex and age. Unfortunately, studies including a comprehensive set of explanatory variables altogether are still scare and most studies have failed to present their analyses split by sex and age groups. Also, urban-rural differences in suicide in Spain have been rarely investigated. The present study aimed at explaining rural-urban differences in suicidality in the province of Castellon (Spain). A comprehensive set of sociodemographic and psychiatric factors was investigated and analyses were split by sex and age.
   Material and method: The sample comprised all suicides recorded in the province of Castellon from January 2009 to December 2015 (n = 343). Sociodemographic data included sex, age, and suicide method. Psychiatric data included the history of mental health service utilization, psychiatric diagnosis, suicide attempts, and psychiatric hospitalization.
   Results: Consistent with past research, suicide rates were highest in rural areas, especially in men and older people. We also found that urban-rural differences in sociodemographic and psychiatric variables were sensitive to sex and age. Our results indicated that specialized mental health service use and accessibility to suicide means might help understand urban-rural differences in suicide, especially in men. When exploring urban-rural differences as a function of age, general practitioner visits for psychiatric reasons were more frequent in the older age group in rural areas.
   Conclusions: Study implications for suicide prevention strategies in Spain are discussed. (C) 2017 SEP y SEPB. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

AB This article focuses on the analysis of the informative treatment that the Spanish newspapers El Pais, ABC, El Mundo and La Razon gave to the consummate suicide, more precisely to the triggering factors, from the 1st of January to the 31st of December of 2017. Applying a methodology of content analysis, the results show that the analyzed journals pose the subject of suicide consummated as the solution to a problem and also include details such as the mechanism used and the suicide note. It could say that some cases are sensationalists. The information reflects the actual suicide data, but moves away from WHO's indications to treat the issue from a more comprehensive and less newsworthy perspective.

ID MENTAL-HEALTH; DEPRESSION; PREVALENCE; DISORDER; AGE
AB A relevant proportion of deaths by suicide have been attributed to other causes that produce the number of suicides remains hidden. The existence of a hidden number of cases is explained by the nature of the problem. Problems like this involve violence, and produce fear and social shame in victims' families. The existence of violence, fear and social shame experienced by victims favours a considerable number of suicides, identified as accidents or natural deaths. This paper proposes a short time discrete compartmental mathematical model to measure the suicidal risk for the case of Spain. The compartment model classifies and quantifies the amount of the Spanish population within the age intervals (16, 78) by their degree of suicide risk and their changes over time. Intercompartmental transits are due to the combination of quantitative and qualitative factors. Results are computed and simulations are performed to analyze the sensitivity of the model under uncertain coefficients.

DE Suicide; Epidemiology; Prevention
ID ATTEMPTED-SUICIDE; PARASUICIDE
AB Background and objectives: To be able to prevent suicides, The exact magnitude of suicides must be known in order to prevent them. There is evidence that data provided on the number of suicides by the Spanish Statistical Office (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica [INE]) differs from that identified by forensic pathologists. This paper aims to determine whether the INE data are to the same as those recorded by the agencies responsible for conducting autopsies in Spain (IML), and calculate the number of missing cases.
   Method: IML were requested to provide the number of suicides in a five year period (2006-2010) and this was compared with those offered by INE in its site. A new rate of suicides per 100,000 was obtained and used to calculate the number of suicides in Spain.
   Results: For every year of the studied period, the number of suicides reported by the INE was lower than that obtained directly from the IML. Using the highest annual suicide rate registered by province and the total, a count was obtained of identified suicides that for some reason had not been recorded in the INE or the IML data. Based on these figures, the mean rate of suicides per 100,000 was 0.97 (SD 0.10) higher than official INE data, which indicates a mean loss of 443.86 (SD 46.72) cases reported each year. Possible factors that may influence the missing recorded cases are discussed.
   Conclusions: According to the results, there is a discrepancy between INE and IML about the number of suicides in Spain. Neither of the two sources can be considered more reliable than the other (C) 2013 SEP y SEPB. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB In this study we analyzed the socioeconomic differences in mortality from suicide in the economically active male population aged 25-64 years in Spain and France in 1980-1982 and 1988-1990; in the case of Spain the data came from the Eight Provinces Study (Regidor, Gutierrez-Fisac, & Rodriguez, 1995). Individuals were grouped into four categories: professional/managerial, clerical/sales/ service, agricultural, and manual workers. For 1980-1982, among those aged 2544, professionals and managers had the lowest risk of mortality in Spain, and clerical/sales/service workers in France. These socioeconomic differences in mortality increased in 1988-1990. In 1980-1982, among those aged 45-64, clerical/ sales/service workers had the lowest risk of mortality from suicide relative to the other occupational groups in both countries, but this difference was not maintained in 1988-1990. Thus, differences in suicide mortality for men by occupational status depended in the present study upon both the nation studied and the time period chosen for study.

AB Introduction. Suicide in Spain has increased in both genders and in different age groups.
   It is important to evaluate the tendencies of this phenomenon. This study describes suicide mortality in a limited and homogeneous population, which offers the possibility of collecting detailed data over a long time period (1936-2000).
   Methods. Suicide cases were extracted from data in regional archives and from autopsy reports in the Olot court registry office. The suicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants was calculated by analyzing the number of suicides and inhabitants in 5-year groups.
   Results. Suicide occurred more frequently in males and in the over 65-year old population. The suicide rate fluctuated during the period studied. Among males, the peak was 14.92 during 1961-1965 and lowered to 8.68 in 1996-2000. The suicide rate in females was always lower than for men, except during 1946-1950 (7.71 vs. 3.09) and 1976-80 (5.7 vs. 4.9). The most common methods used were hanging (52%) and shooting (18%). There was no difference in the methods among females.
   Conclusions. The demographic and methodological data reflect those obtained in similar studies. In the last 10 years of the study, Olot citizens did not have a higher risk of suicide than the population of the rest of Spain. This result should be interpreted considering the limits related to the methodology used in the data collection.

DE Suicide; Mortality; Trends; Regression analisys; Spain
ID GREAT RECESSION; RISK-FACTORS; STATISTICS; RATES; USA
AB Background: The aim of this study was to know the suicide mortality rates in Navarra and Spain and to compare their time trends during the period 2000-2015.
   Methods: Suicide data were obtained front the Institution Nacional de Estadistica [INE], Spain's National Statistics Institute. During all the period, the coding of came of death in Navarra was carried out using data from forensic autopsies, while in some Spanish regions this process started after 2010. A Joinpoint time series regression model was used to assess the time trend and estimate the annual percent change [APC] of the rates by sex and 4 age groups.
   Results. Suicide mortality in Spain showed a significant downward trend in the overall rate between 2000-2011 [APC of -1.93% in males and -2.19% in females] followed by a significant increase in 2012-2015 [APC: 3.65% in men and 7.60% in women]. No inflection points were observed in men aged 25-44 [APC: I.26%], 45-64 [APC: 1.63%], and women over 65 years [APC:-2.18%]. In Navarra, global rates in men showed a non significant decrease [APC:-1.56%] and a significant decrease in the group of men between 25-44 years [APC:-3.19%]. Among women we observed a non significant increase [APC: 0.74%].
   Conclusions. The rise in overall suicide rates observed in Spain sauce 2011, that was not observed in Navarre, could be influenced by the improvements in coding methods in several Spanish regions. However, this could not explain the decrease observed during the all period in men aged 25-44, that was even larger in Navarra.

AB Background The factors most strongly associated with suicide are age and gender-more men than women, and, more people over 65 kill themselves. As a number of Governments have targets to reduce suicide levels we compare elderly suicide rates over a 20-year period in England and Wales. And the major Western countries focusing upon age and gender.
   Method WHO mortality data were used to calculate three-year average General Population Suicide Rates (GPSR) for 1979-1981 to 1997-1999 and rates of people aged 65-74 and 75+ suicide by gender to provide ratios of change and a statistical comparison of England and Wales and the Major Western countries over the period.
   Results Male GSPR: '65-74' suicide ratios fell significantly in six countries and in three for the '75+'. Female GSPR: '65-74' suicide ratios fell in every country except Spain. Proportionately, there were more suicides in the over 65s in countries with an 'extended family' tradition, Spain, Italy, Germany, France and Japan, than in the five 'secular' countries. England and Wales male '65-74' suicide fell significantly more than Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Netherlands and the USA, and did significantly better than the other countries for all female senior citizen suicides.
   Conclusion Suicide of the over-65s has improved in seven countries, especially in England and Wales, who had the greatest proportional reduction, which reflects well upon the psycho-geriatric and community services. However, in all countries, male 65-74 rates did not match the female out so extra efforts are needed to improve male rates. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Discrepant results have been published by studies comparing deaths by suicide with attempted suicides. This study aimed to determine factors associated with suicides and attempted suicides in Andalusia (Spain) between 2007 and 2013, comparing sex, age, year, and suicide method between these populations. A retrospective study was conducted of data on deaths by suicide and attempted suicides over a seven-year period, calculating the sex and age rates for each behavior. Adjusted Poisson regression was used to analyze the association with study variables, and incidence rate ratios were estimated. During the seven-year study period, 20,254 attempted suicides and 5202 deaths by suicide were recorded. The prevalence of attempted suicide did not differ between the sexes, whereas the prevalence of deaths by suicide was three-fold higher among males than among females and increased with higher age. The most frequently used method was the same in males and females for suicide attempts, but differed between the sexes for suicides. The combined influence of sex and age was greater in the model for death by suicide than in the model for attempted suicide. The key differentiating factor was the method used, while the finding of greatest concern was the suicide behavior among the elderly. Preventive strategies should take these differences into account.

AB Background: The incidence of hospital-treated attempted suicide has not been well established in Spain. Aims: To determine the incidence of suicide attempters presenting to a hospital in Oviedo, Spain, to describe the nature of the suicidal behavior, and to identify sociodemographic subgroups of the population with high rates. Methods: All admitted to the Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, during the period 1 May 2008 to 30 April 2009 were examined and those meeting the internationally-recognized case definition were identified. Results: A total of 308 suicide attempt presentations (39% male, 61% female) were made by 279 individuals. Almost 90% of the suicide attempts involved a drug overdose. The age-adjusted total, male, and female attempted suicide rates were 83, 66, and 99 per 100,000, respectively. The highest rate was among 35-44-year-olds for men and women (141.1 and 191.8 per 100,000, respectively). Incidence rates varied widely by sociodemographic characteristics with especially high rates among separated/divorced men (2.4%) and women (1.1%). Conclusions: The reported incidence of hospital-treated attempted suicide is below average in the European context but higher than that reported by previous Spanish studies. Persons separated or divorced constitute a high-risk group.

AB According to the WHO and the European Union, suicide is considered to be a health problem of prime importance and to be one of the principal causes of unnatural death. In Spain, the number of suicides has increased 12% since 2005 (INE). The Research Project "European Regions Enforcing Actions against Suicide (EUREGENAS), funded by the Health Program 2008-2013, has as main objective the description of an integrated model of Mental Health orientated to the prevention of suicide. The differences that allow distinguishing the meaning of prevention in suicide behavior are described and explained through a qualitative methodological strategy and through the creation of discussion groups formed by different groups of health professionals. The results highlight the existing differences between the diverse health professionals who come more in contact with this problem and it shows as well the coincidence of meaning that suicide has to be considered as a priority in the field of health.

AB Objective: Society has changed during the last 100 years of evolution; however, some problems, such as suicide, remain. The objective here is to carry out a long-term epidemiological study in Spain, and to calculate the social and labor costs of 2016. Method: Epidemiological data were obtained from official data obtained between 1906 - 2016. The calculation of the costs of suicides included the social costs and the costs of production losses (labor costs). The latter were obtained by the human capital method, taking into account the unemployment rate. The economic growth rate stood at 2.6% per year. Results: The suicide rate was between 4 and 8% per year. The evolution during these 100 years had three periods. Until 1940 it had slight increases, and then it decreased until 1980 and, subsequently, the rate increased until it reached almost 8% in 2016. The costs of the suicides were 2,167 million euro of economic losses for society, or its equivalent of 607 euro for suicide. Conclusions: Public health policies aimed at the prevention of suicide should be increased, and supported by the economic costs they mean for society.

AB Introduction: Approximately 3500 people commit suicide every year in Spain. The main aim of this study is to explore if a spatial and temporal clustering of suicide exists in the region of Antequera (Malaga, Espana).
   Methods: Sample and procedure. All suicides from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2008 were identified using data from the Forensic Pathology Department of the Institute of Legal Medicine, Malaga (Espana).
   Geolocalisation. Google Earth was used to calculate the coordinates for each suicide decedent's address.
   Statistical analysis. A spatiotemporal permutation scan statistic and the Ripley's K function were used to explore spatiotemporal clustering. Pearson's chi-squared was used to determine whether there were differences between suicides inside and outside the spatiotemporal clusters.
   Results: A total of 120 individuals committed suicide within the region of Antequera, of which 96 (80%) were included in our analyses. Statistically significant evidence for seven spatiotemporal suicide clusters emerged within critical limits for the 0-2.5 km distance and for the first and second semanas (p < 0.05 in both cases) after suicide. There was not a single subject diagnosed with a current psychotic disorder, among suicides within clusters, whereas outside clusters, 20% had this diagnosis (chi(2) = 4.13; df = 1; p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: There are spatiotemporal suicide clusters in the area surrounding Antequera. Patients diagnosed with current psychotic disorder are less likely to be influenced by the factors explaining suicide clustering. (C) 2013 SEP y SEPB. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

TI Economic crisis and suicidal behaviour: the role of unemployment, sex

AB Introduction: Although suicide rates have increased in some European countries in relation to the current economic crisis and austerity policies, that trend has not been observed in Spain. This study examines the impact of the economic crisis on suicide attempts, the previously neglected endpoint of the suicidal process, and its relation to unemployment, age and sex.
   Methods: The study was carried out in Andalusia, the most populated region of Spain, and which has a high level of unemployment. Information on suicide attempts attended by emergency services was extracted from the Health Emergencies Public Enterprise Information System (SIEPES). Suicide attempts occurring between 2003 and 2012 were included, in order to cover five years prior to the crisis (2003-2007) and five years after its onset (2008-2012). Information was retrieved from 24,380 cases (11,494 men and 12,886 women) on sex, age, address, and type of attention provided. Age-adjusted suicide attempt rates were calculated. Excess numbers of attempts from 2008 to 2012 were estimated for each sex using historical trends of the five previous years, through time regression models using negative binomial regression analysis. To assess the association between unemployment and suicide attempts rates, linear regression models with fixed effects were performed.
   Results: A sharp increase in suicide attempt rates in Andalusia was detected after the onset of the crisis, both in men and in women. Adults aged 35 to 54 years were the most affected in both sexes. Suicide attempt rates were associated with unemployment rates in men, accounting for almost half of the cases during the five initial years of the crisis. Women were also affected during the recession period but this association could not be specifically attributed to unemployment.
   Conclusions: This study enhances our understanding of the potential effects of the economic crisis on the rapidly increasing suicide attempt rates in women and men, and the association of unemployment with growing suicidal behaviour in men. Research on the suicide effects of the economic crisis may need to take into account earlier stages of the suicidal process, and that this effect may differ by age and sex.

DE Stefan Zweig; Reception; Censorship; Franquism; Suicide
AB This article analyses the reception of Stefan Zweig's work in Spain during Franco's regime, a period of severe intellectual and cultural censorship. Such control was also influenced by the diplomatic relationship between the Spanish government, which was partly germanophile, and the German National Socialist state. In the midst of the Second World War, Stefan Zweig's suicide in exile shocked the world and was widely reported by the international press. This paper will argue that this act, which was against the dominant ideology of the Spanish regime, may have influenced the publication of the work of the author in Spain. To that end, a study has been conducted both of Zweig's work published between 1939 and 1947, as well as of the reaction of the Spanish press to his suicide.

AB In this text two different points of view of suicide are exposed. On the one hand, from the science of suicidology, suicide is a cause of death that can be prevented by appropriate actions, as well as with a greater knowledge of it. Because of this, the WHO has created suicide prevention (SUPRE), but despite this, suicide remains the leading cause of death in Spain. On the other hand, we will examine another point of view in which philosophers like Schopenhauer defend suicide as a fundamental right of the person, who would have total freedom and autonomy to decide about his own life and decide when to die.

AB The objective of this study was to test whether suicide attempters and suicide gesturers can be clinically differentiated. A total of 150 subjects who had attempted suicide at least once, had made a suicide gesture, had suicidal ideation, and/or had engaged in non-suicidal self-injury were recruited from the inpatient service of the Jimenez Diaz Foundation (Madrid, Spain). A multinomial regression analysis was conducted. Histrionic and antisocial personality disorders were risk factors specific to suicide gestures. Narcissistic personality disorder was specifically associated with suicide attempts. Borderline personality disorder was associated with both suicide gestures and attempts. A high level of impulsiveness was a risk factor specific to suicide attempts. Conclusion: Suicide attempters and suicide gesturers are two distinct, although partially overlapping, populations.

AB Background: Suicidality risk-factors between countries with similar economic and religious background have been rarely compared, especially within genders.
   Methods: Lifetime prevalence of suicide ideation, plans, and attempts in the ESEMeD surveys were stratified on four separate groups: French women, Spanish women, French men, and Spanish men. Outcome odds-ratios (OR) were modelled within each group using logistic regression including demographic characteristics, lifetime mood/anxiety disorders, parental bonding, marital status, and health service-use.
   Results: Lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts was 3.4% in France (1.1% men, 5.4% women) and 1.5% in Spain (1.2% men, 1.7% women), with a significantly greater gender difference in France (p = 0.001). Regarding risk-factors, French women reported suicide attempt more commonly with authoritarian mothers (OR = 1.51; 95%CI = 1.04-2.18), unlike Spanish women (OR = 0.77; 95%CI = 0.51-1.15) (p<0.001). Spanish men showed more than eight-times higher odds of suicide attempt with overprotecting mothers than French men (p = 0.03). General practitioner(GP)-use was significantly protective of suicide attempt among Spanish women (OR = 0.08; 95%CI = 0.02-0.35) with no effect in French women (OR = 1.03; 95%CI = 0.54-2.00) (p = 0.01). No significant differences in the effect of marital status, any lifetime antidepressant use, mental disorders, or religiosity on suicide attempt were observed between France and Spain within gender-stratum.
   Limitations: Parental bonding is retrospective and potentially influenced by mental state. Response rate was considerably lower in France than in Spain.
   Conclusions: Suicidality risk-factors play different roles across genders between France and Spain. Parental bonding dimensions may be interpreted differently according to country, underlining cultural importance. As recommended by WHO, mental health decisions must involve GPs in conjunction with psychiatrists or psychologists. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper compares people who committed suicide with people who made some (mild or severe) attempt, identifying factors associated with each group. This study uses two samples in which sociodemographic and clinical variables of people dying by suicide in Navarre ( 2010-2013, n = 180) and people attending psychiatry emergencies for an attempted suicide (January-October 2015, n = 207) were collected. The results show that a non-violent method of suicide, not being retired, and the absence of previous suicide attempts are associated with those who perform mild attempts. Being a male, the absence of previous attendances in psychiatry emergencies and being born in Spain are associated with those who have committed suicide. It is concluded that the differences between the deceased and suicide attempts underline the need for differentiated approaches in preventing the recurrence of suicidal behavior.

AB Background One of the greatest effects of the financial crisis in Spain has been the enormous increase in the number of evictions. Several studies have shown the association of evictions with different aspects of the physical and mental health. Furthermore, evictions have been associated with an increased risk of suicide. Our objective was to evaluate the risk of suicide among victims of eviction and investigate whether it is associated with specific characteristics of households and interviewees, the eviction process and social support, and health needs. Methods A total of 205 participants from households threatened with eviction in Granada, Spain, and 673 being the total number of members of these households, were interviewed in one-on-one sessions between April 2013 and May 2014. Through a questionnaire, information was obtained on physical and mental health, characteristics of their eviction process and support networks, and the use of health services. Results Almost half of the sample (46.7%) were at low (11.8%), moderate (16.9%), or high suicide risk (17.9%). Household and interviewee features had a limited association with suicide risk. On the contrary, the risk of suicide is greater with a longer exposure to the eviction process. In addition, threatening phone calls from banks increased significantly the risk of suicide, especially among men. Suicide risk was also associated with low social support, especially among women. Interviewees at risk of suicide received more help from nongovernmental organizations than those who were not at risk. In interviewees at risk, the main unmet needs were emotional and psychological help, especially in men. A high percentage of those at risk of suicide declare having large unmeet health needs. Finally, there was a tendency among the evicted at risk of suicide to visit emergency room and primary care more often than those not at risk, especially among women. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that when banks adopt a threatening attitude, suicide risk increases among the evicted. As hypothesized, when the evicted felt socially supported, suicide risk decreased. Emotional help was the main mediator of suicide risk and the main unmet need, especially among men.

AB Suicide is the third leading cause of death in the age group between 15 to 29 years, surpassed only by external causes of death and tumors according to the National Institute of Statistics. The latest data available shows that 310 children and young people under 30 took their own lives, which represents 7.77% of all suicide victims. This article aims to extensively describe the state of the art from the data available in the literature, based on the overview worldwide. The causes that can lead to such acts are discussed, indicating the presence of psychological disorders, specific personality variables, the high burden of emotional stress or bullying, lately displaced by new variants such as cyberbullying or sexting.

AB Introduction: Monitoring and preventing suicidal behaviour requires, among other data, knowing suicide deaths precisely. They often appear under-reported or misclassified in the official mortality statistics. The aim of this study is to analyse the under-reporting found in the suicide mortality statistics of Tarragona (a province of Catalonia, Spain).
   Method and materials: The analysis takes into account all suicide deaths that occurred in the Tarragona Area of the Catalan Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences (TA-CILMFS) between 2004 and 2012. The sources of information were the death data files of the Catalan Mortality Register, as well as the Autopsies Files of the TA-CILMFS. Suicide rates and socio-demographic profiles were statistically compared between the suicide initially reported and the final one.
   Results: The mean percentage of non-reported cases in the period was 16.2%, with a minimum percentage of 2.2% in 2005 and a maximum of 26.8% in 2009. The crude mortality rate by suicide rose from 6.6 to 7.9 per 100,000 inhabitants once forensic data were incorporated. Small differences were detected between the socio-demographic profile of the suicide initially reported and the final one. Supplementary information was obtained on the suicide method, which revealed a significant increase in poisoning and suicides involving trains.
   Conclusions: An exhaustive review of suicide deaths data from forensic sources has led to an improvement in the under-reported statistical information. It also improves the knowledge of the method of suicide and personal characteristics. (C) 2018 SEP y SEPB. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

DT Article
ID LANGUAGE USE; MENNINGER MOTIVES; WORD USE; GENUINE; POEMS
AB Background and Objectives: Text analysis software like "Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count" (LIWC) has been used for the analysis of suicide notes and suicidal texts in English. This is the first analysis of suicide notes using this method in Spanish and, as far as we know, its first application to suicide notes in Europe.
   To compare the sociodemographic and forensic characteristics of a consecutive sample of suicide victims studying the differences between those who left suicidal note and those who did not. To study a sample of suicidal notes from Spain using LIWC, comparing it's linguistic features by gender, age and environment.
   Methods: 144 consecutive suicide cases were analyzed. 23 suicide notes obtained from this sample were processed using LIWC, the results were compared by gender, age and environment of the author.
   Results: People who left suicide notes were younger than non- writers; more frequently single, divorced or widowed and emotional troubles were reported as frequent triggers. Suicide notes written by women were significantly longer, had more emotional content, tentative expressions, denials, pronouns in first person plural and verbs in past and future tenses. Urban cases showed higher emotional expression and word complexity whereas rural cases showed a higher use of social words.
   Conclusions: Our study shows some differences between people who left suicide note and those who didn't and confirms the LIWC ability to detect differences in suicidal speech by gender and by the rural/ urban background of its authors.

AB Introduction: Suicide is the first cause of non-natural death in Spain. According to the WHO, a better coverage of suicide by media can become an effective strategy for its prevention. Objective: This study analyses whether WHO recommendations for the coverage of suicide in media has influenced the mediatic treatment of suicide in the ABC newspaper. Methodology: Analysis of news about suicides published in the years 1995, 2000 and 2005. Results: 90 appearances about suicides were identified, observing a significant reduction in the percentage of news that informed about the method used, which informed about suicide as something unexplainable or simplistic and that described the suicide as method to face problems between 1995 and 2005. Conclusions: The informative coverage of Abc suicide has improved between 1995 and 2005 but not in all aspects recommended by the WHO.

AB The relationship between economic fluctuations and mortality is assessed with data from Spain during the years 1980-1997, when national unemployment oscillated between 7% and 24%. Mortality rates of the Spanish provinces are modeled in fixed-effect panel regressions as functions of the demographic structure and the economic conditions. Unemployment effects on general mortality, sex-specific mortality, and mortality for major causes of death are negative, i.e., death rates increase procyclically when joblessness diminishes in an economic expansion. Homicides and female suicides are only weakly related or unrelated to economic fluctuations, but male suicides escalate countercyclically during economic downturns.

AB Studies conducted worldwide indicate that near-lethal suicide attempts are common among incarcerated populations. However, little research attention has been focused on the Spanish prison population. To address this gap in the literature, data were drawn from a sample of men (N = 2,270) incarcerated in seven prisons in Spain. We compared sociodemographic, criminal/offense, health and mental health, and life events in prison variables between inmates who reported making near-lethal suicide attempts (n = 616) and those who did not (n = 1,654) during their current incarceration term. A series of binary and multiple logistic regression analyses indicated that a variety of variables were associated (p values < .001) with near-lethal suicide attempts, including prior-to-prison employment status, family members in prison, recidivist in prison, childhood trauma, work status in prison, and disciplinary infractions. Our study findings are discussed in light of developing more effective strategies and prevention interventions to reduce attempted suicide in the Spanish Prison System.

AB Background The suicide rate is a macro indicator of the population's psychosocial wellbeing and an evaluation criterion of the effectiveness of suicide prevention strategies. A high level of injury deaths of undetermined intent (UD) is usually discussed in connection with the validity of suicide statistics. An effort is made to develop a criterion to characterise the quality of suicide statistics.
   Methods Standardised rates of suicides (X60-X84) and UD (Y10-Y34) by the International Classification of Disease version 10 as an average for the past five available years were taken from the WHO European mortality database. Rate ratios were computed by dividing rates of UD by suicide rates.
   Results There is considerable variation in suicide and UD rates among countries. The highest overall rates of UD were registered in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and the lowest in Greece, Spain and Italy. The EU-15 average UD rate of 1.97 and the rate ratio of 0.194 UD to suicides were combined into a '2-20 benchmark', in which the primary indicator is 2.0 UD cases per 100 000 and the secondary indicator is the proportion of UD to suicides 0.20 (20%), which enables countries to be clustered according to the quality of suicide statistics. The following countries satisfied the benchmark: Greece, Norway, Spain, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Austria, Italy, Romania, Hungary, Ireland and Finland.
   Conclusion This study used the developed '2-20 benchmark' in Europe to assess suicide registration quality in a particular country, to compare the relative position of countries, and to set a target for those European countries that have not yet achieved the benchmark.

AB Background: An increase in suicide mortality is often observed in economic recessions. The objective of this study was to analyse trends in socioeconomic inequalities in suicide mortality before and during the economic recession in two geographical settings in Spain.
   Methods: This study analyses inequalities in mortality according to educational level during 3 different time periods based on individual data from the Basque Country and Barcelona city. We analysed suicide mortality data for all residents over 25 years of age from 2001 to 2012. Two periods before the crisis (2001-2004 and 2005-2008) and another during the crisis (2009-2012) were studied. We performed independent analyses for sex, age group, and for the two geographical settings. We fit Poisson regression models to study the relationship between educational level and mortality, and calculated the relative index of inequality (RII) and the slope index of inequality (SII) as comparative measures.
   Results: For men in the Basque Country, all RII values for the three time periods were similar and almost all were greater than 2; in Barcelona the RII values were generally lower. The SII values for Barcelona tended to decrease over time, whereas in the Basque Country they showed a U-shaped pattern. Among women aged 25-44 years we found an association between educational level and suicide mortality during the first time period; however, we found no clear association for other age groups or time periods.
   Conclusion: This study within two geographical settings in Spain shows that trends in inequalities in suicide mortality according to educational level remained stable among men before and during the economic recession.

AB Background: There are an estimated one million completed suicides per year worldwide. As a response to increasing concern about suicide within Europe, the EUROSAVE (European Review of Suicide and Violence Epidemiology) study was undertaken to examine recent trends in the epidemiology of suicide and self-inflicted injury mortality in the European Union (EU). Methods: Suicide and self-inflicted injury mortality data for the 15 EU countries for the years,1984-1998 were obtained from the World Health Organisation (WHO), the European Statistical Office of the European Commission (EUROSTAT) and national statistical agencies. Data were also obtained for a second group of deaths classified as 'undetermined' or 'other violence'. Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated and examined for trends over time. Results: Finland had the highest suicide rate, while Greece had the lowest for the latest available year (1997). Age-standardized suicide rates tended to be lowest in the Mediterranean countries. Significant downward linear time trends in suicide,mortality were observed in most countries, although rates varied markedly between countries. Both Ireland and Spain displayed significant upward linear trends in suicide mortality. Portugal had the highest rate of undetermined deaths-both in 1984 and 1998 while Greece had the lowest in both 1984 and 1997. Five countries (including Ireland and Spain) showed significant downward trends in deaths due to undetermined causes whereas Belgium and Germany showed borderline significant upward linear trends in deaths due to undetermined causes. Conclusions: Although suicide rates in most countries seem to be decreasing, the validity of the data is uncertain. Misclassification may contribute to the geographical and temporal variation in suicide rates in some EU countries but it does not explain the phenomenon. More detailed research comparing suicide-recording procedures and practices across the EU is required. In the absence of adequate EU wide data on suicide epidemiology, effective prevention of this distressing phenomenon is likely to remain elusive.

AB Objective: To establish typologies within Madrid's citizens (Spain) with regard to end-of-life by cluster analysis.
   Method: The SPAD 8 programme was implemented in a sample from a health care centre in the autonomous region of Madrid (Spain). A multiple correspondence analysis technique was used, followed by a cluster analysis to create a dendrogram. A cross-sectional study was made beforehand with the results of the questionnaire.
   Results: Five clusters stand out. Cluster 1: a group who preferred not to answer numerous questions (5%). Cluster 2: in favour of receiving palliative care and euthanasia (40%). Cluster 3: would oppose assisted suicide and would not ask for spiritual assistance (15%). Cluster 4: would like to receive palliative care and assisted suicide (16%). Cluster 5: would oppose assisted suicide and would ask for spiritual assistance (24%).
   Conclusions: The following four clusters stood out. Clusters 2 and 4 would like to receive palliative care, euthanasia (2) and assisted suicide (4). Clusters 4 and 5 regularly practiced their faith and their family members did not receive palliative care. Clusters 3 and 5 would be opposed to euthanasia and assisted suicide in particular. Clusters 2, 4 and 5 had not completed an advance directive document (2, 4 and 5). Clusters 2 and 3 seldom practiced their faith. This study could be taken into consideration to improve the quality of end-of-life care choices. (C) 2017 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

AB Rates, methods and some of the risk factors of suicide seem to depend on geographical and cultural differences, which involve conducting research in specific high-risk areas facing the implementation of preventive strategies. This study seeks to determine the risk and protective factors of suicide in the region of Antequera-Malaga (Spain). Is performed on a case-control study using the psychological autopsy of 40 cases of suicide and 80 population controls matched on gender, age and area of residence. The multivariate model found is composed of the following factors: the antecedents of suicide and mental disorders aggregate in families, a diagnosis of personality disorder and family conflict in the month prior to suicide. These factors discriminate risk populations facing the implementation of preventive programs.

AB Introduction: While previous research already exists on the impact of the current economic crisis and whether it leads to an increase in mortality by suicide, our objective in this paper is to determine if the increase in the suicide rate in Catalonia, Spain from 2010 onwards has been statistically significant and whether it is associated with rising unemployment.
   Methods: We used hierarchical mixed models, separately considering the crude death rate of suicides for municipalities with more than and less than 10,000 inhabitants as dependent variables both unstratified and stratified according to gender and/or age group.
   Results: In municipalities with 10,000 or more inhabitants there was an increase in the relative risk of suicide from 2009 onwards. This increase was only statistically significant for working-aged women (16-64 years). In municipalities with less than 10,000 inhabitants the relative risk showed a decreasing trend even after 2009. In no case did we find the unemployment rate to be associated (statistically significant) with the suicide rate.
   Conclusions: The increase in the suicide rate from 2010 in Catalonia was not statistically significant as a whole, with the exception of working-aged women (16-64 years) living in municipalities with 10,000 or more inhabitants. We have not found this increase to be associated with rising unemployment in any of the cases. Future research into the effects of economic recessions on suicide mortality should take into account inequalities by age, sex and size of municipalities.

AB Introduction: Suicide is an important Public Health problem. One of the most relevant known risk factors for suicide is suffering from a mental health disorder, identified in up to 90-95% of completed suicides, with this risk being increased if comorbidity is present. Findings from international research on the most common psychiatric disorders are dichotomous, divided into mood disorders and psychotic disorders. In Spain, data of this kind are scarce.
   Methods: This study describes the psychiatric and forensic characteristics of completed suicide cases (n = 79) occurred in a psychiatric hospital healthcare area (in Spain), between 2007 and 2010. The forensic data were obtained from the Institute of Legal Medicine of Catalonia and the clinical data by reviewing the clinical records.
   Results: Most of the subjects in this sample were males (78.5%, 95% CI; 68.4-87.3%). Almost half of the sample (45.4%, 95% CI; 33.8-57.1%, 35/77) had records in the Mental Health Services Network (including substance misuse services). Two of the 79 were under 18, so we were not able to access the records. More than half (54.3%, 95% CI; 37.1-71.4%) of those with psychiatric history suffered from a mood disorder; 37.1% (95% CI; 22.9-51.4% from a depressive disorder; 14.3% (95% CI; 2.9-25.7%) from a bipolar disorder, and 17.1% (95% CI; 5.7-31.4%) suffered from a psychotic disorder. With regard to substance misuse, 42.9% (95% CI; 25.7-60.0%) presented substance misuse, and 48.6% did not.
   Conclusions: Psychiatric and forensic characteristics of completed suicide in this Spanish sample confirm previous findings from international studies: there is a high rate of psychiatric disorders in those who complete suicide, and there is a specific pattern as regards the method used to complete it.

TI Endogamy and suicide: An observation-based hypothesis
SO MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
LA English
DT Article

AB Suicide is a complex and multifactorial behavior, which is likely the result of distinct pathways in different individuals or groups. Endogamy has been associated with numerous diseases, including behavioral disorders. Here, we discuss the hypothesis of endogamy as one mechanism facilitating high rates of suicide in some small and isolated groups of people across the world. To support our hypothesis, we describe four geographically and culturally distinct populations (the Aguarunas of Peru, the Vaqueiros of Spain, the Baruyas of New Guinea, and the Palawans of the Philippines), which present the following characteristics: (1) a high level of isolation and endogamy; (2) very high rates of suicide restricted to one group with (3) adjacent groups of similar origin and culture displaying low rates of suicide. Within these four distinct populations, endogamy could act in one isolated group as the amplifier of both selected genetic risk alleles and microcultural values (e.g. suicide as an acceptable solution), beyond cultural and genetic traits shared by the whole population (and therefore found in all groups). Genetic and microcultural risk factors are transmitted through close kinship and imitation/modeling, and could interact to increase the frequency of vulnerable individuals leading, in turn, to heightened rates of suicide. Culture could sometimes additionally act by generating stressful conditions for some individuals (e.g. lower social status and maltreatment). In contrast to endogamy, suicide motives (notably interpersonal conflicts) and mental disorders appear to be universal risk factors. More investigation of this endogamy hypothesis is necessary, which could represent a singular case of gene-culture co-transmission and shed light on particular conditions of suicide genesis.

AB PurposeIn global forensic practice, some suicides were misclassified as undetermined deaths, leading to suicide underreporting. In this study, we aimed to explore the influence of undetermined deaths on suicides in Shanghai, China.MethodsThe police records on suicide verdicts and undetermined deaths in Pudong, Shanghai, from 2004 to 2016 were used. In this study, undetermined deaths have been classified into three levels of suicide possibilities namely, probable, possible, and highly unlikely. Probable suicides were presumed as misclassified suicides. Poisson regression was used to calculate the rate ratio (RR) of probable suicides compared to suicide verdicts. Poisson regression was also used to calculate the annual percentage change (APC) of the original suicide rates (crude suicide rates based on the suicide verdicts) and adjusted suicide rates (crude suicide rates based on the suicide verdicts and probable suicides).ResultsAmong the 1,318 underdetermine deaths, 560 (42.5%) were classified as probable suicides. The overall RR was 0.23 (95% CI 0.21-0.26): 0.15 (0.13-0.17) for the locals' RR and 0.22 (0.19-0.26) for the migrants' RR. The APCs of the original and adjusted suicide rates were -2.0 (-3.1 to -0.9) and -2.9 (-3.8 to -2.0), respectively, for the overall population.ConclusionsThe number of suicides could be 23% higher than the reported cases. Suicides were more likely to be underreported in migrants than in the locals. Thus, it is important to improve suicide monitoring and the surveillance systems in China.

AB Objectives. To define different subgroups of suicide attempters according to age at onset of suicide attempts. Methods. Participants were 229 suicide attempters (147 females; 82 males) admitted to a general hospital in Madrid, Spain. We used admixture analysis to determine the best-fitting model for the age at onset of suicide attempts separated by sex. Results. The best fitted model for the age at onset of suicide attempts was a mixture of two gaussian distributions. Females showed an earlier age at onset of suicide attempts in both Gaussian distributions (mean perpendicular to S.D.) (26.98 perpendicular to 5.69 and 47.98 perpendicular to 14.13) than males (32.77 perpendicular to 8.11 and 61.31 perpendicular to 14.61). Early-onset female attempters were more likely to show borderline personality disorder than late-onset female attempters (OR = 11.11; 95% CI = 2.43-50.0). Conclusions. Age at onset of suicide attempts characterizes different subpopulations of suicide attempters.

AB An association between divorce and suicide risk has been noted in numerous studies, but the gender profile of this risk has not been clearly established. This article reviews the evidence on gender differentials in suicide risk following the breakdown of an intimate relationship (including divorce and separation). Nineteen published articles that included individual-level data were identified. Twelve reported a greater risk of suicide in men following relationship breakdown, two indicated a greater risk in women, and a further five showed no clear gender differential. Although there are possible indications of increased risk for men, no definitive conclusion about gender differential can be drawn. Furthermore, research is required that directly compares men with women for suicide risk following relationship breakdown.

DE sensism; sixth sense; sensibility; exaltation; cosmic grief; seduction;
   logos; suicide
AB The character Voyleano has models in the suicide Werther, by Goethe, and in the death-desiring Tediato in the Lugubrious Nights, by Cadalso. The creation of the figure of Voyleano depends on the new sensibility of the Enlightenment, romantic cosmic grief, and the exaltation of romantic psychology. In the novel by Vayo the Napoleonic invasion of Spain is depicted, and this atmosphere lends itself to libertine seductions, betrayals, great disillusionments, and the loss of faith. Voyleano, like don Quijote, like Julien Sorel, like Emma Bovary, and like several characters from Larra and Mesonero Romanos has sought a model or logos in an earlier character. After don Quijote Voyleano is the first of all of them. Voyleano considers the physical act of suicide lacking in nobility and cowardly, and although he is inspired by Werther, he is attracted to Tediato's way of committing suicide while avoiding the physical act of suicide.

AB Background: Suicide prevention can be improved by knowing which variables physicians take into account when considering hospitalization or discharge of patients who have attempted suicide. Aims: To test whether suicide risk is an adequate explanatory variable for predicting admission to a psychiatric unit after a suicide attempt. Methods: Analyses of 840 clinical records of patients who had attempted suicide (66.3% women) at four public general hospitals in Madrid (Spain). Results: 180 (21.4%) patients were admitted to psychiatric units. Logistic regression analyses showed that explanatory variables predicting admission were: male gender; previous psychiatric hospitalization; psychiatric disorder; not having a substance-related disorder; use of a lethal method; delay until discovery of more than one hour; previous attempts; suicidal ideation; high suicidal planning; and lack of verbalization of adequate criticism of the attempt. Conclusions: Suicide risk appears to be an adequate explanatory variable for predicting the decision to admit a patient to a psychiatric ward after a suicide attempt, although the introduction of other variables improves the model. These results provide additional information regarding factors involved in everyday medical practice in emergency settings.

AB The objective of this article is to analyze therelationship between suffering from stressful life events (SLE) and subsequent suicidal behavior among women in a homeless situation, examining the differences in the number and characteristics of SI E experienced by attempters and nonattempters. The study was carried out based on the data obtained from a sample of women living homeless in Madrid (Spain; n = 138). The information was gathered using a structured interview. The results show that 46% of these women living homeless in Madrid had attempted suicide, and 32% of them had done so for the first time when they were homeless. We observed a high level of SLE among the women in a homeless situation, with a substantial increase in the number and severity of the stressors suffered by the interviewees who had attempted suicide, both during their childhood and adolescence and in their later lives.
   Public Policy Relevance Statement
   This study reveals that suicide attempts among women living homeless in Madrid reaches alarming dimensions. Data obtained can be useful for policymakers' design programs for the prevention of suicide in this group. It would be important for designing protocols for the early assessment of suicidal behavior for their implementation in both assistance services and by street outreach teams.

AB The article describes a study carried out with a representative sample of homeless people in Madrid (Spain; N=188). This study aims to corroborate the relationship identified in the literature between stressful life events and suicidal behaviour in a group in a situation of social exclusion, to assess the differences in the number and characteristics of stressful life events experienced by homeless people who are attempters and non-attempters, and to identify which combination of stressful life events enables discrimination for suicide attempts among homeless people. The results show that 30% of homeless people in Madrid had attempted suicide, and 57.9% of them had done so for the first time when they were homeless. The interviewees are shown to have experienced a large amount of stressful life events, with substantially more stressors experienced by the homeless people who tried to commit suicide, during both their childhood and adolescence and throughout their life. Finally, we found that the combination of 7 stressful life events provided the best possible discrimination between homeless attempters and non-attempters.

AB Background: Research has shown that suicide is a highly present phenomenon among the drug dependent population. Moreover, individuals with substance use disorder (SUD) present high psychopathological comorbidity. This study aimed to describe which clinical syndromes are linked to the presence of risk of suicide. Methods: The study was based on a consecutive non-probabilistic convenience sample of 196 patients who attended the Public Addiction Center in Girona (Spain). Sociodemographic data, as well as suicide risk and drug related characteristics, were recorded. The risk of suicide was assessed with the Spanish version of "risk of suicide". Complicated grief was assessed with the Spanish version of the Inventory of Complicated Grief. Clinical syndromes were measured with the Spanish version of MCMI-III. Results: The syndromes most frequently associated with the presence of risk of suicide were complicated grief, major depression and thought disorder. Conclusions: Different psychopathological syndromes were identified in relation to risk of suicide among patients with SUD. The present results highlight the importance of accurately diagnosing those individuals.

AB Background: Little is known about whether the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts has changed in the wake of the economic crisis. The aim of this study was to estimate current prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts in the general population in Spain, to compare it with the prevalence found before the economic crisis, and to analyse the factors associated with suicidality in different age groups.
   Methods: A total of 4583 non-institutionalised adults were interviewed in a cross-sectional household survey of a nationally representative sample in Spain. Several modules of an adapted version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview were administered to the participants, and logistic regression models were employed in each age group.
   Results: Lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts in Spain were respectively, 3.67% and 1.46%. Mental disorders presented the highest significant effects on lifetime suicidal ideation. Marital status, heavy alcohol consumption, and occupational status were associated with lifetime suicidal ideation in people aged 18-49, whereas loneliness was associated with the 50-64 group, and financial problems with the 65+ group. A younger age, poor health status and the presence of depression were all associated with lifetime suicide attempts.
   Limitations: The cross-sectional design of the study represents a methodological limitation.
   Conclusions: The current prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts in Spain is similar to the one found ten years ago, before the recent economic crisis. The factors associated with suicidality vary among age groups. Suicide prevention programmes should focus on early detection and prevention for depression and anxiety disorders.

AB Objective To learn the evolution of antidepressant and lithium use in Castilla y Leon (Central Spain) and its relationship with suicide rates.
   Methods A search in the ECOM (Especialidades Consumo de Medicamentos) database of the Spanish Ministry of Health for antidepressants and lithium was carried out for the period 1992-2005. Defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day were obtained as consumption data. Population and suicide rates data come from the Spanish National Statistics Institute.
   Results Antidepressant consumption increased 7-fold, from 6.9 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day in 1992 to 47.3 in 2005; the corresponding increase in cost was more than 10-fold. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) comprised 77% of the total consumption. Venlafaxine consumption multiplied by 2.2. The consumption of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) decreased after venlafaxine and mirtazapine were marketed. Lithium consumption increased by 76% during the period studied, but it plateaued in 2000.
   Conclusions The consumption of antidepressants in Castilla y Leon has increased remarkably and the pattern has changed; there is an increase in the consumption of the new and more expensive antidepressants such as venlafaxine and escitalopram. No association was observed between suicide rates and antidepressant consumption. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI A pilot study on differences in aggression in New York City and Madrid,
   Spain, and their possible impact on suicidal behavior
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID IMPULSIVITY; HUMANS; INTENT
AB Objective: Published results from a U.S. study of depressed suicide attempters and a Madrid, Spain, study including all consecutively admitted suicide attempters suggested that aggression scores were higher in U.S. attempters. This observation led us to compare depressed attempters and controls from both suicide research centers and explore whether New York City (NYC) patients carry out suicidal acts of greater lethality than patients in Madrid. The study goals were (1) to compare aggression scores in attempters and healthy volunteers between the 2 cities and (2) to determine whether higher aggression scores are associated with greater medical lethality of suicide attempts.
   Method: The respective samples from NYC and Madrid included attempters with a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder (N = 117 and N = 133) and healthy controls (N = 90 and N = 317). Aggression scores, measured by the Brown-Goodwin Scale, in attempters and healthy volunteers from both sites were compared using an analysis of variance model. The relationship between lethality of suicidal acts and aggression scores in attempters was assessed using logistic regression analyses. NYC subjects were recruited from 1998 to 2001, and Madrid subjects were selected from consecutive admissions in 1999.
   Results: Depressed suicide attempters from NYC made attempts of greater lethality and reported more lifetime aggressive behavior than depressed attempters in Madrid. NYC healthy volunteers also reported more aggression than their Madrid counterparts.
   Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that the greater lethality of suicidal behavior in NYC compared to Madrid is related to higher aggression levels, although the data have limitations. Cross-cultural studies are needed to verify whether aggression and higher lethality suicide attempts share a common diathesis explaining the higher suicide rates in NYC.

AB Objectives: To determine the rate of attempted suicide in the health care area of Salnes, Spain, attended by the assigned emergency medical service (EMS) provider and to analyze epidemiologic variables.
   Methods: Retrospective study of all suicide attempts attended by the EMS over a 5-year period. Data analyzed were day and time emergency care was given, age of the patient, sex, history of psychiatric disease, alcoholism, drug abuse, and history of attempted suicide.
   Results: A total of 285 attempts were on record (annual incidence, 76.1/100 000 population). The mean (SD) age was 35 (15) years and 58.9% were women. A history of psychiatric disease was present in 74.4% of the patients, and 46.7% had attempted suicide before. This history was more common in patients in the age range of 18-65 years. Women attempted suicide more often than men. A history of multiple drug abuse and alcoholism was more common in the men who attempted suicide than in the women. Fewer attempts occurred in February and on Wednesdays. [Emergencias 2012;24:121-125]

AB Background: Research has shown that suicide is a phenomenon highly present among the drug dependent population. Different studies have demonstrated an upraised level of comorbidity between personality disorders (PD) and substance use disorders (SUD). This study aimed to describe which PDs are more frequent among those patients with a risk of suicide. Methods: The study was based on a consecutive non-probabilistic convenience sample of 196 bereaved patients attended to in a Public Addiction Center in Girona (Spain). Sociodemographic data, as well as suicide and drug related characteristics were recorded. The risk of suicide was assessed with the Spanish version of "Risk of suicide". Personality disorders were measured with the Spanish version of Millon Multiaxial Clinical Inventory. Results: The PDs more associated with the presence of risk of suicide were depressive, avoidant, schizotypal and borderline disorders. However, the histrionic, narcissistic and compulsive PDs are inversely associated with risk of suicide even though the narcissistic scale had no statistical correlation. Conclusions: The risk of suicide is a significant factor to take into account related to patients with SUD and especially with the presence of specific PDs. These findings underline the importance of diagnosing and treating rigorously patients with SUD.

AB The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with hospital admission after suicide spectrum behaviors. Patients' characteristics, the nature of the suicidal behavior, admission rates between centers, and factors associated with admission have been examined in suicide spectrum presentations to emergency departments in 3 Spanish cities. The intent of the suicidal behavior had the greatest impact on hospitalization. Older age, living alone, self-harm method not involving drug overdose, previous history of suicide spectrum behaviors, and psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia, mood, or personality disorder were independently associated with being admitted. There was a 3-fold between-center difference in the rate of hospitalization. Widespread differences in the rate of hospitalization were primarily accounted for by characteristics of the individual patients and their suicidal behavior.

AB Suicide is a serious global public health problem in both developed and developing countries. The results of the research reviewed here reveal that, in Europe, one person dies by suicide every nine minutes, and that in Spain it is currently the leading external cause of death after road traffic accidents. This review presents the latest findings on effective suicide prevention strategies in the general population as well as the most appropriate instruments for assessing the level of risk for suicidal behavior in a clinical population. The treatments that scientific literature reports to be most effective in the fight against suicide are also included. The most significant results in terms of both prevention and treatment are discussed and several limitations to this study are also raised, which may be considered for future work by practitioners and researchers interested in this field.

AB Objectives: To analyze the trend in suicide mortality in Andalusia from 1975 to 2012 and its relationship with unemployment and the use of antidepressants.
   Methods: Poisson's segmented regression models were used to estimate changes over time. The association between suicide and the factors examined was measured using Spearman's correlation coefficient.
   Results: Suicide mortality patterns in men and women are rising. The largest increase was found in people aged from 15 to 44 years, with an annual percentage rate change of 1.21 (95%CI: 0.7-1.7) for men and 0.93 (95%CI: 0.4-1.4) for women.
   Conclusions: Mortality by suicide has increased in Andalusia since 1975 in all age and gender groups except for women aged 65 years or above. During the last few decades, an upward trend has been observed in young people and a stable or falling trend in the remaining population. Temporary variations in suicide rates are not associated with unemployment rates or with changes in antidepressant prescription. (C) 2013 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.

   Methods: Data collected by the Social Research Centre in Study 2,803 "care for patients who are terminally ill" in 2009 were analysed. Descriptive analysis and comparisons with McNemar test were carried out.
   Results: Spanish populationclearly supports the practice of euthanasia for the terminally ill. Agreement is lower in the case of physician assisted suicide and degenerative diseases.
   Conclusions: The Belgian model matches the approach favoured by Spanish public opinion closest. This represents a starting point for the social, political and legal debate needed to regulate individuals' rights at the end of life.

AB Background: In spite of the high prevalence of suicide behaviours and the magnitude of the resultant burden, little is known about why individuals reattempt. We aim to investigate the relationships between clinical risk factors and the repetition of suicidal attempts.
   Methods: 1349 suicide attempters were consecutively recruited in the Emergency Room (ER) of two academic hospitals in France and Spain. Patients were extensively assessed and demographic and clinical data obtained. Data mining was used to determine the minimal number of variables that blinded the rest in relation to the number of suicide attempts. Using this set, a probabilistic graph ranking relationships with the target variable was constructed.
   Results: The most common diagnoses among suicide attempters were affective disorders, followed by anxiety disorders. Risk of frequent suicide attempt was highest among middle-aged subjects, and diminished progressively with advancing age of onset at first attempt. Anxiety disorders significantly increased the risk of presenting frequent suicide attempts. Pathway analysis also indicated that frequent suicide attempts were linked to greater odds for alcohol and substance abuse disorders and more intensive treatment.
   Conclusions: Novel statistical methods found several clinical features that were associated with a history of frequent suicide attempts. The identified pathways may promote new hypothesis-driven studies of suicide attempts and preventive strategies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: In our prior (first) study, suicide attempts were associated with the menses. The main hypothesis of this replication (second) study is that the proportion of suicide attempters during the menses is significantly higher than the expected probability in the general population. Methods: Using the same methodology and setting, this replication naturalistic study included 120 fertile female suicide attempters with regular menstrual cycles during a 1-year period in the emergency room of a general hospital in Madrid, Spain, serving a catchment area of 500,000 people. Results: The significant increase in probability of attempting suicide during the menses for the first study was 1.61; for the second study, 1.72; and for both studies combined, 1.68 (95% confidence interval, 1.27-2.09). Thus, using the combined results, the probability of attempting suicide during the menses was 1.68 times higher than the overall probability of attempting suicide for any fertile women. In the catchment area, the population rate of fertile women arriving at the hospital after a suicide attempt was 166 per 100,000. The probability for women during the menses arriving at the hospital after a suicide attempt was significantly higher, 279 per 100,000 (1.68 X 166 per 100,000). The 95% confidence interval was 211 to 347 per 100,000. Conclusions: Despite inherent limitations, this naturalistic study replicates a small but significant increase of suicide attempts during the menses.

AB Background: Suicide and suicide attempts represent a severe problem for public health services. The aim of this study is to determine the socio-demographic and psychopathological variables associated with suicide attempts in the population admitted to a General Hospital.
   Methods: An observational-descriptive study of patients admitted to the A Coruna University Hospital (Spain) during the period 1997-2007, assessed by the Consultation and Liaison Psychiatric Unit. We include n = 5,234 admissions from 4,509 patients. Among these admissions, n = 361 (6.9%) were subsequent to a suicide attempt. Admissions arising from a suicide attempt were compared with admissions occurring due to other reasons. Multivariate generalised estimating equation logistic regression models were used to examine factors associated with suicide attempts.
   Results: Adjusting by age, gender, educational level, cohabitation status, being employed or unemployed, the psychiatric diagnosis at the time of the interview and the information on previous suicide attempts, we found that the variables associated with the risk of a suicide attempt were: age, psychiatric diagnosis and previous suicide attempts.
   The risk of suicide attempts decreases with age (OR = 0.969). Psychiatric diagnosis was associated with a higher risk of suicide attempts, with the highest risk being found for Mood or Affective Disorders (OR = 7.49), followed by Personality Disorders (OR = 7.31), and Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders (OR = 5.03).
   The strongest single predictive factor for suicide attempts was a prior history of attempts (OR = 23.63).
   Conclusions: Age, psychopathological diagnosis and previous suicide attempts are determinants of suicide attempts.

AB Background: A previous suicide attempt is a clinically relevant factor for completed suicide. In this paper people who committed suicide on their first attempt are compared with those who did so after previous attempts. Method: A review of the Computerised Clinical Histories in the Navarro Health Service-Osasunbidea (2010-2013) in Spain. Results: Of the 166 cases, 31.9% (n = 53) presented at least one prior attempt. Of these 53, 65.3% modified the method of suicide. Women presented significantly more attempts (chi(2) = 14.3; df = 3; p =.002). Three sub-samples were identified according to the attempts and diagnoses. The diagnoses of personality disorders (90.9%; n = 10) and women under 51 years of age with a diagnosis of affective, anxiety, or substance abuse disorders (82.4%; n=14) presented the highest numbers of attempts. People without a psychiatric diagnosis and with psychotic or organic mental disorders presented the smallest proportion of attempts (13.2%; n = 10) together with people over 51 years of age diagnosed with affective, anxiety, or substance abuse disorders (22.5%; n = 9). Conclusions: Prior attempts are suicide risk factors only in specific clinical sub-samples. Prevention and intervention programs should consider these results.

In a Spanish psychiatric ward, we analyze aforementioned inpatients using quantitative methods, with a cross-sectional descriptive design. We take into account several variables (soclo-demographic, clinical and healthcare variables) from 2012 until 2014, collected by MONSUE in 139 indviduals through 185 episodes. We employ chi-square and ANOVA (SPSS.18.0 (C)) for statistical analysis. Some variables reach conventional levels of statistical significance: women, urban, labour situation and job category, usual household composition, attempt lethality, presence of pathological personality, drug use, previous suicide attempts and healthcare assistance related to. During this time the attempeted suicides were growing.

AB Objective: To analyse trends in mortality from suicide over the period 1965 - 99.
   Method: Data were derived from the WHO database, including data for 47 countries.
   Results: In the European Union (EU), all age suicide mortality peaked at 16.1/100 000 in men in 1980 - 84, and declined thereafter to 14.4/ 100 000 in 1995 - 98. In females, the fall was 29% to reach 4.6/100 000. A similar pattern of trends was observed in several eastern European countries. In contrast, mortality from suicide rose substantially in the Russian Federation, from 37.7/100 000 in males in 1985 - 89 to 58.3/ 100 000 in 1995 - 98 (+ 55%), and to 9.5/100 000 (+ 12%) in females. In the USA and most other American countries providing data, no consistent pattern was evident for males, but falls were observed in females. Steady declines were registered for Japan, starting from the highest suicide rates worldwide in the late 1950s. Suicide rates were upwards in Ireland, Italy, Spain, the UK, Cuba, Australia and New Zealand. Substantial rises were observed in a few countries ( Ireland, Cuba, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand) for young males.
   Conclusion: In spite of mixed trends, suicide remains a significant public health problem worldwide.

AB The aim was to identify and describe sociodemographic and clinical variables in individuals who have made a suicide attempt. An analysis of electronically stored records on persons admitted to the emergency departments of a northern health district during the period 2009-2011 for mental disorders was conducted. The records of 826 patients (30.1% of the total), where 485 (58.7%) were female, aged between 14 and 94 years (M = 49.3; SD = 12.7), were selected. This amounted to 412 individuals (49.9%) who had made a suicide attempt, and were compared with others without prior suicide attempt. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the strongest predictors of suicide attempt. The results show that the risk of making a suicide attempt increases with age, those most at risk being aged 34 to 53 years (p < 0.01; OR = 6.99), female (p < 0.05; OR = 2.70) and unemployed (p < 0.05; OR = 4.98). The most predictive psychopathological diagnoses for suicide attempt were anxiety disorders (p < 0.01; OR = 3.95) and impulse control disorders/addictions (p < 0.01; OR = 3.76). The importance of creating specific risk and protection profiles when implementing contextualized health policies on suicide attempt prevention is discussed.

AB Background: To describe the occurrence of persistent suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in a sample of obsessive-compulsive patients followed-up prospectively during 1 to 6 years, and to determine the existence of predictors of suicide behavior.
   Method: Two hundred and eighteen outpatients with DSM-IV OCD, recruited from a specialized OCD Unit in Barcelona, Spain, between February 1998 and December 2007, were included in the study. Suicide ideation was assessed by item 3 of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Suicide attempts were evaluated by the Beck Suicide Intent Scale. Patients with and without persistent suicidal thoughts and suicide attempters and non-attempters were compared on sociodemographic and clinical variables. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate potential predictors of suicide.
   Results: Patients completed a mean follow-up period of treatment of 4.1 years (SD: 1.7; range: 1-6 years). During this period, eighteen patients (8.2%) reported persistent suicidal ideation, two patients (0.91%) committed suicide and 11 (5.0%) attempted suicide. Being unmarried, presenting higher basal scores in the HDRS, current or previous history of affective disorders and symmetry/ordering obsessions were independently associated with suicidal behaviors.
   Limitations: Patients were recruited from a specialized OCD clinic and received exhaustive treatment. Influence of variables including social support, life events, hopelessness and substance abuse/dependence was not assessed.
   Conclusions: Suicide behavior is not a highly common phenomenon in OCD, but it should not be disregarded, especially in unmarried patients, with comorbid depression and symmetry/ ordering obsessions and compulsions, who appear to be at a greater risk for suicide acts.

TI Factors of risk for suicidal behavior associated with depressive
   disorders and anxiety
SO SALUD MENTAL
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE Anxiety; depression; suicide; suicide attempt
ID PANIC DISORDER; COMORBIDITY
AB Introduction
   Suicide is among the most prevalent causes of death in the world. A history of past suicide attempts is the most important of all the risk factors to show suicidal behavior (attempts and completed suicides). The objective of this study is to assess the effect of anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, and comorbid major depression with anxiety on the risk for suicide attempts.
   Methods
   We recruited 505 patients with a history of suicide attempts and a control group of 277 patients without a history of suicide attempt from thee hospitals in Madrid, Spain. We performed a logistio regression analysis using a progressive elimination method with the presence or absence of a history of suicide attempts as the dependent variable. As independent variables we included the diagnosis (anxiety, major depression, anxiety comorbid with major depression, and other diagnoses) and other risk factors for suicide attempts recognized in the literature.
   Results
   The regression model correctly classified more than 80% of the patients. Patients with depression (OR=3.4; Cl 95%.1.8-4.8) and with anxiety-depression comorbidity (OR=4.3; Cl 95%=2.4-7.8) had higher risk for suicide attempt compared to patients with other diagnoses. Patients without children had a higher risk for suicide attempt then those with children (OR=3.8; 95% C1=2.3-6.2), while patients With a family history of suicide had a higher risk than those without it (OR=2.2; 95% CI=1.1-4.5).
   Conclusions
   In clinical populations, the comorbidity of depression and anxiety is a hiOher risk factor for suicide attempts than having either condition separately or having other diagnoses. It also seems to be more important than other risk factors, such as family history.

AB Background: Suicide is the primary cause of unnatural death in Spain, and suicide re-attempts a major economic burden worldwide. The risk factors for re-attempt and suicide after an index suicide attempt are different. This study aims to investigate risk factors for re-attempt and suicide after an index suicide attempt.
   Methods: This observational study is part of a one-year telephone management program. We included all first-time suicide attempters evaluated in the emergency department at Parc Tauli-University Hospital (n = 1241) recruited over a five-year period (January 2008 to December 2012). Suicide attempters were evaluated at baseline using standardized instruments. Bivariate logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare the time to re-attempt between categorical variables. Comparisons were performed using Log-Rank and Wilcoxon tests. Variables with a p-value lower than 0.2 were included in a multivariate Cox regression model. Bivariate logistic regression models were considered to identify risk factors for suicide. The significance level was set to 0.05.
   Results: Suicide re-attempters were more likely diagnosed with cluster B personality disorders (36.8% vs. 16. 6%; p < 0.001), and alcohol use disorders (19.8 vs. 13.9; p = 0.02). Several [1.2% (15/1241)] of them died by suicide. Attempters who suicide were more likely alcohol users (33.3% vs. 17.2%; p = 0.047), and older (50. 9 +/- 11.9 vs. 40.7 +/- 16.0; p = 0.004).
   Conclusions: Alcohol use, personality disorders and younger age are risk factors for re-attempting. Older age is a risk factor for suicide among suicide attempters. Current prevention programs of suicidal behaviour should be tailored to the specific profile of each group.

AB Background There are few studies exploring associations between different types of childhood abuse and mental health problems among adult prisoners. Aims To explore associations between history of childhood abuse, depression or anxiety, and near-lethal suicide attempts among adult prisoners, and test the hypothesis that post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be a mediator between childhood abuse and adult disorder among prisoners. Method We enrolled 943 men from three prisons in Spain. Childhood abuse was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire at interview and current symptoms were assessed using the 21-item Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Self-reported histories of near-lethal suicide attempts were recorded. Results Overall, 360 (40%) of the men reported at least one type of childhood abuse; 231 (24.5%) described exposure to emotional abuse, 236 (25%) to physical abuse, and 97 (10%) to sexual abuse. Survivors of all types of childhood abuse had over twice the prevalence of severe depression, anxiety, stress disorder, and near-lethal suicide attempts than men who had not been exposed. Survivors of sexual and emotional violence during childhood had more symptoms of PTSD than survivors of physical abuse. Statistically, PTSD had a mediating effect, but it was very small. Conclusions Although other studies have shown high rates of childhood abuse histories among prisoners, this is the first to link such a history to near-lethal suicide attempts in this population.

AB Background: The suicide mortality rate in Andalusia is higher than the Spanish average, and it shows a different evolution over time. This study analyzes recent changes of suicide mortality in Andalusia, its geographical distribution and its relation with antidepressant use, altitude and socioeconomic inequality.
   Methods: An ecological study of the Basic Health Zones in Andalusia has been conducted. Age-standarized suicide rates in 2012 and during 20072011 were calculated. The correlation among variables and their association with the geographical differences was assessed with Spearman's coefficient and generalized linear models were also estimated.
   Results: Andalusia registered 7,58 suicides per 100.000 inhabitants per year from 2007 to 2011, with a range of 0,96 to 27,71 in the different areas. Positive correlation has been observed between altitude and suicide rates in 2012 (r= 0,29; p< 0,001) and during the period 2007-2011 (r= 0,47; p< 0,001). Antidepressant use in 2012 was not correlated with suicide rates in that year (r= 0,03; p= 0,67), but a positive correlation was observed with the precedent five years suicide rates (r= 0,18; p= 0,008). The Deprivation Index had a positive correlation with suicide rates in 2012 (r= 0,29; p< 0,001) and in 2007-2011 (r= 0,33; p< 0,001).
   Conclusions: There is a clear geographical pattern in the distribution of suicide mortality in Andalusia and it remains stable over time. Central areas and in those with the highest altitude concentrate the highest suicide rates, which are associated with a larger use of antidepressants and also with higher levels of material deprivation.

AB Previous research has shown that neighborhood-level variables such as social deprivation, social fragmentation or rurality are related to suicide risk, but most of these studies have been conducted in the U.S. or northern European countries. The aim of this study was to analyze the spatio-temporal distribution of suicide in a southern European city (Valencia, Spain), and determine whether this distribution was related to a set of neighborhood-level characteristics. We used suicide-related calls for service as an indicator of suicide cases (n = 6,537), and analyzed the relationship of the outcome variable with several neighborhood-level variables: economic status, education level, population density, residential instability, one-person households, immigrant concentration, and population aging. A Bayesian autoregressive model was used to study the spatio-temporal distribution at the census block group level for a 7-year period (2010-2016). Results showed that neighborhoods with lower levels of education and population density, and higher levels of residential instability, one-person households, and an aging population had higher levels of suicide-related calls for service. Immigrant concentration and economic status did not make a relevant contribution to the model. These results could help to develop better-targeted community-level suicide prevention strategies.

AB Birth cohort effects in suicide rates are well established, but to date there is no methodological approach or framework to test the temporal stability of these effects. We use the APC-Detrended (APCD) model to robustly estimate intensity of cohort effects identifying non-linear trends (or 'detrended' fluctuations) in suicide rates. The new APC-Hysteresis (APCH) model tests temporal stability of cohort effects. Analysing suicide rates in 25 WHO countries (periods 1970-74 to 2005-09; ages 20-24 to 70-79) with the APCD method, we find that country-specific birth cohort membership plays an important role in suicide rates. Among 25 countries, we detect 12 nations that show deep contrasts among cohort-specific suicide rates including Italy, Australia and the United States. The APCH method shows that cohort fluctuations are not stable across the life course but decline in Spain, France and Australia, whereas they remain stable in Italy, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. We discuss the Spanish case with elevated suicide mortality of cohorts born 1965-1975 which declines with age, and the opposite case of the United States, where the identified cohort effects of those born around 1960 increase smoothly, but statistically significant across the life course.

AB While linkages between some macroeconomic phenomena and suicides in some countries have been explored, only two studies, hitherto, have established a causal relationship between fiscal austerity and suicide, albeit in a single country. The aim of this study is to provide the first systematic multiple -country evidence of a causal relationship of fiscal austerity on time-, gender-, and age-specific suicide mortality across five Eurozone peripheral countries, namely Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain over the period 1968-2012, while controlling for various socioeconomic differences. The impact of fiscal adjustments is found to be gender-, age- and time-specific. Specifically, fiscal austerity has short-, medium- and long-run suicide increasing effects on the male population in the 65-89 age group. A 1% reduction in government spending is associated with a 138%, 2.42% and 3.32% increase in the short, medium- and long-run, respectively, of male suicides rates in the 65-89 age group in the Eurozone periphery. These results are highly robust to alternative measures of fiscal austerity. Improved labour market institutions help mitigate the negative effects of fiscal austerity on suicide mortality.

AB This study analyzes the views of four groups of healthcare professionals who may play a role in the management of suicidal behavior. The goal was to identify key factors for suicide prevention in different areas of the healthcare system. Qualitative research was conducted using focus groups made up of different healthcare professionals who participated in the identification, management, and prevention of suicidal behavior. Professionals included were primary care physicians, psychologists, psychiatrists, and emergency physicians. 'Suicide' was amongst the most relevant terms that came up in discussions most of the times it appeared associated with words such as 'risk', 'danger', or 'harm'. In the analysis by categories, the four groups of professionals agreed that interventions in at-risk behaviors are first in importance. Prevention was the second main concern with greater significance among psychiatrists. Primary care professionals call for more time to address patients at risk for suicide and easier access to and communication with the mental health network. Emergency care professionals have a lack of awareness of their role in the detection of risk for suicide in patients who seek attention at emergency care facilities for reasons of general somatic issues. Mental health care professionals are in high demand in cases of self-harm, but they would like to receive specific training in dealing with suicidal behavior.

AB Background: No recent cross-country examinations for youth suicide trends and methods for Europe were found.
   Aim: The aim of the study is to specify differences in suicide rates, trends and methods used among 15-24 years olds by gender across 15 European countries.
   Method: Data for 14,738 suicide cases in the age group 15-24 in 2000-2004/5 were obtained and analysed.
   Results: Suicide rates ranged 5.5-35.1 for males and 1.3-8.5 for females. Statistically significant decline since 2000 was observed in Germany, Scotland, Spain, and England for males and in Ireland for females. Hanging was most frequently used for both genders, followed by jumping and use of a moving object for males and jumping and poisoning by drugs for females. Male Suicides had a higher risk than females of using firearms and hanging and lower risk of poisoning by drugs and jumping. There were large differences between single Countries.
   Limitations: The limitations of the study are the small numbers of specific suicide methods in some countries as well as the recategorisation of ICD-9 codes into ICD-10 in England, Ireland and Portugal. Further, the use of suicides (X60-X84) without events of undetermined deaths (Y10-Y34) continues to be problematic considering the possibility of "hidden suicides".
   Conclusions: The present Study shows that suicide rates among young males are decreasing since 2000 in several European countries. Analysis of suicide methods confirms that there is a very high proportion of hanging in youths, which is extremely difficult to restrict. However, besides hanging there are also high rates of preventable suicide methods and reducing the availability of means should be one of the goals of suicide prevention.

AB Dysthymia and major depressive disorder (MDD) are both risk diagnoses for suicidal behaviour. The aim of the present study was to identify clinical differences between these disorders, with a special reference to dysthymia. We studied suicidal behaviour, comorbidity and psychiatric symptoms of inpatient suicide attempters with dysthymia and MDD. We used DSM III-R diagnostics, the Suicide Assessment Scale (SUAS) and the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS), part of which is the Montgomery and angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Suicide mortality, number of repeated suicide attempts, method of suicide attempt and comorbidity of Axis I did not differ between the groups. Dysthymia patients, however, suffered more than MDD patients from DSM-III-R Axis II diagnoses (above all cluster B). There was no significant difference in Axis III comorbidity. Total SUAS, CPRS and MADRS scores did not differ significantly between the groups. When studying separate SUAS and CPRS items in a multivariate analysis, the CPRS items "aches and pains", "increased speech flow", increased "agitation" and "less tendency to worrying over trifles" as well as young age remained independently associated with dysthymia. Dysthymia patients, who later committed suicide, more often reported increased "aches and pains" than those who did not commit suicide. In this small sample of suicide attempters, we conclude that dysthymia suicide attempters, more often than MDD patients, have a comorbidity with personality disorders, which combined with a picture of aches and pains, could be factors explaining their suicidality.

DE John Keats; George Keats; family; descendants; America; Spain
AB The article traces the far-flung descendants of George Keats, brother of the poet. In the nineteenth century a middle-class group emerged, tilting upward educationally and professionally. A matriarchy of sorts included strong women whose brothers and sons often struggled. Patterns of alcoholism, homosexuality, and suicide were evident, albeit not provably genetic. A dominant theme is the Keats' peripatetic nature, as they moved to America, Spain, Australia, and a dozen other countries pursuing opportunities. Only one family remains in London, with the largest cluster in California.

AB Objective: The effectiveness of suicide prevention programmes is an important issue worldwide today. The impact of urbanization and gender is controversial in suicide rates. Hence, this study adjusted on potential risk factors and secular changes for suicide rates in gender and rural/urban areas.
   Study design: Observational study.
   Methods: A Suicide Prevention Center was established by the Executive Yuan in Taiwan in 2005 and tried to carry out suicidal intervention in the community in every city and town. There were two phases, including the first phase of the programme from 2005 to 2008, and the second phase of the programme from 2009 to 2013. The crude suicide rates data from the period of 1991-2013, which recruited nine urban and 14 rural areas in Taiwan, were extracted from the Taiwanese national mortality data file. The suicide rates in two areas of Taiwan (Taipei city and Yilan County) were further used to compare the differences between urban and rural areas.
   Results: The results show that unemployment increased the suicide rate in men aged 45-64 years and in women older than 65 years of age in Taiwan. High divorce and unemployment rates resulted in increased suicide rates in men in the city, whereas emotional distress was the main cause of suicides in men in rural areas. The main method of suicide was jumping from a high building for both sexes in the city, whereas drowning was the most common method of suicide for men in rural areas.
   Conclusion: Following the intervention programme, suicide behaviour began to decrease in all urban and rural areas of Taiwan. This study showed the cumulative effect of the intervention programme in decreasing the suicide rate in Taiwan. Moreover, the gender-specific suicidal rate and disparity in suicidal methods in urban and rural areas should be considered in further preventive strategies in Taiwan.

AB Objective
   To analyze the number and characteristics of suicide attempts by reviewing records of the public emergency healthcare service information system.
   Method
   A retrospective observational study was conducted of emergency telephone calls received between January 1 2007 and December 31 2013 throughout the Andalusia region (Southern Spain). Cases were selected based on phone operator or healthcare team labeling. Data were analyzed on the characteristics of the individuals, the timing and severity of attempts, their prioritization, and their outcome.
   Results
   Between January 1 2007 and December 31 2013, 20.942 calls related to suicide attempts were recorded, a rate of 34.7 attempts per 100,000 inhabitants. Most cases were classified by the public emergency healthcare service (Empresa Publica de Emergencias Sanitarias, EPES) as code X84 (The International Statistical Classification of Diseases, tenth revision, ICD-10) or 305(The International Statistical Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, ICD-9). Attempts were more frequent in the 35-49-year age group and there were similar proportions of males and females. The lowest number of calls for suicide attempts were in 2007 and the highest in 2013. Calls were more frequent during the summer months, at weekends, and between 16:00 and 23:00 h. The likelihood of evacuation to the hospital emergency department was almost two-fold lower in over 65-yr-olds than in younger individuals.
   Significant (p = 0.001) gender differences were found in call outcome and prioritization. The most influential factor for evacuation to a hospital emergency department was the code assigned by the attending healthcare team.
   Conclusions
   Information obtained from extra-hospital emergency services provides valuable data on the characteristics and timing of calls related to suicide attempts, complementing information from hospital emergency departments or population surveys. There is a need to standardize the definition and recording of a suicide attempt.

AB Terrorist actions have occurred in all historical periods. The purpose of this article is to analyse and reflect on the causes of terrorism, suicide or otherwise. We concentrate in particular on the publications of Spanish authors. The results are not very promising. The conclusion is that what is published in Spain from the perspective of the psychology of the etiology of terrorism is almost irrelevant. Therefore, currently Spanish psychology can contribute very little to the knowledge about the risk factors of terrorist actions. Psychological investigation seems focused on the quantification of reality rather than its interpretation, understanding and transformation. Thus psychological knowledge runs the risk of becoming socially trivial and insubstantial.

AB Background. Between 25% to 50% of patients with bipolar disorder make suicide attempts during their lives, but there are some controversies about factors related to suicide attempts in this group of patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between suicide attempts and the predictive factors previously described in the literature.
   Method: The sample included all 169 patients with DSM-III-R bipolar I disorder identified in a delimited area (northern Spain). Sociodemographic, clinical, and family history variables measured by Research Diagnostic Criteria-Family History were analyzed. Significant variables were introduced in a logistic regression analysis to control for the effects of other variables.
   Results: There were 56 patients (33%) who had one or more suicide attempts. Early age at onset, history of hospital admission during depressive episodes, drug abuse, and family history were significantly associated with suicide in the univariate analyses (p < .05). A much higher proportion of patients with onset at or before 25 years of age than patients with onset after 25 years of age attempted suicide (23% vs. 10%). The age at onset was no longer significant after controlling for the other 3 variables included in the logistic regression analysis.
   Conclusion: Suicide attempts are highly prevalent in bipolar patients and are related to drug abuse, family history of affective disorders, and severe depressive episodes. This study suggests that the risk of suicide in patients with an early age at onset could reflect other variables such as drug abuse, a history of hospital admissions for depression, or family history.

AB Introduction: The aim of the study was to assess the quality of the clinical records of the patients who are seen in public hospitals in Madrid after a suicide attempt in a blind observation.
   Methods: Observational, descriptive cross-sectional study conducted at four general public hospitals in Madrid (Spain). Analyses of the presence of seven indicators of information quality (previous psychiatric treatment, recent suicidal ideation, recent suicide planning behaviour, medical lethality of suicide attempt, previous suicide attempts, attitude towards the attempt, and social or family support) in 993 clinical records of 907 patients (64.5% women), ages ranging from 6 to 92 years (mean 37.1 +/- 15), admitted to hospital after a suicide attempt or who committed an attempt whilst in hospital.
   Results: Of patients who attempted suicide, 94.9% received a psychosocial assessment. All seven indicators were documented in 22.5% of the records, whilst 23.6% recorded four or less than four indicators. Previous suicide attempts and medical lethality of current attempt were the indicators most often missed in the records. The study found no difference between the records of men and women (z = 0.296; p = 0.767, two tailed Mann-Whitney U test), although clinical records of patients discharged after an emergency unit intervention were more incomplete than the ones from hospitalised patients (z = 2.731; p = 0.006), and clinical records of repeaters were also more incomplete than the ones from non-repeaters (z = 3.511; p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Clinical records of patients who have attempted suicide are not complete. The use of semi-structured screening instruments may improve the evaluation of patients who have self-harmed. (C) 2009 SEP y SEPB. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: This study assessed psychiatric medications and their potential lethality in a representative sample of suicide attempts. Materials and methods: During 1996-98, 563 suicide attempts were studied in a general hospital in Madrid (Spain). Medication overdose was used in 456 suicide attempts (81%). The ratio between dose taken and maximum prescription dose recommended was used to evaluate the medication toxicity. Results: Benzodiazepines were the drugs most often used in self-poisoning (65% of overdoses), followed by new antidepressants (11%), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (10%), and antipsychotics (8%). An overdose with any of the three latter psychiatric medications was significantly more frequent in patients prescribed those medications. The overdoses for TCA were potentially lethal in 47% of the cases. However, all patients who overdosed on psychiatric medications recovered well and were discharged without any sequelae. Discussion: This study suggests that psychiatric medications, particularly benzodiazepines, new antidepressants and antipsychotics, are relatively safe when they are used for self-poisoning. If patients with mental illnesses are under treated, there is a clear and documented higher risk for suicide. Conclusion: It is better to prescribe psychiatric medications, particularly the new ones, rather than withhold them due to an exaggerated fear of a lethal overdose (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

AB Background: The little research there is about suicidal behaviour in those with gender dysphoria indicates that they are at a much higher risk of death by suicide and suicidal behaviour than the general population. The objective of this research is to analyse the prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts reported by people who attended consultations at the Gender Identity Treatment Unit between 2007 and 2017 presenting complaints related to gender dysphoria. Method: An ex-post facto study with a sample of 151 people who were clients at the unit, 97 in the male to female trans group, 54 female to male. Clinical evaluations were carried out assessing variables of suicidal ideation and attempts, along with a possible psychiatric diagnosis. Results: Almost half (48.3%) reported suicidal ideation, 23.8% had attempted suicide. Conclusions: There are higher levels of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in people with gender dysphoria than in the general population. No differences were seen between groups in terms of gender/sex. Psychiatric morbidity was not an influential variable for suicidal behaviour. This suggests that suicidal ideation is one of the best indicators of the risk of suicidal behaviours.

AB Introduction. The current research deals with the treatment of schoolbullying and the news about the suicide of adolescents in the Spanish press. Methodology. The objective is to measure the importance the newspapers give to this phenomenon to ascertain if the interest of newspapers runs parallel to the occurrence of the most serious cases or if the agenda-setting outstands schoolbullying as a main social problem. Results. Data were obtained after accounting 8,421 news items published in reference newspapers between 2004 and 2017, and going deeper into the 222 that directly address the eight cases of teen suicide in Spain during the research period. Conclusions. Media interest for the problema is growing up, although with strong narrative deficiencies. Predominates a sensationalist view focused in autolysis cases, which are no more considerad a taboo topic by its possible imitation effect, and the presumption of inocence is oftenly not respected.

AB Background. Recent research has shown an association between unemployment and suicide, but the mediating factors in this relationship are still unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of unemployment and economic recession on suicide rates in the Spanish region of Galicia between 1975 and 2012
   Method. We analysed age-standardised suicide rates in men and women and in four age groups: less than 25 years, 25-45 years, 45-65 years and more than 65 years and performed a joinpoint analysis to determine trend changes throughout 1975-2012 period. Also we analysed the association between suicide, recession and unemployment by means of a temporal trend model with a Generalised Additive Model.
   Results. Suicide rates increased from 145 suicides in 1975 to a high in 1993, with 377 deaths by suicide, representing 1.38% of all causes of death, and thereafter they tend to decrease to 335 suicides in 2012. Joinpoint analyses revealed that suicide rates changed differently across sex and age groups. For men, the annual percentage of change (APC) between 1975 and 1988 (CI 95% 1986-1994) was 5.45 (CI 95% = 3.5, -7.2) but from 1988 the APC became negative [-0.66 (CI 95% = -1.3, -0.1)]. For women, APC between 1974 and 1990 (CI 95% 1986-1992) was 4.86 (CI 95% = 3.2, -6.4) and -1.46 subsequently (CI 95% = -2.2, -0.5). Women aged 24 years or less showed stable suicide rates while men from 45-65 years showed two incidence peaks. When we studied the independent correlation between unemployment, recession and suicide, we found a significant association between unemployment and suicide, but not between recession and suicide for both sexes together and for men while for women there was no significant correlation between suicide and unemployment or recession. Finally, when we studied the effect of the interaction between unemployment and recession on suicide we found economic recession and unemployment interacted with regards to suicide rates (F = 5.902; df = 4.167; p = 0.00098) and after adjusting by sex, the effect was confirmed among men (F = 4.827; df = 2.823; p = 0.0087), but not among women (F = 0.001; df = 1.000; p = 0.979).
   Conclusions. Although suicide rates in Galicia are gradually decreasing in the last decades, there are important sex and age differences. Unemployment was related with suicide during economic recession periods according to our results.

AB Relationship breakdown constitutes a major risk factor for suicide ideation and completion. Although no definitive conclusion can be reached about a gender differential in susceptibility to this factor, several studies have identified that there is an elevated risk factor in men following divorce and separation. This article presents an overview of sociological explanations that may be employed to understand this phenomenon. There is discussion of the changing nature of intimacy, men's loss of honor, marriage as a more positive experience for men than for women, control in relationships, the increasing importance of the care of children for men, and men's social networks. The article concludes with possible implications for policy and practice.

AB Introduction: Suicidal and self-injurious behaviors in adolescents are a major public health concern. However, the prevalence of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors in Spanish outpatient adolescents is unknown.
   Methods: A total of 267 adolescents between 11 and 18 year old were recruited from the Child and Adolescent Outpatient Psychiatric Services, Jimenez Diaz Foundation (Madrid, Spain) from November 1st 2011 to October 31st 2012. All participants were administered the Spanish version of the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Inventory, which is a structured interview that assesses the presence, frequency, and characteristics of suicidal ideation, suicide plans, suicide gestures, suicide attempts, and non-suicidal self-injury.
   Results: One-fifth (20.6%) of adolescents reported having had suicidal ideation at least once during their lifetime. Similarly, 2.2% reported suicide plans, 9.4% reported suicide gesture, 4.5% attempted suicide, and 21.7% reported non-suicidal self-injury, at least once during their lifetime. Of the whole sample, 47.6% of adolescents reported at least one of the studied thoughts or behaviors in their lifetime. Among them, 47.2% reported 2 or more of these thoughts or behaviors. Regarding the reported function of each type of thoughts and behaviors examined, most were performed for emotional regulation purposes, except in the case of suicide gestures (performed for the purposes of social reinforcement).
   Conclusions: The high prevalence and high comorbidity of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors, together with the known risk of transition among them, underline the need of a systematic and routine assessment of these thoughts and behaviors in adolescents assessed in mental health departments.

AB Objective. To investigate changes in attempted suicide rates in Castile-La Mancha between 2006 and 2015 and the correlation with sociodemographic and economic indicators.
   Methods. Study of attempted suicides attended by the emergency medical services of Castile La Mancha between 2006 and 2015. We obtained records of the number of incidents and recorded sociodemographic and economic variables. Rates were standardized by direct reference to regional population figures, and change over time was studied by means of segmented Poisson regression models. The correlation with economic indicators was assessed with the Pearson correlation coefficient.
   Results. A total of 1308 attempted suicides were attended; 711 (55.8%) were made by women. The years 2007 and 2013 saw the highest numbers of attempts. The population-standardized suicide rates were 23% higher in women than in men, 10% higher in Toledo than in Albacete, 20% higher in 2007-2008 and 30% to 40% higher between 2012 and 2015 than before the crisis began. Rates were higher in age brackets in which employment is usual. Rates correlated most strongly with economic strain (difficulty making it to the end of the monthly pay cycle) (r=0.29, P<.01), risk of poverty/exclusion in the region (r=0.285, P<.01), and the unemployment rate in the region (r=0.265, P<.01).
   Conclusions. Suicide rates rose during the economic recession. There were variable correlations between socioeconomic indicators and attempted suicide rates.

AB Objective To analyze the relationship between suicide in men and stratified measures of religiosity. Methods We studied 192 suicides and 81 controls (nonsuicide, sudden, or accidental death). We employed the psychological autopsy method to compile diagnoses based on DSM-IV criteria. Overall, religiosity and participation in religious associations were determined using a Likert-type scale. Given the limited participation of women in the religious associations of southern Spain, only male subjects were included. Results Religious participants had decreased risk of suicide compared to nonparticipants (OR = 0.148, 95% CI = 0.049-0.447). This lower risk was further associated with the degree of involvement in religious activity. Suicides accounted for 73.47% of subjects with no religious participation, 61.17% of those with some participation, and 56.52% of frequent participants (linear trend test Z = -2.0329, p = .042). Membership in a religious association was also associated with a lower rate of suicide compared to nonmembers (OR = 0.356, 95% CI = 0.172-0.736). This effect was similarly associated with the degree of involvement in the association. Suicides accounted for 74.67% of subjects who never participated in the activities of a religious association, 69.23% of those who sometimes participated, and 42.86% of frequent participants (linear trend test Z = -3.4082, p < .001). Conclusions Religiosity, either as general participation or through a religious association, was associated with protection against suicide proportional to the degree of involvement in religious activities.

AB The Asian economic crises of 1997 and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) had far-reaching impacts on Asian and other global economies. Turmoil in the banking and finance sectors led to downturns in stock markets, resulting in bankruptcies, house repossessions and high unemployment. These crises have been shown to be correlated with a deterioration in mental health and an increase in suicides, and it is important to understand the implication of these impacts and how such recessions affect the health of affected populations. With the benefit of hindsight, did lessons learned from the negative effects of the 1997 Asian economic recession impact the aftermath of the 2008 GFC in Asian countries? Utilising a framework based on a simple strata-bootstrap algorithm using daily data - where available - we investigate the trend in suicide rates over time in three different populations (Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea), and examine whether there were any changes in the pattern of suicide rates in each country subsequent to both the 1997 Asian and 2008. We find that each country responded differently to each of the crises and the suicide rates for certain age-gender specific groups in each country were more affected.

AB To investigate the association between four functional polymorphisms in interleukin-1 (IL-1) [IL-1 alpha-889 C/T, IL-1 beta + 3953 C/T, IL-1RA (86bp)n] and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) (-308A/G) genes and suicide attempts. Distribution of the aforesaid polymorphisms was analyzed in 193 suicide attempters compared with 420 unrelated healthy controls from Asturias (Northern Spain). Genotypes were determined using standard methods. No significant differences were found in genotype or in allelic distribution of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-1RA, or TNF alpha gene polymorphisms. No relationship was found between genotypes and the impulsivity of the suicide attempt. Estimated IL-1 haplotype frequencies were similar in both groups (likelihood ratio test = 13.26, df = 14, P= 0.506). Our data do not suggest that genetically determined changes in the IL-1 or TNF alpha genes confer increased susceptibility to suicidal behavior.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to compare mortality from the leading causes of death in farmers and in all other workers. Methods: Mortality by cause of death was calculated from a longitudinal study in which 9.5 million men were followed up for 10 years. We estimated the contribution of the causes of death to the difference in all-cause mortality. Results: Most of the excess in all-cause mortality in farmers was due to cardiovascular diseases, digestive diseases, and external causes, which contributed 22.3%, 17.2%, and 53.3% to the difference in all-cause mortality, respectively. Traffic accidents and suicide were the main contributors to the excess mortality from external causes. Conclusion: Farmers are a vulnerable group in terms of health, thus there is a need to identify the factors that influence excess mortality from cardiovascular diseases, digestive diseases, traffic accidents, and suicide.

AB This article investigates the prevalence of traumatization and mental distress in a sample of 1055 male European long-term prisoners as part of a wider study of the living conditions of prisoners serving sentences of at least five years in Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Germany, Lithuania, Poland, Spain and Sweden. Data were collected in a written survey using the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) as well as questions on attempted suicide and auto-aggressive behaviour. Participants experienced a mean of three traumatic events, with 14 per cent developing a Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) subsequently. In each national sample, more than 50 per cent of the participants were in need of treatment because of psychological symptoms and nearly one-third had attempted suicide.

TI Predictors of suicide in firt-episode affective and nonaffective

   PREVENTION; SYMPTOMS
AB Objective: To determine the baseline demographic and clinical characteristics associated with suicide attempts over 5 years following a first admission for psychosis and to assess the relationship between suicidal behavior during 5-year follow-up and clinical factors.
   Method: All inpatients consecutively admitted between February 1997 and January 1999 with a first psychotic episode from a specific catchment area in Spain were included at baseline; they were followed up yearly over a 5-year period with an extensive protocol that included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The primary outcome measure was suicide attempts. Comorbidity with alcohol and drug abuse was recorded, as were all suicidal acts made by patients over the follow-up period. Relationships between suicidal outcome and baseline clinical features were examined. Logistic regression modeling was used to test the significance and independence of associations of relevant factors to suicidal status.
   Results: Of 83 first-episode psychotic patients, 14.5% displayed suicidal behavior within the 5 years following the first admission, and 2.4% died by suicide. Suicide rate was 0.48%/year and attempt rate was 2.89%/year, with a 1.5-fold (95% CI = 1.07 to 2.22) greater risk for each depressive symptom at index episode and with an 8-fold (95% CI = 1.45 to 44.40) higher risk among patients with baseline stimulant abuse (cocaine and amphetamine).
   Conclusions: Patients with a first-episode psychotic disorder seemed to be a high-risk population for suicidal behavior. Depressive symptoms during the index psychotic episode and comorbidity with stimulant abuse at baseline were relevant predictive factors for suicidal behavior during the first years of first affective and nonaffective psychotic episodes.

AB Objective: To explore the association between violence and suicidal behavior in female university students. Method: A convenience sample of 540 female students enrolled in the Nursing and Teacher Training Faculties at the University of Valencia was selected. Violence by partners, nonpartners, and both was compared with suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts. An adjusted logistic regression and the Wald Test were performed to explore whether the effect on student's suicidal behavior differed if a partner or others committed violence. Results: 18.1% reported suicidal thoughts in the last month and 2.4% had attempted suicide in the past five years. Suicidal behavior was significantly higher in abused than in nonabused students, although the magnitude was higher when committed by a nonpartner. Conclusions: All forms of violence are strongly associated with suicidal behavior. Understanding the relationship between violence and suicidal thoughts and attempts is a priority for reducing suicide behavior in young women.

AB The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of ethanol in individuals (277) subjected to a mandatory medico-legal autopsy in the Institute of Legal Medicine of Las Palmas (Canary Islands, Spain) during 2016-2017, comparing the results with data published in 2015. Blood and/or vitreous humor samples were analyzed by gas chromatography. 31.8% of the individuals were positive to ethanol. We observed a decrease in the prevalence of ethanol among males (p = 0.002). While the prevalence of ethanol was reduced, the concentration among those positive subjects has increased. 11.9% of the series died in a traffic accident and the percentage of positive to ethanol decreased in relation to 2015 (64.3, 25.0, and 35.3%). The number of suicides remains constant, although the age of the suiciders has been significantly reduced (p = 0.022). The results of this study indicate that ethanol is still heavily involved in non-natural deaths.

AB Background The economic recession starting in 2008 may be having negative effects on health.
   Purpose We aimed to identify and characterise changes in trends in 15 health indicators in Spain during the recession.
   Methods Joinpoint regression and average annual percent change (AAPC) were used to compare trends.
   Results Premature mortality rates from several causes of death, except from cancer, showed statistically significant downward trends during the recession, as did poor self-reported health. HIV incidence was stable. No indicator declined significantly more slowly during the recession than in the preceding 4-year period, and two declined significantly faster.
   Conclusion Health in Spain has continued to improve during the first four years of the economic recession at a rate equal to or higher than in previous years.

DT Article

   TRENDS; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; AVAILABILITY; RESTRICTIONS
AB Background: There is a lack of international research on suicide by drug overdose as a preventable suicide method. Sex-and age-specific rates of suicide by drug self-poisoning (ICD-10, X60-64) and the distribution of drug types used in 16 European countries were studied, and compared with other self-poisoning methods (X65-69) and intentional self-injury (X70-84).
   Methods: Data for 2000-04/05 were collected from national statistical offices. Age-adjusted suicide rates, and age and sex distributions, were calculated.
   Results: No pronounced sex differences in drug self-poisoning rates were found, either in the aggregate data (males 1.6 and females 1.5 per 100,000) or within individual countries. Among the 16 countries, the range (from some 0.3 in Portugal to 5.0 in Finland) was wide. 'Other and unspecified drugs' (X64) were recorded most frequently, with a range of 0.2-1.9, and accounted for more than 70% of deaths by drug overdose in France, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain. Psychotropic drugs (X61) ranked second. The X63 category ('other drugs acting on the autonomic nervous system') was least frequently used. Finland showed low X64 and high X61 figures, Scotland had high levels of X62 ('narcotics and hallucinogens, not elsewhere classified') for both sexes, while England exceeded other countries in category X60. Risk was highest among the middle-aged everywhere except in Switzerland, where the elderly were most at risk.
   Conclusions: Suicide by drug overdose is preventable. Intentional self-poisoning with drugs kills as many males as females. The considerable differences in patterns of self-poisoning found in the various European countries are relevant to national efforts to improve diagnostics of suicide and appropriate specific prevention. The fact that vast majority of drug-overdose suicides came under the category X64 refers to the need of more detailed ICD coding system for overdose suicides is needed to permit better design of suicide-prevention strategies at national level.

AB Background: New technologies are an integral component of today's society and can complement existing suicide prevention programs. Here, we analyzed the use of new technologies in the prevention of suicide in 8 different European countries.
   Objective: The aim of this paper was to assess the opinions of professionals in incorporating such resources into the design of a suicide prevention program for the region of Zamora in Spain. This investigation, encompassed within the European project entitled European Regions Enforcing Actions against Suicide (EUREGENAS), includes 11 regions from 8 different countries and attempts to advance the field of suicide prevention in Europe.
   Methods: Using a specifically designed questionnaire, we assessed the opinions of 3 different groups of stakeholders regarding the use, frequency of use, facilitators, content, and format of new technologies for the prevention of suicide. The stakeholders were comprised of policy and public management professionals, professionals working in the area of mental health, and professionals related to the social area and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). A total of 416 participants were recruited in 11 regions from 8 different European countries.
   Results: The utility of the new technologies was valued positively in all 8 countries, despite these resources being seldom used in those countries. In all the countries, the factors that contributed most to facilitating the use of new technologies were accessibility and free of charge. Regarding the format of new technologies, the most widely preferred formats for use as a tool for the prevention of suicide were websites and email. The availability of information about signs of alarm and risk factors was the most relevant content for the prevention of suicide through the use of new technologies. The presence of a reference mental health professional (MHP) was also considered to be a key aspect. The countries differed in the evaluations given to the different formats suggesting that the cultural characteristics of the country should be taken into account.
   Conclusions: New technologies are much appreciated resources; however they are not often underused in the field of suicide prevention. The results of this exploratory study show that new technologies are indeed useful resources and should be incorporated into suicide prevention programs.

AB Objective: To determine the comparative effectiveness of 3 real-practice preventive programs aimed at lowering the relapse risk following a suicide attempt: a single priority appointment with an outpatient psychiatrist, an enhanced contact intervention, and an individual psychotherapy program.
   Methods: This observational study was conducted in a sample of 1,492 suicide attempters from 3 catchment areas in Madrid, Spain, between 2013 and 2017. Relapse was defined as an emergency department return after a new attempt within a 1-year follow-up. Kaplan-Meier survival functions were obtained by intervention, and Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted risks of relapse by intervention. Sex-and age-stratified analyses were also conducted. Covariates were age, sex, history of suicide attempts, history of psychiatric disorders, main ICD-10 psychiatric diagnostic groups, medical comorbidities, and family support.
   Results: A total of 133 subjects (8.9%) relapsed. The psychotherapy group had a lower presence of known risk factors for suicide attempt. Individual psychotherapy and enhanced contact were more effective than a single priority appointment at reducing suicide reattempt, with a 40% lower relapse risk in adjusted models. Results did not differ after sex and age stratification.
   Conclusions: In a naturalistic clinical setting, patients exposed to individual psychotherapy or an enhanced contact intervention had a similar, lower relapse risk than the single priority appointment group.

TI "Dumb" Yet Deadly: Local Knowledge and Poor Tradecraft Among Islamist
   Militants in Britain and Spain
SO STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM
LA English
DT Article
AB Islamist militants frequently lack a talent for tradecraft. In recent attacks in Britain and Spain, terrorists made numerous mistakes: receiving traffic citations while traveling in oenemyo territory, acting suspiciously when questioned by the police, and traveling together during missions. Militants' preference toward suicide operations restricts their ability to acquire practical experience, particularly when they lose their lives during attacks. And their unyielding devotion to their cause blinds them to opportunities to improve their operations. This is good news for counterterrorism officials. Terrorists' poor tradecraft provides alert law enforcers with critical leads they can use to identify their attackers, unravel their plots, andsometimesdisrupt their operations before they cause additional harm.

AB Objective: This study explored the factors psychiatrists considered in deciding on hospitalization for a large sample of suicide attempters in the emergency department of a general hospital in Madrid, Spain, between 1996 and 1998. Methods: Psychiatrists assessed 509 patients who had attempted suicide; 196 of these (39 percent) were hospitalized in the psychiatric unit, and 313 (61 percent) were discharged from the emergency department. The assessment included Beck's Suicidal Intent Scale (SIS) and a checklist of 47 clinical variables. Results: Of the 32 clinical variables significantly associated with hospitalization that were introduced in a logistic regression model, 11 remained significant. Six variables were associated with an increased odds of hospitalization: intention to repeat the attempt, plan to use a lethal method, low psychosocial functioning before the suicide attempt, previous psychiatric hospitalization, a suicide attempt in the past year, and planning that nobody would try to save their life after they had attempted suicide. Five variables decreased the odds: a realistic perspective on the future after the attempt, relief that the attempt was not effective, availability of a method to kill oneself (that was not used), belief that the attempt would influence others, and family support. Models based on the SIS total score and individual SIS items had lower specificity and sensitivity. Conclusions:. Psychiatrists appear to rely on patients' self-report in deciding on hospitalization rather than focus on demographic, diagnostic, or psychosocial issues. If the findings of this study were replicated in other hospital settings, the implication would be that the guidelines for assessing suicide attempts need to encourage thorough and detailed assessment of the attempt and the future plans.

AB We to study the epidemiologic characteristics of patients with multiple injuries after attempted suicide who were treated by the emergency health system of Navarre between 2004 and 2005. The patients that had 1 or more severe injuries from mechanical force after a suicide attempt were included. The injuries were life-threatening or could be the cause of severe complications or sequelae. An inclusion criterion was a New Injury Severity Score (NISS) of more than 15, or death. The annual incidence of such injuries was 5.7 per 100 000 population. The ratio of men to women was 3:1. In order of frequency, the most common methods were jumping from a high place, jumping in front of an oncoming train, and gunshot. Eighty percent of the patients died. The mean age was 50 years. jumping from heights was chosen most often by both men and women, but men also chose the other methods (train and gunshot) more often than women. The mean NISS was 37 points. We conclude that the incidence of violent suicide is low in Navarre. Mortality is high because of the severity of injuries caused by the methods chosen mainly by men. Women mainly choose jumping from heights whereas men use additional methods. [Emergencias 2012;24:208-210]

AB A robust literature on ingroup versus outgroup conflict suggests that perceived discrimination may be an important factor in intergroup aggression. Yet, to date, no studies have tested the hypothesis that the perception of being the victim of anti-Muslim discrimination might be associated with support for anti-Western political violence. We undertook an analysis of two Pew Global Attitudes Surveys: (1) a 2006 data set surveying 1,627 adult Muslim residents of Great Britain, France, Germany, and Spain and (2) a 2007 data surveying 1,050 adult Muslim residents of the United States. Our analyses support the conclusions that younger age and perceived discrimination are both associated with support of suicide bombing in these Muslim diaspora populations. Study 1 found that a bad experience of discrimination increased the odds of justifying suicide bombing among European Muslims by a factor of 3.4. Study 2 found that experienced discrimination was associated with justification of suicide bombing among American Muslims. If further investigations confirm that perceived discrimination is a risk factor for support for political violence, initiatives to reduce discrimination would theoretically reduce the risk of terrorism. We discuss the challenge of breaking the vicious cycle of intergroup prejudice and radicalization.

AB Introduction. In Spain, a comparative research study between those patients treated for suicide attempt and others treated by any other reason hasn't been found. The aim of this study is to describe the differences between both types of patients in relation to sociodemographic and clinic variables together with the adverse vital events and the suicidal ideation.
   Methodology. A descriptive, multicentric and case-controlled study carried out in psychiatric hospital emergencies where 207 patients had been evaluated for a suicidal attempt (cases) and 233 were also evaluated by any other reasons (checkings).
   Results. The cases presented a larger percentage of previous suicide attempts (45.4% vs. 30.0%; p=0.001) and a lower rates of prior emergency care (55.6% vs. 65.7%; p=0.030) of a history of mental disorder (77.8% vs. 86.7%; p=0.014) and follow-up in mental health. The 31.8% (n=74) exhibited suicidal ideation at the time of care and the 61.4% (n=143) expressed their desire to die when questioned.
   Conclusions. Neither a specific sociodemographic nor clinic profile of those who try to commit suicide has been found. But a high percentage of patients with suicidal ideation were identified in people treated for other reasons. The results emphasize the need to consider and evaluate the ideation of death and the risk of suicide in all the patients treated in psychiatric hospital emergencies.

   Methods : Study of two retrospective cohorts (Belgium, n = 23,607; Spain, n = 44,385) of 50-60 year old male employees with 4 years of follow-up. Mortality rate ratios (MRR) were estimated using Poisson regression models.
   Results : Mortality for subjects with permanent disability was higher than for the employed, for both Belgium [MRR = 4.56 (95% CI: 2.88-7.21)] and Spain [MRR = 7.15 (95% CI: 5.37-9.51)]. For the unemployed/early retirees, mortality was higher in Spain [MRR = 1.64 (95% CI: 1.24-2.17)] than in Belgium [MRR = 0.88 (95% CI: 0.46-1.71)].
   Conclusion : MRR differences between Belgium and Spain for unemployed workers could be partly explained because of differences between the two social security systems. Future studies should further explore mortality differences between countries with different social security systems. (C) 2016 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

AB This study examined the sociodemographic characteristics and the psychological adjustment of transsexuals in Andalusia (Spain), and also analyzed the differences between female-to-male (FtM) and male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals. The sample included 197 transsexuals (101 MtF and 96 FtM) selected from those who visited the Transsexual and Gender Identity Unit at the Carlos Haya Hospital in Malaga between 2011 and 2012. Our analyses indicated that MtF transsexuals were more likely to have lower educational levels, live alone, have worked less frequently throughout their lifetime, and have engaged in prostitution. For FtM transsexuals, there were more frequent references to the mother's psychiatric history and more social avoidance and distress. Multivariate analysis showed that the number of personality dysfunctional traits and unemployment status were associated with depression in the entire sample. The following three conclusions can be made: there are significant differences between MtF and FtM transsexuals (mainly related to sociodemographic variables), depression was high in both groups, and a remarkable percentage of transsexuals have attempted suicide (22.8 %) or have had suicidal thoughts (52.3 %).

AB Objective: There have been few prospective long-term naturalistic studies of patients with mixed episodes of bipolar disorder. The aim of this study was to examine 10-year outcomes in patients with at least 1 mixed episode.
   Method: A naturalistic sample of bipolar I disorder patients (n=120), representative of bipolar patients treated in a catchment area of Spain, was followed prospectively for up to 10 years. Outcomes including number (primary study outcome) and severity of episodes, hospitalizations, and suicide attempts were recorded at bimonthly visits. Bivariate and logistic regression models identified factors significantly associated with mixed episodes. The study was conducted from 1994 through 2004.
   Results: 37% of patients had mixed episodes. Mixed-episode patients had younger mean age at onset compared with the nonmixed group (25.3 vs 30.8 years; P=.025). After adjusting for age at onset, mixed-episode patients had an increased risk of hospitalization compared with the nonmixed group (OR=2.86; 95% CI, 1.09-7.52; P=.033) and more episodes (OR=1.21; 95% CI, 1.10-1.31; P<.001). Other differences between mixed and nonmixed patients, such as alcohol abuse, psychotic symptoms, and suicidality, were partially mediated by age at onset and were not significantly different after controlling for this variable. Mixed-episode patients with previous suicide attempts had a significantly shorter time to first suicide attempt during follow-up than those without history of suicide attempts (P=.014).
   Conclusions: Although some factors associated with mixed episodes are mediated by a younger age at onset, the long-term prognosis of mixed-episode patients is worse than patients with nonmixed episodes. J Clin Psychiatry 2011;72(5):671-676 (C) Copyright 2010 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

TI Suicide and Ambient Temperature: A Multi-Country Multi-City Study
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
LA English
DT Article
ID SOUTH-AFRICA; MORTALITY; SEASONALITY; RATES; ASSOCIATION; ENGLAND
AB BACKGROUND: Previous literature suggests that higher ambient temperature may play a role in increasing the risk of suicide. However, no multicountry study has explored the shape of the association and the role of moderate and extreme heat across different locations.
   OBJECTIVES: We examined the short-term temperature suicide relationship using daily time-series data collected for 341 locations in 12 countries for periods ranging from 4 to 40 y.
   METHODS: We conducted a two-stage meta-analysis. First, we performed location-specific time-stratified case-crossover analyses to examine the temperature suicide association for each location. Then, we used a multivariate meta-regression to combine the location-specific lag-cumulative nonlinear associations across all locations and by country.
   RESULTS: A total of 1,320,148 suicides were included in this study. Higher ambient temperature was associated with an increased risk of suicide in general, and we observed a nonlinear association (inverted J-shaped curve) with the highest risk at 27 degrees C. The relative risk (RR) for the highest risk was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.30, 1.36) compared with the risk at the first percentile. Country-specific results showed that the nonlinear associations were more obvious in northeast Asia (Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan). The temperature with the highest risk of suicide ranged from the 87th to 88th percentiles in the northeast Asian countries, whereas this value was the 99th percentile in Western countries (Canada, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the United Slates) and South Africa, where nearly linear associations were estimated. The country-specific RRs ranged from 1.31 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.44) in the United States to 1.65 (95% CI: 1.40, 1.93) in Taiwan, excluding countries where the results were substantially uncertain.
   DISCUSSION: Our findings showed that the risk of suicide increased with increasing ambient temperature in many countries, but to varying extents and not necessarily linearly. This temperature suicide association should be interpreted cautiously, and further evidence of the relationship and modifying factors is needed.

TI Suicide Coverage in the Digital Press Media: Adherence to World Health
   Organization Guidelines and Effectiveness of Different Interventions
   Aimed at Media Professionals
SO HEALTH COMMUNICATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This study evaluated the characteristics of suicide news articles in the digital press, their adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, and the effectiveness of interventions. We assessed adherence, avoidability, frequency and typology of suicide news over a six-month period in the four main digital media outlets of the Canary Islands (Spain). A brief training and information package intervention to the Canary Islands media outlets was carried out. We compared the quality of media reporting at both the pre-intervention and post-intervention timepoints, and compared the quality of reporting at the post-intervention timepoint in Victoria (Australia), where media interventions have been well-resourced and running for several years. We evaluated 339 suicide news articles: 38 from the pre-intervention period, 64 from the post-intervention period, and 237 from Victoria. News articles showed a very low degree of adherence to WHO recommendations, especially to those recommendations thought to have a protective effect. Post-intervention news articles showed better adherence than pre-intervention ones, but lower than those of Victoria, where constant interventions have been developed for years. We conclude that adherence to WHO recommendations is low. Simple interventions aimed at media professionals can improve adherence. However, constant and complex interventions seem to be more effective.

AB Objective To investigate the association between four serotonergic polymorphisms [A-1438G (rs6311) and T102C (rs6313) of the serotonin 2A receptor gene, and STin2 VNTR and 5-HTTLPR of the SLC6A4 gene] and suicidal behavior.
   Participants and methods One hundred and ninety-three suicide aftempters (SA) and 420 unrelated healthy controls from Asturias (Northern Spain) were genotyped using standard methods.
   Results A-1438G and T102C polymorphisms were in complete linkage disequilibrium in our population. Genotype and allele distributions showed no differences between SA and control participants. In nonimpulsive suicide attempts, however, we found an excess of the -1438A allele as compared with impulsive suicide attempts and the control group [chi(2) (2) = 11.92, corrected P= 0.021]. No other differences were found with regard to the impulsivity of the attempt. An excess of short allele carriers were found in the group of SA with high clinical lethality as compared with the low-lethality group [chi(2)(1) = 4.93, P=0.026, not significant after Bonferroni correction].
   The haplotype analysis showed no association between suicide attempt and haplotype distribution [likelihood ratio test (5)=4.40, P=0.493].
   Conclusion Our findings suggest that the -1438A allele may predispose for nonimpulsive suicidal behavior. Psychiatr Genet 18:213-218 (C) 2008 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB Suicide is a major public health issue with considerable human and economic cost. Previous attempts to delineate techniques capable of accurately predicting suicidal behavior proved unsuccessful. This paper aims at classifying suicide attempters (SA) as a first step toward the development of predictive models of suicidal behavior. A sample of 883 adults (347 SA and 536 non-SA) admitted to two university hospitals in Madrid, Spain, between 1999 and 2003 was used. Five multivariate techniques (linear regression, stepwise linear regression, decision trees, Lars-en and support vector machines) were compared with regard to their capacity to accurately classify SA. These techniques were applied to the Holmes-Rahe social readjustment rating scale and the international personal disorder examination screening questionnaire. Combining both scales, the Lars-en and stepwise linear regression techniques achieved 83.6% and 82.3% classification accuracy, respectively. In addition, these classification results were obtained using less than half of the available items. Multivariate techniques demonstrated to be useful in classifying SA using a combination of life events and personality criteria with reasonable accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

AB ObjectivesTo report worldwide trends in suicidemortality during a period that covers 7years after the 2008 global crisis.MethodsWe performed a time trend analysis with joinpoint regression.ResultsOver the 2000s, suicide mortality decreased with the largest declines observed in some Eastern European countries. The downward trends were followed by an increase in concomitance with the 2008 global crisis in some countries, including Greece (annual percentage change=+6 in men and +11.8 in women), the Netherlands (+4.2 in men and +4.0 in women), and the UK (+1.6 in men), while the pre-crisis downward trends stopped in Germany, Italy, and Spain. The joinpoint analysis also revealed long-term rises in Brazil (+0.8 since 1990 in men and +1.8 since 1999 in women), Mexico (+1.3 since 1995 in men and +3.6 since 1990 in women), the USA (+1.7 since 2005 in men and +4.2 since 2010 in women), and Australia (+1.8 in men and +3.7 in women, since 2006 in both sexes).ConclusionsDespite downward trendsin several areas of the world, in some countries suicide rates increased since the 2008 global crisis.

   ADOLESCENT SUICIDE; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; CHILD; PROGRAM; PARTICIPATION;
   DEPRESSION
AB Background: There have been only a few reports illustrating the moderate effectiveness of suicide-preventive interventions in reducing suicidal behavior, and, in most of those studies, the target populations were primarily adults, whereas few focused on adolescents. Essentially, there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and cultural adaptability of suicide-prevention strategies in schools. There is also a lack of information on whether suicide-preventive interventions can, in addition to preventing suicide, reduce risk behaviors and promote healthier ones as well as improve young people's mental health.
   The aim of the SEYLE project, which is funded by the European Union under the Seventh Framework Health Program, is to address these issues by collecting baseline and follow-up data on health and well-being among European adolescents and compiling an epidemiological database; testing, in a randomized controlled trial, three different suicide-preventive interventions; evaluating the outcome of each intervention in comparison with a control group from a multidisciplinary perspective; as well as recommending culturally adjusted models for promoting mental health and preventing suicidal behaviors.
   Methods and design: The study comprises 11,000 adolescents emitted from randomized schools in 11 European countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden serving as the scientific coordinating center. Each country performs three active interventions and one minimal intervention as a control group. The active interventions include gatekeeper training (QPR), awareness training on mental health promotion for adolescents, and screening for at-risk adolescents by health professionals. Structured questionnaires are utilized at baseline, 3- and 12-month follow-ups in order to assess changes.
   Discussion: Although it has been reported that suicide-preventive interventions can be effective in decreasing suicidal behavior, well-documented and randomized studies are lacking. The effects of such interventions in terms of combating unhealthy lifestyles in young people, which often characterize suicidal individuals, have never been reported. We know that unhealthy and risk-taking behaviors are detrimental to individuals' current and future health. It is, therefore, crucial to test well-designed, longitudinal mental health-promoting and suicide-preventive interventions by evaluating the implications of such activities for reducing unhealthy and risk behaviors while concurrently promoting healthy ones.

AB Introduction. Suicidal behaviour is a major health problem in Spain. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between the recurrence of suicide attempts and the level of lethality reached, and the profile of repeaters who perform more lethal attempts.
   Method. All patients admitted for attempted suicide in a health area of 360,000 inhabitants from 2009 to 2014 (N=711) were systematically assessed. We compared clinical and demographic characteristics of these patients in terms of lethality (low versus moderate-severe) and recidivism (1-2 attempts versus >2 attempts) using univariate analyses and regression models. Later, we repeated the analyses after distributing the sample into four groups depending on the presence or absence of high lethality and/or recidivism.
   Results. Recidivism was associated with the middle-age group (35-65 years), the lack of professional activity, and personality or substance use disorders. Lethality was associated with male gender, extreme age-groups, the use of a violent method, and affective disorders, but not with recidivism. Multiple suicide attempts and high lethality in a single patient was associated with 35-65 years age-group, male gender, violent methods, mental disorders, and inactivity.
   Conclusions. Different demographic and clinical factors indicate an increased risk of medical lethality and recurrence in suicidal patients. Our results show that at least some recidivist patients end up making more lethal and violent attempts with the passage of time, especially if they have psychiatric comorbidity.

AB Objective: This study aims to analyse the number and characteristics of calls made to the Malaga Prehospital Emergency Service (PES) for suicidal behavior based on sociodemographic, temporal, and health care variables.
   Method: This is a retrospective, descriptive study that records all calls made to the PES due to suicidal behavior (suicide attempts and completed suicides) in 2014. Sociodemographic variables (age, sex, and health district), variables related to the calls (time-slot, degree of sunlight, type of day, month, season of the year, prioritization, and number of resources mobilized) were extracted from these calls. The number of cases and percentages were presented for the qualitative variables. The rates per 100,000 were calculated by sex and health district and presented with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).
   Results: Of the total valid calls to PES (n = 181,824), 1,728 calls were made due to suicidal behavior (0.9%). The mean age was 43.21 (+/- 18) years, 57.4% were women, and the rate was 112.1 per 100,000 inhabitants. The calls due to suicidal behavior were in the younger-middle age segment, in the time-slot between 16 and 23 h and during daylight hours, on bank holidays, in spring and summer in comparison with winter, and with a peak of calls in August. The majority of these calls were classified as undelayable emergencies and mobilized one health resource.
   Conclusions: Prehospital emergency services are the first contact to the sanitary services of persons or families with suicide attempts. This information should be a priority to offer a complete overview of the suicide behavior.

AB Background. Suicides account for a number of deaths that is higher than other traumatic deaths in Spain. Non-fatal suicidal behaviour occurs in a greater proportion than such behaviour with a deadly outcome. There are many causes for this behaviour and it is important to become familiar with them if it is to be prevented. The aim of this article is to describe the characteristics of non-mortal suicidal behaviour in the province of Granada.
   Method. A retrospective descriptive study of the characteristics of non-mortal suicidal behaviour in Granada during the years 2008 and 2009, according to the database of the Provincial 061 Service in Granada. The sample includes the demands made to this service in which the literal reason for the alert included the terms: suicide, self-harm or the threat of suicide. The statistical analysis was done with the SPSS 15.0 program. We analyzed the variable non-mortal suicidal behaviour with respect to the independent variables: sex, age, month, day of the week, time slot, health district, resolution of the demand (assigned priority) and further attempts.
   Results. In total we analyzed 535 demands typified as intentional self-injury by unspecified means. Statistically significant differences were found when comparing the data for the two years with respect to the month chosen, and in the relationship between age range and time slot of the suicide attempts.
   Conclusions. Despite its limitations, the characterization of suicidal behaviour in our province offers essential information, and could be useful in designing and developing a program of psychosocial intervention for the prevention of suicidal behaviour adjusted to the specific profiles of our population.

ID SUICIDE; FEAR
AB Background: The atrocity of 9/11 exemplified 'external' caused civil violent deaths, which have major policy implications for the countries contributing armed forces to the 'Coalition-In-Iraq' [C.I.I]. C.I.I Government's resources for perennial 'internal' violent deaths (suicide, homicide and road), are likely to be threatened by alternative priorities. C.I.I 'internal' deaths are compared with those of 9/11 to provide information to determine relative risks.
   Material/Methods: To uniformly compare mortality between countries we utilise the most recent WHO mortality data, taking the latest three years 1997-1999 and calculating an average annual number and rate of 'internal' deaths in each country, these are compared with the 9/11 fatalities, calculating a proportional ratio, as an indicator of differential damage to families and society.
   Results: USA 'external' deaths were 3,074 people and annual average suicides were 30,966. Total 'internal' deaths exceeded 'external' more than 30 times. Every fortnight there are more USA 'internal' violent deaths than on 9/11. Except Australia and Bulgaria, every country had more suicides than died on 9/11. Apart from Bulgaria, total 'internal' deaths exceeded the 'external' toll in all other CAI countries- by 14 times in Japan; 6 in Republic of Korea, 4 in Italy, 3 in Spain and the UK, twice in Canada and 1.5 times in Australia.
   Conclusions: The extent of 'internal' civil violent deaths, such as suicide, highlight the perennial pressures upon psychiatric services and the need to defend resources at a time of competing priorities.

AB Background: Biological studies suggest that lower serotonergic activity is associated with both greater suicide lethality and impulsive personality traits. These results may lead to the conclusion that impulsivity in the attempt should be associated with greater lethality. However, Klerman's review of epiderniologic suicide studies suggests an inverse relationship between impulsivity and lethality. This seemingly paradoxical relationship between impulsivity and lethality has not been explored in large representative clinical samples of suicide attempts.
   Method. During 1996 to 1998, 478 individuals who attempted suicide were studied in a general hospital in Madrid, Spain. Impulsivity was measured as described in the literature by combining 2 items of Beck's Suicidal Intent Scale (active preparation for attempt and degree of premeditation). Lethality of the attempt was assigned 1 of 4 levels according to the need for medical and/or psychiatric treatment.
   Results: More than half of the attempts were impulsive (55%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 51% to 59%), approximately one fourth of the attempts had an intermediate level of impulsivity (28%; 95% CI, 24% to 3.2%), and approximately one sixth of the attempts were not impulsive (17%,95% CI, 13% to 2 1%). There was an inverse association between the impulsivity and lethality of the suicide attempt chi (2) = 62.639, df = 6, p < .0001). The most impulsive attempts tended to result in less morbidity, while the less impulsive attempts tended to be more lethal.
   Conclusion: If the inverse relationship between impulsivity and lethality is replicated in other large and representative samples, new studies will be needed to clarify the complex interactions between the clinical dimensions (lethality, impulsivity as a state, and impulsivity as a personality trait) and the biological correlates (particularly serotonergic function) of suicidal behavior.

AB Objective: Suicidal behavior is a clinically significant but underestimated cause of mortality in narcissistic personality disorder. Currently, there are no reliable estimates of suicidal behavior for this population. The main objective of this study was to test whether or not suicide attempters diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder are different in terms of impulsivity and expected lethality from suicide attempters with other cluster B personality disorders.
   Method: In a sample of 446 suicide attempters, patients with cluster B personality disorder diagnoses (n = 254) as assessed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), version of the International Personality Disorder Examination-Screening Questionnaire (IPDE-SQ) were compared in terms of expected lethality and impulsivity (measured by the Beck Suicidal Intent Scale and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, respectively). The subjects were admitted to the emergency departments of the Ramon y Cajal Hospital and the Fundacion Jimenez Diaz University Hospital in Madrid, Spain, between January 1999 and January 2003.
   Results: Suicide attempts of subjects diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder had higher expected lethality than those of subjects without narcissistic personality disorder (t = -4.24, df = 439, P < .001). There were no differences in expected lethality of the attempts when comparing subjects with and without histrionic personality disorder (t = 0.28, df = 439, P = .795), antisocial personality disorder (t = 0.66, df = 439, P = .504), and borderline personality disorder (t = 1.13, df = 439, P = .256), respectively. Suicide attempters diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder did not significantly differ from suicide attempters without narcissistic personality disorder in terms of impulsivity measures (t = -0.33, df = 442, P = .738), while suicide attempters diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, and borderline personality disorder were significantly more impulsive than suicide attempters without these diagnoses (t = -3.96, df = 442, P < .001; t = -3.88, df = 442, P < .001; and t = -7.44, df = 442, P < .001, respectively).
   Conclusions: Narcissistic personality disorder seems to be a distinct group among cluster B personality disorders with regard to suicidal behavior. In contrast to suicide attempters with other cluster B personality disorders, suicide attempters diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder are less impulsive and have suicide attempts characterized by higher lethality. These distinctions may offer a basis for targeted therapies aimed at decreasing suicidal risk in patients with narcissistic personality disorder.

AB Background: Little is known about country-specific variations in suicidal ideation (SID) by sex and how they correspond with completed suicide rate. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess variations in SID prevalence rates by sex and its correlation to completed suicide rates across European countries.
   Method: SHARE is a cross-national European survey of individuals over the age of 50 and their spouse of any age. The present study relied on wave 4 conducted in 2010-2012 including 49,008 participants aged 55 to 104 years from 16 countries. SID was evaluated using a single item from the Euro-D. Data on completed suicide rates were taken from the WHO mortality database.
   Results: Of the study population (n = 49,008, 44.3% men, mean age 68.2 +/- 9.1 years), a total of 4139 (8.5%, 95% CI 8.2-8.7) reported suicidal ideation within the last month. The women: men ratio in SID prevalence ranged from 1.30 in Estonia to 2.25 in Spain and Portugal. Regarding country-specific variation, the SID prevalence patterns of both men and women did not correspond to the completed suicide rates for males and females aged 55+ reported by the WHO (2013). Correlations were rather moderate in men (r = 0.45) and especially weak in women (r = 0.16).
   Conclusion: The study showed remarkable differences in SID prevalence by sex. The most exciting finding was that SID rates did not correspond with completed suicide rates in each country under investigation. However, the strength of these patterns substantially differs across countries. This unexpected finding need to be further evaluated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Sentences against psychiatrists dictated in appellate or higher courts of Spain in the period from 1992 to 2007 were analyzed. Decisions were gathered for 13 of the 17 autonomous communities and statistical analysis yielded the following results: in more than 50% of cases, the decision was unfavorable for the psychiatrist, but the damages never exceeded (sic) 600,000. The most frequent condition in the series was personality disorders (48.9%). The most frequent reasons for seeking legal redress were monitoring errors and negligence; no cases were brought to trial for therapeutic errors. The patient died in 58.3% of cases. It is noteworthy that 10% of the sentences cited defects in patient information or informed consent.

AB Background The evidence on mortality patterns by education in Spain comes from regional areas. This study aimed to estimate these patterns in the whole Spanish population.
   Methods All citizens aged 25 years and over and residing in Spain in 2001 were followed during 7 years to determine their vital status, resulting in a total of 196 470 401 person-years and 2 379 558 deaths. We estimated the age-adjusted total and cause-specific mortality by educational level-primary, lower secondary, upper secondary and university education-and then calculated the relative and absolute measures of inequality in mortality and contribution of the leading causes of death to absolute inequalities.
   Results Except for some cancer sites, the mortality rate for the leading causes of death shows an inverse gradient with educational level. The leading causes of death with the highest relative index of inequality ratios were HIV disease (9.81 in women and 11.61 in men), diabetes in women (4.02) and suicide in men (3.52). The leading causes of death that contribute most to the absolute inequality in mortality are cardiovascular diseases (48.8%), respiratory diseases (9.3%) and diabetes mellitus (8.8%) in women, and cardiovascular diseases (20.8%), respiratory diseases (19.8%) and cancer (19.6%) in men.
   Conclusions Although the causes of death with the strongest gradient in mortality rate are HIV disease in both sexes, diabetes mellitus in women and suicide in men, most of the absolute education-related inequalities in total mortality are due to cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases and diabetes mellitus in women and to cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases and cancer in men.

AB Although suicide ranks as the third leading cause of death in young people aged 10-29 years, Spain lacks a specific prevention guide for this population, and research in our country is very scarce. In order to propose a basis for the development of a prevention model, the present systematic review was conducted. Using the databases of PsycINFO, PsycArticles, MEDLINE, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection and Web of Science, 38 trials were identified. These studies show promising outcomes from Problem Solving Therapy and family therapies as indicated and selected interventions. For universal interventions, the best results are those that impact on the development of social and coping skills. Studies on gatekeeper training yield contradictory data. More research is demanded.

AB The rapidly-acting antidepressant properties of ketamine are a trend topic in psychiatry. Despite its robust effects, these are ephemeral and can lead to certain adverse events. For this reason, there is still a general concern around the off-label use of ketamine in clinical practice settings. Nonetheless, for refractory depression, it should be an indication to consider. We report the case of a female patient admitted for several months due to a treatment-resistant depressive bipolar episode with chronic suicidal behaviour. After repeated intravenous ketamine infusions without remarkable side effects, the patient experienced a complete clinical recovery during the 4 weeks following hospital discharge. Unfortunately, depressive symptoms reappeared in the 5th week, and the patient was finally readmitted to hospital as a result of a suicide attempt.

AB Objective: To create and validate a questionnaire about knowledge and attitudes of the general population in Madrid (Spain) about life's end stage.
   Method: A descriptive study designed as a structured self-administered questionnaire, validated by seven Madrid Health Service professional experts and assessed through a pilot study.
   Results: The questionnaire consisted of 42 questions, divided into six modules: 1) decisions and psychological-physical care at life's end; 2) palliative care; 3) euthanasia and assisted suicide; 4) advance directives document; 5) spiritual factors; and 6) socio-demographic data.
   Conclusions: The questionnaire was a useful, indirect method to ascertain the opinion of life's end in the Autonomous Region of Madrid. If it were applied in primary health care and hospital care, comparisons could be made among users in different autonomous regions of Spain. (C) 2017 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

AB Objective: To develop a brief and reliable psychometric scale to identify individuals at risk for suicidal behaviour.
   Method: Design: Case-control study. Sample and setting: 182 individuals (61 suicide attempters, 57 psychiatric controls, and 64 psychiatrically healthy controls) aged 18 or older, admitted to the Emergency Department at Puerta de Hierro University Hospital in Madrid, Spain.
   Measures: All participants completed a form including their socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, and the Personality and Life Events scale (27 items). To assess Axis I diagnoses, all psychiatric patients (including suicide attempters) were administered the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Statistical analysis: Descriptive statistics were computed for the socio-demographic factors. Additionally, chi(2) independence tests were applied to evaluate differences in socio-demographic and clinical variables, and the Personality and Life Events scale between groups. A stepwise linear regression with backward variable selection was conducted to build the Short Personality Life Event (S-PLE) scale. In order to evaluate the accuracy, a ROC analysis was conducted. The internal reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha, and the external reliability was evaluated using a test-retest procedure.
   Results: The S-PLE scale, composed of just 6 items, showed good performance in discriminating between medical controls, psychiatric controls and suicide attempters in an independent sample. For instance, the S-PLE scale discriminated between past suicide and past non-suicide attempters with sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 75%. The area under the ROC curve was 88%. A factor analysis extracted only one factor, revealing a single dimension of the S-PLE scale. Furthermore, the S-PLE scale provides values of internal and external reliability between poor (test-retest: 0.55) and acceptable (Cronbach's a: 0.65) ranges. Administration time is about one minute.
   Conclusions: The S-PLE scale is a useful and accurate instrument for estimating the risk of suicidal behaviour in settings where the time is scarce. (C) 2015 SEP y SEPB. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

TI How can one explain changes in the monthly pattern of suicide?
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article

ID UNITED-STATES; CYCLES
AB The monthly pattern of suicides has remained a puzzle ever since it was discovered in the second half of the 19th century. In this paper we intend to "explain" not the pattern itself but rather its changes across countries and in the course of time.
   First, we show that the fairly common idea according to which this pattern is decaying in "modern" societies is not altogether true. For instance, around 2000, in well urbanized countries like South Korea or Spain this pattern was still as strong as it was in France (and other European countries) in the late 19th century.
   The method that we use in order to make some progress in our understanding is the time-honored Cartesian approach of breaking up the problem under consideration "into as many parts as might be necessary to solve it". More specifically, we try two separations of monthly suicides into simpler components: (i) according to suicide methods and (ii) according to age-groups. These separations rely on the introduction of what we call "elementary monthly profiles".
   The first separation points out the key-role of hanging and drowning. The second shows the crucial role of the 15-20 and 65+ age-groups.
   Then, we present a number of cases in which age-group decomposition provides adequate predictions. It turns out that the cases in which the predictions do not work are newly urbanized countries. The discrepancies may be due to a memory effect which induces a time-lag extending over one or two generations.
   Finally, in the light of the new results presented in the present paper, we re-examine the theory proposed by Emile Durkheim. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by chorea, dystonia, behavioral disturbances and cognitive decline. The aim of this study is to assess temporal and spatial changes on mortality attributable to HD over 30 years in Spain. Methods: HD data were extracted from the nationwide mortality registry for the period 1984-2013. Annual and 5-year gender-and age-specific rates adjusted for the standard European population were calculated. Geographic analysis was performed by districts from 1999 through 2013, and then estimated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and smoothed SMRs. Results: There were 1,556 HD-related deaths across the study period. An increasing trend in age-adjusted HD mortality was in evidence, specifically from 1994 through 1998. On a year-by-year basis, age-adjusted mortality rates increased from 0.076 per 100,000 population in 1984 to 0.157 in 2013. Geographical differences among districts were evident in specific areas and in the southwest of Spain with a significantly higher HD mortality risk. Conclusion: HD mortality rising trends in Spain might be attributable to improvements in diagnosis leading to a rise in prevalence. Geographical variability in HD mortality could be related to regional differences in disease prevalence, health-care disparities, or other factors which call for in-depth assessment in future studies.

AB The present study reports the multistage development and evaluation of a Spanish translation of the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ). The INQ measures the constructs of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, which the interpersonal theory of suicide proposes are proximal causes of suicidal desire. Participants were bilingual Hispanic college students in the United States (n = 56), heritage Spanish-speaking college students in the United States (n = 281), college students in Spain (n = 1,016), psychiatric inpatients in Mexico (n = 181), college students in Mexico (n = 239), and Spanish-speaking U.S. adults (n = 104). Results indicated that a 9-item 2-factor solution (INQ-S-9) provided good fit. Multiple group analyses were also consistent with measurement invariance across nationalities and clinical severity. Finally, both subscale scores demonstrated good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent validity, and concurrent associations with scores on measures of suicide ideation. Cultural considerations and implications for use in clinical and research settings are discussed.
   Public Significance Statement
   The present study provides a 9-item Spanish-language version of the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire to promote research on perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness-two robust suicide risk factors-among Hispanic populations. The study details the translation process as well as the factor structure, measurement invariance, reliability, construct validity, and criterion validity of the measure.

AB Bullying is a kind of violence that occurs in some schools. National newspapers, following the suicide of a teenager in 2004 due to the attacks he suffered in the secondary school, have reported and denounced this type of harassment. The treatment by news has shied away from any hint of frivolousness to deepen the gravity of the matter. This has created a social awareness that has helped to detect attacks. If we analyze the news, they reveal that these news have created a social alarm in this regard.

AB Objective: To assess the attitudes and knowledge in the life's end about palliative care, advance directives, psychological-physical care, medically assisted suicide and spiritual accompaniment.
   Method: A cross-sectional study performed in the population at primary health care center of the Autonomous Region of Madrid (Spain). It participated 425 selected people that a simple random was applied in the consultation sheets of health professionals. They analyzed 42 variables of self-administered questionnaire.
   Results: The surveyed population of Madrid displayed the following characteristics: university studies 58%, 51-70 years 47%, married 60%, and women 61%. 91% would like to decide about their care at life's end. 58% of respondents are aware of palliative care and 53% would request spiritual accompaniment. They know advance directives (50%) but have not made the document. 54% are in favor of legalizing the euthanasia and 42% the assisted suicide.
   Conclusion: Madrid's people state they would like to decide what care they will receive at life's end and request spiritual accompaniment. Outstanding advocates of euthanasia against assisted suicide. They would like to receive palliative care and complete advance directives documents. To draw comparisons within the population, thereby increasing awareness about social health care resources in Autonomous Region of Madrid, surveys should be conducted in different primary health care centers areas of Madrid.

AB Death registers are a tool for planning public health care interventions, but data on deaths due to acute poisoning are scarce in Spain. We report a descriptive study based on a cross-section of patients who died from acute poisoning in 2012 in 8 Spanish public hospitals and whose deaths were recorded in the EXITOX register. Of the 14 registered cases, 7 (50%) were suicides; 71% were men, and the mean age was 59.1 years. Caustic substances comprised the largest category (35.7%) of toxic agents, followed by medications (21.4%), and street drugs (21.4%). The mortality rate was 0.5 deaths/100 000 inhabitants. Specific antidotes were used in 28.6% of the cases. In 71%, there was a clear relationship between death and acute poisoning. The EXITOX register, even with its limitations, seems to provide an appropriate tool for understanding mortality due to acute intoxication in Spain.

AB Evidence from a range of sources demonstrates that end-of-life (EoL) care practices and preferences vary across countries; culture is consistently one of the main explanations given for this. In order to understand how cultural factors are used. to explain similarities and differences in EoL care between Spain, Italy and Portugal, database and hand searches were performed and cross-cutting core themes identified. Similarities included higher proportions of people who wished to die at home than actually died at home, a persistent trend for partial disclosure in Italy and Spain, low use of advance directives, and low incidence of all medical EoL decisions (with the exception of terminal sedation) compared to northern European countries. The role of religion and the importance of family ties were the two main cultural factors used to explain the similarities. Further research is needed in order to interpret the important differences that were also found. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Increasing Incidence of Admissions to a General Hospital for Deliberate
   Self-harm in Trinidad
SO WEST INDIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID ATTEMPTED-SUICIDE; DIFFICULTIES; WOMEN
AB Background: Deliberate self-harm and suicidal behaviour have become an increasingly common form of morbidity in the developing world Suicidal behaviour is a major public health problem in Trinidad as the country has the second highest completed suicide rate in the English-speaking Caribbean The objectives of this study were to determine the epidemiology of attempted suicide and self-harm at a specified site (the Port-of-Spain General Hospital) and compare it to previous studies done at the same site.
   Subjects and Methods: This was investigated through a review of one years' admissions to the Port-of-Spain General Hospital for suicidal behaviour. Incidence was compared with a previous study completed at this site and reported in 1974. Comparison of the demographic characteristics of the sample with that of the previous study was also undertaken using chi-square analysis and significance testing through the use of t tests.
   Results: A total of 368 referrals were made for attempted suicide or deliberate self-harm over the period indicating a fourfold increase in the incidence of this behaviour with a greater increase among males where the female to male ratio has declined from 4 to 1 to 2 to 1, p < 0. 001; the mean age of males was 34 years compared to females 22 (p < 0. 0001). The males were more likely to use violent means compared to females who were more likely to ingest tablets or bleach. Relationship difficulties were most commonly cited by both males and females as the reason for their attempt. There was a trend to greater propensity for this behaviour among Indo-Trinidadians as compared to Afro-Trinidadians in both females and males.
   Conclusions: Increasing numbers of men are engaging in self-harm behaviour and are using more violent and physically harmful methods suggesting a greater degree of suicidal risk while women mainly engage in acts of ingestion with a much lower risk of death. The older mean age of these men suggests that their problems are presenting in middle adulthood while women are engaging in this behaviour in young adulthood Suicidal behaviour or deliberate self-harm is a major public health problem in Trinidad

AB Background The screening of digital footprint for clinical purposes relies on the capacity of wearable technologies to collect data and extract relevant information's for patient management. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques allow processing of real-time observational information and continuously learning from data to build understanding. We designed a system able to get clinical sense from digital footprints based on the smartphone's native sensors and advanced machine learning and signal processing techniques in order to identify suicide risk. Method/design The Smartcrisis study is a cross-national comparative study. The study goal is to determine the relationship between suicide risk and changes in sleep quality and disturbed appetite. Outpatients from the Hospital Fundacion Jimenez Diaz Psychiatry Department (Madrid, Spain) and the University Hospital of Nimes (France) will be proposed to participate to the study. Two smartphone applications and a wearable armband will be used to capture the data. In the intervention group, a smartphone application (MEmind) will allow for the ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data capture related with sleep, appetite and suicide ideations. Discussion Some concerns regarding data security might be raised. Our system complies with the highest level of security regarding patients' data. Several important ethical considerations related to EMA method must also be considered. EMA methods entails a non-negligible time commitment on behalf of the participants. EMA rely on daily, or sometimes more frequent, Smartphone notifications. Furthermore, recording participants' daily experiences in a continuous manner is an integral part of EMA. This approach may be significantly more than asking a participant to complete a retrospective questionnaire but also more accurate in terms of symptoms monitoring. Overall, we believe that Smartcrises could participate to a paradigm shift from the traditional identification of risks factors to personalized prevention strategies tailored to characteristics for each patient.

AB Completed suicide (CS) is a leading cause of death worldwide and its rates are available for most developed countries. On the other hand, attempted suicide (AS) is a risk factor for CS but there are limited data on its rates in various countries. In constructing a ratio for AS/CS rates, most would agree that for CS, the denominator should be the annual suicide rate ( per 100 000). As for the ratio's numerator (AS) per 100 000, there are three possible calculations: (1) annual prevalence from population surveys, (2) annual prevalence from national clinical registers or (3) lifetime prevalence from population surveys. We think that the first possibility would probably be the best choice but, unfortunately, surveys providing the annual prevalence of AS are lacking for most countries. Annual prevalence from national registers is also lacking for most countries and is contaminated by under-reporting. Therefore, in this editorial, we are left with only the last option, a ratio for lifetime prevalence of AS (per 100 000) divided by annual rate of CS (per 100 000). This ratio for AS/CS rates appears to differ substantially across countries worldwide but presents no big regional differences other than two remarkable exceptions, one per continent. In Europe, Spain and France had greater ratios (174.4 and 152.5, respectively) than Italy (64.1). In Asia/Pacific, New Zealand has a higher ratio (345.9) compared with China (75.8) and Japan (76.9). The ratio for AS/CS rates could be a good index for implementing evidence-informed decision-making regarding suicidal behaviour (SB) among health service managers, and for helping them in the allocation of health resources for the prevention of SB.

AB Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and Suicide Bombing have become the headline news for every other day. It is a growing global phenomenon that is happening from Iraq to Afghanistan, Syria to United Kingdom and Spain to Pakistan. An average US soldier in Iraq receives 6 to 23 blast wave shocks over his/her tenure in Iraq. Pakistan has witnessed 120 suicide bombing attacks in last six years. While various attempts have been made to assess the impact of blast overpressure on buildings and animals, little has been done on crowd formation, crowd density and underlying geometry to mitigate the effects. This paper is set to make geometrical recommendations to reduce the casualties in case of such an incident for high value targets, like mosques and army facilities in the frontline countries fighting the global war on terrorism. A virtual simulation tool has been developed which is capable of assessing the impact of crowd formation patterns and their densities on the magnitude of injury and number of casualties during a suicide bombing attack. Results indicated that the worst crowd formation is street (Zig-Zag) where 30% crowd can be dead and 45% can be injured, given typical explosive carrying capacity of a single suicide bomber. Row wise crowd formations was found to be the best for reducing the effectiveness of an attack with 18% crowd in lethal zone and 38% in injury zones. For a typical suicide bombing attack, we can reduce the number of fatalities by 12%, and the number of injuries by 7%. Simulation results were compared and validated by the real-life incidents and found to he in good agreement. Line-of-sight with the attacker, rushing towards the exit, and stampede were found to be the most lethal choices both during and after the attack. These findings, although preliminary, may have implications for emergency response and counter terrorism.

ID SUICIDE
AB Background This paper reports the findings of an analytical comparison of several macro indicators collected routinely from institutional sources in Europe. Methods We carried out a review of macro indicators capable of providing a synthetic description of mental health status and the availability of psychiatric care in European countries. These were collected routinely from sources such as WHO, OECD, EUROSTAT, and IMS. The evaluation of temporal trends in each nation permits subsequent comparisons between countries. Results In all European countries, a decreased trend of suicides was observed in the period 1980 - 2000, with the exception of Ireland and ( partially) of Spain. In Ireland, the increased trend was particularly strong, with a high risk in young and adult males. Portugal and Greece had respectively the highest and the lowest rates of undetermined causes of death. Most countries that were high consumers of alcohol in the initial period of observation had a rate above the national mean until 1980, after which consumption decreased. Most nations that were low consumers in 1960 had rates below the mean until 1980, when the rates progressively increased. However, a general decrease of alcohol-related deaths was apparent in all countries. Mortality associated with mental disorder increased, most clearly during the mid 1980s. The number of psychiatrists per 100,000 inhabitants ranged from 3.6 in Spain to 17.5 in Finland; of child psychiatrists, from 0.9 in Germany to 5.1 in Portugal. Psychiatric beds ranged from 0.4 per 1,000 inhabitants in Italy and Spain to 1.3 in Ireland. Nine countries showed a trend towards a reduction in psychiatric beds, whilst in a further five countries no change was observed. Rates of long-stay patients varied from 9.5 in the UK to 84 in Belgium, with a generally decreasing trend. The use of outpatient facilities differed markedly between countries, although there was a general increase over time. Official data were scarce in relation to the sale of psychotropic drugs. IMS data indicated increasing consumption in all European countries for antidepressant and antipsychotic medication. Conclusions The official data resources available for European countries seem to indicate some discrepancies, probably relating to methods of recording. Better co-ordination in the collection of data about mental health status in the European Union and an improvement of the quality in available services is needed.

AB Substance and Internet use or abuse, psychopathology and suicidal ideation appear to be related. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between use of psychotropic substances, inadequate Internet use, suicidal ideation and other psychopathological symptoms within the adolescent population. The present study was carried out as part of the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project, funded by the European Union. The sample is composed of 1026 adolescents aged between 14 and 16 years from 12 state schools in Asturias (530 men and 496 women). This study adds to the possibility of knowing whether the SEYLE data is confirmed in a relatively isolated and recession hit province of Spain.
   In the present study the following consumption rates were obtained: a) alcohol 11.89% in males and 7.86% in females; b) tobacco: 4.15% and 5.44 % in males and females respectively; c) other drugs: 6.98% in males and 4.44% in females; d) maladaptive or pathological Internet use: 14.53% and 20.77% in males and females respectively.
   The variables that predict suicide ideation in the logistic regression model were: previous suicide attempts, depression, maladaptive or pathological Internet use, peer problems and alcohol consumption.

AB The experience of the Netherlands in relation with the legalization and practice of euthanasia is better known in Spain than the Belgian experience in this matter. But the historical process of social debate in Belgium has many specific details which should be known by Spanish healthcare professionals, bioethicists, politicians and lawyers. This paper begins with a comparative analysis of both countries: Spain and Belgium and follows with a description of the milestones of the historical process of debating and, finally, passing the Belgian Law on Euthanasia in 2002. The next chapter consists of a description of the main contents of this important Law. The paper continues then with an approach to the epidemiology of the practice of euthanasia in Belgium and finishes with a description of the different positions of the actors of the process. Two positions are described more in depth: the opinion of the specialists in palliative care, and the opinion of the Catholic Church. The paper ends underlining the reason for the incorporation of the Belgian experience on euthanasia to the debate about the possibility of legalizing euthanasia in Spain.

DE Democratisation; Spain; elites; coordination; parliament
AB In the literature on democratisation, the Spanish case has a paradigmatic status, especially for the negotiations between the regime and the opposition. While these negotiations did stabilise the new regime, the transition was driven by the regime's elites. The key event was the approval of the Law for Political Reform in November 1976, when the legislature voted its own demise. The change was done according to the rules of the system. To explain this reform, we offer a formal model of coordination and a statistical analysis of an original dataset of the 531 legislators. The reform was possible because of elites' belief coordination.

AB Centring on Fernando Leon de Aranoa's Politica, manual de instrucciones, this article examines what Antonio Gramsci has called the 'crisis of authority' in the context of (post-)crisis Spain. I claim that Leon de Aranoa's documentary feature not only registers the emergence of Podemos as a nascent political party, but also attempts to legitimize Podemos as the only viable parliamentary alternative to the hegemony of the Partido Popular (PP) and the Partido Socialista Obrero Espanol (PSOE).

AB The main objective of this descriptive, cross-sectional study, conducted with a sample of 597 university students from Spain, is to describe students' levels of resilience and analyze how they relate to gender and religious tendency. The main instrument used was the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). The results show that male students exhibit higher scores in optimism and adapting to stressful situations, whereas females are more spiritual. It was also noted that Christians and atheists/agnostics obtained higher scores, on average, in defying action-oriented behavior, whereas Muslims scored more highly in spirituality.

LA English
DT Article
ID MENTAL-HEALTH-CARE; EUROPE
AB The 1986 General Health Act and the so-called 'psychiatric reform' were key issues in the development of the mental healthcare system (MHCS) in Spain. The World Health Organization Declaration and Action Plan on Mental Health in 2005 gave it a revitalizing impetus and resulted in the first National Health System (NHS) Mental Health Strategy in 2006. A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, Spanish journals, reference lists, national databases, and European and Spanish official documents to describe the current state of the MHCS in Spain.
   The main results were: (1) existence of great variability among the autonomous communities with respect to mental health resources and provision of care; (2) lack of national epidemiological information on mental disorders with the exception of substance use disorders and suicide, which comprise powerful longitudinal national data, (3) training in psychiatry is well established, although there is no specialism of child and adolescent psychiatry, and (4) a dramatic increase in scientific productivity in the last decade among research groups, in part due to the creation of the Spanish Mental Health Network, the Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red en el Area de Salud Mental (CIBERSAM).
   Quantifiable and reliable indicators are needed to provide efficient monitoring and analysis of epidemiological events and subsequently to understand the status of the Spanish MHCS.

AB Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death among young people. While suicide prevention is considered a research and intervention priority, longitudinal data is needed to identify risk and protective factors associate with suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Here we describe the UNIVERSAL (University and Mental Health) project which aims are to: (1) test prevalence and 36-month incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors; and (2) identify relevant risk and protective factors associated with the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among university students in Spain.
   Methods: An ongoing multicenter, observational, prospective cohort study of first year university students in 5 Spanish universities. Students will be assessed annually during a 36 month follow-up. The surveys will be administered through an online, secure web-based platform. A clinical reappraisal will be completed among a subsample of respondents. Suicidal thoughts and behaviors will be assess with the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI) and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Risk and protective factors will include: mental disorders, measured with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview version 3.0 (CIDI 3.0) and Screening Scales (CIDI-SC), and the Epi-Q Screening Survey (EPI-Q-SS), socio-demographic variables, self-perceived health status, health behaviors, well-being, substance use disorders, service use and treatment. The UNIVERSAL project is part of the International College Surveys initiative, which is a core project within the World Mental Health consortium. Lifetime and the 12-month prevalence will be calculated for suicide ideation, plans and attempts. Cumulative incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and mental disorders will be measured using the actuarial method. Risk and protective factors of suicidal thoughts and behaviors will be analyzed by Cox proportional hazard models.
   Discussion: The study will provide valid, innovative and useful data for developing prevention programs for youth suicide and for improving early identification for high-risk students. The longitudinal design of this study will improve causal interpretation of analyzed associations, needed for generating and validating predictive models. It will represent the first results about suicidal thoughts and behaviors in the Spanish university population. The World Mental Health Survey collaboration will permit accurate cross-national comparisons.

AB The social and economic development of a country is based on the study of the health level of its population that is directly or indirectly affected by many factors associated with 'health indicators'. From the analysis of the health status of Greece and Spain before and after the economic crisis, the health level of the Greek population is generally good, and the health level of the Spanish population does not seem to be affected by the crisis. On the contrary, the economic crisis in Greece and Spain seems to affect indicators that concern: the incidence of HIV and the birth rate of live offspring weighing less than 2500 grams. In addition, indicators in Greece are also affected: deaths from attacks, suicides and deliberate self-injuries. Finally, the per capita total health expenditure is worse in Greece than in Spain. It is important to note that the national and international statistical data used and elaborated in this article do not exceed 2014, which does not reflect the most recent state of health of the two countries. It is estimated that the data is relatively small for a safer estimate and the effects of the crisis will be better for longer. However, it is estimated that the reduction in per capita health expenditures as well as protracted unemployment and its consequences are highlighted in important issues.

AB Current methodologies employed in collecting data for suicide research present several limitations. In this article, we describe a novel method and tool to prospectively study suicidal behavior and its related risk and protective factors in different countries. This tool is a web-based database, which will initially be developed and piloted by suicide research groups from Austria, Brazil, Chile, France, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, and the US. The database will develop and integrate research tools key to collaboration, permit exploration of ethical considerations, and provide a universal interface in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, and German that will make it possible to incorporate new groups from different countries to the network. The common database resulting of this cross-national effort will allow researchers to share and compare data across countries in a large sample of patients. Using anonymous electronic records of patients, we will: 1) determine the impact of risk and protective factors (viz. aggression and religious affiliation) in different socio-cultural environments; 2) develop a clinical model of suicidal behavior that integrates the multiple dimensions implicated; 3) try differentiating the effects of biological, environmental, and cultural factors on suicidal behavior, and 4) offer the global psychiatric research community a tool that will standardize assessment across nations, allowing for better generalization.

AB The views of French, Portuguese, and Spanish people on end-of-life decisions were compared. Two hundred seventy-seven adults from Barcelona, Oporto, and Toulouse judged the acceptability of life-ending procedures in 42 scenarios composed of all combinations of 3 factors: the patient's age (30 or 80 years), the patient's life expectancy (days, weeks, or months), and the type of procedure (suicide, suicide assisted by the physician, euthanasia by the physician at the request of a suffering patient, euthanasia of a comatose patient at the family's request, euthanasia of a comatose patient as stipulated in the patient's advance directives, euthanasia of a comatose patient without advance directions and without a request from the family, or euthanasia of a suffering patient without a request from the patient). In all 3 countries, the type of procedure had the major effect. The 4 procedures implemented by the patient or at the patient's request were, on average, considered acceptable. The 2 procedures not implemented at the patient's request were considered unacceptable. Euthanasia of a comatose patient at the request of the family was judged mildly acceptable. The attitudes of the people in Toulouse, Oporto, and Barcelona concerning the acceptability of ending a patient's life have now largely converged, although Spanish participants were statistically significantly more accepting than French and Portuguese participants.

AB Background. Depression is one of the main causes of disability worldwide. The aim of this study was to determine the opinions of the Spanish population regarding this disease, its relation to suicide, its symptoms, the people who suffer from it, its causes, the professionals who treat it and antidepressant medication
   Methods. A questionnaire designed by experts was administered by phone to a representative sample of 1,700 people aged 18 and over in all Spanish autonomous communities using multistage sampling procedure, stratified by clusters, with a random selection of municipalities and population by sex, age and economic activity in a representative way at a national level.
   Results. Eighteen percent of the people surveyed said they had depression or had suffered from it previously, 86% thought of it is a disease and 85% considered it to be a cause of suicide. The most well-known symptoms (> 95%) were sadness and apathy. The people surveyed expressed certain stigmatizing attitudes towards people who suffer from it (60% unstability and 49% weakness). Most stated that the causes of this disease are of external origin (95% due to adverse life events), thought that a psychologist is a more appropriate health specialist for treating depression than a psychiatrist (47 vs. 29%) and that antidepressant medication generates dependency (72%) despite being effective (62%); 67% of depressed patients reported taking it.
   Conclusions. It is suggested that the relevant health administrations should conduct campaigns aimed at informing the public about the true nature of depression, to reduce stigmatizing attitudes and to clarify the efficacy and possible adverse effects of antidepressant medication.

AB OBJECTIVE
   To systematically identify, critically appraise, and synthesise empirical studies about the impact of the 2008 financial crisis in Europe on health outcomes.
   Design
   Systematic literature review.
   Data sources
   Structural searches of key databases, healthcare journals, and organisation based websites.
   Review methods
   Empirical studies reporting on the impact of the financial crisis on health outcomes in Europe, published from January 2008 to December 2015, were included. All selected studies were assessed for risk of bias. Owing to the heterogeneity of studies in terms of study design and analysis and the use of overlapping datasets across studies, studies were analysed thematically per outcome, and the evidence was synthesised on different health outcomes without formal meta-analysis.
   Results
   41 studies met the inclusion criteria, and focused on suicide, mental health, self rated health, mortality, and other health outcomes. Of those studies, 30 (73%) were deemed to be at high risk of bias, nine (22%) at moderate risk of bias, and only two (5%) at low risk of bias, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn. Although there were differences across countries and groups, there was some indication that suicides increased and mental health deteriorated during the crisis. The crisis did not seem to reverse the trend of decreasing overall mortality. Evidence on self rated health and other indicators was mixed.
   Conclusions
   Most published studies on the impact of financial crisis on health in Europe had a substantial risk of bias; therefore, results need to be cautiously interpreted. Overall, the financial crisis in Europe seemed to have had heterogeneous effects on health outcomes, with the evidence being most consistent for suicides and mental health. There is a need for better empirical studies, especially those focused on identifying mechanisms that can mitigate the adverse effects of the crisis.

SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS

DT Article
DE health; inequality; mortality; homicide; suicide
ID INCOME INEQUALITY; POPULATION HEALTH; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; DETERMINANT;
   TRENDS
AB We investigate whether changes in economic inequality affect mortality in rich countries. To answer this question we use a new source of data on income inequality: tax data on the share of pretax income going to the richest 10% of the population in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US between 1903 and 2003. Although this measure is not a good proxy for inequality within the bottom half of the income distribution, it is a good proxy for changes in the top half of the distribution and for the Gini coefficient. In the absence of country and year fixed effects, the income share of the top decile is negatively related to life expectancy and positively related to infant mortality. However, in our preferred fixed-effects specification these relationships are weak, statistically insignificant, and likely to change their sign. Nor do our data suggest that changes in the income share of the richest 10% affect homicide or suicide rates. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a study conducted on 709 Latin American undergraduates from four countries with different development levels (Nicaragua, El Salvador, Chile and Spain). The intention of this paper is to value the differences in the number and characteristics of stressful life events (SLE) suffered by the participants. Another purpose is to confirm the relation between SLE and suicidal conduct in Spanish cultural contexts, through the study of a multicultural sample of Spanish-speaking university students, and finally, to isolate the SLE that allow predicting a later suicidal conduct to a greatest extent. The information was collected by means of a self-applied questionnaire. The results indicate a greater presence of SLE among those who live in countries with lower development levels and among those who have attempted committing suicide. It is observed that the fact of having suffered certain SLE physical or sexual mistreatment, excessive alcohol or drug consumption and having left home during childhood or adolescence aid in the prediction of later suicidal conducts in the studied samples.

The clinical and biographical data of the case are presented in the first part of the work. The paper goes on to explain the decisions of the two committees that evaluated her request, that is the Regional Ethics Committee and the Consultative Council of Andalusia. Finally, the outcome of the case is presented. The second part analyzes the background of the debate on end-of-life decision making in Spain in cases such as those of Ramon Sampedro, Jorge Leon or Madeleine Z. It then presents four different settings of end-of-life decision making that have been clarified over these last years: euthanasia and assisted suicide, limitation of life-prolonging treatment, treatment refusal and palliative sedation. The article concludes that the latter three can be considered as sufficiently clarified after the case of Inmaculada Echevarria. However, the first one, that is euthanasia and assisted suicide, must be confronted by the Spanish society in forthcoming years.

AB Background. Internalized stigma has negative consequences on subjective and objective aspects of the recovery in people diagnosed with mental disorders. Despite its relevance, it has been poorly studied in patients with schizophrenia.
   Methods. A sample of 71 outpatients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia who attended Psychosocial Rehabilitation Centers of Gran Canaria, Spain, were evaluated. We assessed the prevalence of internalized stigma and its possible association with sociodemographic, clinical, psychological and psychopathological variables, as well as suicidal behaviour and suicidal ideation.
   Results. 21.1% of the patients had internalized stigma. Internalized stigma was associated with higher prevalence of suicidal ideation during the last year, higher number of suicide attempts, higher current suicidal risk, worse self-compassion, higher self-esteem, higher scores on depression, higher prevalence of depression and higher hopelessness. After multivariate analysis, hopelessness and the existence of depression were independently associated with internalized stigma, although depression showed trend towards significance.
   Conclusions. The association between internalized stigma and higher hopelessness, depression and higher suicidal risk suggests the necessity to systematically assess internalized stigma in patients with schizophrenia, and to intervene to reduce it.

AB This study aims to provide data regarding the association between reported degree of victimization and suicidal phenomena, with special emphasis on gender differences. There were 923 adolescents recruited from eight secondary schools in Catalonia, Spain. The Youth Self-Report (YSR) and the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire (JVQ) were used to assess suicidal phenomena and victimization, respectively.
   Participants were divided into three groups (nonvictim, victim, and polyvictim groups) according to the total number of different kinds of victimization reported. Results showed that the polyvictim group reported significantly more suicidal phenomena than did the victim and nonvictim groups in both boys and girls. Furthermore, although no gender differences in reported suicidal phenomena were found in the nonvictim group, girls reported significantly more suicidal phenomena in both the victim and the polyvictim groups.
   In conclusion, the results suggest that victimization may play an important role in generating gender differences with respect to reported suicidal phenomena. In addition, this study highlights the importance of taking into account the whole range of victimizations suffered by adolescents when seeking to design suicide prevention and intervention policies.

   UNEMPLOYMENT; AIDS; DEATH; IMPACT; SPAIN; STATISTICS
AB Objective-In recent decades, in most European countries young adult mortality has risen, or at best has remained stable. The aim of this study was to describe trends in mortality attributable to the principal causes of death: AIDS, drug overdose, suicide and motor vehicle traffic accidents, among adults aged between 15 and 34 years in three European cities (Barcelona, Bologna and Munich), over the period 1986 to 1995.
   Methods-The population studied consisted of all deaths that occurred between 1986 and 1995 among residents of Barcelona, Bologna and Munich aged from 15 to 34 years. Information about deaths was obtained from mortality registers. The study variables were sex, age, the underlying cause of death and year of death. Causes of death studied were: drug overdose, AIDS, suicide and motor vehicle traffic accidents. Age standardised mortality rates (direct adjustment) were obtained in all three cities for the age range 15-34. To investigate trends in mortality over the study period Poisson regression models were fitted, obtaining the average relative risk (RR) associated with a one year increment.
   Results-Young adult mortality increased among men in Barcelona and Bologna (RR per year: 1.04, 95% confidence intervals (95%CI): 1.03, 1.06 in Barcelona and RR:1.03, 95%CI:1.01, 1.06 in Bologna) and among women in Barcelona (RR:1.02, 95%CI: 1.01, 1.04), with a change in the pattern of the main causes of death attributable to the increase in AIDS and drug overdose mortality. In Munich, the pattern did not change as much, suicides being the main cause of death during the 10 years studied, although they have been decreasing since 1988 (RR:0.92, 95%CI:0.88, 0.96 for men and 0.81, 95%CI: 0.75-0.87 for women).
   Conclusion The increase in AIDS mortality observed in the three European cities in the mid-80s and mid-90s has yielded to substantial changes in the pattern of the main causes of death at young ages in Barcelona and Bologna. Munich presented a more stable pattern, with suicide as the main cause of death.

ID EXTREMISM
AB This article suggests a rational explanation for extreme voluntary sacrifice in situations in which the state of the world when the decision must be made is observable only by the agent. Such explanation is the cult of martyrs, heroes, and saints. This cult may get out of control and fuel fanaticism, or excessive sacrifice from the standpoint of the sponsoring organization. A survey of the historical evidence of Christian martyrdom strongly suggests that martyrs were driven by the expectation of a cult in this world, not by otherworldly rewards. In particular, it is argued that the evidence of excess martyrdom in both Muslim Spain and the Roman Empire strongly speaks for the cult theory.

AB Introduction: Suicide is a major public health problem worldwide, and an approach is necessary due to its high potential for prevention. This paper examines the main characteristics of people admitted to hospitals in the Community of Madrid (Spain) with suicidal behaviour, and the factors associated with their hospital mortality.
   Material and methods: A study was conducted on patients with E950-E959 codes of suicide and self-inflicted injuries of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, contained in any diagnostic field of the minimum basic data set at hospital discharge between 2003 and 2013. Sociodemographic, clinical and health care variables were assessed by uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis in the evaluation of factors associated with hospital mortality.
   Results: Hospital suicidal behaviour predominates in women (58.7%) and in middle-age. Hospital mortality is 2.2% (1.6% in women and 3.2% in men), increasing with age. Mental disorders are detected 3-4 times more in secondary diagnoses. The main primary diagnosis (> 74%) is poisoning with substances, with lower mortality (similar to 1%) than injury by hanging and jumping from high places (>= 12%), which have the highest numbers. Other factors associated with increased mortality include different medical comorbidities and severity of the injury, while length of stay and mental disorders are protective factors. Type of hospital, poisoning, and Charlson index are associated differently with mortality in men and women.
   Conclusions: Hospitalised suicidal acts show a low mortality, mainly related to comorbidities and the severity of injuries. (C) 2016 SEP y SEPB. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To analyse trends in socio-economic inequalities in mortality due to all injuries, as well as, suicide and motor vehicle injuries, in men in the census tracts of 26 Spanish cities for the periods 1996-2001 and 2002-2007.
   Methods: Ecological study of trends based on two periods (1996-2001 and 2002-2007). The study population consisted of male residents in each city during the period 1996-2007. We fitted a hierarchical Bayesian model which takes into account the spatial structure of the data in order to obtain relative risks (RRs), and their 95% credible intervals (CIs), between mortality and a socio-economic deprivation index, in each period.
   Results: In most of the cities, mortality due to total injuries presents the same geographical pattern as the deprivation index in the two periods. Moreover, inequalities remained stable. In contrast, socio-economic inequalities in mortality due to motor vehicle injuries tended to diminish in the second period in the majority of the cities, particularly Castellon (first period: RR1=2.56; 95%CI: 1.19-4.84; second period: RR2 = 1.06; 95%CI: 0.45-2.12), whereas in the case of suicides, the inequalities remain stable but are only significant in large cities.
   Conclusion: This study has demonstrated that socio-economic inequalities in mortality due to all injuries in small areas of 26 Spanish cities remain stable over time. These results highlight the importance of intra-urban inequalities in mortality due to injuries and their evolution over time. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Compliance with pharmacotherapy for the treatment of Bipolar Disorder (BPD) is necessary to prevent recurrence of affective episodes, which have been associated with increased morbidity risk, treatment non-response, full syndromal recurrence and suicidality. While male gender is one of the specific factors associated with treatment noncompliance in BPD, there have been no specific studies to date on the influence of gender in the adherence to BPD treatment. The objectives of this paper are to describe adherence in BPD in relation with gender in a well-defined catchment area in Vitoria (Spain, CIBERSAM) and the factors associated with it. We use the following methods: patients diagnosed type-I BPD were evaluated in 1994 and began long-term prophylactic treatment. They were followed Lip for 10 years and underwent assessments at <= 8-week intervals to review their morbidity, abuse of alcohol or other substances. hospitalizations, suicide attempts, use and closes of all psychotropic agents, with estimates of adherence to the prescribed, primary mood stabilizing regimen. Bivariate analyses were done to compare compliance between men and women. Logistic regression models were applied to Study the factors associated with non-compliance in men. The results show that women were more adherent to the treatment than men. Non-adherent men had higher substance abuse. more mixed and manic episodes and more hospitalizations than men who complied with treatment. Non-adherent women were not married and experienced more suicide attempts. Conclusions: The findings support the increasing body of evidence that there are important differences in adherence with regard to gender. and that men need special preventive care for manic relapses and special treatment for improving their compliance.

AB The aim of this study was to analyze the presence of alcohol in individuals (137) that were subjected to a mandatory medico-legal autopsy in the Institute of Legal Medicine of Las Palmas (Canary Islands, Spain) during 2015. Blood and vitreous humor samples (232) were analyzed by gas chromatography. 46.0% of the individuals were positive for alcohol, being half of them tourists. Blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) was higher in men over 60 years (p = 0.041). 10.2% of the series died in a traffic accident, and victims had the highest proportion of positives to alcohol (64.3%) and the highest BAC (2.56 g/L, p = 0.048). The BAC: VHAC (alcohol in vitreous humor) ratio was higher among victims of traffic crashes (p = 0.036), suggesting a short elapsed interval between the alcohol intake and the fatal accident. The results of this study indicate that ethanol is still heavily involved in non-natural deaths. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB This study assessed the relationship between poly-victimization and suicidality in 227 adolescents involved in child and youth-serving systems (i.e., child welfare and juvenile justice systems) in Spain. The mean age of participants was 15.24 years (SD = 1.56 (range 12 to 17). The Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire (which includes conventional crime, caregiver victimization, victimization by peers and siblings, sexual victimization, witnessing and indirect victimization, and electronic victimization), and two items from the Youth Self-Report were used to assess victimization and suicidality respectively. Lifetime poly-victimization was reported by 61.7% of the overall sample, and suicidality by 39.6%. The logistic regression analysis indicated that the odds of presenting suicidality were twice as high in the poly-victims (OR = 2.13). Sexual victimization was a statistically significant predictor and was associated with the occurrence of suicidality (OR = 2.67). In view of the high prevalence of victimization and its association with suicidality in this sample, we propose that the assessment of victimization should be included in the design of policies for suicide prevention and intervention.

AB Suicide bombing attacks have emerged as a lethal weapon in the hands of terrorist groups. Our aim was to review the medical experience acquired in Israel, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States in managing terrorist attacks, and prepare medical systems for the difficult task of managing these events. EMS protocols are amended to deal with a large number of victims in an urban setting who must be rapidly evacuated to a medical center where resuscitative as well as definitive care is delivered. A combination of extensive soft tissue damage caused by penetrating injuries, blast injury to the lungs and tympanic membranes, and burns are common among survivors. Preparation must include establishment of a clear chain-of-command lead by a general surgeon who manages the event and is responsible for decisions regarding OR preferences and ICU admissions. The emergency department is re-organized to handle the influx of numerous severely injured casualties. Professional personnel and resources are recruited and re-directed away from routine tasks towards treating the victims. This is achieved by deferring non-urgent operations, procedures and imaging studies. Victims are frequently re-assessed and re-evaluated to control chaos, minimize missed injuries and ensure delivery of an adequate level of care.

AB Psychosis has been associated with committing violent crimes. However, it has been reported that the association is mediated by toxin consumption, personality disorders, and positive symptoms. This study will examine the relationship between different psychological disorders and sociodemographic variables, and violent crime perpetration in a sample of 472 men serving prison terms in Andalusia, Spain. A correlation-based, retrospective study was conducted and data were analyzed through logistic regression. The sample is representative of the Andalusian prison population, with a 95% level of confidence and .02% precision. Inmates were sampled and diagnosed by expert clinicians using the SCID-I and the IPDE-II. We computed bivariate correlations between the aforementioned variables and perpetration of violent crimes (murder, homicide, attempted murder, and injury) to later apply logistic regression and find adjusted odds ratios. We confirmed the association between diagnosis of functional psychoses and violent crime, with a significant adjusted odds ratio in the last model (OR = 3.71; p = .010). Other significant variables that acted like risk factors include suicide attempts (OR = 2.04; p = .046), having received care at a mental health facility in the year before imprisonment (OR = 3.83; p = .008), and more strongly than the psychosis diagnosis, low level of education (OR = 10.32; p = .029). Toxin consumption and personality disorders were not significant in the final model.

AB Background: The trade-off between efficiency and equity has been largely studied in the health economics literature and for countries with different types of health systems. Even if efficiency and equity are desired, it is not always feasible to attain both simultaneously. In Spain, the National Health System has historically been recognized for its universal access and free of charge provision, with good health outcomes. However, the recent increase in health expenditures together with the economic cycle has turned the orientation of health policy implementation towards efficiency, threatening universality and equity in the access to healthcare.
   Methods: A Discrete Choice Experiment was carried out to weigh priorities of policy-makers from different regions in Spain. A total of 69 valid questionnaires were collected and the preferences towards equity and/or efficiency criteria were evaluated. Composite League Tables (CLTs) were used to rank hypothetical health interventions based on their attributes.
   Results: The Spanish health policy-makers, managers and other stakeholder displayed a stronger preference for severity of disease, high individual benefits, a large number of beneficiaries and proven cost-effectiveness criteria in decision making. The priority interventions targeted severe mental disorders, i.e. major depressive disorders and suicides (or suicidal attempts), especially for young and middle age categories across the three regions under study.
   Conclusion: In times of economic crisis, health policy-makers, managers and other stakeholder value, in moderation, efficiency over equity. The impact of austerity measures on populations' socio-economic wellbeing seems correlated with the preference for mental health interventions.

AB Objective: Studies examining the relationship between homeless persons and the use of psychiatric emergency services (PES) in a country with universal access to health care are lacking. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of homelessness in adults visiting a PES in Spain, identify the differences between homeless and non-homeless patients in the use of PES and analyze the factors associated with homelessness and the decision to hospitalize.
   Method: The study included a total of 11 578 consecutive admissions to a PES in a tertiary hospital in Barcelona, Spain, over a 4-year period. Data collected included socio-demographic and clinical information, and score on the Severity of Psychiatric Illness (SPI) scale. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios for the factors associated with homelessness and the decision to hospitalize.
   Results: Five hundred sixty (4.8%) admissions were considered homeless. Homeless patients had more psychotic and drug abuse disorders, greater severity of symptoms, more risk of being a danger to others and more frequent hospitalization needs than non-homeless patients. Factors related to homelessness were male gender, substance abuse and immigrant status from North Africa, Sub-Sahara Africa and Western countries. The decision to hospitalize homeless patients was associated with psychosis diagnosis, suicide risk, danger to others, symptom severity, medical problems and noncompliance with treatment.
   Conclusions: In an attempt to decrease the use of emergency resources and prevent the risk of homelessness, mental health planners in a universal healthcare system should improve outpatient access for populations with risk factors such as substance abuse and immigration.

AB Purpose
   Evidence of whether the recent economic crisis has or has not had an effect on psychotropic drug consumption is very scarce. Our objective was to determine if there had in fact been an increase in psychotropic drug use as a result of the financial crisis.
   Methods
   In our study a retrospective cohort (between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2012) was made up of individuals from the general population in a region in the northeast of Catalonia, Spain. We specified a generalized linear mixed model along with combined 'selection on observables' as (propensity scoring) matching and 'selection on unobservables' as (random coefficient) the panel data model methods, and performed inferences using a Bayesian framework.
   Results
   In the period following the economic crisis (post 2009), there was an increase in the consumption of psychotropic drugs which was significantly higher among those who had already been consuming psychotropic drugs prior to 2009 and those most likely to be unemployed. The increase was of greater significance when consumption was measured by the number of drugs being taken, rather than by the defined daily dose (DDD), with the greatest increase occurring in 2011; the very year in which Spain was most affected by the crisis.
   Conclusions
   Once the financial crisis had ended, there was an increase in the severity, rather than the intensity, of mental health disorders in individuals who had already had disorders before the crisis. This increase occurred in those most likely to be unemployed, and the severity was accentuated in the toughest year of the economic crisis.

AB An estimated 800 000 suicide deaths occur worldwide. The global suicide rate is 11.4 per 100 000 population; 15.0/100 000 for males and 8.0/100 000 for females. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds. In a collaborative effort to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental health problems among youth across Europe, the European Union 7(th) Framework funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. SEYLE is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to promote mental health and healthy lifestyles, while preventing psychopathology and suicidal behaviours among adolescents. The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD +/- 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged >= 16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged <= 15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called `invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised risk behaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the `invisible' risk group with those in the high-risk group, similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%), subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%), depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32%, respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-injurious behaviours (D-SIB) was 27.6%, with higher rates reported for occasional D-SIB (19.7%) compared to repetitive D-SIB (7.8%). Suicidal ideation was present in approximately one third of the sample (32.3%). More than four percent (4.2%) of the sample reported attempting suicide during their lifetime, with a significantly higher prevalence among girls (5.1% vs. 3.0%, p<0.05). In comparing the effectiveness of the three active SEYLE interventions, based on three specific preventive strategies directed towards teachers and school staff, professionals and pupils in comparison to a control group, the intervention empowering pupils, called the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) showed significant results in preventing new cases of suicide attempts, severe suicidal ideation with plans and depression. More than a 50% reduction of incident cases of suicide attempts (OR: 0.45 [0.24 - 0.85]; p=0.014), and of incident cases of severe suicidal ideation and plans (OR: 0.50 [0.27 - 0.92]; p=0.025), as well as a significant reduction by 30% of incident cases with moderate to severe depression (OR: 0.71 [0.52- 0.97]; p=0.031) was observed.

TI Psychiatric Disorders and Montelukast in Children: A Disproportionality
   Analysis of the VigiBase®
SO DRUG SAFETY

AB Introduction In 2008, the US FDA issued an alert about an increased risk of psychiatric events associated with montelukast. Recent national pharmacovigilance analyses in Sweden, France and Spain detected a potential increase in reporting risk of the association.
   Aim Our objective was to analyse spontaneous reports of psychiatric events in children and adolescents worldwide treated with montelukast.
   Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) recorded up to 1 January 2015 in the World Health Organization (WHO) database (VigiBase (R)), in which montelukast was associated with 'psychiatric disorders'. We used the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) approach for signal generation.
   Results A total of 14,670 ICSRs for montelukast were recorded, of which 2630 corresponded to psychiatric disorders in people aged <18 years. The main symptoms reported for infants (aged<2 years) were sleep disorders, for children (aged 2-11 years) the main symptoms were depression/anxiety, and for adolescents (aged 12-17 years) they were suicidal behaviour and depression/anxiety. Suicidal behaviour was over-represented in all age groups with information component (IC) values that reached 5.01 in children and 3.85 in adolescents. Unexpectedly, completed suicides were reported more frequently for children (IC: 3.15; IC025: 1.98) than for adolescents (IC: 3.11; IC025: 2.61) or the total population (IC 1.95; IC025: 1.73).
   Conclusions Neuropsychiatric disorders as side effects of montelukast were more frequently reported for children than for adults. Infants and children seem to be more prone to sleep disturbances, whereas adolescents present symptoms of depression/anxiety and psychotic reactions more often. Suicidal behaviour and completed suicide appear to be more frequently reported than previously thought in practice. Risk management plans and epidemiological studies are needed to quantify the risk. Practitioners should be aware of the risk of neuropsychiatric events associated with montelukast use, and should advise the patient and report new cases.

AB Introduction: When evaluating gender differences in mental disorders and suicidality, specifically between European countries, studies are sparse and frequently hindered by methodological issues, such as the limited items evaluated and inconsistent sampling designs.
   Methods: In ten European countries participating in the World Mental Health Survey Initiative, lifetime internalizing and externalizing disorders and suicidality were assessed among 37,289 respondents. Disorders were classified using DMS-IV criteria. Odds ratios (OR) for gender differences were calculated using logistic regression, while trends across age groups were tested via gender x age interaction.
   Results: Within countries, prevalence of any lifetime internalizing disorder ranged from 10.8% to 44.5% among women and 5.9% to 26.5% among men, with women having consistently higher odds than men (OR range: 1.52-2.73). Prevalence of any lifetime externalizing disorders ranged from 02% to 6.6% among vvomen and 2.2% to 22.4% among men, with women having consistently lower odds than men (OR range: 0.05-0.35). Any lifetime suicide attempt was found in 0.8-5.4% of women and 0.3-2.4% of men, showing inconsistent relative gender differences across countries (OR range: 0.77-4.72). Significant effects in gender OR across age groups were not observed for any internalizing disorder or suicide attempt, yet vvere present for any externalizing disorder in France (p=0.01), the Netherlands (p=0.05), and Spain (p = 0.02).
   Limitations: Mental disorders were assessed with the CIDI 3.0 and not psychiatric evaluations. Suicidality does not fully represent more important clinical events, such as suicide mortality.
   Conclusions: Consistent across European countries, internalizing disorders are more Common among women and externalizing disorders among men, whereas gender differences in suicidality varied. (C)2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background
   The health effects of recent economic crises differ markedly by population group. The objective of this systematic review is to examine evidence from longitudinal studies on factors influencing resilience for any health outcome or health behaviour among the general population living in countries exposed to financial crises.
   Methods
   We systematically reviewed studies from six electronic databases (EMBASE, Global Health, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science) which used quantitative longitudinal study designs and included: (i) exposure to an economic crisis; (ii) changes in health outcomes/behaviours over time; (iii) statistical tests of associations of health risk and/or protective factors with health outcomes/behaviours. The quality of the selected studies was appraised using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. PRISMA reporting guidelines were followed.
   Results
   From 14,584 retrieved records, 22 studies met the eligibility criteria. These studies were conducted across 10 countries in Asia, Europe and North America over the past two decades. Ten socio-demographic factors that increased or protected against health risk were identified: gender, age, education, marital status, household size, employment/occupation, income/financial constraints, personal beliefs, health status, area of residence, and social relations. These studies addressed physical health, mortality, suicide and suicide attempts, mental health, and health behaviours. Women's mental health appeared more susceptible to crises than men's. Lower income levels were associated with greater increases in cardiovascular disease, mortality and worse mental health. Employment status was associated with changes in mental health. Associations with age, marital status, and education were less consistent, although higher education was associated with healthier behaviours.
   Conclusions
   Despite widespread rhetoric about the importance of resilience, there was a dearth of studies which operationalised resilience factors. Future conceptual and empirical research is needed to develop the epidemiology of resilience.

AB Do institutions of citizenship shape public opinion among Muslims in the West? Pitched debates about the future of multiculturalism give strong theoretical reason to think that institutions would cause cross-national variation in minority opinion. Institutions set rules for national integration and communal recognition and send signals regarding social views of diversity. Testing these theorised links, however, requires two steps. First, careful conceptualisation of citizenship, both in individual and communal dimensions, categorises states' citizenship regimes. Second, unique cross-national polling of Muslim minorities in France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States permits analysis of the relationship between institutions and minority political attitudes. Findings demonstrate strong institutional effects on attitudes. However, these effects vary depending on the question asked. Institutions impact on cross-national variation in opinion regarding national identification and women's place in society. There is no evidence of institutional roots of support for suicide terrorism.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is defined as the direct and deliberate destruction of one's own body tissue in the absence of lethal intent. Following decades of progressive increase in the incidence of NSSI among adolescents and young adults, as well as growing scientific interest, the disorder was listed as a condition for further study in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fifth edition). In this review we provide updated information on this phenomenon, focusing on: prevalence, course and prognosis; associated factors; its relationship with psychopathology; and the role of the mass media, social networks, and the internet. Finally, we discuss some conclusions and future proposals, emphasizing the need for collaborative work to better understand NSSI in Spain, and to improve prevention and treatment strategies.

AB This paper presents a stochastic dynamic mathematical model to study the evolution of the unemployment rate and other relevant related variables in a country. This model is composed by three basic interrelated subsystems: demographic, economic and wellbeing ones. A key aspect of this model is that it considers three UN well-being variables simultaneously: Human Development Index, Gender Empowerment Index and Gender Differentiation Index. These variables involve key concepts for human development, as Health, Education, Economy and Female Labor.
   With this model, the most outstanding variables found in the literature in relation with unemployment control can be used to design strategies and scenarios to reduce the unemployment rate in the future. The model has been fitted for the case of Spain in the 2002-2014 period, the largest one with information about all the variables involved in the model. Finally, several tentative scenarios and strategies have been tested. to reduce the unemployment rate in Spain in the horizon of year 2025, and the corresponding forecast evolution of the Gender Differentiation Index, National income per capita, Public debt and the ratio between Public debt and Gross domestic product are shown.

TI Mortality in Spain in the Context of the Economic Crisis and Austerity
   Policies
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID FINANCIAL CRISIS; HEALTH; RECESSION; IMPACT; RISK
AB Objectives. To analyze the mortality trend in Spain before, during, and after the economic crisis and austerity policies.
   Methods. We calculated age-standardized annual mortality rates in 2001 through 2016 and estimated linear trends in mortality rates during 4 periods (2001-2007, 2008-2010, 2011-2013, and 2014-2016) using the annual percentage change (APC).
   Results. All-cause mortality rate decreased during the period 2001 to 2016, although we found increases over the previous year. After adjusting for increased influenza activity (P =.743) and heat waves (P =.473), we found the greatest declines during the economic crisis (2008-2010) and the smallest in the period 2014 to 2016, in which the APC in mortality rates was -2.9 and -0.6, respectively. The APC before the crisis (2001-2007) and during austerity (2011-2013) was -2.0 and -2.2, respectively. We observed similar results in mortality from cardiovascular, respiratory, and digestive diseases and motor vehicle accidents. Mortality from cancer showed the smallest decline during the crisis and the austerity period, whereas suicide increased in the period 2011 to 2013.
   Conclusions. Lifestyle changes could explain the decline in mortality during the economic crisis. Increased influenza activity and the 2015 heat wave may prevent identifying a possible delayed effect of austerity policies in the slowing down of mortality decline in the period 2014 to 2016.

AB Background: Our main objective was to evaluate the fundamental biases detected in studies assessing the effects the Great Recession had on health for the case of Spain. As secondary objectives we presented methods to control these biases and to discuss the results of the studies in question if they had controlled for them. Methods: We carried out a systematic review of the literature published up to June 2018. We evaluated the biases that could have happened in all the eligible studies. Results: From the review, we finally selected 53 studies. Of the studies we reviewed, 60.38% or 32 out of 53, were evaluated as having a high risk of bias. The main biases our review revealed were problems with evaluation, time bias, lack of control of unobserved confounding, and non-exogeneity when defining the onset of the Great Recession. Conclusions: The results from the studies that controlled the biases were quite consistent. Summing up, the studies reviewed found that the Great Recession increased the risk of declaring poor self-rated health and the deterioration of mental health. Both the mortality rate and the suicide rate may well have increased after the Great Recession, probably after a three-to four-year delay.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Objectives: Among the well-established treatments for bipolar disorder (BPD), lithium continues to offer an unusually broad spectrum of benefits that may include reduction of suicidal risk.
   Methods: We examined the association of suicidal acts with adherence to long-term lithium maintenance treatment and other potential risk factors in 72 BP I patients followed prospectively for up to 10 years at a Mood Disorders Research Center in Spain.
   Results: The observed rates of suicide were 0.143, and of attempts, 2.01%/year, with a 5.2-fold (95% CI: 1.5-18.6) greater risk among patients consistently rated poorly versus highly adherent to lithium prophylaxis (11.4/2.2 acts/100 person-years). Treatment non-adherence was associated with substance abuse, being unmarried, being male, and having more hypomanic-manic illness and hospitalizations. Suicidal risk was higher with prior attempts, more depression and hospitalization, familial mood disorders, and being single and younger, as well as treatment non-adherence, but with neither sex nor substance abuse. In multivariate analysis, suicidal risk was associated with previous suicidality > poor treatment adherence > more depressive episodes > younger age.
   Conclusions: The findings support growing evidence of lower risk of suicidal acts during closely monitored and highly adherent, long-term treatment with lithium and indicate that treatment adherence is a potentially modifiable factor contributing to antisuicidal benefits.

TI Financial crisis, austerity, and health in Europe

LA English

ID ECONOMIC-CRISIS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; MENTAL-HEALTH; MORTALITY; UNEMPLOYMENT;
   CARE; IMPACT; CUTS; POLICY; TIMES
AB The financial crisis in Europe has posed major threats and opportunities to health. We trace the origins of the economic crisis in Europe and the responses of governments, examine the effect on health systems, and review the effects of previous economic downturns on health to predict the likely consequences for the present. We then compare our predictions with available evidence for the effects of the crisis on health. Whereas immediate rises in suicides and falls in road traffic deaths were anticipated, other consequences, such as HIV outbreaks, were not, and are better understood as products of state retrenchment. Greece, Spain, and Portugal adopted strict fiscal austerity; their economies continue to recede and strain on their health-care systems is growing. Suicides and outbreaks of infectious diseases are becoming more common in these countries, and budget cuts have restricted access to health care. By contrast, Iceland rejected austerity through a popular vote, and the financial crisis seems to have had few or no discernible effects on health. Although there are many potentially confounding differences between countries, our analysis suggests that, although recessions pose risks to health, the interaction of fiscal austerity with economic shocks and weak social protection is what ultimately seems to escalate health and social crises in Europe. Policy decisions about how to respond to economic crises have pronounced and unintended effects on public health, yet public health voices have remained largely silent during the economic crisis.

TI The burden of premature mortality in Spain using standard expected years
   of life lost: a population-based study
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID PUBLIC-HEALTH UTILITY; DEATH
AB Background: Measures of premature mortality have been used to guide debates on future health priorities and to monitor the population health status. Standard expected years of life lost (SEYLL) is one of the methods used to assess the time lost due to premature death. This article affords an overview of premature mortality in Spain for the year 2008.
   Methods: A population-based study was conducted estimating SEYLL by sex and age groups. SEYLL, a key component of the disability-adjusted life years measure of disease burden, was calculated using Princeton West standard life tables with life expectancy at birth fixed at 80 years for males and 82.5 years for females. Population data and specific death records were obtained from the official registers of the National Institute of Statistics. All data were analysed and prepared in GesMor and Epidat software packages.
   Results: The burden of premature mortality was estimated at 2.1 million SEYLL when age at death is taken into account. Males lost 60.9% and females lost 39.1% of total SEYLL. Malignant tumors (34.5%) and cardiovascular diseases (24.0%) were the leading categories in terms of SEYLL. Ischaemic heart disease (8.5%) and lung cancers (8.0%) were the most common specific causes of SEYLL followed by cerebrovascular diseases (5.9%), colorectal cancer (4.1%), road traffic accidents (3.5%), Alzheimer and other dementias (2.9%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2.8%), breast cancer (2.8%) and suicides (2.6%).
   Conclusions: In Spain, premature mortality was essentially due to chronic non-communicable diseases. Data provided in this study are relevant for a more balanced health agenda aimed at reducing the burden of premature mortality. This study also represents a first step in estimating the overall burden of disease in terms of premature death and disability.

DE Psychological autopsy; suicide; Spanish; methodology
AB Introduction: objectives. The aim of this work was to adapt and validate into Spanish the Semi-Structured Interview for Psychological Autopsy (SSIPA).
   Method. The SSIPA consists of 69 items distributed into four modules: precipitants and/or stressors, motivation, lethality, and intentionality. The original instrument was translated from Portuguese into Spanish and backtranslated by bilinguals persons. The resulting questionnaire was compared with the original and discussed by an expert panel. The adapted instrument was then applied to the relatives of 26 presumed suicide cases in Ourense (Spain) who voluntarily accepted to participate. Interviews were digitally recorded and evaluated using a decision-making algorithm by the interviewer and two independent judges blind to the results of the others.
   Results. lnterrater agreement was measured using Kappa statistics. Participation in the study (27.60/0) was similar to that obtained in the original study in Brazil >(20%). The Kappa values obtained were statistically significant. Correlation index was considered good (k> 0.60) or very good (k> 0.80) in 15 steps including 3 out of 4 final steps of each module and the final result of the autopsy; moderate (k> 0.40) in 8 steps, 3 of them located in the motivation's module; and weak (k> 0.20) just in 2 steps.
   Conclusions. The Spanish version of the SSIPA is a reliable instrument for psychological autopsy studies. Low correlation in two of the algorithm steps for decision making may be due to the lack of accuracy of the questionnaire and should be improved.

ID WEEKLY SYMPTOMATIC STATUS; NATURAL-HISTORY; I DISORDER; MOOD
AB Background: To determine the clinical and therapeutic relevance of longitudinally predominant polarity for bipolar disorders longterm outcome.
   Method: Two hundred twenty-four patients (n=224) were enrolled for the study in the Bipolar Disorders Program of Barcelona, which provides integrated care for difficult-to-treat bipolar patients derived from all over Spain, but also provides clinical care to all bipolar patients coming from a specific catchment area (Eixample Esquerre) in Barcelona. Data collection regarding predominant polarity started on October 1994 and lasted for the following ten years. Patients were divided according to the predominance of depressive or manic/hypomanic episodes. The two groups were compared regarding clinical and sociodemographic variables.
   Results: 135 patients (60.3%) were classified as Depressive Polarity, whilst 89 (39.7%) were considered as Manic Polarity. Manic Polarity was more prevalent amongst bipolar I patients than bipolar II. Depressive Polarity was strongly associated with depressive onset of bipolar disorder. Lifetime history of attempted suicide was strongly associated with Depressive Polarity, who also had a higher mean number of suicide attempts. As for therapeutic issues, acute and maintenance use of atypical antipsychotics and conventional neuroleptics were more common amongst Manic Polarity whilst antidepressants and lamotrigine use was highly prevalent amongst Depressive Polarity.
   Conclusions: Prevention of depression is crucial for the maintenance treatment of bipolar II patients, whilst prevention of mania and depression would be equally important in the case of bipolar i patients. Predominant polarity is a valid prognostic parameter with therapeutic implications. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To estimate the cost of depression for the adult population in Catalonia (Spain) for 2006.
   Method: The total adult population of Catalonia for the reference year was close to 6 million. A cross-design synthesis study was conducted, combining "top-down" and "bottom-up" data from secondary data sources, as well as expert opinion (nominal groups). A societal perspective was adopted. Estimates included direct health costs (hospital, primary, specialised and pharmacological care) and the indirect costs derived from the productivity lost due to morbidity and mortality. Sensitivity analyses were carried out for primary and specialised care resource utilisation. A Monte Carlo simulation model was developed to handle the uncertainty of the unit costs of primary care, specialised care and hospital visits.
   Results: The total annual cost of depression in Catalonia for 2006 was 735.4 million Euros. Of this figure, 21.2% corresponded to direct costs, including 41 million Euros in primary care (5.6%), 8.1 million Euros in mental health specialised care (1.1%), 5.6 million Euros due to hospitalisation (0.8%) and 101.1 million Euros due to pharmacological care (13.7%); and 78.8% to indirect costs due to productivity loss. 3.7 million work days were lost to temporary disability for depression with a cost of 199.6 million Euros (27.1%), and 353.3 million Euros due to permanent disability (48%). Mortality attributed to suicide accounted for 26.9 million Euros (3.7%). The average annual cost of an adult with depression was close to 1800 Euros.
   Limitations: The heterogeneity of the data sources, the uncertainty in several estimates (i.e. proportion of psychotropic expenditure attributed to the treatment of depression, suicide rate attributed to depression), and the difficulty in disaggregating anxiety and depressive disorders in a number of databases are study limitations.
   Conclusions: The burden of depression for the Catalan public health system and society as a whole due to the consumption of resources and, more importantly, the loss of productivity is significant. Inefficiencies may be found in the overuse of pharmaceuticals and in the eligibility criteria of disability for work. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   Twitter
AB Bullying is the deliberate physical and psychological abuse that a child receives from other children. The term cyberbullying has recently emerged to denote a new type of bullying that takes place over digital platforms, where the stalkers can perform their crimes on the vulnerable victims. In severe cases, the harassment has lead the victims to the extreme causing irreparable damage or leading them to suicide. In order to stop cyberbullying, the scientific community is developing effective tools capable of detecting the harassment as soon as possible; however, these detection systems are still in an early stage and must be improved. Our contribution is CyberDect, an online-tool that seeks on Social Networks indications of harassment. In a nutshell, our proposal combines Open Source Intelligence tools with Natural Language Processing techniques to analyse posts seeking for abusive language towards the victim. The evaluation of our proposal has been performed with a case-study that consisted in monitor two real high school accounts from Spain.

ID MACINTOSH LARYNGOSCOPE; INTUBATION
AB This case report describes the emergency use of a novel, single-use, anatomically shaped laryngoscope that has recently become commercially available in the UK (Airtraq, Prodol Meditec, Spain). It was used to successfully intubate a severely injured 41-year-old patient who had sustained traumatic asphyxia after attempting suicide by hanging. He was bleeding into his upper airway, necessitating regular suctioning. The patient underwent an emergency rapid sequence intubation at the scene of injury, with in-line immobilisation and cricoid pressure while lying on the ground in bright sunlight. A Cormack and Lehane grade 1 view of the oedematous vocal cords was readily obtained, and successful endotracheal intubation was rapidly achieved at the first attempt. The endotracheal tube was clearly seen to pass through the vocal cords and enter the trachea. The Airtraq required minimal manipulation to obtain a close-up, panoramic, high-grade view of the larynx. Further evaluation of this device is warranted to define its role in the emergency department and in prehospital care.

AB Introduction. Patients with psychiatric illness typically have great difficulty following a medication regimen, but they also have the greatest potential for benefiting from adherence. Due to the lack of insight in schizophrenia, adherence to treatment is especially important. We try to analyze and compare the opinion on adherence and compliance of psychiatrists, patients with schizophrenia and relatives.
   Method. A direct, anonymous survey specifically designed for the project was administered to psychiatrists, patients and relatives from all over Spain through different associations of patients and family legally constituted in Spain. Analysis was done separately for variables corresponding to the three groups.
   Results. The psychiatrists (n = 844) considered that 56.8% of their evaluated patients (n = 7.439) were non-compliers in the past month, as opposed to 43.2% of these patients who were considered good compliers (3,215 patients). Ninety-five percent of the patients (n = 938) stated that they took their medication regularly, while 5% answered no to this question. Eighty-two percent of relatives (n = 796) think that patients regularly take their medication, but 47% state that they sometimes forget to take it.
   Conclusions. Treatment adherence should be evaluated in clinical trials and in research on treatment of diseases, particularly in chronic mental diseases such as schizophrenia. It seems clear that only programs aimed at detection and resolution of the problems involved in treatment adherence will be able to improve the mid- and long-term prognosis of patients with schizophrenic disorders.

AB Background: The economic impact caused by diseases goes far beyond health care costs and, therefore it is transferred to the society through different dimensions. The aim of this study was to estimate the productivity losses due to premature deaths caused by diseases occurred in Spain during the period 2005-2009.
   Methods: We used data from several sources (Death Registry, Labour Force Survey and Wage Structure Survey) to develop a simulation model based on the human-capital approach that allowed us to estimate the labour productivity losses caused by premature deaths in the period analysed. Additionally, we also carried out two alternative scenarios in which we analysed how epidemiologic data influenced our results.
   Results: Our model showed the estimated loss of productivity due to premature death fell from 8,935 billion euros in 2005 to 8,073 billion euros in 2009. Nine diseases (traffic accidents, malignant tumour of the trachea, suicides, acute myocardial infarction, AIDS, cirrhosis, breast tumour, cerebrovascular disease and colon cancer) accounted for 35.6% of the total Years of Potential Productive Life Lost and 36.5% of the estimated productivity losses. The estimated losses represented 0.98%, 0.85% and 0.77% of Gross Domestic Product in 2005, 2007 and 2009, respectively.
   Conclusions: The labour productivity losses caused by premature deaths decreased substantially in the period analysed. This reduction was mainly due to the epidemiological evolution of premature mortality.

AB Objectives: To analyse socio-economic inequalities in mortality due to injuries among census tracts of ten Spanish cities by sex and age in the period 1996-2003.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional ecological study where the units of analysis are census tracts. The study population consisted of people residing in the cities during the period 1996-2003. For each census tract we obtained an index of socio-economic deprivation, and estimated standardized mortality ratios using hierarchical Bayesian models which take into account the spatial structure of the data.
   Results: In the majority of the cities, the geographical pattern of total mortality from injuries is similar to that of the socio-economic deprivation index. There is an association between mortality due to injuries and the deprivation index in the majority of the cities which is more important among men and among those younger than 45 years. In these groups, traffic injuries and overdoses are the causes most often associated with deprivation in the cities. The percentage of excess mortality from injuries related to socio-economic deprivation is higher than 20% in the majority of the cities, the cause with the highest percentage being drug overdose.
   Conclusions: In most cities, there are socio-economic inequalities in mortality due to overdose and traffic injuries. In contrast, few cities have found association between suicide mortality and deprivation. Finally, no association was found between deprivation and deaths due to falls. Inequalities are higher in men and those under 45 years of age. These results highlight the importance of intra-urban inequalities in mortality due to injuries. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The literature provides support for the hypothesis that some major repeaters (individuals with lifetime suicide attempts) are addicted to suicidal behavior (SB). This study explores whether major repeaters are addicted to SB or not using 7 criteria: tolerance (Criterion 1), withdrawal (Criterion 2), loss of control (Criterion 3), problems in quitting/cutting down (Criterion 4), much time spent using (Criterion 5), substantial reduction in activities (Criterion 6), and adverse physiological/physical consequences (Criterion 7). Total dependence on SB was indicated by the presence of 3 or more of the 7 criteria in the last 12 months. This cross-sectional study at Puerta de Hierro University Hospital (Madrid, Spain) recruited 118 suicide attempters including 8 major repeaters (7%, 8/118), who were all females. The association between each SB addiction criterion, physiological dependence and total dependence with major repeater status was tested for significance and for effect size with odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals. As hypothesized, major repeaters met significantly higher frequency of criteria for total dependence on SB, OR=62.9 (6.4-615). A backward stepwise logistic regression model was used to provide an OR between major repeater status and total dependence status corrected by confounding variables. Age, panic disorder without agoraphobia, borderline personality disorder, history of psychiatric inpatient admission, and total dependence on SB were introduced as independent variables with major repeater status as the dependent variable. The model selected total dependence and age as the remaining significant variables in the last step. Accordingly, major repeaters appear to be addicted to SB.

AB Objective To obtain more accurate calculations of maternal and pregnancy-related mortality ratios in Sweden from 1988 to 2007 by using information from national registers and death certificates. Design A national register-based study, supplemented by a review of death certificates. Setting Sweden, 1988-2007. Population The deaths of 27 957 women of reproductive age (1549 years). Methods The Swedish Cause of Death Register, Medical Birth Register, and National Patient Register were linked. All women with a diagnosis related to pregnancy in at least one of these registers within 1 year prior to death were identified. Death certificates were reviewed to ascertain maternal deaths. Maternal mortality ratio (the number of maternal deaths/100 000 live births, excluding and including suicides), and pregnancy-related mortality ratio (number of deaths within 42 days after termination of pregnancy, irrespective of cause of death/100 000 live births) were calculated. Main outcome measures Direct and indirect maternal deaths and pregnancy-related deaths. Results The maternal mortality ratio in Sweden, based on the current method of identifying maternal deaths, was 3.6. After linking registers and reviewing death certificates, we identified 64% more maternal deaths, resulting in a ratio of 6.0 (or 6.5 if suicides are included). The pregnancy-related mortality ratio was 7.3. A total of 478 women died within a year after being recorded with a diagnosis related to pregnancy. Conclusions By including the 123 cases of maternal death identified in this study, the mean maternal mortality ratio from 1988 to 2007 was 64% higher than reported to the World Health Organization.

AB Suicide is more effectively prevented when its first manifestations are detected. The first warning sign may be suicidal ideation, so identifying these thoughts and the factors that protect against them is essential if solutions are to be found to this social problem. The purpose of this study, then, is to determine the role of religiosity, perceived social support, and depressive symptomatology in the suicidal ideation of young people. We administered the following questionnaires to a sample of 409 subjects (60.64% women) between 18 and 29 years old: Brief Scale of Religiosity, Beck Depression Inventory, Scale for Suicide Ideation, and Functional Social Support Questionnaire (which includes the subscales Confidential social support and Affective social support). Participants were resident in Spain (84.60%) or Andorra (15.41%). The results show significant correlations between suicidal ideation and the two factors of perceived social support (confidential social support and affective social support). These relationships were still significant after controlling for depressive symptomatology. However, religiosity was not correlated with suicidal ideation. Therefore, the results suggest that perceived social support is a protection factor against suicidal ideas in young men and women. In fact, people who experience suicidal ideation tend to have a greater sense of dissatisfaction in relation to the social support received by such social groups as family and friends. On the other hand, the data of the present investigation suggest that religiosity has an indirect relationship with suicidal ideation in young Spanish and Andorran community populations, through its relationship with social support.

TI Austerity: a failed experiment on the people of Europe
SO CLINICAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID PUBLIC-HEALTH PROFESSIONALS; FINANCIAL CRISIS
AB Many governments in Europe, either of their own volition or at the behest of the international financial institutions, have adopted stringent austerity policies in response to the financial crisis. By contrast, the USA launched a financial stimulus. The results of these experiments are now clear: the American economy is growing and those European countries adopting austerity, including the UK, Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain, are stagnating and struggling to repay rising debts. An initial recovery in the UK was halted once austerity measures hit. However, austerity has been not only an economic failure, but also a health failure, with increasing numbers of suicides and, where cuts in health budgets are being imposed, increasing numbers of people being unable to access care. Yet their stories remain largely untold. Here, we argue that there is an alternative to austerity, but that ideology is triumphing over evidence. Our paper was written to contribute to discussions among health policy leaders in Europe that will take place at the 15th European Health Forum at Gastein in October 2012, as its theme 'Crisis and Opportunity Health in an Age of Austerity'.

AB Researchers seem to view meaning in life as consisting of different dimensions: coherence, purpose, and significance. Meaning in life has been found to be a protective factor against several mental disorders, and an association between meaning in life and the psychopathology of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) has been found. The aim of this study is to analyze the role of the dimensions of meaning in life. The sample was composed of 102 participants with BPD diagnoses from mental health services in Spain, and all of them filled out the BSL-23, PIL-10, MLQ, and OLQ questionnaires. The results suggest that BPD symptoms are negatively correlated with meaning in life. The meaning in life dimensions' model accounted for 52% of the variance in BPD symptoms. The variables that significantly predicted BPD symptoms were: Meaning and Satisfaction, Comprehensibility (coherence), and Purpose and Vital Goals. The present study emphasizes meaning in life as an important variable in BPD psychopathology.

AB In recent publications it has been suggested that the health of the European population is deteriorating as a consequence of the economic crisis. Such deterioration would be manifested by an increase in mortality, particularly in those countries applying austerity measures. It has also been suggested that as a consequence of these policies, suicides have skyrocketed and the situation could become a public health catastrophe of the kind that occurred in the 1990s in the countries formerly part of the USSR. These affirmations have no basis in the existing data. Statistics indicate that in European countries in general and especially in those most affected by the crisis, general mortality has decreased and the health of the population has improved in 2007-2010. Paradoxically, the crisis has had a beneficial effect on health in these countries. Such findings are in substantial agreement with previous studies that have shown throughout various periods within market economies that recessions are favorable to health while periods of economic expansion are harmful.

AB To estimate the impact of (particularly long-term) unemployment on the overall and mental health of the Spanish working-age population and to check whether the effects of unemployment on health have increased or been tempered as a consequence of the economic crisis.
   We apply a matching technique to cross-sectional microdata from the Spanish Health Survey for the years 2006 and 2011-2012 to estimate the average treatment effect of unemployment on self-assessed health (SAH) in the last year, mental problems in the last year and on the mental health risk in the short term. We also use a differences-in-differences estimation method between the two periods to check if the impact of unemployment on health depends on the economic context.
   Unemployment has a significant negative impact on both SAH and mental health. This impact is particularly high for the long-term unemployed. With respect to the impact on mental health, negative effects significantly worsen with the economic crisis. For the full model, the changes in effects of long-term unemployment on mental problems and mental health risk are, respectively, 0.35 (CI 0.19-0.50) and 0.20 (CI 0.07-0.34).
   Anxiety and stress about the future associated with unemployment could have a large impact on individuals' health. It may be necessary to prevent health deterioration in vulnerable groups such as the unemployed, and also to monitor specific health risks that arise in recessions, such as psychological problems.

ID ACUTE LIVER-FAILURE; ACETAMINOPHEN OVERDOSE; N-ACETYLCYSTEINE; INJURY;

AB There are few data on hepatotoxicity induced by acute or chronic paracetamol poisoning in the pediatric population. Paracetamol poisoning data can reveal the weaknesses of paracetamol poisoning management guidelines.
   We retrospectively studied the patients of less than 18 years old with measurable paracetamol levels, who were brought to the emergency department (ED) of La Paz University Hospital, Madrid, Spain, for suspected paracetamol overdoses between 2005 and 2010.
   Ninety-two patients with suspected paracetamol poisoning were identified. In 2007, the incidence of paracetamol poisoning in the pediatric population was 0.8 [Poisson-95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03-3.69] per 10 000 inhabitants aged less than 18 years. The incidence in the same year was 1.53 (Poisson-95% CI: 0.24-5.57) per 10 000 patients in the pediatric ED. The most common cause of poisoning was attempted suicide (47.8%) in teenagers with a median age of 15 years, followed by accidental poisoning (42.2%) in babies with a median age of 2.65 years. Difference was seen in the frequency of hepatotoxicity between acute and chronic poisoning cases. Only 1 of 49 patients with acute poisoning showed hepatotoxicity [acute liver failure (ALF)], whereas 7 of 8 patients with chronic poisoning showed hepatotoxicity (3 cases of ALF). The average time to medical care was 6.83 hours for acute poisoning and 52.3 hours for chronic poisoning (P < 0.001).
   Chronic paracetamol poisoning is a potential risk factor for hepatotoxicity and acute liver failure. Delays in seeking medical help might be a contributing factor. Clinicians should have a higher index of clinical suspicion for this entity.

AB BACKGROUND: In the frame of the European study on quality assurance in consultation liaison psychiatry and psychosomatics (supported by the BIOMED 1 program), the clinical "process" of consultation-liaison psychiatry units pertaining to six Spanish general hospitals is analyzed.
   PATIENTS AND METHOD: A sample of 3.608 consecutive patients referred to the consultation-liaison psychiatry units of five public general hospitals (Clinico of Zaragoza, Clinico of Barcelona, General of Alicante, Ramon y Cajal of Madrid, Princesa of Madrid) and one private gynecological hospital (Dexeus of Barcelona) was studied. The data were recorded with a standardized instrument (CL-BDoK-P), validated in a previous study.
   RESULTS: consult request took place 10.6 days (on average) after the patients admission ("lagtime 1"), half the requests were urgent, and psychiatric consultants examined the patients 1.9 days (on average) after the request("lagtime 2"). The most frequent reasons for referral were current psychiatric symptoms (50.3%), unexplained physical symptoms (15.2%), substance abuse (9.2%), psychiatric history (8.5%), suicide risk (6%) and coping with illness (5.8%). The main referral services were internal medicine (17.5%), traumatology (7.5%) and general surgery (7.3%). An important clinical activity is documented in patients frequently considered to be "complex", with broad spectrum diagnostic and interventions processes and both in-hospital and out-patient follow-up. However, some problems were also detected in the clinical "process".
   CONCLUSIONS: The results outline the clinical importance of Spanish consultation-liaison psychiatry in the general hospital, but the possibility of improving its efficiency through the implementation of integrative models, organizational changes and modern models of "quality assurance" is also emphasized.

ID CONSULTATION-LIAISON PSYCHIATRY; MORTALITY
AB Purpose: To determine the incidence and characteristics of mental disorders (MD) in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and to define a classification system adapted to the ICU environment.
   Design: A retrospective, descriptive analysis.
   Setting: Intensive Care Unit, Arnau de Vilanova Hospital in Lerida (Spain). Patients: All patients with MD admitted during 5-year period (January, 1 2004 to December 31, 2008).
   Main variables: General variables included clinical-demographic data, diagnostic variables, procedures, severity score, length of stay and mortality. Specific variables included psychiatric history, screening for substance abuse, psychiatric assessment, monitoring and transfer to a psychiatric center. Classification of the MD was as follows: 1) acute substance intoxication (SI); 2) suicide attempts (SA); and 3) MD associated with the main diagnosis (AMD).
   Results: A total of 146 patients had MD (7.8%); they were predominantly male (74%) and were younger than the general ICU population (43.9 vs. 55.3 years, p < 0.001). The ICU stays of the patients with MDs were shorter (4 days vs. 7 days, p < 0.001), and there was less hospital mortality (17.1 vs. 25%, p < 0.05). They also showed a higher incidence of pneumonia (19.9 vs. 13.8%, p < 0.05), but no differences in the level of severity were observed. The SI group (24.7%) contained the highest number of young people; the SA group (36.3%) showed a predominance of women; and the AMD (39%) group had the longest stays and the highest mortality. Psychiatric consultation was carried out mainly in the SA group (62.3%).
   Conclusions: MD is a relatively common problem in the ICU. Collaboration with the Psychiatry Department seldom occurs, but must be encouraged to develop fully integrated management of critical patients with MD. (C) 2011 Elsevier Espana, S.L. and SEMICYUC. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Immigration stress appears to augment the risk for suicide behaviors for Latinos. Yet, specific risk factors that contribute to suicidal ideation (SI) among diverse Latino immigrant populations are not well established.
   Methods: Data were collected in Boston, Madrid and Barcelona using a screening battery assessing mental health, substance abuse risk, trauma exposure, demographics, and sociocultural factors. Prevalence rates of lifetime and 30-day SI were compared across sites. Logistic regression modeling was used to identify sociodemographic, clinical, and sociocultural-contextual factors associated with 30-day SI.
   Results: Five hundred and sixty-seven Latino patients from primary care, behavioral health and HIV clinics and community agencies participated. Rates of lifetime SI ranged from 29-35%; rates for 30-day SI were 21-23%. Rates of SI were not statistically different between sites. Factors associated with SI included exposure to discrimination, lower ethnic identity, elevated family conflict, and low sense of belonging (P < 0.01). In the adjusted model, higher scores on depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and trauma exposure were significantly associated with 30-day SI (OR = 1.14, 1.04, and 7.76, respectively). Greater number of years living in the host country was significantly associated with increased odds of having SI (OR = 2.22) while having citizenship status was associated with lower odds (OR = 0.45).
   Conclusion: Latinos suffering depression, trauma exposure, and immigration stressors are more likely to experience SI. Despite differences in country of origin, education, and other demographic factors between countries, rates of SI did not differ. Recommendations for prevention and clinical practice for addressing suicidal ideation risk among Latino immigrants are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Precise knowledge of the epidemiology of suicidality provides necessary information for designing prevention programs. The aims of the present study were to investigate the prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideas and attempts in the general population of Europe.
   Methods: The European Study on the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMED) is a cross-sectional household survey carried out in a probability representative sample of non-institutionalised adults (aged 18 years or older) of six European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain). The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0) was administered to 21,425 individuals.
   Results: Lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation was 7.8% and of suicidal attempts 1.3%. Being women, younger and divorced or widowed were associated with a higher prevalence of suicide ideation and attempts. Psychiatric diagnoses were strongly related to suicidality. Among them, major depressive episode (Rate ratio 2.9 for lifetime ideas and 4.8 for lifetime attempts), dysthymia (RR 2.0 and 1.6), GAD (RR 1.8 and 2.3 for lifetime), PTSD (RR 1.9 and 2.0) and alcohol dependence (RR 1.7 and 2.5) were the most important. Population attributable risks for lifetime suicidal attempt was 28% for major depression.
   Limitations: Information about suicidal ideas and attempts was self reported, psychiatric diagnoses were made using fully structured lay interviews rather than clinician-administered interviews.
   Conclusions: In spite of meaningful country variation in prevalence, risk factors for suicidality are consistent in the European countries. Population prevention programmes should focus on early diagnosis and treatment of major depression and alcohol abuse and in those individuals with recent appearance of suicidal ideas.

AB Introduction: Violence against women (VaW) directly influences their quality of life and mental health. Unfortunately, its influence may be ignored or underestimated by professionals attending these women.
   Objectives: To describe a hospitalized sample of women suffering from emergent VaW who visited the mental health department for other reasons. To evaluate the degree of knowledge about VaW and interventions for VaW taken by health professionals.
   Methods: We performed an observational, prospective study with systematic data collection on all cases of emergent and/or urgent VaW at the Corporacio Sanitaria Parc Tauli (Sabadell, Spain) from January-December 2004 and January-December 2006. The reference population consisted of 390,000 inhabitants, mostly urban and from the industrial and service economic sectors. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed.
   Results: In the two study periods, 218 and 194 women, respectively, were attended for emergent and/or urgent VaW resulting in severe injures and/or medical and/or social assistance. Of these, up to 53 received or had received specialized mental health treatment. Most of these women (69.7%) withdrew from follow-up. We detected a high rate of comorbid abuse or dependence on alcohol (27.3%), benzodiazepines (33.3%) or other drugs of abuse and a high rate of suicide attempts (41.9%) and successful suicides in these periods. VaW was explicitly registered in only 51.1% of the cases and a specific intervention for VaW was documented in only 15.2% of the cases.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of psychiatric and/or psychological disorders was very high in our sample, but the presence of VaW was not always specifically documented or treated. (C) 2009 SEP y SEPB. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, the European euthanasia debate has become more intense, and the practice was legalized in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. We aimed to determine the current degree of public acceptance of euthanasia across Europe and investigate what factors explain differences.
   Data were derived from the 2008 wave of the European Values Survey (EVS), conducted in 47 European countries (N = 67,786, response rate = 69 %). Acceptance of euthanasia was rated on a 1-10 scale.
   Relatively high acceptance was found in a small cluster of Western European countries, including the three countries that have legalized euthanasia and Denmark, France, Sweden and Spain. In a large part of Europe public acceptance was relatively low to moderate. Comparison with the results of the previous EVS wave (1999) suggests a tendency towards a polarization in Europe, with most of Western Europe becoming more permissive and most of Eastern Europe becoming less permissive.
   There is roughly a West-East division in euthanasia acceptance among the European public, making a pan-European policy approach to the issue difficult.

AB Objective: To analyze differences in the variables associated with severity of suicidal intent and in the main factors associated with intent when comparing younger and older adults. Design: Observational, descriptive cross-sectional study. Setting: Four general hospitals in Madrid, Spain. Participants: Eight hundred seventy suicide attempts by 793 subjects split into two groups: 18-54 year olds and subjects older than 55 years. Measurements: The authors tested the factorial latent structure of suicidal intent through multigroup confirmatory factor analysis for categorical outcomes and performed statistical tests of invariance across age groups using the DIFFTEST procedure. Then, they tested amultiple indicators-multiple causes (MIMIC) model including different covariates regressed on the latent factor "intent" and performed two separate MIMIC models for younger and older adults to test for differential patterns. Results: Older adults had higher suicidal intent than younger adults (z = 2.63, p = 0.009). The final model for the whole sample showed a relationship of intent with previous attempts, support, mood disorder, personality disorder, substance-related disorder, and schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. The model showed an adequate fit (chi(2)([12]) = 22.23, p = 0.035; comparative fit index = 0.986; Tucker-Lewis index = 0.980; root mean square error of approximation = 0.031; weighted root mean square residual = 0.727). All covariates had significant weights in the younger group, but in the older group, only previous attempts and mood disorders were significantly related to intent severity. Conclusions: The pattern of variables associated with suicidal intent varies with age. Recognition, and treatment of geriatric depression may be the most effective measure to prevent suicidal behavior in older adults. (Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 2010; 18:839-847)

AB Bacteria usually live in complex environments, sharing niche and resources with other bacterial species, unicellular eukaryotic cells or complex organisms. Thus, they have evolved mechanisms to communicate, to compete and to adapt to changing environment as diverse as human tissues, animals or plants. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these adaptation processes is therefore of primary importance for epidemiology and human health protection, and was the focus of a Current Trends in Biomedicine workshop organized by the International University of Andalucia in late October 2015 in Baeza ( Spain). The topic was covered by complementary sessions: ( i) interbacterial communication and competition that enable a better access to nutrients or a more efficient colonization of the ecological niche, ( ii) adaptation of intracellular pathogens to their host, focusing on metabolic pathways, adaptive mechanisms and populational heterogeneity, and ( iii) adaptation of animal and plant pathogens as well as plant-associated bacteria to a plant niche. This workshop emphasized the broad repertoire of mechanisms and factors bacteria have evolved to become efficient pathogens.

AB A significant rise in the abuse of a new group of synthetic cathinones was reported recently in Western Europe. We selected four documented cases that recently occurred in Spain to discuss the toxicological significance and the mechanisms that explain the legal facts. All drugs and metabolites were detected using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). Case 1: A 19-year old male was arrested for assaulting his father. He drank a random glass in a discotheque. He described a feeling of elation, irritability and several episodes of amnesia. Methylone and its metabolites, and 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) were detected in urine. Case 2: A 33-year-old gay male committed suicide by hanging. Alpha-pyrrolidinovalerophenone (alpha-PVP) and 4-methylethcathinone were found in blood and urine. Cocaine and its metabolites were detected in urine. Case 3: A 53-year-old male went to the hospital suffering palpitations and thoracic pain and explained that he had inhaled a "white substance" while taking money from a cashier. The case was defined as drug facilitated crime (robbery). Alpha-PVP was detected in blood (0.009 mg/L) and urine, along with nordiazepam and lorazepam and metabolites. Case 4: The police restrained a 39-year-old Colombian male with agitation, persecutory psychosis and irrational behavior. Autopsy samples showed alpha-PVP in blood (1.20 mg/L) and urine along with cocaine, amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine, lormetazepam and alprazolam.
   The four cases bring attention to the severe toxicity including behavioral abnormalities induced by easily accessible synthetic cathinones, all of which should be taken into consideration by authorities in order to adjust legislation with celerity to real life circumstances.

AB Introduction: The available information on the cost of illness of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is overtly insufficient for policy planning. Our aim was to estimate the costs of illness for BPD in Catalonia (Spain) for 2006.
   Methods: This is a multilevel cross-design synthesis study combining a qualitative nominal approach, quantitative 'top-down' analysis of multiple health databases, and 'bottom-up' data of local surveys. Both direct and indirect costs have been estimated from a governmental and societal perspective.
   Results: Estimated year-prevalence of BPD was 0.7% (41,921 cases), but only 9.6% of these cases were treated in the mental health system (4033 cases). The baseline of the total cost of BPD in Catalonia was 45.6 million (sic), of which 15.8 million (sic) (34.7%) were direct costs related to mental health care. The cost distribution was 0.4% in primary care; 4% in outpatient mental health care; 4.7% in hospitalisation; 0.7% in emergency care; and 24.9% in pharmacotherapy. Additionally, the cost of drug addiction treatment for persons with BPD was 11.2%; costs associated with sheltered employment were 23.9% and those of crime and justice were 9.7%. Indirect costs - including temporary sick leave and premature death (suicide) - represented 20.5% of total costs. The average annual cost per patient was 11,308 (sic).
   Conclusions: An under-reporting of BPD was identified by the experts in all health databases and official registries. Most of the BPD costs were not related to mental health care. Amongst the direct cost categories, pharmacotherapy had the largest proportion despite the lack of specificity for BPD. This distribution of costs reinforces the idea of BPD complexity related to an inadequate and inefficient use of health resources. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Background Studies of the effect of macroeconomic fluctuations on mortality in different socioeconomic groups are scarce and have yielded mixed findings. We analyse mortality trends in Spain before and during the Great Recession in different socioeconomic groups, quantifying the change within each group.
   Methods We did a nationwide prospective study, in which we took data from the 2001 Census. All people living in Spain on Nov 1, 2001, were followed up until Dec 31, 2011. We included 35 951 354 people alive in 2001 who were aged between 10 and 74 years in each one of the four calendar years before the economic crisis (from 2004 to 2007) and in each one of the first four calendar years of the crisis (from 2008 to 2011), and analysed all-cause and cause-specific mortality in those people. We classified individuals by socioeconomic status (low, medium, or high) using two indicators of household wealth: household floor space (<72 m(2), 72-104 m(2), and >104 m(2)) and number of cars owned by the residents of the household (none, one, and two or more). We used Poisson regression to calculate the annual percentage reduction (APR) in mortality rates during 2004-07 (pre-crisis) and 2008-11 (crisis) in each socioeconomic group, as well as the effect size, measured by the APR difference between the pre-crisis and crisis period.
   Findings The annual decline in all-cause mortality in the three socioeconomic groups was 1.7% (95% CI 1.2 to 2.1) for the low group, 1.7% (1.3 to 2.1) for the medium group, and 2.0% (1.4 to 2.5) for the high group in 2004-07, and 3.0% (2.5 to 3.5) for the low group, 2.8% (2.5 to 3.2) for the medium group, and 2.1% (1.6 to 2.7) for the high group in 2008-11 when individuals were classified by household floor space. The annual decline in all-cause mortality when people were classified by number of cars owned by the household was 0.3% (-0.1 to 0.8) for the low group, 1.6% (1.2 to 2.0) for the medium group, and 2.2% (1.6 to 2.8) for the high group in 2004-07, and 2.3% (1.8 to 2.8) for the low group, 2.4% (2.0 to 2.7) for the medium group and 2.5% (1.9 to 3.0) for the high group in 2008-11. The low socioeconomic group showed the largest effect size for both wealth indicators.
   Interpretation In Spain, probably due to the decrease in exposure to risk factors, all-cause mortality decreased more during the economic crisis than before the economic crisis, especially in low socioeconomic groups.

AB Cyberbullying is a phenomenon with important adverse consequences on victims. The emotional impact of this phenomenon has been well established. However, there is to date no instrument with good psychometric properties tested to assess such impact. The objective of this study was developing and testing the psychometric properties of an instrument to assess the emotional impact of cyberbullying: the Cybervictimization Emotional Impact Scale, CVEIS. The sample included 1,016 Compulsory Secondary Education students (52.9 percent female) aged between 12 and 18 (M=13.86, DT=1.33) from three schools in southern Spain. The study used Confirmatory Factor Analyses to test the structure of the questionnaire and robustness of the scale. Internal consistency was also tested. The results supported the suitability of a three-factor model: active, depressed, and annoyed. This model showed an optimal adjustment, which was better than its competing models. It also demonstrated strong invariance among cybervictims and non-cybervictims and also among gender. The internal consistency of each factor, and the total scale, was also appropriate. The article concludes by discussing research and practical implications of the scale.

AB This is a cross-sectional study of participants from a population census living in the province of Granada (Spain). A total of 1176 persons were contacted, 367 (31%) refused and 54 (6.7%) needed substitution. A final sample of 809 participants (response rate, 69.3%) were screened for mental disorder (MD) using the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview, a comprehensive interview validated to generate diagnoses compatible with ICD-10/DSM-4 criteria. Current (1-month) prevalence for any MD was 11.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.7%-13.4%; affective 8.2%, anxiety 9.6%, psychotic 2.1%, addiction 1.8%, personality disorder 3.6%). Lifetime MD prevalence was 24.6% (95% CI, 21.6-27.6; affective 14.9%, anxiety 15.5%, psychotic 3.4%, addiction 4.4%, personality disorder 3.6%). Female sex was associated with MD, but this appeared partially due to higher levels of neuroticism among women. MD also correlated significantly with cannabis use, family history of MD, higher social adversity, higher suicide risk, poorer physical health, poorer cognitive performance, and personality problems.

AB The aim of this study was to develop an exploratory approach to characterizing the pattern of recreational abuse of alcohol and other drugs abuse at Christmas work dinners. An adaptation of the rapid assessment methodology RARE was carried out through the combination of quantitative (rapid assessment surveys, n=444) and qualitative (observations and semistructured interviews, n=8) techniques. The fieldwork was carried out at 13 restaurants in Valencia and Alicante (Spain) in December 2007. In general we observed a marked increase in the use of alcohol and other substances compared to the rest of the year, though restaurant staff perceived a decrease in alcohol abuse attributable to new road traffic legislation. Cocaine is perceived as the illicit substance most widely used at such events. Younger coworkers initiate older ones in the use of illicit drugs, and the the latter may use this behaviour as a means of feeling younger and more uninhibited. Christmas work dinners propitiate a recreational substance-use pattern that requires adapted preventive and restrictive interventions, such as the introduction of suitable transport initiatives and the restriction of alcohol serving hours.

AB Introduction
   In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the demand for prehospital emergency care in different countries.
   Objective
   The aim of the present study was to identify the variables associated with psychiatric calls to the Prehospital Emergency Care Services (PECS) in the province of Malaga.
   Method
   An observational retrospective study based on calls made to the PECS and registered in the computerized database of the Coordination Emergency Centre during one year (N = 163 331). Independent variables included 1. sociodemographic variables: sex and age; and 2. variables related with the characteristics of each call: time of day, type of day, time of year, caller identification, number of resources needed, number of patients attended and type of solution. The x(2) test was used to compare of the variables. A multivariant logistic regression analysis was also carried out.
   Results
   Psychiatric calls accounted for 7% of the total calls and were associated with: younger age, female gender, calls made in the evenings and afternoons, a lower number of patients attended, the call being performed by other individual calling on the patient's behalf, and no ambulance transportation.
   Discussion and conclusion
   The calls concerned with mental health problems have specific characteristics which need to be taken into account in order to provide a better care for psychiatric patients.

AB The main goals of this study were to determine the prevalence rate of suicidal ideation among callers to a Spanish telephone general crisis helpline (Telefono de la Esperanza) and to identify gender-based characteristics and risk factors related to suicidal ideation. A sample of 10,765 (6,868 men and 3,897 women) callers to this telephone helpline was assessed. ATENSIS, an assessment tool designed to collect information related to suicidal ideation among callers to telephone helplines, was used. Comparisons between men and women with suicidal ideation were carried out in all variables studied: sociodemographics, telephone call timing, risk factors, and suicidality. Of the total sample, 1.87% (n = 201) presented suicidal ideation, with a higher prevalence in women (2.80%) than in men (1.34%). Moreover, significant gender-based differences among callers with suicidal ideations were observed in some variables: women were older than men and showed a greater prevalence of chronic disease with pain; men showed a greater prevalence of depression, alcohol/drug abuse, helplessness, and lack of hope for the future. This study showed that telephone helplines can be used to identify suicidal ideation among callers. Moreover, gender-based differential characteristics among suicide ideators have been found. The implications for further research are discussed.

AB Introduction
   Bipolar disorder (BD) is a heterogeneous disorder needing personalized and shared decisions. We aimed to empirically develop a cluster-based classification that allocates patients according to their severity for helping clinicians in these processes.
   Methods
   Naturalistic, cross-sectional, multicenter study. We included 224 subjects with BD (DSM-IV-TR) under outpatient treatment from 4 sites in Spain. We obtained information on sociodemography, clinical course, psychopathology, cognition, functioning, vital signs, anthropometry and lab analysis. Statistical analysis: k-means clustering, comparisons of between group variables, and expert criteria.
   Results and discussion
   We obtained 12 profilers from 5 life domains that classified patients in five clusters. The profilers were: Number of hospitalizations and of suicide attempts, comorbid personality disorder, body mass index, metabolic syndrome, the number of comorbid physical illnesses, cognitive functioning, being permanently disabled due to BD, global and leisure time functioning, and patients' perception of their functioning and mental health. We obtained preliminary evidence on the construct validity of the classification: (1) all the profilers behaved correctly, significantly increasing in severity as the severity of the clusters increased, and (2) more severe clusters needed more complex pharmacological treatment.
   Conclusions
   We propose a new, easy-to-use, cluster-based severity classification for BD that may help clinicians in the processes of personalized medicine and shared decision-making.

AB This paper studies the 2004 Spanish fictional novel by Andres Barba, Ahora tocad musica de baile, one of the first cultural texts dealing entirely with Alzheimer's disease to appear in Spain. It argues that the significance of Barba's fictional novel rests on two important issues: the ethics of representation of violence against vulnerable subjects and the ethics of care. The paper analyses how these two issues allow Barba to create a story in which the verbal and physical abuse to which the person living with Alzheimer's disease is subjected places the reader, on the one hand, as voyeur/witness of the abuse; and, on the other, as interpreter, and ultimately judge, of the fine line that separates euthanasia, assisted suicide and murder. The open ending of the novel defers all ethical and moral judgement to the reader. It examines how the novel offers a monolithic perspective about Alzheimer's disease, in which care is presented as a burden. In fact, this study shows that the novel's multi-layered structure and polyphonic nature places the emphasis on stigmas, stereotypes and negative metaphors around Alzheimer's disease, as found in contemporary social discourses.

AB Backgrounds: With the intention of establishing economic inequities, the article analyzes the variations of the Unnecessarily Premature and Sanitarily Avoidable Mortality (MIPSE) of each of the 81 cantons of Costa Rica during 2000-2005. It is important to identify those inequities, to establish policies and strategies trying to mitigate them.
   Method: It applies the MIPSE classification proposed by members of the Information and Studies Service, of the Catalunya's Sanitary Resources Headquarter, Spain. By an Indicator of Socioeconomic Development (IDSE) of a University of Costa Rica economist's team, it organised each canton in groups of quintiles (I for the richest, V. for the poorest), previous people standardization.
   Results: We found as a major causes of mortality MIPSE in the country: Heart Isquemic Disease (19,55% MIPSE causes), Traffic Accidents with Motor Vehicles (11,60%), Brain Vascular Disease (6,95%), Perinatal (6,92%) and Suicide (5,14%).
   Conclusion: The VIH infection - AIDS mortality, the Best Cancer in Women, Uterus Cancer, Skin Cancer and Hepatic Disease Secondary to Alcohol Consumption, affects more the cantons with better financial conditions and the Prostate Benign Hyperplasia mortality, Mothers mortality related with Pregnancy, Childbirth or Puerperal Stage and the Abdominal Hernia mortality, affects more to those with worst economic level. Two MIPSE groups were identified with similar inequality: Leukaemia and Congenital Cardiovascular Disease.

AB There is a paucity of data about the epidemiology of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) and, particularly, with regard to temporal trends and sociodemographic factors. This study included 7,195 episodes of AWS in a defined community (Galicia, Spain) over a 11-year period. We looked for geographical correlations between AWS rate and sociodemographic factors (education and socioeconomic levels and rates of occupational activity and unemployment) within respective districts. We also investigated the inter- and intra-annual time trends for AWS. The median age of the participants was 49 years (interquartile range, 41-60 years), and 85% were men. The annual frequency of AWS episodes remained stable during the study period, with a consistent peak in episodes during the summer months and lowest frequency of episodes in winter months (P < .001). The age- and sex-adjusted geographical distribution of the AWS rate was uneven; districts with high rate tended to cluster. The mean education level was negatively correlated with AWS rate within a given district after adjusting for socioeconomic level, occupational activity rate, and unemployment rate (P < .001). In conclusion, we identified characteristic temporospatial patterns of AWS rate in this defined community. The rate of AWS tended to be higher in the summer months and lower in the winter months. The rate of AWS was higher in districts with low education levels. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Novel Use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Predict Suicidal
   Ideation and Psychiatric Symptoms in a Text-Based Mental Health

AB Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning were used to predict suicidal ideation and heightened psychiatric symptoms among adults recently discharged from psychiatric inpatient or emergency room settings in Madrid, Spain. Participants responded to structured mental and physical health instruments at multiple follow-up points. Outcome variables of interest were suicidal ideation and psychiatric symptoms (GHQ-12). Predictor variables included structured items (e.g., relating to sleep and well-being) and responses to one unstructured question, "how do you feel today?" We compared NLP-based models using the unstructured question with logistic regression prediction models using structured data. The PPV, sensitivity, and specificity for NLP-based models of suicidal ideation were 0.61, 0.56, and 0.57, respectively, compared to 0.73, 0.76, and 0.62 of structured databased models. The PPV, sensitivity, and specificity for NLP-based models of heightened psychiatric symptoms (GHQ-12 >= 4) were 0.56, 0.59, and 0.60, respectively, compared to 0.79, 0.79, and 0.85 in structured models. NLP-based models were able to generate relatively high predictive values based solely on responses to a simple general mood question. These models have promise for rapidly identifying persons at risk of suicide or psychological distress and could provide a low-cost screening alternative in settings where lengthy structured item surveys are not feasible.

TI Unusually strong association between education and mortality in young

AB Background: To examine the association between education and mortality for various causes of death in young adults in a community with a high rate of injection-drug users. Methods: Linked mortality study based on mortality records for 1996 and 1997 and on 1996 population census data from the Region of Madrid (Spain). The association between educational level and mortality was estimated by the mortality rate ratio. Results: After adjustment for age and other socioeconomic variables the mortality rate in men and women aged 25-44 years with no education was, respectively, 4.7 and 3.7 times higher than in men and women with the highest educational level. The causes of death with the strongest association were chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, AIDS and diseases of the heart in both sexes and suicide in men. For these causes of death the mortality rate ratio between persons with the lowest and highest educational level ranged from 6.8 to 21.8 in men and from 4.1 to 16.9 in women. Conclusions: These causes of death are the leading specific causes of death in persons aged 25-44 years. Given that probably a substantial part of deaths from diseases of the heart in this age category are drug-related, the common denominator of the excess mortality related poor education seems to be drug injection.

AB ObjectivesTo compare mortality by cancer sites and by other specific causes of death, and the prevalence of risk behaviors in farmers and non-farmers in Spain.MethodsMortality by cause of death was calculated based on a longitudinal study with 10-years follow-up of 9.5million men and 6 million women aged 20-64years who were employed in 2001. The prevalence of risk behaviors was calculated from the 2001 National Health Survey in the 6464 employed men and 5573 employed women aged 20-64. The study subjects were grouped as farmers and non-farmers. For each cause of death, we estimated the ratio of age-standardized mortality rates, and for each risk behavior we estimated the age-standardized prevalence ratio in farmers versus non-farmers.ResultsIn men, the mortality rate for most cancer sites did not differ significantly between farmers and non-farmers, except for cancers of the lip, oral cavity, stomach, larynx and skin epidermoid carcinomawhich was higher in farmersand cancers of the liver, pancreas and mesotheliomawhich was lower in farmers. In contrast, farmers had a higher rate of mortality from most other diseases and from external causes of death. In women, farmers showed lower mortality from lung cancer, breast cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease, and higher mortality from external causes. The prevalence of smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and obesity was higher in farmers than in non-farmers, except smoking and excessive alcohol consumption in women where prevalence was lower in farmers.ConclusionsFindings are different from those found in other studies. In men, greater exposure to the sun and the higher prevalence of risk behaviors in farmers could explain their excess mortality from some cancer sites and the other causes of death. However, other factors may be behind this excess risk of mortality from these causes, given that farmers did not show higher mortality from some cancers related to smoking. In women, no differences were observed in mortality rate for majority of causes of death between farmers and non-farmers.

AB Objectives Comorbidity is a common feature of mental disorders. However, needs assessment surveys focus largely on individual disorders rather than on comorbidity even though the latter is more important for predicting suicidal thoughts and behaviors. In the current report, we take a step beyond this conventional approach by presenting data on the prevalence and correlates (sociodemographic factors, college-related factors, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors) of the main multivariate profiles of common comorbid Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV disorders among students participating in the first phase of the World Health Organization World Mental Health International College Student initiative. Method A web-based mental health survey was administered to first year students in 19 colleges across eight countries (Australia, Belgium, Germany, Mexico, Northern Ireland, South Africa, Spain, United States; 45.5% pooled response rate) to screen for seven common DSM-IV mental disorders: major depression, mania/hypomania, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, alcohol use disorder, and drug use disorder. We focus on the 14,348 respondents who provided complete data; 38.4% screened positive for at least one 12-month disorder. Results Multivariate disorder profiles were detected using latent class analysis (LCA). The least common class (C1; 1.9% of students) was made up of students with high comorbidity (four or more disorders, the majority including mania/hypomania). The remaining 12-month cases had profiles of internalizing-externalizing comorbidity (C2; 5.8%), internalizing comorbidity (C3; 14.6%), and pure disorders (C4; 16.1%). The 1.9% of students in C1 had much higher prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors than other students. Specifically, 15.4% of students in C1 made a suicide attempt in the 12 months before the survey compared with 1.3-2.6% of students with disorders in C2-4, 0.2% of students with lifetime disorders but no 12-month disorders (C5), and 0.1% of students with no lifetime disorders (C6). Conclusions In line with prior research, comorbid mental disorders were common; however, sociodemographic correlates of LCA profiles were modest. The high level of comorbidity underscores the need to develop and test transdiagnostic approaches for treatment in college students.

AB Opium is a substance extracted from Papaver somniferum L that is chronically abused specially in the traditional production regions. Reports on opium poisoning has largely disappeared from the occidental literature on drug problems but recent scientific articles show cases of death related to opium in industrialized countries. This fact led us to consider the interest of knowing the state of the art of acute opium intoxication in modern times. This work shows a compilation of these uncommon cases occurred in different settings and circumstances. Data were obtained by a computer assisted search of the literature using the key words "opium poisoning", "poppy", "poppy seeds", and "papaver somniferum" in PubMed, accompanied by a hand search of the reference lists of all articles for any relevant studies not included in the database. In addition, Google Scholar, government reports, and cases adequately documented on websites were reviewed.
   Type 1 cases, Accidental opium intoxications when it is used as a recreational drug: Reported cases came mainly from industrialized countries. They were mostly male with a range age of 17-64 years. Many had antecedents of alcoholism or drug abuse and opium tea was used as a substitute of heroin. Rachacha has caused poisonings in France and has been detected in a stash in Spain. Toxicological analysis was documented in forensic cases. The danger of this renewed interest in opium is exemplified in that many of the poisoning cases resulted in fatalities. Type 2 cases, Accidental opium intoxications in children or adults when it used as folk remedy: Pediatric intoxication after the use of opium as folk remedy are mainly published in traditional opium-producing areas with a long history of use or ethnic communities in England or USA. Addiction to opium was common among relatives. Type 3 cases, Opium intoxications with poppy seeds consumed as food: Due to excessive consumption of opium seeds as food, sporadic cases of mild toxicity had been reported and morphine contents were documented. Type 4 cases: Accidental opium intoxications when using the abdominal or pelvic cavity for concealing the drug: Accidental opium body packer intoxications are seen in patients who traveled from illegal opium areas of production. Type 5 cases: Suicides by opium: Opium was a prevalent agent among cases of suicides in Iran but data are scarce. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Data show that 92.5% of prison inmates report drug or alcohol use. In spite of this, only 2% of dual diagnosis research has been carried out in the prison context. Therefore, the aim of this descriptive cross-sectional study was to analyze the profiles of dual diagnosis in a Spanish prison and test the feasibility of two assessment instruments.
   Method: The sample was made up of 152 drug-addicts imprisoned in the Villabona Penitentiary Center (Asturias, Spain) who volunteered to be interviewed. The sixth version of the Addiction Severity Index and the International Neuropsychiatric Interview -MINI- were used for the assessment of inmates' psychopathological status and drug problems.
   Results: The results show that, in general, the offender's profile is: male, 34 years old, unmarried, with children and with an average time spent in prison of approximately five years. Only 4.5% of respondents did not use drugs at the time of the study. In the remainder, the most widely used substances are cocaine (37.6%), heroin (29.9%) and alcohol (10.8%), with 52.7% reporting having used drugs in the last month. With regard to psychopathological state, only 12.9% have no associated disorders, and the most prevalent symptoms correspond to antisocial personality disorder (65.6%), risk of suicide (45.2%), depression (35.9%) and anxiety (25.5%).
   Conclusion: The instruments proposed (ASI-6 and MINI) are feasible tools for detecting addiction severity and associated psychopathology in this context.

AB The relationship between weather conditions and psychiatric disorders has been a continuous subject of speculation due to contradictory findings. This study attempts to further clarify this relationship by focussing on specific conditions such as panic attacks and non-panic anxiety in relation to specific meteorological variables. All psychiatric emergencies attended at a general hospital in Barcelona (Spain) during 2002 with anxiety as main complaint were classified as panic or non-panic anxiety according to strict independent and retrospective criteria. Both groups were assessed and compared with meteorological data (wind speed and direction, daily rainfall, temperature, humidity and solar radiation). Seasons and weekend days were also included as independent variables. Non-parametric statistics were used throughout since most variables do not follow a normal distribution. Logistic regression models were applied to predict days with and without the clinical condition. Episodes of panic were three times more common with the poniente wind (hot wind), twice less often with rainfall, and one and a half times more common in autumn than in other seasons. These three trends (hot wind, rainfall and autumn) were accumulative for panic episodes in a logistic regression formula. Significant reduction of episodes on weekends was found only for non-panic episodes. Panic attacks, unlike other anxiety episodes, in a psychiatric emergency department in Barcelona seem to show significant meteorotropism. Assessing specific disorders instead of overall emergencies or other variables of a more general quality could shed new light on the relationship between weather conditions and behaviour.

AB BackgroundThe aim of this study is to analyse the health status, the use of public healthcare services and the consumption of prescription drugs in the population of Catalonia, taking into consideration the socioeconomic level of individuals and paying special attention to vulnerable groups.MethodsCross-sectional study of the entire population resident in Catalonia in 2015 (7.5million people) using administrative records. Twenty indicators are analysed related to health, the use of healthcare services and consumption of prescription drugs. Rates, frequencies and averages are obtained for the different variables stratified by age groups (under 15 years, 15-64 years and 65 years or older), gender and socioeconomic status (calculated on the basis of pharmacy copayment levels and Social Security benefits received).ResultsA socioeconomic gradient was observed in all the indicators analysed, in both sexes and in all age groups. Morbidity, use of mental healthcare centres, hospitalisation rates and probability of drug consumption among children is 3-7 times higher for those with low socioeconomic level respect to those with a higher one. In children and adults, the steepest gradient was found in the use of mental health services. Moreover, there are gender inequalities.ConclusionThere are significant socioeconomic inequalities in health status and in the use of healthcare services in the population of Catalonia. To respond to this situation, new policies on health and other areas, such as education and employment, are required, especially those that have an impact on early years.

AB Background: Considering the extensive debate that is currently taking place in Spain regarding euthanasia, it is important to examine the attitude of professionals who perform most of their duties at the bedside of these patients and their families. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to present an adaptation and validation of the Euthanasia Attitude Scale and to evaluate its psychometric properties among a sample of nursing students in Spain. Research design: A cross-sectional study design was conducted. Participants and research context: Non-probabilistic sampling was used to recruit 396 Spanish nursing students. Methods: A self-report questionnaire, including socio-demographic data and the Euthanasia Attitude Scale, were used for data collection. The psychometric properties of the Euthanasia Attitude Scale were assessed, including reliability and validity. Fit indices of the overall model were computed. Ethical considerations: This study was approved by the Hospital Ethical Committee. Students were informed of the aims and procedures and provided written informed consent prior to data collection. Results: The factorial solution comprised four domains and the scale demonstrated adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .878). For the exploratory factor analysis, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin index of sampling adequacy was .905 and the Bartlett's Test of Sphericity was 2972.79 (p < .001). The initial factorial solution revealed four factors with eigenvalues of 6.78 for the first factor, 1.90 for the second one, 1.29 for the third, and 1.10 for the fourth factor. Moreover, there was a significant relationship between religiosity and the domains of the Euthanasia Attitude Scale. Discussion: This study obtained a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of .88 which is in consonance with the findings reported by other studies whereby none of the items were removed and the initial structure based on four domains was conserved, with a factorial solution that explains 52.79% of the total variance. The displacement of some items of the domain may be explained by certain religious and/or cultural components as, in accordance with other studies, people with firm religious beliefs are more inclined to refuse euthanasia. Conclusion: According to the findings of this study, the Euthanasia Attitude Scale is a reliable and valid instrument to measure the attitudes toward euthanasia in a sample of Spanish nursing students. This Spanish adaptation will be valuable in future studies examining the attitude and implication of nurses, understanding that nurses are key figures in the euthanasia debate.

AB Background and objective. Digoxin poisoning is a frequent reason for seeking emergency care. This study aimed to assess mortality related to digoxin poisoning.
   Methods. Descriptive observational study of digoxin poisonings attended in the emergency departments of 4 hospitals in Catalonia from 2013 through 2015. We gathered data relevant to the poisonings and recorded immediate and 30-day mortality. Factors possibly related to mortality were explored.
   Results. A total of 171 digoxin poisonings were attended. Seven (4.1%) were acute and 164 (95.9%) were chronic. The immediate and 30-day mortality rates were 6.4% and 13.4%, respectively. Bivariate analysis did not identify factors related to immediate mortality. However, the variables more often associated with 30-day mortality in this analysis were acute poisoning (after which 13% died vs 2.7% of those with chronic poisoning, P=.05), suicide attempts (8.7% of whom died vs 0.7%, P=.048), more compromised renal function (21.7% vs 9.5%, P=.037), fewer neurologic symptoms (4.3% vs 17.8% with more symptoms, P=.005), higher mean digoxin concentrations (4.7 mg/dL in those who died vs 3.7 mg/dL, P=.027), and a lower Barthel index (mean [SD] 49.1 [33.4] in those who died vs 70.3 [28.5]; P=.006). Logistic regression analysis identified serum digoxin concentration to be independently associated with immediate mortality. A lower Barthel index was associated with 30-day mortality.
   Conclusions. Immediate mortality is related to a high digoxin concentration in serum, and 30-day mortality to a low Barthel index.

AB Introduction. Descriptive data about co-occurrence of alcohol and cocaine consumption is scarce, despite its important prevalence. Dual disordes shows high prevalence in clinical samples, and patients report worse evolution and need more health services. Objective. To compare psychopathology in patients in treatment with lifetime alcohol and cocaine (Alc + Coc) substance use disorder (SUD) with subjects with alcohol but not cocaine (Alc) lifetime SUD and cocaine but not alcohol (Coc) SUD. Method. The sample consisted of 837 outpatients from Madrid, Spain, under treatment in substance misuse or mental health units. Two analyses were made: we compared subjects in the Alc + Coc (n = 366) to the Alc group (n = 162), and then to the Coc group (n = 122). Socio-demographic variables were addressed by interview. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used to evaluate Axis I disorders and the Personality Disorder Questionnaire (PDQ) to evaluate Personality Disorders (PD). Results. Compared to Alc group, patients in the Alc + Coc group were younger, had different socio-demographic characteristics, had more proportion of cannabis and opioid SUD, had less proportion of major depressive disorder, obsessive and depressive PD, more proportion of antisocial PD and lower suicide risk. Compared to the Coc group, they had more cannabis SUD and lower opioid SUD, showed higher prevalence of bipolar disorder, general anxiety disorder, paranoid, histrionic and dependent PD. Discussion and conclusion. We present a cross-sectional study describing comorbidity of dual disordes on treatment-seeking concurrent alcohol and cocaine problematic users. This concurrence showed different dual disordes prevalence profile than single users in some specific mental disorders.

AB Prior to HAART availability, there was no evidence of a geographical variation in HIV disease progression among injecting drug users (IDU) from different European regions. Nowadays, factors of importance regarding HIV disease progression in the face of HAART availability, such as HAART access, adherence, and the organization of care for IDU may differ across Europe. Therefore we studied HIV disease progression in a European study of IDU with known dates of HIV-seroconversion. Results show that with ongoing HAART availability, the risk of HIV disease progression has continued to decrease. When accounting for pre-AIDS death (in AIDS analyses) and non-natural deaths (suicide, overdose, accidents and homicide, in analyses of death) which are common among IDU, the risk of AIDS and death has decreased by as much as 65% and 75%, respectively, in 2000/2001. Results show little geographic variation in progression to AIDS. All-cause mortality was higher in IDU from Glasgow than elsewhere, while in the Valencian region (Spain) IDU were at a significantly lower risk of non-natural deaths. The timing of HAART initiation by treatment-naive IDU likewise differed across Europe: IDU in Amsterdam, Innsbruck, and Edinburgh started at significantly lower CD4 counts than IDU in Paris, Geneva, Glasgow, and the Valencian region, but the subsequent short-term immune response was similar. In conclusion, the risk in progression to AIDS or natural death is similar across western Europe although IDU across Europe differ in other factors, such as the risk of non-natural death and the timing of HAART initiation.

AB The comorbidity of any substance use disorder and another mental disorder is defined as dual diagnosis. Dual diagnosis is very common and clinical and therapeutic consequences have been described. This cross-sectional study aimed to analyse health-related quality of life (HRQoL) according to clinical characteristics and psychiatric comorbidities in patients with substance dependence.
   A total of 1276 substance-dependent patients seeking treatment were recruited. HRQoL was evaluated by the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire. The SCID-I, SCID-II and Conners' adult ADHD diagnostic interview were used to evaluate dual diagnosis. A visual analogue scale was used to measure craving. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed, and correction for multiple tests was conducted.
   Substance-dependent patients had impaired quality of life, especially in the mental component. SF-36 physical and mental component scores were 47.7 +/- 10.9 and 36.1 +/- 14.1, respectively. Furthermore, 65% of the patients had dual diagnosis, 51% had an Axis I DSM-IV-TR mental disorder and 35% had some personality disorder. Impaired physical quality of life was independently associated with medical condition, age, being female, depressive disorder and anxiety disorder. Depression disorder, any personality disorder, active consumption last month, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorder, suicide attempt were independently associated with worse mental quality of life.
   These findings emphasize the significance of dual diagnosis in the impairment of HRQoL in substance-dependent patients, particularly with regard to mental component. In addicted patients with low scores on SF-36, psychiatric comorbidity should be evaluated and treated in an integrated approach.

SO PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES
LA English
DT Article
ID PRESCRIPTION; SYSTEM
AB Objective: This study aimed to determine factors associated with hospitalization and decisions to prescribe psychotropic medication for patients with borderline personality disorder seeking care at psychiatric emergency units. Methods: A total of 11,578 consecutive visits were reviewed over a four-year period at a psychiatric emergency service in a tertiary hospital in Spain. Some patients were repeat visitors. Data collected included sociodemographic, clinical, social, and therapeutic information and the Severity of Psychiatric Illness (SPI) score. Results: Borderline personality disorder was the diagnosis in 1,032 of the visits (9%) to the emergency department, which corresponded to 540 individuals. Of these visits, 11% required hospitalization. Multivariate statistical logistic regression analysis showed that the decision to hospitalize was associated with risk of suicide, danger to others, severity of symptoms, difficulty with self-care, and noncompliance with treatment. The decision to prescribe benzodiazepines was related to male sex, anxiety as the reason for seeking care, little difficulty with self-care, few medical or drug problems, and housing instability. Factors related to the prescription of antipsychotics were male sex, risk of endangering others, and psychosis as the reason for the visit. Factors associated with the prescription of antidepressants were depression as the reason for seeking help and little premorbid dysfunction. Conclusions: Patients with borderline personality disorder had greater clinical severity, but the percentage of hospitalizations was lower than for patients without the disorder. Although a psychiatric emergency service is not the ideal setting to initiate pharmacotherapy, in practice, psychiatrists often prescribe medications in this setting. The SPI was a good tool to assess the severity of illness of these patients.

AB Drug utilization studies have applied different methods to various data types to describe medication use, which hampers comparisons across populations. The aim of this study was to describe the time trends in antidepressant prescribing in the last decade and the variation in the prevalence, calculated in a uniform manner, in seven European electronic healthcare databases.
   Annual prevalence per 10,000 person-years (PYs) was calculated for 2001-2009 in databases from Spain, Germany, Denmark, the United Kingdom (UK), and the Netherlands. Prevalence data were stratified according to age, sex, antidepressant type (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors [SSRIs] or tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs]) and major indications.
   The age- and sex-standardized prevalence was lowest in the two Dutch (391 and 429 users per 10,000 PYs) and highest in the two UK (913 and 936 users per 10,000 PYs) populations in 2008. The prevalence in the Danish, German, and Spanish populations was 637, 618, and 644 users per 10,000 PY respectively. Antidepressants were prescribed most often in 20- to 60-year-olds in the two UK populations compared with the others. SSRIs were prescribed more often than TCAs in all except the German population. In the majority of countries we observed an increasing trend of antidepressant prescribing over time. Two different methods identifying recorded indications yielded different ranges of proportions of patients recorded with the specific indication (15-57 % and 39-69 % for depression respectively).
   Despite applying uniform methods, variations in the prevalence of antidepressant prescribing were obvious in the different populations. Database characteristics and clinical factors may both explain these variations.

TI Heat Waves and Cause-specific Mortality at all Ages
SO EPIDEMIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID HIGH AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; AIR-POLLUTION; STRESS; IMPACT; EXERCISE;
   CLIMATE; PATHWAY; COUNTS; HEALTH; COLD
AB Background: Mortality has been shown to increase with extremely hot ambient temperatures. Details on the specific cause of mortality can be useful for improving preventive policies. Infants are often identified as a population that is vulnerable to extreme heat conditions; however, information on heat and infant mortality is scarce, with no studies reporting on cause-specific mortality.
   Methods: The study includes all deaths in the Catalonia region of Spain during the warm seasons of 1983-2006 (503,389 deaths). We used the case-crossover design to evaluate the association between the occurrence of extremely hot days (days with maximum temperature above the 95th percentile) and mortality. Total mortality and infant mortality were stratified into 66 and 8 causes of death, respectively.
   Results: Three consecutive hot days increased total daily mortality by 19%. We calculated that 1.6% of all deaths were attributable to heat. About 40% of attributable deaths did not occur during heat-wave periods. The causes of death that were increased included cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, mental and nervous system disorders, infectious and digestive system diseases, diabetes, and some external causes such as suicide. In infants, the effect of heat was observed on the same day and was detected only for conditions originating in the perinatal period (relative risk = 1.53 [95% confidence interval = 1.16-2.02]). Within the perinatal causes, cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive system, and hemorrhagic and hematologic disorders were the causes of death with stronger effects.
   Conclusions: Heat contributes to an increase in mortality from several causes. In infants, the first week of life is the most critical window of vulnerability.

AB Background: This study aimed at assessing the changes in mental disorders in the French working population between 2006 and 2010, using Rationally representative prospective data and a structured diagnostic interview for major depressive episode (MDE) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and also at exploring the differential changes in mental disorders according to age, origin, occupation, public/private sector, self-employed/employee status and work contract.
   Methods: The data came from the prospective national representative Sante et ltineraire Professionnel (SIP) survey, including a sample of 5600 French workers interviewed in 2006 and 2010. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used to measure MDE and GAD. Analyses were performed using weighted generalized estimation equations, and were stratified by gender.
   Results: No changes in MDE and GAD were observed for both genders among the working population. No differential changes were observed, except one the prevalence of GAD increased among women working in the public sector while there was no change among women in the private sector.
   Limitations: Two data collections over a 4-year period may not capture the effects of the crisis on mental disorders properly.
   Conclusion: No changes in mental disorders between 2006 and 2010 were found but the increase in the prevalence of anxiety among women in the public sector may be of particular interest for prevention policies. High levels of social protection in France might contribute to explain these non-significant results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and Objectives: Dual diagnosis is associated with increased emergency department service use. During recent years, increased emphasis has been given to monitor the decision to hospitalise the most sever patients. Many rating scales have developed based on patient-related factors. To assess the level of severity of dual diagnosis patients measured by the Severity Psychiatric Illness (SPI) Scale and to evaluate it as a tool for predicting discharge in emergency psychiatric practice.
   Methods: Data on 1,227 consecutive admissions visited in a psychiatric emergency room of a general teaching hospital during a period of six months were collected. A routine computerised protocol was completed which included socio-demographic, clinical and social factors and the SPI scale.
   Results: 206 admissions (17%) had dual diagnosis disorder, 106 (9%) had substance abuse disorder (SUD), and 906 (74%) had non-substance abuse disorder (NSUD). Differences among groups were found in clinical characteristics, discharge decision, readmissions, previous psychiatric history, reason for referral, DSM-IV diagnosis and illicit drug use. Dual diagnosed patients had the highest scores of severity. Logistic regression analyses revealed the independent contribution of different SPI'items. The model showed a good fit and indicated excellent calibration in the sample studied, predicting 87.6% of discharge decisions.
   Conclusions: Dual diagnosed patients at the emergency psychiatric room presented the highest levels of severity both in clinical and social problems. While the SPI was a good tool for assessing severity of illness in our patients, only some dimensions predicted discharge decision.

AB Background: We wanted to examine how the acceptance of euthanasia among the general public in Western Europe has changed in the last decades, and we wanted to look for possible explanations. Methods: We analysed data from the European Values Surveys, held in 1981, 1990, and 1999-2000 in 12 West European countries. In each country, representative samples of the general public were interviewed using the same structured questionnaire in all countries. Euthanasia was explained in the questionnaires as 'terminating the life of the incurably sick'. Results: A total of 46 199 respondents participated in the surveys. A significant increase in acceptance of euthanasia could be observed in all countries except (West) Germany. While the average increase in euthanasia acceptance was 22%, the increase was particularly obvious in Belgium, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. Although changes in several characteristics of respondents, such as decrease in religious beliefs, rising belief in the right to self-determination, and (to a lesser extent) rise in levels of education, were associated with growing acceptance of euthanasia, they could only partly explain the increase of euthanasia acceptance over the years. Conclusions: An increase of euthanasia acceptance among the general public took place over the last two decades in almost all West European countries, possibly indicating a growing support for personal autonomy regarding medical end-of-life decisions. If this trend continues, it is likely to increase the public and political debate about the (legal) regulation of euthanasia under certain conditions of careful medical practice in several West European countries.

AB Background: We compared mortality by cause of death in HIV-infected adults in the era of combined antiretroviral therapy with mortality in the general population in the same age and sex groups.
   Methods: Mortality by cause of death was analyzed for the period 1999-2006 in the cohort of persons aged 20-59 years diagnosed with HIV infection and residing in Navarre (Spain). This was compared with mortality from the same causes in the general population of the same age and sex using standardized mortality ratios (SMR).
   Results: There were 210 deaths among 1145 persons diagnosed with HIV (29.5 per 1000 person-years). About 50% of these deaths were from AIDS. Persons diagnosed with HIV infection had exceeded all-cause mortality (SMR 14.0, 95% CI 12.2 to 16.1) and non-AIDS mortality (SMR 6.9, 5.7 to 8.5). The analysis showed excess mortality from hepatic disease (SMR 69.0, 48.1 to 78.6), drug overdose or addiction (SMR 46.0, 29.2 to 69.0), suicide (SMR 9.6, 3.8 to 19.7), cancer (SMR 3.2, 1.8 to 5.1) and cardiovascular disease (SMR 3.1, 1.3 to 6.1). Mortality in HIV-infected intravenous drug users did not change significantly between the periods 1999-2002 and 2003-2006, but it declined by 56% in non-injecting drug users (P = 0.007).
   Conclusions: Persons with HIV infection continue to have considerable excess mortality despite the availability of effective antiretroviral treatments. However, excess mortality in the HIV patients has declined since these treatments were introduced, especially in persons without a history of intravenous drug use.

AB AimsAcute drug overdose, especially with paracetamol, may cause acute liver failure leading to registration for transplantation (ALFT). Population statistics and between-country differences for ALFT related to overdose have been poorly described. The aim of the present study was to evaluate overdose ALFT in the multi-country Study of Acute Liver Transplantation (SALT).
   MethodsAll adult overdose-related ALFT, with or without suicidal intent, in France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK between 2005 and 2007 were identified from liver transplant registries and hospital records. These were compared with whole-country and per capita use of paracetamol.
   ResultsSix hundred cases of ALFT were identified in 52 of 57 eligible transplant centres, of which 114 involved overdose (72 intentional, 10 non-intentional, 32 uncertain). Overdose represented 20% of all-cause ALFT: Ireland 52%, UK 28%, France 18%, the Netherlands 8%, and Italy 1%. Overdose ALFT were mostly females (61%), mean age 33.610.9years. A total of 111 (97%) of the overdoses involved paracetamol. Event rates ranged from one ALFT for 20.7 tons of paracetamol in Ireland, to one for 1074 tons in Italy and one case in 60 million inhabitants over 3years in Italy to one case in 286000 inhabitants per year in Ireland. Per-country event rates for non-overdose ALFT exposed to paracetamol were between 2.5 and 4.0 per million treatment-years sold.
   ConclusionsParacetamol overdose was found to represent one-sixth of all-cause ALFT. There was a 50-fold difference in Europe in the rates of paracetamol overdose ALFT, and a 200-fold difference per million inhabitants.

AB AimDepression among older adults has serious implications, especially because suicide rates are higher in this group than in younger adults. Research has identified biological and social risk factors. However, studies addressing cultural and psychosocial factors associated with specific ethnic groups, such as Spanish Romani, are lacking. The objective of the present study was to establish the differential prevalence of depression among Romany and non-Romany people older than 55years of age. It also aimed to explore how cultural, sociodemographic, and psychosocial factors predispose individuals to depression.
   MethodsA total of 181 people were interviewed. The sample consisted of 95 self-adscribed Romany individuals and 86 non-Romany individuals over the age of 55; the latter group served as the control group. We performed bifactorial univariate anova, epidemiological analysis using Epi Info software, and analysis of correlations between Geriatric Depression Scale scores and the different factors analyzed.
   ResultsSignificant differences in Geriatric Depression Scale score related to ethnicity and sex were found. Probable depression or depression in Romany men was four times higher than in non-Romany men. In Romany women, the risk was more than twice as high as in non-Romany women. Among the factors analyzed, income level, activity at home, and perception of being valued by family members showed significant differences between the groups.
   ConclusionsIn short, we can state that Romany people develop symptoms of depression to a greater extent than non-Romany people, and although Romany women have a higher risk of depression, the differential effect of ethnicity is greater among Romany men. Income level, activity at home, and perception of being valued by family members are unambiguously related to ethnicity.

TI Evolution and study of a copycat effect in intimate partner homicides: A
   lesson from Spanish femicides
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MEDIA; VIOLENCE; SUICIDES; BEHAVIOR; IMPACT; WOMEN; RISK
AB Objectives
   This paper focuses on the issue of intimate partner violence and, specifically, on the distribution of femicides over time and the existence of copycat effects. This is the subject of an ongoing debate often triggered by the social alarm following multiple intimate partner homicides (IPHs) occurring in a short span of time. The aim of this research is to study the evolution of IPHs and provide a far-reaching answer by rigorously analyzing and searching for patterns in data on femicides.
   Methods
   The study analyzes an official dataset, provided by the system VioGen of the Secretarla de Estado de Seguridad (Spanish State Secretariat for Security), including all the femicides occurred in Spain in 2007-2017. A statistical methodology to identify temporal interdependencies in count time series is proposed and applied to the dataset. The same methodology can be applied to other contexts.
   Results
   There has been a decreasing trend in the number of femicides per year. No interdependencies among the temporal distribution of femicides are observed. Therefore, according to data, the existence of copycat effect in femicides cannot be claimed.
   Conclusions
   Around 2011 there was a clear change in the average number of femicides which has not picked up. Results allow for an informed answer to the debate on copycat effect in Spanish femicides. The planning of femicides prevention activities should not be a reaction to a perceived increase in their occurrence. As a copycat effect is not detected in the studied time period, there is no evidence supporting the need to censor media reports on femicides.

AB Over the past five decades, two successive waves of political reform have brought democracy to, first, Spain, Portugal and Greece, and, more recently, Central and Eastern European countries. We assessed whether democratization was associated with improvements in population health, as indicated by life expectancy and cause-specific mortality rates.
   Data on life expectancy at birth, age-standardized total and cause-specific mortality rates, levels of democracy and potential time-variant confounding variables were collected from harmonized international databanks. In two pooled cross-sectional time-series analyses with country-fixed effects, life expectancy and cause-specific mortality were regressed on measures of current and cumulative democracy, controlling for confounders. A first analysis covered the 1960-1990 period, a second covered the 1987-2008 period.
   In the 1960-1990 period, current democracy was more strongly associated with higher life expectancy than cumulative democracy. The positive effects of current democracy on total mortality were mediated mainly by lower mortality from heart disease, pneumonia, liver cirrhosis, and suicide.
   In the 1987-2008 period, however, current democracy was associated with lower, and cumulative democracy with higher life expectancy, particularly among men. The positive effects of cumulative democracy on total mortality were mediated mainly by lower mortality from circulatory diseases, cancer of the breast, and external causes. Current democracy was associated with higher mortality from motor vehicle accidents in both periods, and also with higher mortality from cancer and all external causes in the second.
   Our results suggest that in Europe during these two periods democratization has had mixed effects. That short-term changes in levels of democracy had positive effects in the first but not in the second period is probably due to the fact that democratization in Central and Eastern Europe was part of a complete system change which caused major societal disruptions.

AB Aim Early intervention psychiatric services for patients with psychosis aim to limit the most damaging outcomes and reduce the patient's risk of social drift, decreasing illness severity and thus containing healthcare costs. There is a scarcity of studies that focus on first-episode psychosis (FEP), and those few that have been published only looked at direct health costs, but not at indirect costs, which make up the bulk of the budget. Our study aims to explore the short-term (1-year follow-up) economic cost of a FEP Program, including both direct and indirect costs. Methods Data were collected retrospectively from the clinical records of 157 patients included in the Programa Atencion Fases Iniciales de Psicosis, from Marques de Valdecilla University Hospital, Santander. Our data collection sheet collated data from direct and indirect costs associated with the illness. Data were also extracted from the Cantabria Health Service Records. STATA 15.0 was used for statistical analysis. Results On average, the total costs during the first year were euro48 353.51 per patient, with direct healthcare costs being euro13 729.47 (28.39%), direct non-medical costs euro108.6 (0.22%), and indirect costs euro34 515.44 (71.39%). We found that hospitalization costs were higher in males (p = 0.081) and in cannabis users (p = 0.032). The number of relapses increased both, hospitalization and treatment costs (r = 0.40 p = 0.000; r = 0.24 p = 0.067, respectively). Conclusions Intensive Early Intervention in Psychosis Services may result in cost savings by decreasing hospitalization, premature mortality, disability, unemployment, and legal problems; however, the first year after diagnosis would represent the one with the highest costs.

DE Self-harm; Clinic; Epidemiology; Motivations; Clinical models; Therapy
AB Is Presented a study that is an epidemiological, clinical and hermeneutical approach to the phenomenon of adolescent self-harm. It is almost a viral phenomenon that has deserved a profuse investigation in other countries but scarce in Spain. Investigation's problem is the understanding of the real dimensions of a complex clinical manifestation, as it has been focused and analysed by the most outstanding authors, especially in the last twenty years. It begins with a detailed and specific description of Deliberate Non-Suicidal Self-injuries, discriminating them from other clinical pictures or corporal manifestations that have other expressive and ideological intentions. Next, the types and variants of Self-contingent Behaviors are exposed and we detail the epidemiology and the psychic meanings of them. We show the analysis of the motivations and psychological factors most frequently referred to in health and therapeutic centers, observing these from different theoretical perspectives from solvent hermeneutic models. The text progresses exposing the main comorbidities presented by adolescent self-harm, their juxtaposition with frequent clinical disorders in this vital period (abuse and sexual abuse reactions, traumatic experiences, suicide attempts, eating disorder, substance abuse, boundary disorder, attention deficiency hyperactivity disorder, stress...). They propose and balance the perspectives and clinical evaluations that have taken care of this phenomenon (with their respective projections and therapeuticprospects): emotional self-regulation, traumatolysis, identity search, mentalization, dysfunctional vital expression ... Finally, we present some lines of future development of possible value for research and the therapy of this practice' of concern among the clinical and nonclinical population of the young generations.
   The essential purpose is, therefore, to offer an up-to-date and complete status of the etiopathogenic, symptomatic and other contingent variables to its clinical presentation so that is useful as a first approximate guide to therapists who have to approach adolescents with this worrying manifestation of psychological distress.

AB Background and objectives: Psychotic symptoms (PS) can be ascertained in the general population suggesting the existence of a wide psychosis phenotype. We aim to investigate the prevalence and correlates of PS in the province of Granada (Spain) in the absence of previous data. Our objectives were to establish the prevalence of PS, i.e. delusions and hallucinations, and identifying correlates with PS in search of plausible risk factors.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study (GRANAD Sigma P study) including assessments of 809 individuals who were selected randomly from the Unified Database of the Andalusian Health System, a census covering about 98% of the entire regional population. PS were assessed by the MINI Neuropsychiatric International Interview Psychosis Subscale. A variety of potential risk factors for PS were also assessed including socio-demographics, cognitive function, psychiatric comorbidity and physical health issues.
   Results: The prevalence of any PS in the province of Granada was 10.3% (hallucinations were detected in 6.1% of the sample and delusions in 7.4%). PS was correlated with increased suicide risk, lower functionality, having suffered childhood abuse, cannabis use, lower working memory and higher impulsivity.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of PS in this Southern Spanish sample is similar to that found in other European populations. This may indicate that an extended subclinical psychotic phenotype can be detectable on general populations and that it associates to a variety of cognitive deficits, personality traits and environmental factors upon which we can direct preventative measures to prevent transition from subclinical non-cases to clinical cases states.

TI Outcomes and Costs of Poisoned Patients Admitted to an Adult Emergency
   Department of a Spanish Tertiary Hospital: Evaluation through a
   Toxicovigilance Program
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID TRENDS; REPETITION; MORTALITY; STAY
AB The Abstract
   Toxicovigilance is the active process of identifying and evaluating the toxic risks existing in a community, and evaluating the measures taken to reduce or eliminate them.
   Objective
   Through a validated toxicovigilance program (SAT-HULP) we examined the characteristics of acute poisoning cases (APC) attended in the Emergency Department (ED) of La Paz Hospital (Madrid, Spain) and assessed their economic impact on the health system.
   Material and Methods
   The active poisoning surveillance system performs a daily search for cases in the hospital's computerized case records. Found cases are entered into a database for recording of type of poisoning episode, reasons for exposure, causative agent, signs and symptoms and treatment. We carried out a cross-sectional epidemiological study with analytical projection, based on an impact study on cost per survivor. The data for the costs attributable to cases of APC observed at HULP (outpatients and inpatients) was obtained from the based on the information provided by the diagnosis-related groups (DRG) through the corresponding hospital discharge reports (available through SAT-HULP).
   Results
   During the first 30 month of SAT-HULP operation we found a total of 3,195 APC, a cumulative incidence rate of 1.75% of patients attended in the ED. The mean (SD) patient age was 40.9 (17.8) years and 51.2% were men. Drug abuse accounted for 47.5% of the cases. Suicide attempt was the second most frequent category (38.1%) and other causes accounted for 14.5% of APC. The total cost of hospital care for our hospital rose to (sic)1,825,263.24 (approximately (sic)730,105.30/year) resulting in a permanent occupation of 4 beds/year.
   Conclusions
   SAT-HULP constitutes a validated toxicovigilance tool, which continuously integrates available data in real-time and helps health services manage APC data flexibly, including the consumption of resources from the health system.

AB Background: Periods of financial crisis are associated with higher psychological stress among the population and greater use of mental health services. The objective is to analyse contextual factors associated with mental health among the Spanish population during the recession.
   Methodology: Cross-sectional, descriptive study of two periods: before the recession (2006) and after therecession (2011-2012). The study population comprised individuals aged 16+ years old, polled for the National Health Survey. There were 25,234 subjects (2006) and 20,754 subjects (2012). The dependent variable was psychic morbidity. Independent variables: 1) socio-demographic (age, socio-professional class, level of education, nationality, employment situation, marital status), 2) psycho-social (social support) and 3) financial (GDP per capita, risk of poverty, income per capita per household), public welfare services (health spending per capita), labour market (employment and unemployment rates, percentage of temporary workers). Multilevel logistic regression models with mixed effects were constructed to determine change in psychic morbidity according to the variables studied.
   Results: The macroeconomic variables associated with worse mental health for both males and females were lower health spending per capita and percentage of temporary workers. Among women, the risk of poor mental health increased 6% for each 100(sic) decrease in healthcare spending per capita. Among men, the risk of poor mental health decreased 8% for each 5-percentage point increase in temporary workers.
   Conclusions: Higher rates of precarious employment in a region have a negative effect on people's mental health; likewise lower health spending per capita. Policies during periods of recession should focus on support and improved conditions for vulnerable groups such as temporary workers. Healthcare cutbacks should be avoided in order to prevent increased prevalence of poor mental health.

AB Background Despite a clear impact on the Canadian economy, little is known about the subsequent health impacts of the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC) in this country. This study fills this gap in knowledge by conducting a repeated cross-sectional analysis of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS).
   Methods Data from 7 cycles (2007-2013) of the CCHS were combined to form a large data set representative of the Canadian working-age population (15-64 years) residing in 1 of 10 provinces. A logistic regression model was used to determine whether exposure to various periods of the GFC resulted in increased odds of reporting poor mental health. Exposure was categorised into 4 periods based on political and economic indicators, as follows: precrisis period (baseline), initial crisis period, stimulus period and austerity period. Other outcomes investigated included: anxiety disorders (AD), mood disorders (MD), poor physical health and health-related behaviours (heavy alcohol drinking (HAD) and decreased fruit/vegetable consumption (FVC)).
   Results A significant increased odds of reporting poor mental health was observed during the austerity period compared with the precrisis period (OR=1.26 (1.16 to 1.32)); findings remain significant when adjusted for sex, marital status and education. Exposure to the austerity period was also significantly associated with increased odds of reporting AD, MD, HAD and decreased odds of FVC. No significant associations were observed for the poor self-perceived physical health variable.
   Conclusions Statistically significant associations were observed between several negative health outcomes and the austerity period when compared with the precrisis period. Austerity has been linked to worsening health in other studies and represents an example of how the policy response can have greater detrimental impact on health than the financial crisis itself.

SO EPIDEMIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID NEW-ZEALAND; HEALTH INEQUALITIES; VALUE-JUDGMENTS
AB Background: Holistic depiction of time-trends in average mortality rates, and absolute and relative inequalities, is challenging.
   Methods: We outline a typology for situations with falling average mortality rates (m down arrow; e.g., cardiovascular disease), rates stable over time (m-; e.g., some cancers), and increasing average mortality rates (m up arrow; e.g., suicide in some contexts). If we consider inequality trends on both the absolute (a) and relative (r) scales, there are 13 possible combination of m, a, and r trends over time. They can be mapped to graphs with relative inequality (log relative index of inequality [RII]; r) on the y axis, log average mortality rate on the x axis (m), and absolute inequality (slope index of inequality; SII; a) as contour lines. We illustrate this by plotting adult mortality trends: (1) by household income from 1981 to 2011 for New Zealand, and (2) by education for European countries.
   Results: Types range from the "best" m down arrow a down arrow r down arrow (average, absolute, and relative inequalities all decreasing; southwest movement in graphs) to the "worst" m up arrow a up arrow r up arrow (northeast). Mortality typologies in New Zealand (all-cause, cardiovascular disease, nonlung cancer, and unintentional injury) were all m down arrow r up arrow (northwest), but variable with respect to absolute inequality. Most European typologies were m down arrow r up arrow types (northwest; e.g., Finland), but with notable exceptions of m-a up arrow r up arrow (north; e.g., Hungary) and "best" or southwest m down arrow a down arrow r down arrow for Spain (Barcelona) females.
   Conclusions: Our typology and corresponding graphs provide a convenient way to summarize and understand past trends in inequalities in mortality, and hold potential for projecting future trends and target setting.

AB Objective: Meta-analyze all published epidemiologic studies reporting pediatric mania or bipolar disorder to investigate whether pediatric bipolar disorder is becoming more prevalent and whether rates vary significantly by country.
   Data Sources: Searches of PubMed and PsycInfo were conducted through the spring of 2010 using the following search terms: child, pediatric, young, adolescent, epidemiology, prevalence, bipolar, mania, suicide, and psychiatric. We also manually reviewed references in recent reviews of epidemiology of bipolar disorder.
   Study Selection: All studies reporting rates for mania or hypomania in community epidemiologic samples with participants up to 21 years of age.
   Data Extraction: All articles were coded to extract relevant variables. Prevalence rates were calculated from reported number of cases with bipolar disorders, then logit transformed. Twelve studies were included, enrolling 16,222 youths between the ages of 7 and 21 years during a period from 1985 to 2007. Six samples were from the United States; 6 were from other countries (the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain, Mexico, Ireland, and New Zealand).
   Results:The overall rate of bipolar disorder was 1.8% (95% CI, 1.1%-3.0%). There was no significant difference in the mean rates between US and non-US studies, but the US studies had a wider range of rates. The highest estimates came from studies that used broad definitions and included bipolar disorder not otherwise specified. Year of enrollment was negatively correlated with prevalence (r=-0.04) and remained nonsignificant when controlling for study methodological differences.
   Conclusions: Mean rates of bipolar disorder were higher than commonly acknowledged and not significantly different in US compared to non-US samples, nor was there evidence of an increase in rates of bipolar disorder in the community over time. Differences in diagnostic criteria were a main driver of different rates across studies. J Clin Psychiatry 2011;72(9):1250-1256 (C) Copyright 2011 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB Objective: College entrance may be a strategically well-placed "point of capture" for detecting late adolescents with suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). However, a clear epidemiological picture of STB among incoming college students is lacking. We present the first cross-national data on prevalence as well as socio-demographic and college-related correlates for STB among first-year college students.
   Method: Web-based self-report surveys were obtained from 13,984 first-year students (response rate 45.5%) across 19 colleges in 8 countries (Australia, Belgium, Germany, Mexico, Northern Ireland, South Africa, Spain, and the United States).
   Results: Lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts was 32.7%, 17.5%, and 4.3%, respectively. The 12-month prevalence was 17.2%, 8.8%, and 1.0%, respectively. About three-fourths of STB cases had onset before the age of 16 years (Q3 = 15.8), with persistence figures in the range of 41% to 53%. About one-half (53.4%) of lifetime ideators transitioned to a suicide plan; 22.1% of lifetime planners transitioned to an attempt. Attempts among lifetime ideators without plan were less frequent (3.1%). Significant correlates of lifetime STB were cross-nationally consistent and generally modest in effect size (median adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.7). Nonheterosexual orientation (aOR range 3.3-7.9) and heterosexual orientation with some same-sex attraction (aOR range 1.9-2.3) were the strongest correlates of STB, and of transitioning from ideation to plans and/or attempts (aOR range 1.6-6.1).
   Conclusion: The distribution of STB in first-year students is widespread, and relatively independent of socio-demographic risk profile. Multivariate risk algorithms based on a high number of risk factors are indicated to efficiently link high-risk status with effective preventive interventions.

AB This study aimed to examine differences in all-cause mortality and main causes of death across different migrant and local-born populations living in six European countries. We used data from population and mortality registers from Denmark, England & Wales, France, Netherlands, Scotland, and Spain. We calculated age-standardized mortality rates for men and women aged 0-69 years. Country-specific data were pooled to assess weighted mortality rate ratios (MRRs) using Poisson regression. Analyses were stratified by age group, country of destination, and main cause of death. In six countries combined, all-cause mortality was lower for men and women from East Asia (MRRs 0.66; 95 % confidence interval 0.62-0.71 and 0.76; 0.69-0.82, respectively), and Other Latin America (0.44; 0.42-0.46 and 0.56; 0.54-0.59, respectively) than local-born populations. Mortality rates were similar for those from Turkey. All-cause mortality was higher in men and women from North Africa (1.09; 1.08-1.11 and 1.19; 1.17-1.22, respectively) and Eastern Europe (1.30; 1.27-1.33 and 1.05; 1.01-1.08, respectively), and women from Sub-Saharan Africa (1.34; 1.30-1.38). The pattern differed by age group and country of destination. Most migrants had higher mortality due to infectious diseases and homicide while cancer mortality and suicide were lower. CVD mortality differed by migrant population. To conclude, mortality patterns varied across migrant populations in European countries. Future research should focus both on migrant populations with favourable and less favourable mortality pattern, in order to understand this heterogeneity and to drive policy at the European level.

AB The current study analyzed how trait emotional intelligence (trait El) mediates the relationship between self-esteem and state anxiety and trait anxiety. The sample was composed of 153 undergraduate students from the University of Cadiz, Spain (71.9% women and 28.1% men). Students completed measures of self-esteem, state anxiety, trait anxiety, and trait E1. Mediation analyses were completed with three trait E1 dimensions (EA, emotional attention; EC, emotional clarity; and MR, mood repair) as mediating variables, self-esteem as the independent variable, and state anxiety and trait anxiety as the dependent ones. Our results confirmed that self-esteem scores explained and predicted both, state and trait anxiety values (13% for state and 21% for trait anxiety). This explanatory capacity is increased by 8% when accounting for all trait El dimensions. Considering state anxiety, the results of the direct effects showed that a decrease in their levels is predicted through the increases in the levels of both, self-esteem and MR. Regarding trait anxiety, the results of the direct effects showed that a decrease in their levels is predicted, in addition to an increment of self-esteem and MR values, by an increase of EC and a decrease of EA. Conversely, indirect effects revealed that higher levels of self-esteem were associated with worse scores in EA and worse MR, which in turn would enhance both state and trait anxiety levels. Moreover, regarding trait anxiety higher levels of self-esteem were associated with worse scores in EA and worse EC, therefore increasing trait anxiety levels. As shown, the negative association found between self-esteem and EA becomes a key element. The effect of self-esteem on EA and the influence that the latter had on EC and MR exerts an indirect mediated effect with the power to invert the influence that self-esteem wields on both types of anxiety. In this sense, the apparent protective role of self-esteem changed, turning into a risk factor that promotes higher anxiety values.

AB Objectives: Mortality rates generally decline during economic recessions in high-income countries, however gaps remain in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This study estimates the impacts of increases in unemployment rates on both all-cause and cause-specific mortality across U.S. metropolitan regions during the Great Recession.
   Methods: We estimate the effects of economic conditions during the recent and severe recessionary period on mortality, including differences by age and gender subgroups, using fixed effects regression models. We identify a plausibly causal effect by isolating the impacts of within-metropolitan area changes in unemployment rates and controlling for common temporal trends. We aggregated vital statistics, population, and unemployment data at the area-month-year-age-gender-race level, yielding 527,040 observations across 366 metropolitan areas, 2005-2010.
   Results: We estimate that a one percentage point increase in the metropolitan area unemployment rate was associated with a decrease in all-cause mortality of 3.95 deaths per 100,000 person years (95%Ci 6.80 to 1.10), or 0.5%. Estimated reductions in cardiovascular disease mortality contributed 60% of the overall effect and were more pronounced among women. Motor vehicle accident mortality declined with unemployment increases, especially for men and those under age 65, as did legal intervention and homicide mortality, particularly for men and adults ages 25-64. We find suggestive evidence that increases in metropolitan area unemployment increased accidental drug poisoning deaths for both men and women ages 25-64.
   Conclusions: Our finding that all-cause mortality decreased during the Great Recession is consistent with previous studies. Some categories of cause-specific mortality, notably cardiovascular disease, also follow this pattern, and are more pronounced for certain gender and age groups. Our study also suggests that the recent recession contributed to the growth in deaths from overdoses of prescription drugs in working-age adults in metropolitan areas. Additional research investigating the mechanisms underlying the health consequences of macroeconomic conditions is warranted. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Preventable mortality is a good indicator of possible problems to be investigated in the primary prevention chain, making it also a useful tool with which to evaluate health policies particularly public health policies. This study describes inequalities in preventable avoidable mortality in relation to socioeconomic status in small urban areas of thirty three Spanish cities, and analyses their evolution over the course of the periods 1996-2001 and 2002-2007.
   Methods: We analysed census tracts and all deaths occurring in the population residing in these cities from 1996 to 2007 were taken into account. The causes included in the study were lung cancer, cirrhosis, AIDS/HIV, motor vehicle traffic accidents injuries, suicide and homicide. The census tracts were classified into three groups, according their socioeconomic level. To analyse inequalities in mortality risks between the highest and lowest socioeconomic levels and over different periods, for each city and separating by sex, Poisson regression were used.
   Results: Preventable avoidable mortality made a significant contribution to general mortality (around 7.5%, higher among men), having decreased over time in men (12.7 in 1996-2001 and 10.9 in 2002-2007), though not so clearly among women (3.3% in 1996-2001 and 2.9% in 2002-2007). It has been observed in men that the risks of death are higher in areas of greater deprivation, and that these excesses have not modified over time. The result in women is different and differences in mortality risks by socioeconomic level could not be established in many cities.
   Conclusions: Preventable mortality decreased between the 1996-2001 and 2002-2007 periods, more markedly in men than in women. There were socioeconomic inequalities in mortality in most cities analysed, associating a higher risk of death with higher levels of deprivation. Inequalities have remained over the two periods analysed. This study makes it possible to identify those areas where excess preventable mortality was associated with more deprived zones. It is in these deprived zones where actions to reduce and monitor health inequalities should be put into place. Primary healthcare may play an important role in this process.

AB Background: Mental health problems and risk behaviours among young people are of great public health concern. Consequently, within the VII Framework Programme, the European Commission funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in eleven European countries, with Sweden as the coordinating centre, and was designed to identify an effective way to promote mental health and reduce suicidality and risk taking behaviours among adolescents.
   Objective: To describe the methodological and field procedures in the SEYLE RCT among adolescents, as well as to present the main characteristics of the recruited sample.
   Methods: Analyses were conducted to determine: 1) representativeness of study sites compared to respective national data; 2) response rate of schools and pupils, drop-out rates from baseline to 3 and 12 month follow-up, 3) comparability of samples among the four Intervention Arms; 4) properties of the standard scales employed: Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (Z-SAS), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), World Health Organization Well-Being Scale (WHO-5).
   Results: Participants at baseline comprised 12,395 adolescents (M/F: 5,529/6,799; mean age=14.9 +/- 0.9) from Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain. At the 3 and 12 months follow up, participation rates were 87.3% and 79.4%, respectively. Demographic characteristics of participating sites were found to be reasonably representative of their respective national population. Overall response rate of schools was 67.8%. All scales utilised in the study had good to very good internal reliability, as measured by Cronbach's alpha (BDI-II: 0.864; Z-SAS: 0.805; SDQ: 0.740; WHO-5: 0.799).
   Conclusions: SEYLE achieved its objective of recruiting a large representative sample of adolescents within participating European countries. Analysis of SEYLE data will shed light on the effectiveness of important interventions aimed at improving adolescent mental health and well-being, reducing risk-taking and self-destructive behaviour and preventing suicidality.

AB With the advent into the 20(th) century whole world has been facing the common dilemma of Terrorism. The suicide attacks on US twin towers 11 Sept. 2001, Train bombings in Madrid Spain 11 Mar. 2004, London bombings 7 Jul. 2005 and Mumbai attack 26 Nov. 2008 were some of the most disturbing, destructive and evil acts by terrorists in the last decade which has clearly shown their evil intent that they can go to any extent to accomplish their goals. Many terrorist organizations such as al Quaida, Harakat ul-Mujahidin, Hezbollah, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Toiba, etc. are carrying, Out training camps and terrorist operations which are accompanied with latest technology and high tech arsenal. To counter such terrorism our military is in need of advanced defense technology. One of the major issues of concern is Secure communication. It has to be made sure that communication between different military forces is secure so that critical information is not leaked to the adversary. Military forces need secure communication to shield their confidential data front terrorist forces. Leakage of concerned data can prove hazardous, thus preservation and security is of prime importance. There may be a need to perform computations that require data from many military forces. but in some cases the associated forces would not want to reveal their data to other forces. In such situations Secure Multi-party Computations find their application. In this paper, we propose a new highly scalable Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC) protocol and algorithm for Defense applications which call be used to perform computation oil encrypted data. Every party encrypts their data in accordance with a particular scheme. This encrypted data is distributed among some created virtual parties. These Virtual parties send their data to the TTP through all Anonymizer layer. TTP performs computation on encrypted data and announces the result. As the data sent was encrypted its actual value can't be known by TTP and with the use of Anonymizers we have covered the identity of true Source of data. Modifier tokens are generated along encryption of data which are distributed among virtual parties, then sent to TTP and finally used in the computation. Thus without revealing the data, right result can be computed and privacy of the parties is maintained. We have also given a probabilistic security analysis of hacking the protocol and shown how zero hacking security can be achieved.

AB Objectives: To collate data from multiple obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) treatment centers across seven countries and five continents, and to report findings in relation to OCD comorbidity, age of onset of OCD and comorbid disorders, and suicidality, in a large clinical and ethnically diverse sample, with the aim of investigating cultural variation and the utility of the psychiatric diagnostic classification of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.
   Methods: Researchers in the field of OCD were invited to contribute summary statistics on current and lifetime psychiatric comorbidity, age of onset of OCD and comorbid disorders and suicidality in their patients with OCD.
   Results: Data from 3711 adult patients with primary OCD came from Brazil (n = 955), India (n = 802), Italy (n = 750), South Africa (n = 565), Japan (n = 322), Australia (n = 219), and Spain (n = 98). The most common current comorbid disorders were major depressive disorder (28.4%; n = 1055), obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (24.5%, n = 478), generalized anxiety disorder (19.3%, n = 716), specific phobia (19.2%, n = 714) and social phobia (18.5%, n = 686). Major depression was also the most commonly co-occurring lifetime diagnosis, with a rate of 50.5% (n = 1874). OCD generally had an age of onset in late adolescence (mean = 17.9 years, SD = 1.9). Social phobia, specific phobia and body dysmorphic disorder also had an early age of onset. Co-occurring major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and psychotic disorders tended to have a later age of onset than OCD. Suicidal ideation within the last month was reported by 6.4% (n = 200) of patients with OCD and 9.0% (n = 314) reported a lifetime history of suicide attempt.
   Conclusions: In this large cross-continental study, comorbidity in OCD was common. The high rates of comorbid major depression and anxiety disorders emphasize the need for clinicians to assess and monitor for these disorders. Earlier ages of onset of OCD, specific phobia and social phobia may indicate some relatedness between these disorders, but this requires further study. Although there do not appear to be significant cultural variations in rates or patterns of comorbidity and suicidality, further research using similar recruitment strategies and controlling for demographic and clinical variables may help to determine whether any sociocultural factors protect against suicidal ideation or psychiatric comorbidity in patients with OCD.

AB Background: Patient-perceived health-related quality of life has become an important outcome in health care as an indicator of treatment effectiveness and recovery for patients with substance use disorder. As no study has assessed health-related quality of life among male patients with substance use disorder and co-existing severe mental illness, we compared health-related quality of life among patients with substance use disorder and the following severe mental illness diagnosis in Barcelona, Spain: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and examined the associations with clinically related variables. Additionally, we compared results for healthrelated quality of life in patients with substance use disorder and severe mental illness, with Spanish population norms.
   Methods: We assessed 107 substance use disorder male patients using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey comparing results across three groups with: comorbid schizophrenia (n = 37), comorbid bipolar disorder (n = 34), and comorbid major depressive disorder (n = 36). Multiple analyses of variance were performed to explore health-related quality of life by the type of co-existing SMI and linear regression analyses examined clinical correlates for the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey dimensions for each group.
   Results: There were differences in Physical Functioning, Vitality and the Physical Composite Scale among groups. Poorer Physical Functioning was observed for patients with comorbid schizophrenia (80.13 +/- 3.27) and major depressive disorder (81.97 +/- 3.11) compared with comorbid bipolar disorder patients (94.26 +/- 1.93). Patients with substance use disorder and schizophrenia presented lower scores in Vitality (41.6 +/- 2.80) than those with co-existing bipolar disorder (55.68 +/- 3.66) and major depressive disorder (53.63 +/- 2.92). Finally, results in the Physical Composite Scale showed lower scores for patients with comorbid schizophrenia (51.06 +/- 1.41) and major depressive disorder (51.99 +/- 1.87) than for those with bipolar disorder (60.40 +/- 2.17). Moreover, all groups had poorer health-related quality of life, especially Social Functioning, Role-Emotional and Mental Health, compared with population norms. Different clinical variables (e. g. medical disease comorbidity, severity of addiction, psychiatric symptomatology, suicide attempts, drug relapses) were related to different health-related quality of life dimensions depending on the co-existing severe mental illness.
   Conclusions: Among male patients with substance use disorder, co-existing severe mental illness may influence some health-related quality of life dimensions and clinically related variables. Such differences may require tailored therapeutic interventions.

AB Numerous studies showing statistically significant associations between environmental noise and adverse health effects already exist for short-term (over one day at most) and long-term (over a year or more) noise exposure, both for morbidity and (albeit to a lesser extent) mortality. Recently, several studies have shown this association to be independent from confounders, mainly those of air pollutants. However, what has not been addressed is the problem of misalignment (i.e. the exposure data locations and health outcomes have different spatial locations). Without any explicit control of such misalignment inference is seriously compromised.
   Our objective is to assess the long-term effects of traffic noise on mortality in the city of Barcelona (Spain) during 2004-2007. We take into account the control of confounding, for both air pollution and socioeconomic factors at a contextual level and, in particular, we explicitly address the problem of misalignment.
   We employed a case-control design with individual data. We used deaths resulting from myocardial infarction, hypertension, or Type II diabetes mellitus in Barcelona between 2004 and 2007 as cases for the study, while for controls we used deaths (likewise in Barcelona and over the same period of time) resulting from AIDS or external causes (e.g. accidental falls, accidental poisoning by psychotropic drugs, drugs of abuse, suicide and self-harm, or injuries resulting from motor vehicle accidents). The controls were matched with the cases by sex and age.
   We used the annual average equivalent A-weighted sound pressure levels for daytime (7-21 h), evening-time (21-23 h) and night-time (23-7 h), and controlled for the following confounders: i) air pollutants (NO2, PM10 and benzene), ii) material deprivation (at a census tract level) and iii) land use and other spatial variables. We explicitly controlled for heterogeneity (uneven distribution of both response and environmental exposures within an area), spatial dependency (of the observations of the response variables), temporal trends (long-term behaviour of the response variables) and spatial misalignment (between response and environmental exposure locations). We used a fully Bayesian method, through the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA). Specifically, we plugged the whole model for the exposure into the health model and obtained a linear predictor defined on the entire spatial domain. Separate analyses were carried out for men and for women.
   After adjusting for confounders, we found that traffic noise was associated with myocardial infarction mortality along with Type II diabetes mellitus in men (in both cases, odds ratios (OR) were around 1.02) and mortality from hypertension in women (ORs around 1.01). Nevertheless, only in the case of hypertension in women, does the association remain statistically significant for all age groups considered (all ages, >= 65 years and >= 75 years).

AB Objective: To study the characteristics of poisoning cases treated in a hospital emergency department according to patient's place of birth.
   Methods: In 2003 and 2004 for all poisoning cases we collected data on patients' country of origin, type and place of poisoning, treatment, and destination on discharge. Variables were compared according to national origin: Spanish vs other places of origin, specifically Eastern Europea (EE), Latin America (LA), or North Africa (NA).
   Results: Data on 1287 poisoning cases were available. Non-Spanish emergency poisoning patients were younger than Spanish patients (29.6 vs 35.8 years, P<.001). The percentages of men in each group were different as follows: NA, 74.5%; EE, 62.9%, Spanish, 55.3%, and Lk 47.9% (P=.023). More Spanish poisoning cases were related to attempted suicide (29.8% vs 20.7% in other groups) rather than use of recreational drugs (62.3% of Spaniards vs 72.1% of others) (P=.007). Non-Spanish patients were poisoned more often in public places (68.1% vs 53.2% of Spanish cases), while Spanish patients' poisonings occurred more often in the home (44.4% vs 28.3%) (P<.001). It was more common for Spanish patients to have been poisoned on previous occasions (50.7% vs 30.4% of others, P<.001) and to have a history of mental illness (58.3% vs 31.6% of others; P<.001). Spanish patients had more drug overdoses, of a single drug (24.2% vs 14.5% of others, P=.001) or of a drug in association with alcohol (8.7% vs 4.3% of others, P=.017). Patients from other countries were more often poisoned by alcohol overdose (34.1% vs 24.4% of Spaniards, P=.001) or by home cleaning products (5.1% vs 2.2% of Spaniards, P=.01). A psychiatric evaluation was made for 38.3% of the Spanish nationals and 22.8% of the foreign nationals (P<.001). The rates of gastrointestinal decontamination were also different (Spanish, 13.2% vs other, 6.9%; P=.008). Spanish patients had to be admitted more often (10.5% vs 5.1% of others, P=.004) and more often had prolonged stays in the emergency department (25.6% vs 16.4% of others, P=.008). The Spanish and LA patient profiles were similar.
   Conclusions: Poisonings of patients from countries other than Spain more often occurred in public places and were caused by alcohol or home cleaning products or recreational drugs. Poisoning patients born in other countries were less likely to have a history of prior poisoning or mental illness and were less often admitted, kept for prolonged periods in the emergency department, or evaluated by a psychiatrist.

DE Depression; adolescence; cultural analysis; explanatory models;
   health-seeking behaviours
AB Introduction
   In recent years, adolescent mental health has become a health policy priority in the majority of OCDE and European countries. According to the World Health Organization, in Europe some two million children and adolescents suffer from some type of mental disorder, especially depression, which affects 4% of the adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17, and 9% of 18-year-olds. As is also the case for behavioural and anxiety disorders, rates of adolescent depression are on the rise.
   Several studies associate depression in adolescence with either current or future consumption of psychoactive substances, a diagnosis of severe mental disorder in adulthood, and suicide. Some studies highlight the importance of social factors and lifestyles in the etiology and prognosis of these types of disorders; for example, various forms of social discrimination, abusive parents, and bullying. The incidence and prevalence of depression appear to be increasing among adolescents, as well as self-reported distress among young people and so-called "negative mood states".
   Despite the importance of depression, sadness, and so-called "negative mood states" among adolescents, there is a clear lack of qualitative studies analyzing these phenomena, and especially of studies that provide knowledge about the perceptions and cultural models of this age group with respect to their own sense of distress and lay strategies for coping with adversity, and the role of social capital as a buffer against it.
   Objective and methods
   The objective of this article is to describe the adolescents' explanatory models (EMs) or lay perceptions on depression, sadness, and related factors. With this purpose we performed an ethnographic study in a sample of 49 students (age 15-16) in three public secondary-schools of Barcelona and its metropolitan area using semi-structured interviews, cultural-domains interviews, and focus groups. We employed content analysis and semantic network analysis for qualitative data, and frequency analysis, cultural-consensus analysis, and multidimensional scaling for quantitative data.
   Results
   The results outline that adolescents use their own nosologies to define depressive mood states such as "rallado", "burchado", "chof", or "deprimido". These categories are dichotomically organized between passive items (i.e. to feel sadness or loneliness) and active items (i.e. "to be angry").
   The state of deprimido (being depressed) is related to feelings of physical weariness and apathy. It can be defined as "a culmination of situations that make you feel bad", including the sense of feeling misunderstood by peers and adults, feeling insecure when having to take decisions or with his/her physical appearance, alone or isolated or in a bad mood. A person that is depressed is someone who "isn't in the mood to even speak about anything", that finds him/herself bad because "things haven't turned out as they expected". This leads him/her "to blame him/herself for things", to have "very low self-esteem", to not "leave the house", to "become closed within himself", to "build a wall" or a "bubble", to think that "nothing is worth anything" and that "the whole world is against him/her". One can cope with that state for being a "bad time in a person's life", but it can also become "a burden that is much more" or "an eternity that never ends".
   When we asked our adolescents, "how can you tell that a person is sad or worried?", their answers were varied. One of the most common is to show an oscilation between the passive characteristics of discomfort and its active correlate, between isolation and an uneasy response, despite this behavior not being premeditated. A person that is rallada, deprimida or burchada can appear "isolated from society" and feel unaccepted, alone, insecure, apathetic; he/she might "stop talking or interacting with others", find him/herself feeling "tired of everything", downcast, depressive, as if he/she had experienced un bajon (suddenly feeling down); distracted, serious and without smiling, or anxious and nervous, and because of that hurting others although unintentionally. He/she can also sigh and weep, have difficulties to "express him/herself", appear to have "changed" for not behaving as he/she normally does, or have a lost gaze.
   The perception that adolescents have of a person exhibiting characteristics such as rallada, burchada, or deprimida is not isomorphic with the vision they hold of themselves when they suffered adversity or experienced discomfort in the past. For example, the category rallado is not used very much in these cases, perhaps in order to save a semantic stigmatizing load. They normally define expressions of discomfort in terms such as "a desire to forget about school, of people and of everything", "scream where no one can hear you", "break things or hit someone", self-inflict physical pain "to balance the pain from within with exterior pain", "make someone feel the same as I feel", "flee or run very far", or of locking oneself up in one's bedroom to "cry while listening to music". They also feel powerless before "the things that they can not confront", "inferior to others", worthless, guilty, with difficulties to concentrate and insomnia.
   The adolescents situate the causes of their afflictions in the universe of their interactions with family members, adults in general, and peers, within situations of pressure and overexertion in daily life. When we segmented dates by gender we observed that male adolescents prioritized the "school loads" before "relations with friends", while female adolescents a higher relevance to these followed by "affective relations".
   When we asked our informants, "In your opinion, what can be done to help a person your age that is in this state of sadness or discomfort?", the answers were very diverse, but coincided as a whole to empower sociability between peers. It is striking although congruent with available literature that they discard the possibility of accompanying or referring the affected person to a specific professional for help or even suggest him/her to speak to his/her parents, tutors or professors. As a matter of fact, adolescents constitute an age group characterized by their vague consideration of professional resources in their help-seeking processes.
   Discussion
   A fundamental reason for the avoidance of professional services by adolescents is the existence of an explanatory model that, contrary to expert discourses from the "psy" field, understands afflictions as products of the social world. If the causes of discomfort are a result of social interactions (conflicts between equals, states of solitude and isolation, lack of recognition or prestige, dissonances with the models of the body and person, problems in the development of their autonomy against the tutelage of adults, etc.), the restitution of wellbeing must structure itself on those same relations and on that same independence in regards to the adult world.
   Our data points to a need to establish dialogical strategies of intervention. Insofar as adolescents show explanatory models different to the expert and adult systems in general, it is easy for them to feel indifferent to the interventions that do not involve them as active agents. They want to be protagonists of their own stories. For this reason, the promotion of participation and the dialogue of information (expert and lay) are guidelines that, in our opinion, must be present in any intervention in this field. In these strategies we find the possibility of reconverting lay explanatory models and social capital in a fundamental axis of mental health programs for adolescents.
