TI Suicide rate trends in the Slovak Republic in 1993-2015

AB Background: Suicide is a significant public health issue worldwide, resulting in loss of lives, and burdening societies.
   Aims: To describe and analyze the time trends of suicide rates (SRs) in the Slovak Republic in 1993-2015 for targeted suicide prevention strategies.
   Methods: Data for this study were obtained from the mortality database of the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic. Crude and standardized annual SRs were calculated. Trends and relative risks of suicide according to age and sex were analyzed by joinpoint regression and negative binomial regression.
   Results: In total, there were 14,575 suicides in the Slovak Republic in the period 1993-2015 (85.3% were men). The overall average age-standardized SR for the study period was 11.45 per 100,000 person years. The rate increases with age, the highest is in men aged 75+ (42.74 per 100,000 person years). Risk of suicide is six times higher in men than in women and nine times higher in men than in women in the age group 25-34. The time trend of SRs is stable or decreasing from 1993 to 2007, but increasing after 2007, corresponding with increased unemployment rate in the country.
   Conclusion: The SR in the Slovak Republic is slightly below the average of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations. Highest SR is observed in men of working age and in retirement. Society might benefit from a strategy of education for improving the recognition of suicide risks.

AB Background and Aim: Suicide is a significant global public health issue, resulting in loss of lives, and burdening societies. The aim of the study was to assess the situation of suicides in the Slovak Republic, as this has not been published before. We have conducted a study of time trends of suicide rates in the country in the period of its existence 1993-2015 as well as cross-sectional analysis of socio-economic sucide-influencing factors on district level for the period 2011-2015.
   Methods: Data for this study were obtained from the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic, the national mortality database for the period 1993-2015. Socio-economic indicators on district level were extracted from DataCube database of the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic. We have calculated crude and standardised suicide rates by age, sex, year of death, methods of suicide on both national level (for the whole study period 1993-2015) as well as district level for 2011-2015 period. Suicide rates relative risk and trend were analyzed by using negative binomial and joinpoint regression models respectively. Univariate and multivariate linear regression was used to assess the relationship between the socioeconomic variables and suicide rates at district level.
   Results: In the period 1993-2015 were 14,575 suicides reported in the Slovak Republic (85.3% men). The overall time trend for total population is decreasing with time over the study period, from 14.61 in 1993 to 7.76 per 100,000 people in 2015. The overall average age-standardized SR for the study period was 11.45 per 100,000 person years, this is below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average. The rate increases with age, the highest is in men aged 75+ (42.74 per 100,000 people). Risk of suicide is six times higher in men than in women and nine times higher in men than in women in the age group 25-34. Highest suicide rate in the Slovak Republic in 2015 on district level is in Myjava district.
   Conclusion: The time trend of SRs is decreasing in the study period 1993-2015, however, at the same time we have observed increasing trend of proportion of deaths classified as caused by 'undetermined intent'. Correct cause of death certification and standardized mortality data collection is higly desirable for accurate monitoring and targeted intervention. Suicides are an important public health issue in need of focused prevention activities, with special attention on older people.
